1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:22,271
Well, these are certainly the cleanest
steps on Madison Avenue.

3
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:27,339
That's how Mr. Day wants them kept.

4
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,777
Good morning.
Good morning.

5
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,918
You're new here, aren't you?

6
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,053
Just this morning.
This is the way Mr. Day gets his milk.

7
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,666
Annie, be careful of this dish.
You can burn your hand.

8
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,343
And keep the cover on
till you're ready to serve them.

9
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:23,444
Mr. Day likes his muffins hot.
I'll do that.

10
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:09,871
Annie, is the table set for breakfast?
Yes ma'am.

11
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,742
Good morning, ma'am.

12
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:17,867
Good morning, Annie.
How are you getting along?

13
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:19,600
All right, ma'am, I hope.

14
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,374
Now don't be nervous just
because this is your first day.

15
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,902
Everything's going to be all right.

16
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,888
But I do hope nothing goes wrong.

17
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,422
Oh no, Annie.
The cream and sugar go down at this end.

18
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:34,917
I thought everyone could reach it from here.

19
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,563
Mr. Day sits here.
Excuse me.

20
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:40,960
I didn't know where to place
the napkins, ma'am.

21
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,834
You can tell by the rings.
The boys have their initials.

22
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:47,069
C for Clarence.
He sits here.

23
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,645
J for John,
here.

24
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:53,446
W for Whitney.
He sits over there next to his father.

25
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:58,702
And the one with a little dog on it is Harlan's,
of course. He's the baby.

26
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:03,503
This narrow plain one is mine.
And this is Mr. Day's.

27
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:07,691
It's just like mine except that it got bent...
one morning.

28
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,100
And that reminds me, Annie.

29
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,000
Always have Mr. Day's coffee piping hot.
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,000
And whenever Mr. Day speaks to you,
just say Yes sir.

31
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:17,800
Don't be nervous. You'll get used to him.
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,995
Oh, that beautiful rubber plant.
I'm so glad it came.

33
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,154
You mustn't water it every day.

34
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:27,555
Too much moisture makes it very unhappy.

35
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,222
Well good morning, Mother.
I thought you were still upstairs.

36
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:31,222
Good morning, Clarence.

37
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:34,725
Father must be talking to himself.

38
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:39,555
A redhead!
Did you sleep well, Mother?

39
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:43,805
Yes, thank you, dear.
Golly I'm hungry.

40
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:45,753
Oh and Annie,
we always start with fruit in the morning.

41
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:48,888
Except the two younger boys
who have their porridge and milk.

42
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,232
Jiminy! Another wreck on the New Haven!

43
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,809
That always disturbs the stock market.
Father won't like that.

44
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,789
I do wish the New Haven would stop having wrecks.

45
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,837
If they knew how it upsets your father.

46
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:02,559
My soul and body! Clarence,
what's happened to your coat?

47
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,330
Oh it ripped open again.

48
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,554
Margaret mended it for me
but it won't stay mended.

49
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:10,018
Oh dear. I'll just have to speak to your father
about a new suit of clothes.

50
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,870
Clarence, why did you take my H2SO4
out of our clothes closet?

51
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:18,221
I've told you a hundred times
that closet's not to make experiments in.

52
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:21,789
Two?
Good morning, Mother.

53
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,444
John, have you been making those
chemical smells again?

54
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,555
No, Mother,
I'm making an electric battery.

55
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:28,032
It'll ring a bell and everything.

56
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,933
You know your father
doesn't like electricity.

57
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,484
But Mother,
everything's going to be electricity.

58
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:37,285
Not in this house.
Oh God!

59
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:39,192
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

60
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,075
Where's my necktie?
Which necktie?

61
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,325
The one I gave you yesterday.

62
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:46,999
It isn't pressed yet.
I forgot to give it to Margaret.

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,027
I told you distinctly I wanted
to wear that necktie today.

64
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,888
You've got plenty of neckties.

65
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,554
Put on another one right away
and come down to breakfast.

66
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:57,971
I don't know what this world's coming to.

67
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:01,777
Mother, may I have my breakfast early.
I'm going to play baseball.

68
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,117
Three!

69
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:07,007
Whitney, before you leave the house
you have to study your catechism.

70
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,159
But Mother,
they're going to let me pitch today.

71
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,388
Good morning. Who won?
Giants, 7 to 3.

72
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,473
Buck Ewing hit a home run!
Let me see!

73
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:17,521
Boys, don't wrinkle the paper
before your father sees it.

74
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:21,591
Mother, could you ask me my catechism now?
I think I know it.

75
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:25,028
Well, let's see.
What is your name?

76
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,000
Whitney Benjamin.
Who gave you your...

77
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:32,980
Here I come...weeeeeee.
Come and help me down, Mother.

78
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,410
We have steps to come down on.
Good morning, darling.

79
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,443
Good morning, Mother.
How's your finger?

80
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:40,466
It itches.
Good. That's a sign it's getting better.

81
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:44,244
Come along.
Four!

82
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:49,551
Oh let's see. What was I doing?
Oh yes, the Catechism.

83
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,000
Who gave you your name?
My sponsors at baptism

84
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,481
wherein I was made a member of Christ,
the child of God,

85
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,634
and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.

86
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:02,620
Mother, if I hadn't been baptized,
wouldn't I have any name?

87
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,224
Not in the sight of the church.

88
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,760
What did your sponsors then for you?

89
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,655
They did promise and vow
three thing in my name.

90
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:23,057
First, that I should renouce the devil and...
[continues speaking in background]

91
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,636
And thirdly, that I should keep God's holy will

92
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,100
and commandments and walk in the same

93
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,101
all the days of my...
Morning, boys.

94
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:36,555
Morning.
Good morning, Father.

95
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,000
Morning, Vinnie.
Have a good night?

96
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:42,114
Yes, thank you, Clare.
Good. Get down, boys.

97
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:44,511
What's that thing doing in here?

98
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:47,220
Clare, that's our new rubber plant.

99
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,546
Place for rubber plants is on the equator.

100
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,531
Uh, take that object out, Katherine.

101
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,733
You're not Katherine.
No, sir.

102
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,970
Good. Never liked Katherine anyway.

103
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:02,837
Put it somewhere else, Annie,
but not too near a window.

104
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:07,068
Sit down, Harlan.
Thank you, dear.

105
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:20,068
Where did that dog come from?
She'll leave. I'll talk to her.

106
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:24,506
What did you say?
Clare, that new suit looks very nice.

107
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:27,000
A triffle tight.
You've put on a little weight, dear.

108
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,950
I weigh just the same as I always have.

109
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:33,499
Well, Clarence has just managed
to ruin the only decent suit he has.

110
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,486
I'm sorry but I'm afraid he'll need
a new suit of clothes.

111
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,958
Vinnie, Clarence has to learn
not to be so hard on his clothes.

112
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,443
But Father, I thought...
You'll be starting at Yale in the fall.

113
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,480
You'll be completely outfitted.
But nothing this summer.

114
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,354
Can I have one of your old suits cut down for me?

115
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,924
Every suit I own still has plenty of wear in it.

116
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:52,999
I wear my clothes until they're worn out.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,667
Well, if you want your clothes worn out, Clarence
can wear them out much faster than you can.

118
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,369
Yes, and Father,
you never get a chance to wear yours out.

119
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,181
Every time you get a new batch of clothes,
Mother sends the old ones to the missionary barrel.

120
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:05,209
I guess I'm just as good
as any old missionary.

121
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,110
Clarence, before you compare yourself to
a missionary, remember the sacrifices they make.

122
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,242
Oh I don't know, Vinnie.

123
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:16,133
I think my clothes would look better on Clarence
than on some Hottentot.

124
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:20,821
Have that dark suit of mine cut down to fit you.

125
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:23,043
Well thank you, Father.
One of Father's suits.

126
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,821
Thank you, sir.

127
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:28,335
In return for that, Clarence,
I want you to practice more often on your violin.

128
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,939
Whitney, don't eat so fast.

129
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,717
Well Father,
I'm going to pitch today.

130
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:36,766
But before I go,
I have to study my catechism.

131
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,502
What do you bother with that for?

132
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:41,322
Because if he doesn't know his catechism,
he can't be confirmed.

133
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,787
But Vinnie, Whitney's going to pitch today.

134
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,461
He can be confirmed any old time.

135
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:51,211
Clare, sometimes it seems to me you don't care
whether your children get to heaven or not.

136
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:52,712
Oh, Whitney will get to heaven alright.

137
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:55,482
I'll be there before you are, Whitney.
I'll see that you get in.

138
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,775
And Whitney,
when we get to heaven,

139
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,961
we'll organize a baseball team of our own.
Good.

140
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:03,982
It would be just like you to try
and run things up there.

141
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:07,462
Well, from all I've heard about heaven,
it seems to be a pretty unbusiness-like place.

142
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,476
They could probably use
good man like me.

143
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:12,554
What makes you so sure
they'll let you in to heaven?

144
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:16,532
Well if they don't,
I'll certainly raise a devil of a row!

145
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:20,900
Clare, I do hope you'll behave
when you get to heaven.

146
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:24,401
Now Vinnie, what...

147
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:27,000
Vinnie, how many times have I asked you

148
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:30,338
not to engage a maid
who doesn't know how to serve properly?

149
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,041
Clare, can't you see she's new
and doing her best?

150
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,555
How can I serve myself when
she's holding that platter over my head?

151
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:41,003
Hold it lower, Annie.
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,346
What became of the one we had yesterday?

153
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:48,647
I don't know why you can't keep a maid.

154
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:50,222
Oh you don't!

155
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,617
Why on earth can't you run your house
the way I run my office?

156
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:56,218
All I want is service.

157
00:11:56,219 --> 00:12:01,111
[Annie weeping]
What the devil is that noise?

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,999
It's Annie.
Annie? Who's Annie?

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,610
The maid.
I'll take it, Annie.

160
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,000
Clare, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

161
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,666
What have I done now?

162
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,000
You made her cry,
speaking to her the way you did.

163
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,554
I never said a word to her.
I was addressing myself to you.

164
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,471
I do wish you'd be more careful!

165
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:30,202
It's hard enough to keep a maid
and the uniform just fit this one.

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,204
[stomping foot]
What's the matter, Clare? What's wrong?

167
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:44,665
[dog barks]
What in the name of...

168
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:49,222
Well!
Where did you come from?

169
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,000
Who do you belong to?

170
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,154
She's mine, Father.
Her name is Princess.

171
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:59,000
Hmmm,
looks more like a Prince to me.

172
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,002
What's wrong, sir?
Margaret, this bacon's good!

173
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:08,759
Ohh...
Well it's good! Yes sir.

174
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,960
Harlan, how's that finger?
Come here and let me see it.

175
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,621
Yes, Father.

176
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:22,722
Ah, that's healing nicely.

177
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:25,524
I guess you'll know the next time
that cats don't like to be hugged.

178
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,712
It's alright to stroke them
but don't squeeze them.

179
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,913
Now go back and finish your oatmeal.
I don't like oatmeal.

180
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:33,000
Go on and finish it.
it's good for you.

181
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,555
But I don't like it!

182
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:37,313
I'll tell you what you like
and what you don't like.

183
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,517
You're not old enough
to know about such things.

184
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,747
You've no business not liking oatmeal.
It's good.

185
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,906
I hate it!
That's enough! We won't discuss it!

186
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:49,541
Eat that oatmeal at once!

187
00:13:55,542 --> 00:14:05,151
Aghhh...
[stomping floor]

188
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:07,443
John, that letter's for your mother.

189
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:10,324
I finished my oatmeal, Father.
May I be excused?

190
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,269
Yes Whitney, you may go.
Pitch a good game.

191
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,186
I will.
Whitney!

192
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,654
Yes Mother, my catechism.

193
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:21,505
Never mind this morning, darling.
Run along.

194
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:22,512
Thank you, Mother!

195
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:27,853
What's wrong, sir?
Margaret, what is this?

196
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:29,805
Coffee, sir.
It is not coffee.

197
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:33,450
You couldn't possibly take water and coffee beans
and arrive at that!

198
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:36,111
It's slops! That's what it is!
Slops! Take it away.

199
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:38,466
I come down to this table every morning hungry...

200
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:41,887
Well if you're hungry, Clare,
why aren't you eating your breakfast?

201
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,001
I am.

202
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:47,299
Aunt Judith wants me to come up and vist her.

203
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,998
Now Vinnie,
I want no more relatives in this house.

204
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:55,597
We are going to live here by ourselves
in peace and comfort.

205
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,998
Clare, I was saying,
Aunt Judith wants me to visit her.

206
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,888
Oh.
Eat your oatmeal, dear.

207
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,938
But what on earth is this?
Dear friend Day,

208
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:08,666
We are assigning you the exclusive rights
to Staten Island for selling

209
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,397
the Gem Home Popover Popcorn.
I think that's for me, Father.

210
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:15,998
But then why isn't it addressed
to Clarence Day Jr?

211
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,027
Oh, it is.

212
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:22,998
I wouldn't get mixed up in popcorn,
Clarence. It's too indigestible.

213
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,110
Confound it!
Another wreck on the New Haven...

214
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:28,111
If you please, ma'am.
There's a dollar due on a package.

215
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:31,676
It's from Lewis and Congers.
Oh yes, those kitchen knives I ordered.

216
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,666
Ah, make a memorandum of that, Vinnie.
One dollar...

217
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,998
and whatever it was for.
Of course, Clare.

218
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:39,928
I must have a record of what is spent
running this house.

219
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,995
I've never understood what good a record is
after the money's gone!

220
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,991
There's just a dollar, Margaret.

221
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,000
Vinnie, this house must be run
on a business basis. Of course, dear.

222
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,224
That's what the household accounts are for.

223
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:53,308
Oh Clare, it's half past eight.
You don't want to be late at the office.

224
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:57,065
Plenty of time.
Annie, clear the table now.

225
00:15:57,066 --> 00:16:00,337
Clarence. John.
Yes, Mother?

226
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:04,000
You boys go up and move the small bureau
from my room into yours.

227
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,331
Who's coming?
Cousin Cora.

228
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,333
And she's bringing a friend with her,
a young girl.

229
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,777
A girl!

230
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,777
You would have to help entertain her,
Clarence.

231
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,111
Oh Mother, do I have to?

232
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:15,222
Wait till Father finds out we've got visitors!
There'll be a rumpus!

233
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:17,222
John, don't criticise your father.

234
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:20,998
He's very hospitable...
after he gets used to the idea.

235
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,888
I like coffee.
I like tea.

236
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,777
I like the girls
and the girls like me.

237
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,657
Well, I don't like girls
and they don't like me.

238
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:30,747
Oh God!
Go on, boys. Go on.

239
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:34,359
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

240
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,555
How did that get in this room?

241
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:40,088
Now, Clare.
How was the new maid to know?

242
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,666
Keep that abomination out of here.
All right, I'll take it.

243
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:50,498
Oh Clare dear, I'm afraid
I'm going to need some more money.

244
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,555
You were complaining about
the coffee this morning.

245
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,639
Well, that nice French drip
coffee pot is broken.

246
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,547
You know how it got broken.

247
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,881
Never mind that, Vinnie.

248
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:03,998
As I remember that coffee pot cost $5
and... something.

249
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,381
I'll give you $6.

250
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:10,569
When you get it, Vinnie,
enter the exact amount in the ledger.

251
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,870
Of course, Clare.
We can't go on month after month

252
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,874
having the household accounts
in such a mess.

253
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,562
No, and I thought of a system
that will make my bookkeeping perfect!

254
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:20,777
Well, I'm certainly relieved to hear that!

255
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:24,555
All we have to do is open
charge accounts everywhere!

256
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:26,160
And the stores will do my
bookkeeping for me!

257
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,868
Now wait a minute, Vinne...

258
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,445
Then when the bills come in
you'd know exactly where your money had gone!

259
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,910
Yes! I certainly would!

260
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,583
Vinnie, we get enough bills as it is!

261
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,945
Clare dear, don't you hate those
arguments we have every month?

262
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,346
I certainly do.

263
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:46,555
Not to have those I should think
would be worth something to you.

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,778
Well, I'll open an account
at Lewis and Congers

265
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,000
and one at McCreery's
to start with.

266
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you, Clare.

267
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,999
We'll see how it works out.
Thank you.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,647
Oh, the rector is coming to tea today.

269
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:03,355
The rector.
Well, I'm glad you warned me.

270
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:06,555
I'll go to the club. Don't expect me
home until dinner time.

271
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:12,141
Clare dear, I do wish you'd take
a little more interest in the church.

272
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:14,208
Getting me into heaven
is your business, Vinnie.

273
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,544
If there's anything wrong with my ticket
when I get there,

274
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:18,044
you can fix it up.

275
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:21,509
Everybody loves you so much,
I'm sure God must too.

276
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,669
I'll do my best, Clare.

277
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,385
It wouldn't be heaven without you.

278
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,572
If you're there, Vinnie,
I'll manage to get in some way,

279
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:34,306
even if I have to climb the fence.

00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,295
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

283
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,998
Why did God make so many
dumb fools and Democrats?

284

Uhh, politics...

285
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,998

out of our mouths!

Fine mayor you've turned out to be!

288
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:09,915
If you can't run this city without
raising taxes every five minutes,

289
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,303
you'd better get out!

290
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,769
Let someone who can!

and you're just his cat's paw!

Tell me this...

293
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,998
Are these increased taxes
going into public improvements?

294
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,222
Or are they going into graft?

295
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:28,380
Answer me that honestly,
if you can, Mr. Honest Hugh Grant!

296
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,998
You can't?
I thought so! Baah!

297
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,443
You were elected to office on the promise
that you would put an end

298
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,346
to all this thievery and corruption!

299
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,846
Have you put an end to it?
No!

300
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,833
You've encouraged it!

301
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,667
Every day there's some
new raid on the public treasury!

302
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:48,680
[multiple conversations]
...we're going to throw you

303
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,215
and your boodle Board
of Aldermen out of office!

304
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,465
I'm warning you for the last time!

305
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:56,861
Robbery! That's what it is!
Highway robbery!

306
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,998
Annie, take this fresh a cup
of coffee in to Mr. Day.

307
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:07,027
But Mr. Day's got a visitor.
Run along in there.

308
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:09,008
We pay you a good round sum
to watch after our interests.

309
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,869
And all we get is inefficiency!

310
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,945
I know you're a nincompoop and I
strongly suspect you of being a scalawag!

311
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:21,376
You're not going to escape
your legal responsibilities!

312
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:26,313
Legal responsibilities?
By God, I mean criminal responsibilities!

313
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,744
Don't think for one minute
we're going to let you escape!

314
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:37,845
We're going to throw you into jail!
[dishes breaking]

315
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,221
Annie, are you hurt?
He can't throw me into jail!

316
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:49,554
Vinnie? Vinnie, why can't
I have quiet here in the morning?

317
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,222
Clare, what happened?

318
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:53,665
Sounded to me as tho that maid
dropped a whole tray of dishes!

319
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,822
Yes, but what did you say to her?

320
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,111
Say to her?
I haven't seen her since breakfast!

321
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:01,586
I better get to the office.
Oh yes Clare, you don't want to be late.

322
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:03,357
I'll be home in plenty of time for dinner.

323
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:06,871
Why don't we have
chicken fricassee tonight?

324
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:10,505
Well, Clare, chicken's gone up!
It's 8 cents a pound!

325
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:17,885
[Annie crying]

326
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:26,351
Where the devil is she going
dressed up like that?

327
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,998
Clare, you've done it again!
How could you?

328
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:31,998
How could I what?
Can't you see she's leaving?

329
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh dear.
I have no time to engage a new maid.

330
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:37,185
We'll have to have dinner out.
Dinner out!

331
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:40,111
Nonsense!
I'll engage a new maid myself.

332
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,514
Clare, you can't!
She has to fit the uniform.

333
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:44,365
I have one here in an hour!

334
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,907
Goodbye, dear.
Goodbye, Clare.

335
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,555
Good morning, Mr. Day.
On your way to the office?

336
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:53,102
Yes, Sergeant. Good morning.
Mrs. Day.

337
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:59,417
Good morning, Mr. Day.
Morning, Jim.

338
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,177
Giddap!

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,632
Cora, it's wonderful to see you.

340
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:30,611
Well Vinnie, I declare,
you're getting younger and pretier every year!

341
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:33,665
This is Mary Skinner.
Ed Skinner's daughter!

342
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,998
My goodness I never
would have known you!

343
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,998
Just leave your things out here
and come right on in.

344
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,222
I heard my father talk so much about you.
Ah ha ha.

345
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:46,999
Did he tell you how he used to dip
my pigtails in the ink well at school?

346
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:52,444
What's the news in Pleasantville, Cora?
Oh Vinnie, I have so much to tell you.

347
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,793
We wrote you that Aunt Carrie broke her hip.
Yes.

348
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,894
That was the night Robert Ingersoll lectured.

349
00:22:56,895 --> 00:23:00,555
Of course she couldn't get there, but
was a good thing for Mr. Ingersol she didn't!

350
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:04,777
How do you do, Cousin Cora?
Oh, Clarence, my my...

351
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:08,998
Oh no, Cora, this is John.
John? Why how you've grown!

352
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,443
You'll be a man before your mother...

353
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:14,555
John, this is Mary Skinner.
How do you do?

354
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,000
How do you do?

355
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,666
Vinnie, everybody in Pleasantville
sends their love.

356
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,888
Grandpa Evans, Cousin Edith,
Aunt Hattie. the Taylors.

357
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,777
Oh, just everybody.
Cora, how is Grandpa Evans?

358
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,333
Oh, he hasn't been at all well.

359
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:28,000
You know he only has one kidney
and that's bloated.

360
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,776
How do you do, Cousin Cora?
I'm glad to see you.

361
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:34,000
This can't be Clarence!
Yes it is!

362
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,666
My my!
My goodness!

363
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,000
Every time I see you boys,
you've grown another foot!

364
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,163
Let's see, you're going to St. Paul's now,
aren't you?

365
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:46,111
St. Paul's? I was through with
St. Paul's long ago.

366
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:47,776
I'm starting in Yale this fall.

367
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:51,777
Yale!
Oh, oh Mary, this is Clarence.

368
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,455
Mary Skinner.
How do you do?

369
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:58,444
Oh, this is Mary's first trip to New York.
Yes it is.

370
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:01,555
It's her first trip.
We'll have to show Mary around!

371
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:07,333
Oh I tell you, I'll ask Mr. Day to take us all
to Delmonico's for dinner tonight.

372
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,444
Delmonico's!
Think of that, Mary.

373
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:12,998
Delmonico's,
And Cousin Clare's such a wonderful host.

374
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,777
Well. I know you girls want to freshen up,
so come upstairs.

375
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:17,000
Clarence, get their bags.

376
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:20,727
I've given you girls Clarence's room,
but he didn't know about it.

377
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:24,777
[chattering]

378
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:29,776
John, get their old bags.
[chattering]

379
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:36,776
Oh, you play the violin.
Well, I... I fool with it a little.

380
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,998
You're just being modest.

381
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:42,714
No, really I...
I play the piano.

382
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:47,923
Not awfully well.
Now you're being modest.

383
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:55,902
Do you ever play duets?
Well, I haven't up now.

384
00:24:55,903 --> 00:25:02,170
Neither have I, up to now.

385
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:10,244
Cora didn't tell me about you.
I never met a Yale man before.

386
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:13,473
[giggling...]

387
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:23,607
What's happened to you?
Nothing. I feel fine.

388
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:45,391
Where do you keep them?

389
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:48,758
Do you wish domestic servants?
Where do you keep them?

390
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,998
I will take your name and address.

391
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,502
Confound it!
I'm late at the office now!

392
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:56,398
If you will give me the details as to
what kind of person you require...

393
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,666
I'm asking you where you keep them?

394
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:03,468
Why the girls are in there,
but clients are not allowed in that room.

395
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,998
If you will tell me the kind of a position
you wish to have held,

396
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,946
I'll be very glad to...

397
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:20,052
Stand up...

398
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,518
Sir, this is quite
against the rules!

399
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,777
I must know
what you want the girl for!

400
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:25,777
I'll take that one.

401
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,555
What's your name?
Hilda, sir.

402
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:29,998
Hilda, you go right over to
420 Madison Avenue.

403
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,893
I will, sir.
That's all. Thank you.

404
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:35,769
Sir, before I can let any girl go
from this establishment,

405
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,483
I must know the character of the home
in which he will be employed.

406
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:44,384
Madam, I am the character of my home.

407
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:53,111
My duty toward my neighbor is to love him
as myself and to do unto all men as...as...

408
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:59,914
...as they should do unto me...
...as they should do unto me, to...to...

409
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:01,158
He really knows it.

410
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,172
Well, he's done very well
for so young a boy.

411
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,776
May I go now?
Yes, darling.

412
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,333
Thank you, Dr. Lloyd.

413
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:13,000
Come on, Harlan.
Wait for me.

414
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:18,075
Ah, you and Mr. Day must be
very proud of your children.

415
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,998
I was hoping I'd find
Mr. Day at home this afternoon.

416
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,548
Well, he's usually home from the office
by this time.

417
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,998
Perhaps he's gone for
gallop in the park.

418
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,998
It's such a fine day.

419
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,998
He's very fond of horseback riding,
I believe.

420
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,576
Oh yes.
Tell me,

421
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:34,076
has he ever been thrown from a horse?

422
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:37,896
Oh no, no horse would throw Mr. Day!

423
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:42,791
I just thought he might have had some accident.
I notice he never kneels in church.

424
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,222
Oh, that's no accident.

425
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:48,777
But I don't want you to think he doesn't pray.
He does.

426
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:50,777
Why, sometimes you can hear him
all over the house!

427
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:54,429
But he never kneels.

428
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,111
Ah, perhaps that's Mr. Day now.
I hardly think so.

429
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,000
Ah, the devil!
I forgot!

430
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:09,244
Clare, you're just in time for tea.
I'll send for some hot water.

431
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:11,000
How are you, Dr. Lloyd?

432
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,665
Just a brief second to have
a visit with you, Mr. Day.

433
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,613
Mother, are they back yet?
No, Clarence, no.

434
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:19,627
Except for a brief glimpse on the sabbath,
I don't see much of you.

435
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:23,443
Well, Clare, have a busy day at the office?
Devilishly busy!

436
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:29,607
Clare!
Ah...very busy day. Tired out.

437
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:33,109
How a man can get tired just sitting
at a desk all day, I don't know!

438
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,378
I suppose Wall Street is just as much
a mystery to you as it is to me, Dr. Lloyd.

439
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:40,295
No, no. It's all very clear to me.

440
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:43,142
My mind often goes to the businessman.

441
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,157
The picture I'm most fond on is when

442
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:47,169
I envision him at the close of the day's work.

443
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,434
I see him pausing in his toil

444
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,038
and it comes over him that all those

445
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,998
figures of profit and loss are without
importance or consequence.

446
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,776
Vanity and dust.

447
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:04,386
Well, I'll be...
Clare!

448
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:08,177
Yes ma'am?
Delia, some more hot water, please.

449
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:09,671
Yes ma'am.
Who's that?

450
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:13,865
The new maid.
Where's the one I sent this morning?

451
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:16,859
The uniform didn't fit.

452
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,374
I like the one I picked out better.

453
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:25,213
Clare, Dr. Lloyd wants to tell us about
the plans for the new edifice.

454
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:27,470
The new what?
The new church.

455
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:29,888
You knew we were planning
to build a new church.

456
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:33,318
Of course, we're going to have to raise
a large sum money.

457
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,033
Well, personally I am against the church
hop skipping and jumping all over the town.

458
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:41,616
So any contribution I make
will have to be a small one.

459
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:44,777
The amount everyone is to subscribe
has already been decided.

460
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:46,340
Who decided it?

461
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:50,111
After considerable thought,
we voted that our supporting members

462
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:53,998
should each contribute a sum
equal to the cost of their pew.

463
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,888
I paid $5,000 for my pew!

464
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,998
Yes, Clare.
That makes our contribution $5000.

465
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,000
That's robbery!

466
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:05,958
Do you know what that pew is worth today?
$3000!

467
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,000
That's what the last one sold for.

468
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:11,305
I've taken a dead loss of $2000
on that pew already!

469
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:14,998
Frank Bags sold me that pew
when the market was at its peak!

470
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,959
He knew when to get out!

471
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,875
And I'm warning you, Vinnie,

472
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:22,998
if the market ever goes up,
I'm going to unload that pew!

473
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,554
Clarence Day!
How can you speak of the temple of the Lord

474
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:29,666
as though it was something to be
bought and sold on Wall Street?

475
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,925
Now Mrs. Day, your husband
is a practical man.

476
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:35,960
We've had to be practical
about the new church.

477
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,440
We have all the facts and figures.

478
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,998
Oh, what's the property worth
where we are now?

479
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:47,821
Oh, let's see. Is it $40,000?
I know the figure has a 4 in it.

480
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:50,998
What's the new piece of property
going to cost you?

481
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,953
I think the figure I heard mentioned
was $85,000.

482
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,776
Or was it $185,000?

483
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:03,385
Dr. Lloyd, you preach that someday
we'll all have to answer to God.

484
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,485
We shall indeed!

485
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:10,489
Well, I hope God doesn't ask you
any questions with figures in them!

486
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,000
Mr. Day is in the living room.
Thank you.

487
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:19,444
It's Cousin Cora.
She's passing through town.

488
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:24,378
Oh, well...

489
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:31,887
Oh, hello. Hello. Hello.
Thank you for helping me. Come, Mary.

490
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:36,969
Oh Vinnie, what a day!
We've been in every shop in town!

491
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,532
Why, Cousin Clare.
Cora.

492
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,332
My my!
You're as welcome as the flowers in May.

493
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,775
This is Mary Skinner.
Mr. Day.

494
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,555
How do you do?
I've been telling Mary all about you.

495
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,888
She's been dying to meet you.
Well...

496
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,888
Dr. Lloyd, I want you to meet
my favorite cousin, Miss Cartwright.

497
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:53,554
How do you do?

498
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:56,027
And this is Mary Skinner.
Miss Skinner, Dr. Lloyd.

499
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:57,998
How do you do?
How do you do?

500
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,998
Well, this seems to be a family reunion.
I'll just run along.

501
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,999
Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.

502
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,325
Goodbye, Miss Cartwright.
Goodbye.

503
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,125
Clarence, you haven't said
'how do you do' to Dr. Lloyd.

504
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,242
Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.

505
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,186
Goodbye, everybody.
I'll go to the door with you, Dr. Lloyd.

506
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:17,562
Thank you so much for the tea.
Those muffins were delicious.

507
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,483
Who did you say this pretty little girl is?

508
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,998
She's Ed Skinner's daughter.
This is Mary's first trip to New York.

509
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,444
Oh sit down. Sit down.

510
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,798
Have some tea.
We had tea downtown.

511
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,999
Oh, never mind then, ah...Delia.
Sit down, sit down.

512
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,554
Even if you have had tea,
you can stay and visit for a while.

513
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:37,555
As a matter of fact,
why don't you both stay to dinner.

514
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,000
That's all arranged, Clare.

515
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,889
Cora and Mary are going
to have dinner with us.

516
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,528
Oh fine, fine.

517
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,661
Of course, you'll just have to take potluck.
Well, I'd hardly call...

518
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:49,426
Clare! Did you know the girls
are going to visit Aunt Judith

519
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,888
in Springfield for a whole month!
Fine.

520
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:55,264
Now, how long you are you going
to be in New York, Cora?

521
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,077
All week!
Splendid!

522
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:59,998
We'll hope to see something of you.
Well, you certainly will...

523
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:03,111
Cora, did you find anything
you wanted in the shop?

524
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:05,777
Oh, I can't wait to show you.
Oh, but I'm afraid

525
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:08,888
some of these packages can't be opened
in front of Cousin Clare!

526
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,998
Shall I leave the room?

527
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:17,307
[laughing]

528
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:20,998
Oh, Clarence. Would you take the
packages in the hall up to our room?

529
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,555
Or should I say, your room!

530
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:26,926
Wasn't it nice of Clarence to give up
his room to us for a whole week!

531
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:30,231
Cora, come on I just can't wait
to see what's in those packages.

532
00:33:30,232 --> 00:33:33,294
Well, we'll be back soon.

533
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:36,895
Ah, Vinnie, I wish to speak to you
before you go upstairs.

534
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:38,669
I'll be down in just a minute, Clare.

535
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,822
I wish to speak to you now!

536
00:33:39,823 --> 00:33:42,461
I'll be up in just a minute, Cora.

537
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:44,444
It's all right, Vinnie.
Come along, Mary.

538
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:47,127
Are those two women encamped in our house?
Now, Clare...

539
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:49,052
Answer me!
Now Clare, you know...

540
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:53,976
Answer me!
Just a minute... Clarence!

541
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:59,476
Now Clare, you know you've
always been fond of Cora.

542
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,351
What's that got to do with her packing
herself down in my house

543
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,212
and bringing hordes of strangers with her.

544
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:06,837
How can you call that sweet
little girl a horde of strangers?

545
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:10,071
Why don't they go to a hotel?
New York is full of hotels

546
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:12,776
built for the express purpose
of housing such nuisances.

547
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:15,111
Clare two girls alone in a hotel!

548
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:17,000
Well who knows what might happen to them!

549
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,000
All right, then put them on the first train.

550
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,443
They want to roam like gypsies,
lend them a hand!

551
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:22,111
Keep them roaming!

552
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:25,290
But Clare, they're just staying
in that little room of Clarence's.

553
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,000
The trouble is,
they don't stay there!

554
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:30,129
They stay in the bathroom.
Every time I want to take my bath,

555
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,179
it's full of gigling females
washing their hair!

556
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,222
I tell you, I won't have it!
Send them to a hotel!

557
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:38,555
I'll pay the bill gladly,
but get them out of here!

558
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,555
Father, I'm afraid
they can hear you upstairs!

559
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,401
Then keep those doors closed!

560
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:48,457
Clarence, you open those doors!
Open them all the way!

561
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:52,075
Now Clare,
you be quiet and behave yourself.

562
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:55,676
They're here,
and they're going to stay here.

563
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,000
That's enough, Vinnie.

564
00:34:57,001 --> 00:35:00,212
I want no more
of this argument.

565
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh God!

566
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:15,000
What I don't understand is
why this swarm of locusts

567
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,231
always descends on us
without any warning!

568
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,119
Oh thunder!

569
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,453
Vinnie...
Dear Vinnie.

Father, may I go along with
the rest of you to Delmonico's?

574
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:15,000
What's that?
Delmonico's?

575
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,000
You're taking Mother, Cousin Cora
and Miss Skinner

576
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,555
to Delmonico's for dinner tonight.

577
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:21,666
Oh God!
[slams piano keys]

578
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,830
I won't have it!
I won't have it!

579
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:26,296
I will not have my life
arranged for me!

580
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,666
I bought this house
for my own comfort!

581
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,000
I will not submit myself
to this indignity!

582
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:33,000
Now Clare, what's the matter?
I won't stand it!

583
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:37,304
By heaven, I won't stand it!
Clarence...

584
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:43,149
Do I understand I am not permitted
to have dinner in my own home?

585
00:36:43,222 --> 00:36:46,886
Oh Clare,
a little change will do you good!

586
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,109
I have home
to have dinner in.

587
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,054
And any time I can't
have dinner at home,

588
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,054
this house is for sale.

589
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:54,555
Well Clare, you can't have
dinner here tonight

590
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:56,047
because it isn't ordered.

591
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,555
And besides, Cora and Mary want
to see something of New York.

592
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:02,165
Well, that's no affair of mine!

593
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,777
I am not a guide
to Chinatown and the Bowery.

594
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,853
Oh Mr. Day,
I just love your house!

595
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:15,950
I could live here forever!

596
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:24,918
Cora is for you, Mrs. Day.
Oh yes. I'll run right up.

597
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,555
I'm glad you like our house,
Miss Skinner.

598
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,389
I like it very much,

00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:41,347
has not been neglected
in our infancy or youth.

754
00:47:41,348 --> 00:47:46,451
Can you imagine any man

755
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:49,645
who has reached maturity
with the knowledge

756
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:51,764
that he had never been baptized

757
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:54,541
failing to hasten
to the holy font

758
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:57,215
that his soul might be saved?

759
00:47:57,216 --> 00:48:01,695
As it says in the baptismal office,

760
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:05,271
"Except a man be born of water
and of the spirit,

761
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:08,500
he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God."

762
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:13,813
"He that believeth
and is baptized

763
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:17,771
shall be saved,
but he that believeth not

764
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:20,828
shall be damned."

765
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:23,223
What's that fellow up to?
He can't be...

766
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:25,000
Which also shows us
the great benefit we reap...

767
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,335
[loud sermon continues...]
Tell Father, Shhh!

768
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,335
Tell Father, Shhh!

769
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:32,335
Tell Father, Shhh!

770
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:35,000
Tell Father, Shhh!

771
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:38,998
Mother says, Shhh!
[loud sermon continues...]

772
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,467
"For the promise is to you
and to your children.

773
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:47,329
Doubt ye not therefore,

774
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:52,730
but earnestly believe."

775
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:58,017
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

776
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,384
and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

777
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,748
This is William Tyler Wickersham.

778
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:36,560
And this is
Wilhemina Eugenia Wickersham.

779
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:39,333
What a lovely day for
them to be baptized.

780
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:41,955
The happiest day in my life.

781
00:49:46,055 --> 00:49:50,822
Lovely sermon.
Thank you, Mrs. Day.

782
00:49:56,985 --> 00:50:00,138
Clare, you know I didn't
ask Dr. Lloyd to do that.

783
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:01,555
You must have said something.

784
00:50:01,556 --> 00:50:04,339
Well, I had to find out from him
if we were really married.

785
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,527
I am married and
I'm not baptized.

786
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:08,000
And as far as I'm concerned,

787
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,555
the whole congregation
can know it.

788
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:12,222
They certainly know it now.
That suits me.

789
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't go to church
to be preached at

790
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:16,000
as though I were
some lost sheep.

791
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,000
Clare, you don't seem to understand
what the church is for.

792
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,319
Vinnie, if there's one place
the church should leave alone,

793
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,597
it's a man's soul!

794
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:33,681
Well, he's going to be baptized,
Cora, you mark my word!

795
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:36,007
I just couldn't go to heaven
without Clare.

796
00:50:36,008 --> 00:50:39,889
Why, I get lonesome for him
even when I go to Ohio!

797
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,111
It's awfully hard on a woman
to love a man like Clare so much.

798
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:46,257
Oh, men are so aggravating.

799
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:50,174
They take everything for granted.
They certainly do!

800
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:53,075
You know, I don't believe
Clare's come right out

801
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:55,000
and told me he loves me
since we've been married.

802
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:57,998
Of course, I know he does because
I keep reminding him of it.

803
00:50:57,999 --> 00:50:59,998
You have to keep
reminding them, Cora.

804
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:04,111
Vinnie,
the table isn't set for dinner yet.

805
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:07,969
I'll be back in a minute, Cora.

806
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,980
We're having it after Cora and Mary
go to the train.

807
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:12,555
Their cab is coming at 1:00.

808
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:14,974
Cab? The horse cars go
right past the door.

809
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:17,333
But Clare,
they have those heavy bags.

810
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,898
Cabs are a waste of money.

811
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:22,111
Well, if dinner is going to be delayed,
I'll work on this month's bills.

812
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,222
Where are they?
Now Clare, it isn't fair

813
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:27,000
to go over the household accounts
when you're hungry.

814
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,107
Vinnie, where are those bills?

815
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:31,274
They're in the library
on your desk.

816
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:34,222
I didn't know dinner
was going to be late.

817
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:36,453
Nobody ever tells me anything
in this house.

818
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,858
Back home I ride all the time.
I love horses.

819
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:41,774
The horse is my favorite animal.

820
00:51:41,775 --> 00:51:43,074
Oh my goodness.
Where have you two been?

821
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:45,420
Clarence wanted to show me his
his grandfather's house.

822
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,771
You will have to hurry
and finish your packing.

823
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,080
It won't take me long.

824
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:52,156
Can I help you pack?
Clarence!

825
00:51:54,157 --> 00:51:58,906
Clarence, why didn't you
kneel in church today?

826
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,671
I...
I just couldn't.

827
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:07,859
If it's because your father doesn't kneel,
you must remember

828
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,942
he wasn't brought up to kneel in church.
But you were.

829
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:16,505
Has it anything to do with Mary?
I know she's a Methodist.

830
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh no, Mother. Methodists kneel.
Mary told me.

831
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:22,241
They don't get up-and-down so much,
but they stay down longer.

832
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,150
Clarence, you want to kneel,
don't you?

833
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh yes!
I wanted to kneel today.

834
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:33,555
I tried! You saw me try!
But... I just couldn't.

835
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:38,116
Is that suit of your father's too tight for you?
No, it's not too tight.

836
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:42,111
What is it?
Mother, very peculiar things

837
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:43,791
have happened to me since
I started to wear this suit.

838
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:48,778
I can't seem to make these clothes
do anything Father wouldn't do!

839
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,159
That's nonsense, Clarence.

840
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,556
And not to kneel
in church is a sacrilege.

841
00:52:53,557 --> 00:52:56,778
Making Father's trousers kneel
seemed more of a sacrilege.

842
00:52:56,779 --> 00:52:58,555
Clarence!
Do you know what happened

843
00:52:58,556 --> 00:53:00,701
at Dura Wakefield's party
for Mary last night?

844
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:02,111
We were playing musical chairs

845
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,104
and some girl sat down suddenly
right in my lap.

846
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:05,998
Well I jumped up so fast
she almost got hurt!

847
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:09,930
She was sitting
on Father's trousers!

848
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:13,000
Well Mother, I've got to have
a suit of my own!

849
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:18,333
My soul and body! Well you'll just
have to talk to your father about it.

850
00:53:18,334 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm sure if you approach him the right way,
you know, tactfully, he'll see.

851
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:29,140
Oh excuse me.
Gracious! It didn't take you very long.

852
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:34,759
Well I'll see about your box
lunch for the train.

853
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:40,260
Remember, it's Sunday.

854
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:49,666
I... I was hoping we could have a few
minutes together before you left.

855
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,635
Cora had so much to do,
I wanted to get out of her way.

856
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:58,343
Well, didn't you want to see me?

857
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:04,398
I did want to tell you how much
I've enjoyed our... friendship.

858
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:09,888
Oh hello. Mother told us to sit in
the living room till dinner's ready.

859
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:13,392
Not on the best sofa! Hello.
Hello.

860
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,444
Have you ever been out on our porch?
Oh yes.

861
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,128
Well let me show it to you!

862
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:24,555
It's awfully hard to grow up
in a family with children.

863
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:28,650
My, I've never known a week
to pass so quickly.

864
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,444
Why I...
Yes?

865
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,555
Why I...
Yes?

866
00:54:37,556 --> 00:54:40,221
You're going to write me when you
when you get to Springfield, aren't you?

867
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:42,512
Of course,
if you write me first.

868
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:44,595
But you'll have something to write about,

869
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:47,657
your trip and aunt Judith
and how things are in Springfield.

870
00:54:47,658 --> 00:54:50,000
You write me as soon as you get there.

871
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:55,222
Maybe I'll be too busy.
Maybe I won't have time.

872
00:54:55,223 --> 00:54:58,888
Well, you find the time!
Let's not have any nonsense about that!

873
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:02,139
You'll write me first, and you'll
do it right away, the first day.

874
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:07,222
How do you know I'll take
orders from you?

875
00:55:07,243 --> 00:55:10,444
Well I'll show you!
Give me your hand!

876
00:55:10,445 --> 00:55:13,111
Why should I?
Give me your hand, confound it!

877
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:16,582
Why do you want...
my hand?

878
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:21,950
I just wanted it.
[sighs]

879
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,986
What are you thinking about?
I was just thinking.

880
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:27,771
About what?

881
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:31,785
I was hoping you'd write me first
because that would mean you liked me.

882
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:35,000
What's my writing first got to do
with liking you?

883
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:39,000
You do like me then?
Of course I do.

884
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:43,410
I like you better than
any girl I ever met!

885
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,007
But you don't like me
well enough to write first?

886
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:51,222
Well I don't see how one thing's
got anything to do with the other!

887
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:56,444
But a girl can't write first because...
because she's a girl!

888
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:57,998
Well that's nonsense!

889
00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:00,555
if a girl has something to write about
and a fellow hasn't,

890
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:02,555
there's no reason why she
shouldn't write first.

891
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:07,111
You know, the first three days I was here,
you'd do anything for me!

892
00:56:07,112 --> 00:56:10,876
And then you changed!
You used to be a lot of fun.

893
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:14,689
Then all of a sudden,
you turned into an old sobersides.

894
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,272
Why... why you even dress
like an old sobersides!

895
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:25,000
What's the matter?
I just happened to remember something.

896
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:27,888
What?
Oh, I know.

897
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:31,100
It's because this is the last time
we'll be together.

898
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:33,555
Mary! Please!
But Clarence,

899
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,998
we'll see each other in a month
when I come back.

900
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:39,777
Oh Clarence,
please write me first

901
00:56:39,778 --> 00:56:42,385
because that will show me
how much you like me.

902
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:45,000
Pleeeeeease?

903
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,389
I'll show you how much I like you...

904
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:56,000
Get up! Get up!
Ohhhh! Ohhhh!

905
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:59,387
Oh Mary, don't do that
Please, don't do that!

906
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:03,000
Now you will think
i'm just a bold and forward girl!

907
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:05,385
Oh no!
No, it's not that!

908
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,497
Was it because it's Sunday?

909
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:11,444
No, it'd be the same any day.

910
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh! You just didn't want
me sitting on your lap!

911
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:16,536
Oh, it was nice of you to do it!

912
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:19,538
It was nice of me?
So you told me to get up!

913
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,534
You just couldnt bear
to have me sit there!

914
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:24,000
Oh and you needn't
write me first!

915
00:57:24,001 --> 00:57:26,111
You neeedn't write me
any letters at at all!

916
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:29,000
Because I will tear them up
without opening them!

917
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:31,534
I never want to see you again!

918
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:37,534
Oh Mary! Mary, listen to me!
Mary! Please! Oh Mary...

919
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:46,534
[shreiking}
Ohhhhhh!

920
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:51,339
Clarence!

921
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,000
Yes Father?

922
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,812
That young lady's crying!
She's in tears.

923
00:57:57,813 --> 00:57:59,879
What's the meaning of this?

924
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,590
I'm sorry, Father.
It's all my fault.

925
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,396
Nonsense!
What's that girl trying to do to you?

926
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:08,708
No no... she wasn't...
It was... I... I...

927
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:11,222
Well! Whatever the quarrel
was about, Clarence,

928
00:58:11,223 --> 00:58:13,999
I'm glad
you held your own!

929
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,888
Father, I have to have
a new suit of clothes!

930
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,819
You've got to give me
the money for it!

931
00:58:20,555 --> 00:58:24,389
Young man! Do you realize that
you're addressing your father?

932
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm sorry, Father.
I apologize.

933
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,612
But you don't know how
important this is to me.

934
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:33,777
A new suit of clothes
clothes is so impor...

935
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:36,737
Oh why should...

936
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:42,222
Clarence has your need
for a new suit of clothes

937
00:58:42,223 --> 00:58:44,050
anything to do
with that young lady?

938
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:46,182
Yes Father.

939
00:58:47,183 --> 00:58:49,308
Why, Clarence!

940
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:53,333
Why, this comes as
quite a shock to me!

941
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,828
What does, Father?

942
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:59,111
Well, you're being so...
grown-up!

943
00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:00,777
Still, I might have known,

944
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:03,222
if you are going
to college this fall...

945
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:06,145
Yes, you're at the age
when you'll be meeting girls.

946
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:13,176
Clarence, there are things about women
that I think you ought to know.

947
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,111
Sit down.

948
00:59:32,845 --> 00:59:35,824
Yes, I think it's better for you
to hear this from me

949
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:37,695
than to have to learn it
for yourself.

950
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:45,469
Clarence, women aren't the angels
that you think they are.

951
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:48,848
Well now, first let me explain
this to you.

952
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:53,081
You see, Clarence,
we men have to run this world.

953
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:58,333
And it's not an easy job.
It takes work and it takes thinking.

954
00:59:58,334 --> 01:00:00,000
A man has to reason things out.

955
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:04,526
Now you take a woman.
A woman thinks...

956
01:00:05,527 --> 01:00:10,000
No, I'm wrong right there!
A woman doesn't think at all!

957
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,054
She gets stirred up!

958
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:16,000
And she gets stirred up over
the most confounded things!

959
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:18,111
Now I love my wife
just as much as any man.

960
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:21,721
But that doesn't mean that I should
stand for a lot of falderol!

961
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:25,555
By God, I won't stand for it!
Stand for what, Father?

962
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:28,499
That's the one thing I shall not
submit myself to!

963
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,007
Clarence, if a man thinks a certain thing
is wrong, he shouldn't do it!

964
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:36,729
If he thinks it's right,
he should do it!

965
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,444
Now, that has nothing to do with
whether he loves his wife or not!

966
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:42,000
Who says it has, Father?
They do!

967
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:43,611
Who, sir?
Women!

968
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:46,998
They get stirred up and then
they try to get you stirred up too!

969
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:50,444
But don't you let them do it, Clarence!
Don't you let them do it!

970
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:53,777
Now, if you can keep reason
and logic in the argument,

971
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:56,444
well, a man can hold
his own, of course.

972
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:59,444
But if they can switch you,

973
01:00:59,445 --> 01:01:02,264
pretty soon the argument's about
whether you love them or not!

974
01:01:02,265 --> 01:01:05,007
I swear, I don't know how they do it,

975
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:08,230
but don't you let them, Clarence.
Don't you let them!

976
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:12,555
I see what you mean so far, Father.
If you don't watch yourself,

977
01:01:12,556 --> 01:01:14,555
love can make you do a lot of things
you don't want to do.

978
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:16,888
Exactly!
But if you do watch out

979
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:20,481
and know just how to handle women...
Then you'll be all right!

980
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:24,301
All a man has to do is be firm!

981
01:01:24,302 --> 01:01:28,888
You know how sometimes I have
to be firm with your mother.

982
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:32,981
Yes. But Father,
what can you do when they cry?

983
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:40,857
Hmmm, well ahh...
that's quite a question.

984
01:01:40,858 --> 01:01:45,222
You just have to make them understand
that what you're doing is for their good.

985
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:49,683
I see.
Now, Clarence, you know all about women.

986
01:01:56,185 --> 01:01:59,666
But Father...
Yes Clarence?

987
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:02,000
I thought you were going to tell me about...

988
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:05,888
About what?
About women!

989
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:10,444
Clarence, there are some things
gentlemen don't discuss!

990
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:13,261
I've told you all you need to know.

991
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,664
The thing for you to remember is:
be firm.

992
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:50,131
Mary, when you get to Springfield,
the very first thing you...

993
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,361
Oh God!

994
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,363
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

995
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,555
Sit down, Vinnie.
Oh Clare, Cora and Mary are

996
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:09,583
leaving any moment now...
Sit down.

997
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:13,653
Vinnie, you know
I like to live well,

998
01:03:13,654 --> 01:03:15,555
and I want my family
to live well.

999
01:03:15,556 --> 01:03:18,099
But this house must be
run on a business basis!

1000
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,042
I must know how much money
I'm spending and what for!

1001
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:23,000
For instance, if you recall,

1002
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:26,389
a week ago I gave you $6.00
to buy a new coffee pot.

1003
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,000
Yes, because you broke the old one!
You threw it right on the floor!

1004
01:03:30,071 --> 01:03:31,605
I'm not talking about that.

1005
01:03:31,606 --> 01:03:35,000
Now I find here among my...
It was a pity to break that nice coffee pot,

1006
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:37,000
Clare, it was imported from France.

1007
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,666
and that little shop
has stopped selling them.

1008
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:40,696
But what has that...
They said the tariff wouldn't let them.

1009
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:44,272
And that's your fault because
you're always voting to raise the tariff.

1010
01:03:44,273 --> 01:03:47,333
The tariff protects America
against cheap foreign labor.

1011
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:48,390
Now this bill...

1012
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:51,821
The tariff does nothing
but put up the prices

1013
01:03:51,822 --> 01:03:54,422
and that's hard on everybody
especially the farmer.

1014
01:03:54,423 --> 01:03:56,998
Vinnie, I wish to heaven you wouldn't
talk about matters

1015
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,888
you don't know anything about!
I do too know about them!

1016
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:03,666
Miss Guelig says that every intelligent
woman should have some opinion about...

1017
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,333
Who may I ask is Miss Guelig?

1018
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:07,444
She's the current events woman.
I told you about.

1019
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:09,666
And the tickets
are $1 every Tuesday.

1020
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:13,135
Do you mean to tell me that
a pack of idle minded females

1021
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:17,079
pay $1 apiece to hear another female
gavel about the events of the day!?

1022
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,777
Listen to me if you want to know
anything about the events of the day!

1023
01:04:19,778 --> 01:04:22,565
But do you get so excited, Clare!

1024
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:25,666
And besides, Miss Guelig says
that our president,

1025
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:29,000
whom you're always belittling,
prays to God for guidance.

1026
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:33,000
Vinnie, what happened to that $6.00?
What $6.00?

1027
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:38,777
I gave you $6.00
to buy a new coffee pot.

1028
01:04:38,778 --> 01:04:41,555
Now I find that you apparently
got one at Lewis and Congers

1029
01:04:41,556 --> 01:04:43,240
and charged it!
Here's their bill.

1030
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:45,504
One coffee pot - $5.00.

1031
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:49,000
So you owe me a dollar!
And you can hand it right over!

1032
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:50,185
I'll do nothing of the kind!

1033
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,000
What did you do with that $6.00?

1034
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:56,220
Well Clare, I can't tell you now, dear.

1035
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:59,000
Why didn't you ask me at the time?

1036
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:04,000
I give up!
Wait a minute!

1037
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:07,444
I spent $4.50 for
that new umbrella.

1038
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:11,666
Now we're getting somewhere!
One umbrella - $4.50.

1039
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,866
And that must have been in the week
I paid Mrs. Tobin for two extra days washing.

1040
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:15,998
Mrs. Tobin...

1041
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:21,415
Tthat's $2 more.
that makes... that makes up... $6.50.

1042
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:25,200
And that's another 50¢ you owe me!
I don't owe you anything!

1043
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,444
What you owe me is an explanation
of where my money is gone!

1044
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:31,326
I do the best I can
to keep down expenses.

1045
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,555
You know yourself, Cousin Phoebe
spends twice as much as we do.

1046
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,726
Don't talk to me about
your cousin Phoebe!

1047
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:39,527
You talk about your
own relatives enough!

1048
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,688
That's not fair, Vinnie.

1049
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:45,299
When I talk about my relatives,
I criticize them!

1050
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,000
I can't even speak
of Cousin Phoebe!

1051
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:49,555
You can speak of her
all you want to.

1052
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:52,000
But I won't have Cousin Phoebe
or anyone else

1053
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,980
dictating to me
how to run my house!

1054
01:05:53,981 --> 01:05:56,757
I didn't say a word
about her dictating.

1055
01:05:56,758 --> 01:06:03,000
Clare, you know she isn't that...
You said... You said...

1056
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,998
I don't know what you said now!

1057
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:06,888
You never stick to the point!

1058
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:11,168
Now, we're going over this
account book - item by item.

1059
01:06:11,169 --> 01:06:14,444
I find here a bill for $38.

1060
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:17,444
I don't know what you expect of me.

1061
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:22,265
I tire myself out chasing up
and down those stairs all day long,

1062
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:26,444
trying to look after your comfort,
to bring up our children...

1063
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:29,000
I do the mending
and the marketing.

1064
01:06:29,555 --> 01:06:33,000
Now you want me to be
an expert book keeper too!

1065
01:06:42,864 --> 01:06:46,900
Vinnie, I want to
be reasonable. But...

1066
01:06:47,555 --> 01:06:51,555
Can't you understand?
I'm doing all this for your own good.

1067
01:06:57,338 --> 01:07:00,555
Well, I suppose I'll have to go ahead
just paying the bills

1068
01:07:00,556 --> 01:07:03,386
and hoping I've got enough money
in the bank to meet them.

1069
01:07:03,865 --> 01:07:09,444
But it's all very discouraging.
I'll try to do better, Clare.

1070
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:12,649
Well, that's all I'm asking.

1071
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:17,777
Well, I'll it make out the checks
and sign them.

1072
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:23,222
But... maybe I haven't any right
to sign those checks

1073
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:26,000
since in the sight of the Lord
I haven't any name!

1074
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,502
That's right! Clare,
to make those checks good,

1075
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,111
you'll have to be baptized...
right away.

1076
01:07:32,112 --> 01:07:35,567
Vinnie, the bank doesn't care whether
I've been baptized or not.

1077
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:38,553
Well, I care!
And no matter what Dr. Lloyd said,

1078
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,845
I'm not sure we're really married.

1079
01:07:40,846 --> 01:07:43,040
Vinnie, we have four children!

1080
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:46,000
If we're not married now,
we never will be!

1081
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,222
Clare, Dr. Lloyd said this morning...
Ahh, that's all, Vinnie.

1082
01:07:49,555 --> 01:07:52,908
Uhh, I think you better go tell
Whitney to watch for the cab.

1083
01:07:52,998 --> 01:07:57,408
Not before you give me that $1.50.
What $1.50?

1084
01:07:57,444 --> 01:08:01,555
That $1.50 you owe me!
I don't owe you any $1.50!

1085
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:04,000
I gave you money to buy
a coffee pot for me,

1086
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,124
and somehow it turned into
an umbrella for you!

1087
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,971
Why, Clarence Day! What kind
of man are you?

1088
01:08:08,972 --> 01:08:13,242
Quibbling about $1.50 when
your immortal soul is in danger!

1089
01:08:13,243 --> 01:08:16,924
And what's more...
All right! All right! All right!

1090
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,444
Thank you, Clare.

1091
01:08:23,445 --> 01:08:26,243
Now the accounts are
all straight again!

1092
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:48,554
What were you doing down there?

1093
01:08:48,555 --> 01:08:51,666
I'm setting up this new burglar alarm.
I invented it myself.

1094
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:52,920
Have you got any money
you can lend me?

1095
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:54,668
No, you owe me 30¢ now.

1096
01:08:54,669 --> 01:08:56,222
Well, I'll give you
my stamp collection

1097
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:57,998
and my piece of
John Wilkes Booth's finger.

1098
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:00,555
How much?
Enough to get a new suit of clothes.

1099
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:03,111
If you can wait a month till I hear
from the Patent Office in Washington,

1100
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:05,919
I may be rich!
I can't wait that long!

1101
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,020
Maybe I could get it sooner.

1102
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:09,460
I'm gonna look into
something else tomorow.

1103
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:14,888
Wanted. An energetic young man
to sell household necessity.

1104
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,315
Liberal commission.
Apply 312... John, let me have this job!

1105
01:09:18,316 --> 01:09:20,225
Why should I give you my job?
They're hard to get!

1106
01:09:20,226 --> 01:09:22,204
I've got to get
a new suit of clothes.

1107
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:24,287
Maybe I could get the job
for both of us.

1108
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:26,088
I'll ask the man.

1109
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:39,907
The cab's here, Father.
Oh, thank you, Whitney.

1110
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:43,163
Vinnie! Corra!
The cab's here!

1111
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,504
Uhh, John, go up and get their bags.
Yes sir.

1112
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Here's the lunch for the train, sir.

1113
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:54,518
Well, take it out to the cab.

1114
01:09:55,519 --> 01:09:58,226
Who's that one?
It's Ellen. Delia left yesterday.

1115
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,000
I don't know where your mother finds them.

1116
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:03,111
Now Vinnie, don't you let Clare
worry about us.

1117
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:04,111
We have plenty of time.

1118
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:06,444
Ah, take the bags right on out, John.
Yes sir.

1119
01:10:06,445 --> 01:10:08,555
Well goodbye, Clarence.
It was so nice to see you.

1120
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:10,000
Goodbye, Cousin Cora.

1121
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:13,117
Goodbye, Whitney.
Now you be a good boy.

1122
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:15,333
Goodbye, Cousin Cora.
Goodbye, Harlan.

1123
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:16,998
Goodbye. Keep out of mischief.

1124
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:18,555
Come along, everybody.
Don't keep the cab waiting.

1125
01:10:18,556 --> 01:10:19,373
Cabs cost money.

1126
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:23,040
If there's one thing Mr. Day can't stand,
it's to keep a cab waiting.

1127
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,075
If there's any waiting to do,

1128
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:27,000
there's a waiting room at the
Grand Central Depot just for that.

1129
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:31,222
Mary, aren't you even going
to shake hands with me?

1130
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't think I'd better.

1131
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:37,000
You may remember, that when I get too
close to you, you feel contaminated.

1132
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:40,333
Mary, you're going to write to me,
aren't you?

1133
01:10:40,334 --> 01:10:44,333
Are you going to write first?
No, Mary.

1134
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:47,000
There are times when
a man must be firm.

1135
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,000
Mary, Mother says you
better hurry out

1136
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:52,181
before Father starts yelling.
It's Sunday.

1137
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:53,998
Goodbye, John.

1138
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,333
I'm very happy to have made
YOUR acquaintance.

1139
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:57,653
Thank you!

1140
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:01,890
May I help you?
No, thank you.

1141
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:04,077
Take care of yourself.

1142
01:11:04,078 --> 01:11:06,444
Goodbye, Mr. Day.
Goodbye, Mary.

1143
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:08,077
I've had a wonderful time.
Bye bye.

1144
01:11:08,078 --> 01:11:13,645
Goodbye, Cousin Clare.
Goodbye, Cora.

1145
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:33,009
Dear Mary...

1146
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:40,333
My duty toward my neighbor
is to love him as myself

1147
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:45,222
and to do to all men as I
would they should do unto me.

1148
01:11:45,223 --> 01:11:48,190
Has Father gone to the office yet?

1149
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:49,666
Come on,
let's go to the ball field.

1150
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:52,270
I've got to guard this box
till John comes back.

1151
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:53,555
It's his burglar alarm.

1152
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:55,105
It wouldn't work,
so he fixed it.

1153
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:56,523
We're going to put it
back in the dining room

1154
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:59,998
after Father goes to the office.
Are there burglars around?

1155
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,774
Everywhere!
Oh...

1156
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:06,555
...to love, honor, and succor
my father and my mother.

1157
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,555
Why do you have to learn that?

1158
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:10,222
Because if I don't,
I'll go to hell!

1159
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:12,852
Father's going to hell!
He is not!

1160
01:12:12,853 --> 01:12:14,899
Yes he is,
because he isn't baptized!

1161
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,444
He'll go to hell and burn
for a thousand years!

1162
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:19,239
He won't! He won't!

1163
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,295
He'll be in a lake of
fire and brimstone!

1164
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:24,333
And a thousand devils with
pitchforks will be poking at him!

1165
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:27,816
No! No! Mother dont' let...
Father will hear you!

1166
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:33,818
[singing loudly:] ♪ Oh come, all ye faithful,
joyful and triumphant. ♪

1167
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:38,333
Don't smother me!
♪ Oh come, all ye faithful... ♪

1168
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,679
What's that noise?
Just singing, Father.

1169
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,222
You boys, be quiet! You know
your mother isn't feeling well.

1170
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:45,880
Yes, Father.

1171
01:12:55,798 --> 01:12:57,444
What did your mother say?

1172
01:12:57,445 --> 01:13:00,075
She says she doesn't
want any breakfast.

1173
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:02,555
Now, why does your mother
do that to me?

1174
01:13:02,556 --> 01:13:05,887
She knows that it just upsets my day
when she doesn't come down to breakfast.

1175
01:13:05,888 --> 01:13:08,242
A special delivery, sir.
Thank you.

1176
01:13:10,243 --> 01:13:12,443
Where's John this morning?

1177
01:13:12,444 --> 01:13:15,165
John had his breakfast early, Father,
and went out to see about something.

1178
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:16,173
See about what?

1179
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:20,000
Well, John and I thought we'd
work this summer and earn some money.

1180
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,840
Good! Work never hurt anyone.
It's good for them.

1181
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:24,923
But if you're going to work,
work hard.

1182
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,214
King Solomon had the right idea
about work.

1183
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:33,181
"Whatever thy hand findeth to do,"
Solomon said, "Do thy doggonedest!"

1184
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,888
Hmm, well I don't
understand this at all.

1185
01:13:40,889 --> 01:13:43,599
Here's a letter from some woman
I never even heard of!

1186
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:47,666
Oh Father...
Oh God!

1187
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:50,022
What is it, Father?

1188
01:13:50,444 --> 01:13:53,111
This woman claims that
she sat on my lap

1189
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:56,856
and that I didn't like it!
Huh!

1190
01:13:57,857 --> 01:13:58,999
What's that word?

1191
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:02,444
No, that one down there!

1192
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:05,555
It looks like "curiosity".

1193
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:09,745
Oh... "I only opened your letter
as a matter of curiosity."

1194
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:11,999
Huh!
Yes, go on!

1195
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,801
Why, this gets worse and worse!

1196
01:14:15,802 --> 01:14:19,093
It just turns into a lot of
sentimental lovey-dovey mush!

1197
01:14:19,094 --> 01:14:24,593
Ha! If this is someone's idea
of a practical joke...

1198
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:28,555
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1199
01:14:28,556 --> 01:14:30,871
Nothing wrong.
Just a fool letter.

1200
01:14:30,872 --> 01:14:34,059
How are you feeling, Vinnie?
I thought you needed me.

1201
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,000
If you don't,
I'll go back to bed.

1202
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:39,222
On, no no no! Come sit down
and get some food in you.

1203
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:41,111
It'll do you good.
Build up your strength.

1204
01:14:41,112 --> 01:14:43,000
Here, here.
Sit down. Sit down.

1205
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:45,760
Here uh... What's this one's name?
Nora.

1206
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:48,111
Nora, get Mrs. Day some
bacon and eggs.

1207
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:51,976
No, Nora. Bring me a cup
of tea up to my room.

1208
01:14:51,977 --> 01:14:52,990
Yes ma'am.

1209
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:57,116
Oh Vinnie, it's just weak
to give in to an ailment!

1210
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:00,777
I notice when you have a headache,
you yell and groan and swearing enough.

1211
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:03,444
Well, that's to prove to the headache
that I am stronger than it is!

1212
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:05,999
I think I've caught
some kind of germ.

1213
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:09,555
Some of my friends have
had to send for the doctor.

1214
01:15:09,556 --> 01:15:12,000
A doctor!?
Oh poppycock!

1215
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:15,998
But Clare dear, when people are ill,
you have to do something!

1216
01:15:15,999 --> 01:15:17,444
Certainly you have
to do something!

1217
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:19,686
Cheer them up!
That's the way to cure them.

1218
01:15:19,999 --> 01:15:23,111
How would you go about
cheering them up?

1219
01:15:23,112 --> 01:15:29,998
I? Well I'd tell them "Bah!"
[Vinnie crying...]

1220
01:15:30,999 --> 01:15:38,000
Well, what have I done now?
Oh... Oh Clare, hush up!

1221
01:15:42,993 --> 01:15:47,393
Vinnie, I didn't mean
to upset you.

1222
01:15:58,098 --> 01:16:01,732
"Dear Clarence..."

1223
01:16:16,432 --> 01:16:20,535
I... I was just
trying to help you.

1224
01:16:21,111 --> 01:16:23,000
You know,
when you take your bed,

1225
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:26,805
I have a confounded lonely
time around here.

1226
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:29,221
So when I see you getting into your
head that you're not feeling well,

1227
01:16:29,222 --> 01:16:31,688
I want to do something about it.

1228
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:34,000
Just because some of your friends
have given into this,

1229
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:35,444
is no reason why you should
imagine you're ill.

1230
01:16:35,445 --> 01:16:41,703
Clare, stop! Get out of this
house and go to your office.

1231
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:03,111
Did you get the job?

1232
01:17:03,112 --> 01:17:05,010
Yes, for both of us!
Look, I've got with me!

1233
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:06,997
What is it?
Medicine!

1234
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:10,666
Medicine? You took a job for us
to go out and sell medicine?

1235
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:13,927
But it's wonderful medicine.
Look what it cures...

1236
01:17:13,928 --> 01:17:17,809
"A sovereign cure for colds,
coughs, catarrh, asthma,

1237
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:21,087
quinsy, and sore throat,
poor digestion, summer complaint,

1238
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:24,865
colic, dyspepsia, heartburn,
and shortness of breath,

1239
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:28,777
lumbago, rheumatism, heart disease,
giddiness, and women's complaints,

1240
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:33,222
nervous prostration, St. Vitus dance,
jaundice, la grippe, proud flesh,

1241
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:35,226
pink eye, sea sickness, and pimples."

1242
01:17:35,227 --> 01:17:38,666
It's made from a secret formula
known only to Dr. Bartlett.

1243
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,777
We get 25¢ cents commission on
every bottle we sell!

1244
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:44,075
And he's giving us the territory
of all Manhattan Island!

1245
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,888
Well, lots of Father's and Mother's
friends have some of those diseases.

1246
01:17:47,889 --> 01:17:49,555
Let's start out by
calling on them.

1247
01:17:49,556 --> 01:17:54,033
Yes. Oh... What if they ask us
if we use it at our house?

1248
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:57,193
Oh yes, it would be better
if we could say we did.

1249
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:02,888
Excuse me.
Oh, is that the tea for Mrs. Day?

1250
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:05,444
Yes.
Oh, I'll take it up to her.

1251
01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:08,186
Thank you.
Right away now, while it's hot.

1252
01:18:09,555 --> 01:18:11,339
What's the matter with Mother?

1253
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,603
I don't know.
She was just complaining.

1254
01:18:14,604 --> 01:18:20,104
Say! It says here it's good
for women's complaints! Here...

1255
01:18:27,445 --> 01:18:31,702
Yes sir, Chesapeake and Ohio: an eighth.
New York Central: three quarters.

1256
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:34,668
I'd like to see Mr. Day about those
Morris and Essex deposits.

1257
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:37,646
He's very busy this morning.
You'll have to wait.

1258
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:42,998
Where's Father?

1259
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:46,444
Well, Master Whitney,
have you come to pay us a visit?

1260
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:49,703
Where's Father?
He's busy in his office with a customer.

1261
01:18:49,704 --> 01:18:52,001
Master Whitney!

1262
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:56,001
Mr. Day, the president
of the firm is...

1263
01:18:56,002 --> 01:18:58,842
Father, you have to
come home right away!

1264
01:18:58,843 --> 01:19:00,111
What's the meaning of this?

1265
01:19:00,112 --> 01:19:01,666
Who sent you down here?
Your mother?

1266
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:04,999
No sir. Mother's ill.
She's terribly ill.

1267
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:08,446
Did the doctor sent you for me?
No sir. It was Margaret.

1268
01:19:08,447 --> 01:19:09,222
Margaret?

1269
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:13,426
Margaret says you're to come home
right away, and no nonsense!

1270
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,856
Perkins, go down and stop
the first cab you see.

1271
01:19:17,857 --> 01:19:19,998
A cab, sir??
For you, Mr. Day??

1272
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:22,926
Yes, I want a cab
and no nonsense!

1273
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:27,027
I'm sorry, Mr. Hopkins.

1274
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,864
Confound you!
Can't you go any faster?

1275
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:40,149
All right, sir.
Gid-up!

1276
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:47,151
Gid-up there!
You hear me! Gid-up!

1277
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:04,111
Oh doctor. How is Mrs. Day?
She's a pretty sick woman.

1278
01:20:04,153 --> 01:20:07,303
Well what's wrong with her?

1279
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:08,771
Well, do you know?
Or don't you?

1280
01:20:08,772 --> 01:20:10,748
What did Mrs. Day have
for breakfast this morning?

1281
01:20:10,749 --> 01:20:13,658
Not a thing! I tried to get her
to eat something, but she wouldn't.

1282
01:20:13,659 --> 01:20:16,222
I can't understand it.
Understand what?

1283
01:20:16,223 --> 01:20:19,769
These violent attacks of nausea.
It's almost as though she were poisoned.

1284
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,111
Poisoned?
Let me take your cab.

1285
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:24,222
I'll try not to be gone more
than 10 to 15 minutes.

1286
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:26,713
And Mr. Day you are not
to go into her room!

1287
01:20:27,714 --> 01:20:31,555
You'd better get her well!
Right away! Or you'll hear from me!

1288
01:20:31,556 --> 01:20:35,534
Turn west on 27th Street.
Gid-up. Gid-up.

1289
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,035
How is Mother?
I don't know?

1290
01:20:46,036 --> 01:20:49,805
Well she better be good and sick or Father
may be mad at me for getting him up here.

1291
01:20:49,806 --> 01:20:51,906
Especially in a cab.

1292
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,896
Has your father come?
Yes, just now!

1293
01:20:56,897 --> 01:21:00,048
Where are you going, Margaret?
I have to go for the minister.

1294
01:21:06,674 --> 01:21:12,111
I guess the minister's coming to baptize
Father so he won't have to go to hell.

1295
01:21:12,112 --> 01:21:15,666
He can't be baptized in a house.
You've got to have water.

1296
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,888
We have lots of water!
Not the right kind.

1297
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:27,666
Is Mother better, Father?
How can I tell?

1298
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,000
She wouldn't let me
in the room with her.

1299
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:33,551
These confounded doctors never know
what's the matter with anybody!

1300
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,321
Father?
Yes?

1301
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:46,516
Mother's going to get well,
isn't she?

1302
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:48,308
Of course she's going to get well.

1303
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,475
Father, may we come in?
It's lonesome without Mother.

1304
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:59,600
Yes, it is, Harlan.
It's lonesome. Come in, boys.

1305
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:09,212
What have you been doing, Harlan?
Nothing, they won't let me upstairs.

1306
01:22:09,213 --> 01:22:11,446
What about you, Whitney?

1307
01:22:11,447 --> 01:22:14,149
I was supposed to learn
the rest of my catechism.

1308
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:16,802
Will you hear me, Father?

1309
01:22:18,444 --> 01:22:20,413
Yes Whitney,
I'll hear you.

1310
01:22:22,414 --> 01:22:23,999
Start here.

1311
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:28,316
"How many parts are there
in a sacrament?"

1312
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:33,555
Two: the outward visible sign
and the inward spiritual grace.

1313
01:22:33,556 --> 01:22:38,888
"What is the outward visible sign
or form in bap... baptism?"

1314
01:22:38,889 --> 01:22:43,005
Water, wherein the person is
baptized in the name of...

1315
01:22:43,006 --> 01:22:45,956
You haven't been baptized,
have you, Father?

1316
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:48,998
Whitney, what is the
outward visible sign?

1317
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:55,415
Water, wherein the person...
wherein the person...

1318
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:58,561
You don't know it well enough, Whitney.
You'd better go and study it some more.

1319
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:00,555
Do you want me to
read to you, Harlan?

1320
01:23:00,556 --> 01:23:03,491
Father, are they going to
put you into hell?

1321
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:06,226
Whitney, take Harlan with you.

1322
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:08,046
What's the world coming to?
Everybody's sending for doctors.

1323
01:25:08,047 --> 01:25:12,275
Doctors don't do you any good.
Only make you feel worse.

1324
01:25:12,276 --> 01:25:18,422
All poppycock!
[bell rining]

1325
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:22,424
Who's rining that bell?
Stop that noise!

1326
01:25:22,427 --> 01:25:27,428
Stop it, I say! What
idiot's ringing that bell?

1327
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,422
Mr. Day,
we must all be quiet.

1328
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:34,645
Mrs.Day's been ill.
I know she's ill.

1329
01:25:34,646 --> 01:25:36,206
Go up and see if
she needs anything.

1330
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:39,290
What are you doing out of house?
Sent for the minister.

1331
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:40,333
The minister?

1332
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:43,162
He'll be right in.
He's paying off the cab.

1333
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:53,555
I was deeply shocked to learn the
serious nature of Mrs. Day's illness.

1334
01:25:53,556 --> 01:25:55,389
Will you take me up to her?

1335
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,332
She's resting now.
She can't be disturbed.

1336
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,423
The doctor will be
back in a minute.

1337
01:26:00,424 --> 01:26:03,111
Mrs. Day has been a tower
of strength in the parish.

1338
01:26:03,112 --> 01:26:05,555
Everyone liked her so much.

1339
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,431
Yes, she was a fine woman.

1340
01:26:08,432 --> 01:26:11,802
I wish to heaven you wouldn't talk
about Mrs. Day as if she were dead!

1341
01:26:16,222 --> 01:26:18,952
Is the doctor back yet?
No, does she need him?

1342
01:26:18,953 --> 01:26:20,828
Well, she's kind of restless.

1343
01:26:20,829 --> 01:26:22,911
She's talking in her sleep
and twisting and turning.

1344
01:26:22,912 --> 01:26:26,812
[doorbell]

1345
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:38,444
Well doctor, it seems to me
that was a pretty long 10 minutes!

1346
01:26:38,445 --> 01:26:41,000
See here, Mr. Day.
if I'm to handle this case...

1347
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:43,120
How can you handle it
if you're out of the house?

1348
01:26:43,121 --> 01:26:45,134
Who is this?
It's Dr. Somers.

1349
01:26:45,135 --> 01:26:46,368
How do you do?

1350
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:49,266
I felt that Mrs. Day's condition
warranted my getting Dr. Somers here

1351
01:26:49,267 --> 01:26:53,655
as soon as possible for consultation.
I hope that meets with your approval?

1352
01:26:54,163 --> 01:26:59,000
Why yes, of course.
Anything that can be done.

1353
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:02,409
Upstairs, doctor.
Pardon me.

1354
01:27:07,295 --> 01:27:10,111
Mrs. Day is in good hands
now, Mr. Day.

1355
01:27:10,112 --> 01:27:12,773
There's nothing you and I can do
at the moment to help.

1356
01:27:15,999 --> 01:27:19,000
Dr. Lloyd?
Yes?

1357
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:21,489
There's something that's
troubling Mrs. Day's mind.

1358
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:25,000
Oh?
I think you know what I refer to.

1359
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:28,888
Yes. You mean the fact that
you've never been baptized.

1360
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:33,111
Yes, I gathered that you knew about it
from your sermon last Sunday.

1361
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,602
But let's not get angry.

1362
01:27:35,603 --> 01:27:38,719
I think something had
better be done about it.

1363
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,365
Yes, Mr. Day?
When the doctors get through up there,

1364
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:45,998
I want you to talk to Mrs. Day.
I want you to tell her something.

1365
01:27:45,999 --> 01:27:48,540
Well, I'd be glad to!
You're just the man to do it.

1366
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:50,623
She shouldn't be upset about this.

1367
01:27:50,624 --> 01:27:52,916
Now I want you to tell her
that my being baptized

1368
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:55,859
would just be a lot
of confounded nonsense.

1369
01:27:56,222 --> 01:27:57,527
But Mr. Day...

1370
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,345
Oh, she'll take your word
on a thing like that.

1371
01:28:00,346 --> 01:28:02,984
And we both must do everything
we can to help her now.

1372
01:28:02,985 --> 01:28:05,450
But the solution is so simple.

1373
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:08,228
It would take only your
consent to be baptized.

1374
01:28:09,229 --> 01:28:11,318
That's out of the question!

1375
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:15,888
And I'm surprised that a grown man
like you would suggest such a thing!

1376
01:28:24,347 --> 01:28:27,980
Well doctor, how is she?
What have you decided?

1377
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:30,937
Is there a room we could
use for our consultation?

1378
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:34,722
Oh yes, my library.
Doctor...

1379
01:28:34,723 --> 01:28:37,000
Dr. Somers,
this isn't serious is it?

1380
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:39,965
After we've had our consultation,
we'll talk to you, Mr. Day.

1381
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:42,118
But surely...
Rest assured,

1382
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:45,307
Dr. Somers will do everything
that is humanly possible.

1383
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:48,023
We'll try not to be long.

1384
01:29:04,634 --> 01:29:11,598
Tell me, this Dr. -uh- Somers,
he's very highly thought of, isn't he?

1385
01:29:11,599 --> 01:29:13,000
Oh yes.

1386
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:17,362
But if Vinnie is seriously...
If anyone could help her, he could.

1387
01:29:17,363 --> 01:29:20,555
Don't you think?
Very fine physician.

1388
01:29:21,999 --> 01:29:25,998
But there is a greater help,
ever-present in the hour of need.

1389
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:29,988
Let us turn to him,
in prayer.

1390
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:34,398
Let us kneel and pray.

1391
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:41,774
Let us kneel and pray.

1392
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:53,211
Oh Lord, look down
from heaven.

1393
01:29:53,212 --> 01:29:57,555
Behold, visit, and relieve
this thy servant

1394
01:29:57,556 --> 01:30:00,052
who is grieved
with sickness.

1395
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:02,444
Have mercy on her,
oh Lord.

1396
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:05,385
Have mercy on
this miserable sinner.

1397
01:30:05,386 --> 01:30:08,000
Forgive her, and
extend thy accustomed...

1398
01:30:08,001 --> 01:30:10,261
She's not a miserable sinner,
and you know it!

1399
01:30:10,262 --> 01:30:13,666
Oh God! You know Vinnie
is not a miserable sinner!

1400
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:14,844
She's a fine woman!

1401
01:30:14,845 --> 01:30:16,844
She shouldn't be
made to suffer!

1402
01:30:16,845 --> 01:30:18,997
It's got to stop, I tell you!
It's got to stop!

1403
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:22,123
Have mercy, I say!
Have mercy, I tell you!

1404
01:30:22,124 --> 01:30:24,555
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1405
01:30:24,556 --> 01:30:27,507
Vinnie! Vinnie, what are you
doing down here?

1406
01:30:27,508 --> 01:30:30,109
You shouldn't be out of bed!
You get right back upstairs!

1407
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:32,991
I heard you call.
Do you need me?

1408
01:30:32,992 --> 01:30:35,977
Vinnie, I know now
how much I need you.

1409
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:39,666
Get well, Vinnie. I'll be baptized.
I promise. I'll be baptized.

1410
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,998
You will?
I'll do anything.

1411
01:30:41,999 --> 01:30:45,444
Oh Clare!
We'll go to Europe, just we two.

1412
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:50,402
You won't have to worry about the children
or the household accounts or... Vinnie!

1413
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:57,159
Don't worry, Mr. Day.
She'll be all right now.

1414
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,555
Bless you for what you've done!
What did I do?

1415
01:30:59,556 --> 01:31:01,666
You promised
to be baptized.

1416
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:04,827
I did?!
Oh God!

1417
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:46,000
Isn't it drafty here, Mother?
Shall I get your coat, Mother?

1418
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:49,222
No thank you.
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.

1419
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:52,111
Come on now. Let's stay together.
Harlan, don't you get lost again.

1420
01:31:52,112 --> 01:31:55,231
Aren't the hats lovely this year?

1421
01:31:55,232 --> 01:31:57,766
Ostrich feathers!

1422
01:31:57,767 --> 01:32:00,000
You wouldn't wear that hat,
would you, Mother?

1423
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:04,773
Well, I think that's very pretty.
I think they're all pretty.

1424
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:07,961
Well, I do need some
pink silk thread.

1425
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:15,461
Oh, isn't this applique beautiful?
Just arrived from Paris, madam.

1426
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:18,169
It's charming.
What are you looking for, Mother?

1427
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:20,220
Oh, I'm just shopping.

1428
01:32:22,288 --> 01:32:25,788
I think I just take a plain one.
But this is the very latest.

1429
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:28,274
We've only had them
in a few days.

1430
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:29,825
Remember, Mother,
this is your first day out.

1431
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:31,000
You mustn't get too tired.

1432
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:33,555
No, I'm saving myself, dear.
I have to.

1433
01:32:33,556 --> 01:32:35,275
Cousin Cora's coming tomorrow.

1434
01:32:35,276 --> 01:32:37,275
She is?
Does Father know about it?

1435
01:32:37,276 --> 01:32:39,011
Not yet.
Is Mary coming too?

1436
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,032
Yes, dear.
Harlan, don't touch things.

1437
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:44,824
I'll bet you knew it.
No, honest I didn't, not tomorrow.

1438
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:48,455
Aren't the sleeves a little long?
It fits right

1439
01:32:48,456 --> 01:32:50,755
across the shoulders.
Now, about the sleeves...

1440
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:54,206
Do we have any more of this material?
Yes, we do. Thank you.

1441
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,706
This one is genuine
imitation Dresden,

1442
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:03,998
the original design
by Duriet.

1443
01:33:03,999 --> 01:33:06,222
John, isn't this
the darlingest thing?

1444
01:33:06,223 --> 01:33:08,005
It's exactly what
I've always wanted.

1445
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:09,666
How much is this
lovely pug dog?

1446
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:13,222
$15, ma'am.
$15! Gee whiz, Mother.

1447
01:33:13,223 --> 01:33:16,000
We could buy a real
live bloodhound for $5.

1448
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:18,888
Oh, isn't he perfectly adorable?

1449
01:33:19,555 --> 01:33:23,000
Oh, I shouldn't.
I know I shouldn't.

1450
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:28,000
Mrs. Day!
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.

1451
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:29,874
How nice to see you.
Are you quite recovered?

1452
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:31,998
Almost.
This is my first day out.

1453
01:33:31,999 --> 01:33:34,111
We've missed you at the church.
You remember Mr. Morley.

1454
01:33:34,112 --> 01:33:35,555
How do you do, Mrs. Day?
How do you do?

1455
01:33:35,556 --> 01:33:38,111
Mr. Morley preached the
Sunday Dr. Lloyd was ill.

1456
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:42,848
Oh yes! I can't tell you
how much I enjoyed your sermon.

1457
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:44,555
Even my husband
enjoyed your sermon.

1458
01:33:44,556 --> 01:33:47,028
We've just come from the board
meeting of the foreign missions.

1459
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:48,555
I'm taking Mr. Morley
home to lunch.

1460
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,980
I had to drop in here to pick up
a purchase. I won't be a minute.

1461
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,555
Is your parish in the city?

1462
01:33:54,556 --> 01:33:57,208
Yes, it's on the outskirts.
My church is in Audubon Park.

1463
01:33:57,209 --> 01:33:58,888
Oh, way up there.

1464
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:00,998
Oh, are you acquainted
in Audubon Park?

1465
01:34:00,999 --> 01:34:03,523
No, I don't believe
we know a soul there.

1466
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:11,666
Mr. Morley,
would this be possible?

1467
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:13,777
My husband, Mr. Day...

1468
01:34:13,778 --> 01:34:16,918
If we lower the collar,
it'll be a very fine fit.

1469
01:34:16,919 --> 01:34:19,222
You won't find a better suit
of clothes in the city for $15.

1470
01:34:19,223 --> 01:34:21,888
Oh, it's not the price.
It's the money.

1471
01:34:22,999 --> 01:34:25,349
Thank you for holding it for me.
You're welcome.

1472
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:29,425
Goodbye, Mrs. Day.
I hope we meet again soon.

1473
01:34:29,426 --> 01:34:32,000
Goodbye. It was very pleasant
meeting you again.

1474
01:34:32,001 --> 01:34:33,555
I think it was
divine providence.

1475
01:34:33,556 --> 01:34:36,000
I shall be delighted
to be of service.

1476
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:37,572
Goodbye, Mr. Morley.
Goodbye.

1477
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:39,673
May I work it?

1478
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:44,371
Oh no. It's against the rules.
Whee...

1479
01:34:59,372 --> 01:35:01,607
Hello.

1480
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:05,607
What did you bring home
more medicine for?

1481
01:35:05,608 --> 01:35:07,111
Dr. Bartlett paid us off,
didn't he?

1482
01:35:07,112 --> 01:35:10,094
Oh yes.
Oh jiminy, you scared me.

1483
01:35:10,095 --> 01:35:12,666
I've got to take $15
right down to McCreery's.

1484
01:35:12,667 --> 01:35:14,000
I bought a suit there
this morning and

1485
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:16,407
I said I'd have the
money this afternoon.

1486
01:35:16,408 --> 01:35:18,111
Gee, that's too bad.
What's too bad?

1487
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,444
Well...
Well, you see, Clarence...

1488
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:23,444
What?
Dr. Bartlett paid us off in medicine.

1489
01:35:23,445 --> 01:35:24,888
Oh god!

1490
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:27,333
Well, he thanked us too
for our services to mankind.

1491
01:35:27,334 --> 01:35:29,199
But my suit!
I've got to have it tomorrow!

1492
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,777
And besides,
they're making the alterations.

1493
01:35:30,778 --> 01:35:32,222
I've got to have $15!

1494
01:35:32,223 --> 01:35:34,859
Maybe you could offer them
15 bottles of medicine.

1495
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:37,870
Oh, they wouldn't take it.
McCreery's don't sell medicine!

1496
01:35:38,555 --> 01:35:40,423
Father!

1497
01:35:41,424 --> 01:35:43,888
Vinnie!
I'm home!

1498
01:35:43,889 --> 01:35:47,444
Good afternoon, sir.
How's your mother, Clarence?

1499
01:35:47,445 --> 01:35:49,222
Oh, the ride this morning
did her a lot of good.

1500
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:51,222
She'll be well enough to go
to church with us next Sunday.

1501
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:52,059
Ah, fine!

1502
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:56,583
Father, have you noticed I haven't
been kneeling down in church lately?

1503
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:57,517
Don't let your mother catch you at it.

1504
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:59,916
Then, I have to have a new
suit of clothes right away.

1505
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:01,000
That doesn't make sense.

1506
01:36:01,001 --> 01:36:03,222
I can't do anything in your
clothes that you wouldn't do!

1507
01:36:03,223 --> 01:36:05,665
Well, if my old clothes
make you behave yourself,

1508
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:06,998
I don't think you ought
to wear anything else!

1509
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:09,542
Oh no! You're you, and I'm me!
I'm want to be myself!

1510
01:36:09,543 --> 01:36:12,553
I mean, suppose I should want to
kneel down in front of a girl.

1511
01:36:12,554 --> 01:36:14,646
Why in heaven's name should you
want to do a thing like that?

1512
01:36:14,647 --> 01:36:16,930
Well, I've got to propose
to a girl sometime.

1513
01:36:16,931 --> 01:36:18,437
Clarence!
Oh, not right away.

1514
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:20,608
But for $15, I can
get a good suit of clothes.

1515
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,555
Clarence, you're beginning
to talk as crazy as your mo...

1516
01:36:23,556 --> 01:36:26,514
...Hello, Vinnie.
You're feeling better today, huh?

1517
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,600
Much better.
Thank you, Clare.

1518
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:32,522
You don't have to hurry home
from the office every day like this.

1519
01:36:32,523 --> 01:36:34,000
Uh, with business the way it is,

1520
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:35,999
there's no use going
to the office at all.

1521
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,536
Yes, you do look better, Vinnie.
What did you do today?

1522
01:36:38,537 --> 01:36:41,555
Well, I got a carriage
and took the boys for a ride.

1523
01:36:41,556 --> 01:36:43,298
And we stopped in at McCreery's.

1524
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:48,112
And, oh Clare, I have the
most wonderful news for you.

1525
01:36:48,113 --> 01:36:52,279
Who do you think I met?
Mr. Morley.

1526
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,980
Morley?
Never heard of him?

1527
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:57,904
Remember, that nice young minister who
substituted for Dr. Lloyd one Sunday.

1528
01:36:57,905 --> 01:37:01,238
Oh yes.
Bright young fellow.

1529
01:37:01,239 --> 01:37:03,998
Preached a good sensible sermon,
short one too.

1530
01:37:03,999 --> 01:37:05,794
Ought to be more
ministers like him.

1531
01:37:05,795 --> 01:37:08,345
Well Clare, his parish
is in Audubon Park.

1532
01:37:08,346 --> 01:37:10,038
You know,
way up above Harlem.

1533
01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:13,629
Nobody knows you up there.
You'll be perfectly safe.

1534
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:16,798
Safe? Vinnie, what the devil
are you talking about?

1535
01:37:16,799 --> 01:37:18,850
I've gone all over
everything with Mr. Morley.

1536
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:20,666
And he's agreed
to baptize you.

1537
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,998
Oh, he has!

1538
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:25,935
Hehe, the young whippersnapper!
Very nice of him.

1539
01:37:25,936 --> 01:37:27,701
We can go up there any morning.

1540
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:29,666
We don't even have
to make an appointment.

1541
01:37:29,667 --> 01:37:32,072
Who said I was going
to be baptized at all?

1542
01:37:32,073 --> 01:37:36,358
Why Clare! You did!
Now Vinnie...

1543
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:39,754
You gave me your promise,
your sacred promise!

1544
01:37:39,755 --> 01:37:42,444
You said: I'll be baptized.
I promise I'll be baptized.

1545
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:44,000
Well, what if I did?

1546
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:47,677
Clare! Aren't you a
man of your word?

1547
01:37:48,678 --> 01:37:51,812
Vinnie, we all thought
you were dying!

1548
01:37:51,813 --> 01:37:54,573
So naturally, I said that
to cheer you up!

1549
01:37:54,574 --> 01:37:57,109
As a matter of fact, the doctor
told me that's what cured you!

1550
01:37:57,110 --> 01:38:00,888
So it seems to me pretty ungrateful of
you to press this matter any further.

1551
01:38:00,889 --> 01:38:03,789
My being well has
nothing to do with it.

1552
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:07,190
You gave me your word!
You gave the Lord your word!

1553
01:38:07,191 --> 01:38:09,555
And you're going to march
yourself up to Mr. Morley's church

1554
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:12,036
some morning before you go to
the office and be christened!

1555
01:38:12,037 --> 01:38:14,991
If you think for one minute I'm...
What in the name of heaven is that?

1556
01:38:14,992 --> 01:38:16,998
If you think I'm going
to let you add the sin

1557
01:38:16,999 --> 01:38:18,777
of breaking your
solemn and sacred promise...

1558
01:38:18,778 --> 01:38:21,777
I demand to know what
that repulsive object is?

1559
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:24,666
It's perfectly plain what it is.
It's a pug dog.

1560
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:27,888
What is it going in this house?
I wanted it and I bought it.

1561
01:38:27,889 --> 01:38:32,645
You spent good money for that?
Clare don't try to change the subject.

1562
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:35,097
How much did you pay
for that atrocity?

1563
01:38:35,098 --> 01:38:37,888
I didn't pay anything for it.
I charged it.

1564
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:39,666
Charged it!
I might have known!

1565
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:41,402
How much was it?
$15.

1566
01:38:41,403 --> 01:38:44,777
$15?
For that eyesore?

1567
01:38:44,778 --> 01:38:47,998
Don't you call this lovely
work of art an eyesore!

1568
01:38:47,999 --> 01:38:50,312
It will look beautiful
sitting on a red cushion

1569
01:38:50,313 --> 01:38:52,466
by the fireplace
in the living room.

1570
01:38:52,467 --> 01:38:54,236
If that sits in the living room,
I won't!

1571
01:38:54,237 --> 01:38:57,216
Furthermore, I don't even want it
in the same house with me!

1572
01:38:57,217 --> 01:38:58,666
Get it out of here!

1573
01:38:58,667 --> 01:39:02,779
Clare, you're not going
to get out of this room

1574
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:04,897
until you set
a date for your baptism!

1575
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:06,146
I'll tell you one thing.

1576
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:10,997
I'll never be baptized as long as that
hideous monstrosity is in this house!

1577
01:39:12,932 --> 01:39:16,555
All right!
All right!

1578
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,832
Clarence...

1579
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:24,222
That pug dog goes
back this afternoon

1580
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:25,998
and he's chrisrened
first in the morning!

1581
01:39:25,999 --> 01:39:27,473
You heard him,
didn't you, Clarence?

1582
01:39:27,474 --> 01:39:29,555
You heard him say that
he'd be baptized

1583
01:39:29,556 --> 01:39:31,726
as soon as I got this pug dog
out of the house.

1584
01:39:31,727 --> 01:39:33,888
You hurry right back
to McCreery's with it

1585
01:39:33,889 --> 01:39:36,444
and be sure they
credit us with $15.

1586
01:39:36,445 --> 01:39:38,419
Oh Mother, while we
were at McCreery's,

1587
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,333
I happened to see a suit
I'd like very much.

1588
01:39:40,334 --> 01:39:41,553
And the suit was only $15.

1589
01:39:41,554 --> 01:39:44,222
Well Clarence, I'm afraid
your suit will have to wait

1590
01:39:44,223 --> 01:39:46,000
until after I
get your father christened.

1591
01:39:46,001 --> 01:39:48,919
Well no, I meant that since the suit
cost just the same as the pug dog,

1592
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,933
If I exchanged the
pug dog for the suit...

1593
01:39:51,934 --> 01:39:56,111
Why yes! Then the suit wouldn't
cost your father anything!

1594
01:39:56,114 --> 01:40:00,205
Why, how bright of you, Clarence,
to think of that!

1595
01:40:00,206 --> 01:40:01,975
I'd better start right away
before McCreery's closes.

1596
01:40:01,976 --> 01:40:03,998
Yes.
Now let's see.

1597
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:07,824
If we're going to take your father
all the way to Audubon Park...

1598
01:40:07,825 --> 01:40:10,672
Clarence, on your way back,
you stop at the livery stable

1599
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:13,444
and tell them to have a cab here
at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.

1600
01:40:13,445 --> 01:40:15,111
Mother! A cab!
Do you think you ought to?

1601
01:40:15,112 --> 01:40:17,000
We can't walk all
the way to Audubon Park!

1602
01:40:17,001 --> 01:40:18,267
But you know what
a cab does to Father.

1603
01:40:18,268 --> 01:40:21,004
This is a very important occasion.
All right.

1604
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:23,998
Get one of their best cabs,
the kind they use at funerals.

1605
01:40:23,999 --> 01:40:26,959
But those cost $2 an hour!
And if Father gets mad...

1606
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,650
Well, if your father starts to argue
in the morning, you remember...

1607
01:40:29,651 --> 01:40:31,401
Oh he agreed to it.
We both heard him.

1608
01:40:36,412 --> 01:40:41,076
I hope you notice,
Clarence is returning the pug dog.

1609
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:43,018
Well, that's a sign you're
getting your faculties back!

1610
01:40:43,019 --> 01:40:48,952
Don't dawdle, Clarence.

1611
01:40:56,687 --> 01:41:00,277
♪ Come to me,
sweet Marie. ♪

1612
01:41:00,278 --> 01:41:04,222
♪ Not because your face is fair,

1613
01:41:04,223 --> 01:41:06,498

1616
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,222
Oh, uh - on the way uptown,
I stopped in at

1617
01:41:23,223 --> 01:41:26,444
Tiffany's and bought you
a little something.

1618
01:41:26,445 --> 01:41:28,112
Thought you might like it.

1619
01:41:28,113 --> 01:41:33,555
Clare!
What a beautiful ring!

1620
01:41:33,556 --> 01:41:37,000
Well, I'm glad
it pleases you.

1621
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:39,869
Oh Clare!
How sweet of you!

1622
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:43,403
I don't know how
to thank you!

1623
01:41:43,404 --> 01:41:45,444
Well, it's thanks
enough for me

1624
01:41:45,445 --> 01:41:47,000
just to have you
up and around again.

1625
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:49,998
You know when you're ill, Vinnie,
this house is like a tomb!

1626
01:41:49,999 --> 01:41:52,515
There's no excitement.

1627
01:41:52,516 --> 01:41:54,777
That's the loveliest ring
you ever bought me.

1628
01:41:54,778 --> 01:41:59,022
Now that I have this, you
needn't buy me any more rings.

1629
01:41:59,023 --> 01:42:01,203
Well, if you don't want any more.

1630
01:42:01,204 --> 01:42:03,794
What I'd really like now
is a nice diamond necklace.

1631
01:42:05,803 --> 01:42:09,863
Vinnie, do you know how much
a diamond necklace costs?

1632
01:42:09,864 --> 01:42:10,666
Yes, I know, Clare.

1633
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,222
But don't you see,
your getting me this

1634
01:42:12,223 --> 01:42:14,113
shows I mean a little
something to you.

1635
01:42:14,114 --> 01:42:16,301
Now a diamond necklace...
Good heaven!

1636
01:42:16,302 --> 01:42:18,777
If you don't know by this
time how I feel about you...

1637
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,111
Well we've been married
for 20 years!

1638
01:42:21,112 --> 01:42:23,357
And I've loved you
every minute of it!

1639
01:42:24,358 --> 01:42:26,025
What did you say, Clare?

1640
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:28,444
I said we've been
married for 20 years

1641
01:42:28,445 --> 01:42:30,767
and I've loved you
every minute of it.

1642
01:42:30,768 --> 01:42:33,238
But if I have to buy out jewelry
stores to prove it...

1643
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,555
If I haven't shown it to you
in my words and actions...

1644
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:37,566
Well, I might as well...

1645
01:42:38,567 --> 01:42:41,531
Well, what have I done now?

1646
01:42:41,532 --> 01:42:44,531
It's all right, Clare.

1647
01:42:44,532 --> 01:42:48,666
I'm just so happy.
Happy?

1648
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,553
You said you loved me.

1649
01:42:52,554 --> 01:42:56,636
And this beautiful ring, that's
something else I didn't expect.

1650
01:42:56,637 --> 01:43:00,666
Oh Clare.
I love surprises.

1651
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:06,000
That's another thing I've never
understood about you, Vinnie.

1652
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:08,000
Now I like to know
what to expect,

1653
01:43:08,001 --> 01:43:10,316
Then I'm prepared to meet it.
Yes, I know, Clare.

1654
01:43:10,317 --> 01:43:13,555
But life would be pretty dull
if we always knew what was coming.

1655
01:43:13,556 --> 01:43:15,888
Well, it's certainly
not dull around here!

1656
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,998
In this house,
you never know

1657
01:43:17,999 --> 01:43:20,318
what's going to hit you
tomorrow! Hehehe.

01:44:27,245 --> 01:44:32,911
Well then, Harlan,
the very...

1669
01:44:32,912 --> 01:44:34,148
Who are you?
What's your name?

1670
01:44:34,149 --> 01:44:37,000
Margaret, sir.
Can't be Margaret.

1671
01:44:37,001 --> 01:44:38,703
We've got one Margaret
in the house.

1672
01:44:38,704 --> 01:44:41,444
At home,
they call me Maggie, sir.

1673
01:44:41,445 --> 01:44:43,058
All right, Maggie.

1674
01:44:43,059 --> 01:44:46,058
If her name's Margaret,
that's a good sign.

1675
01:44:46,059 --> 01:44:49,176
Maybe she'll stay a while.
Hehehe...

1676
01:44:49,177 --> 01:44:50,555
Do you know, boys,
your mother used

1677
01:44:50,556 --> 01:44:53,516
to be just the same about
cooks as she is about maids.

1678
01:44:53,517 --> 01:44:55,670
Never could keep them
for some reason.

1679
01:44:55,671 --> 01:45:00,426
Well, one day about...uh
14 years ago...

1680
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:02,718
Yes, it was right after
you were born, John.

1681
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:06,406
My, you were a homely baby!
Hehehe...

1682
01:45:12,407 --> 01:45:14,408
Thank you, Margaret.

1683
01:45:15,407 --> 01:45:19,067
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Mother.

1684
01:45:19,068 --> 01:45:21,067
Good morning, Clare.
Morning, Vinnie.

1685
01:45:21,068 --> 01:45:23,778
Why, you look as though
you were dressed for a wedding.

1686
01:45:23,915 --> 01:45:25,768
Do I, dear?
Yes.

1687
01:45:25,769 --> 01:45:27,859
Have a good night?
Yes, thank you, Clare.

1688
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,893
Sit down, Vinnie.
Sit down, boys.

1689
01:45:34,111 --> 01:45:35,895
Oh, thank you, Clarence.

1690
01:45:36,222 --> 01:45:39,706
Well, seems to me everyone's
all dressed up this morning.

1691
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:42,519
What's on the program
for this fine day?

1692
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Well, this afternoon,
May Lewis' mother

1693
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:48,555
is giving a party for everyone
in May's dancing class.

1694
01:45:48,556 --> 01:45:51,436
Harlan's going to that.
I don't want to go, Mama.

1695
01:45:51,437 --> 01:45:55,222
Harlan! Don't you want to go to a
party and get ice cream and cake?

1696
01:45:55,223 --> 01:46:00,204
May Lewis always tries to kiss me!
hehehe...

1697
01:46:00,205 --> 01:46:01,222
When you get a little older,

1698
01:46:01,223 --> 01:46:03,513
you won't object to girls
wanting to kiss you...

1699
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:08,548
Will he, Clarence?
hehehe

1700
01:46:10,111 --> 01:46:12,782
This is for you, Mr. Day.
Where shall I put it?

1701
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:15,000
Oh, that's for me, I think.
Take it upstairs, Maggie.

1702
01:46:15,001 --> 01:46:17,411
Wait a minute, Maggie.
Bring it here. Let me see it.

1703
01:46:17,423 --> 01:46:19,666
See! It's for me, Father:
Clarence Day Jr.

1704
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:22,111
Let me look.
Well, that's from McCreery's.

1705
01:46:22,112 --> 01:46:24,000
It's marked: Charge!
What is it?

1706
01:46:24,001 --> 01:46:26,333
Clare, it's all right.
It's nothing for you to worry about.

1707
01:46:26,334 --> 01:46:28,771
Well, at least I think I should know
what's being charged to me.

1708
01:46:28,772 --> 01:46:30,889
What is it?
Clare, stop your fussing.

1709
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,666
It's a new suit of
clothes for Clarence

1710
01:46:32,667 --> 01:46:35,188
and it isn't costing
you a penny.

1711
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:40,222
It's marked: Charge $15.
It's costing me $15!

1712
01:46:40,223 --> 01:46:43,111
And I told Clarence...
Clare, can't you take my word?

1713
01:46:43,112 --> 01:46:45,154
It isn't costing you a penny!

1714
01:46:45,155 --> 01:46:47,931
I'd like to have you
explain why it isn't!

1715
01:46:47,932 --> 01:46:52,556
Because Clarence took the pug dog back
and got the suit instead!

1716
01:46:52,557 --> 01:46:55,027
Of course, and they'll
charge me $15 for the suit.

1717
01:46:55,028 --> 01:46:56,279
Nonsense, Clare.

1718
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,431
We gave them the pug dog for
the suit. Don't you see?

1719
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:00,998
Then they'll charge me $15
for the pug dog.

1720
01:47:00,999 --> 01:47:04,119
But Clare, they can't!
We haven't got the pug dog!

1721
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:12,000
We sent that back!
Well... Hmm... But...

1722
01:47:13,001 --> 01:47:20,087
Well now, wait a minute, Vinnie.
The suit...

1723
01:47:20,088 --> 01:47:23,211
Well, there's something
wrong with your reasoning!

1724
01:47:23,212 --> 01:47:25,998
Well, Clare!
I'm surprised at you!

1725
01:47:25,999 --> 01:47:28,222
And you're supposed to be
so good at figures!

1726
01:47:28,223 --> 01:47:30,296
Why, it's perfectly
clear to me!

1727
01:47:30,297 --> 01:47:32,766
Vinnie, they're going to charge
me for one thing or the other!

1728
01:47:32,767 --> 01:47:34,734
Don't you let them!

1729
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,222
Haa...

1730
01:47:40,223 --> 01:47:42,222
Well, McCreery's aren't
giving away suits,

1731
01:47:42,223 --> 01:47:44,198
and they aren't
giving away pug dogs.

1732
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:46,212
Why, it should be
clear to a child,

1733
01:47:46,213 --> 01:47:52,407
that if Clarence sent the
pug dog back, they... Well...

1734
01:47:54,408 --> 01:47:56,998
I will not have that
botanical freak in this room!

1735
01:47:57,222 --> 01:48:00,504
John! Have you been going around
this town selling medicine?

1736
01:48:00,505 --> 01:48:02,777
Yes, Mother.
Dog medicine?

1737
01:48:02,778 --> 01:48:04,998
No, Mother.
Not dog medicine.

1738
01:48:04,999 --> 01:48:08,777
This letter from Mrs. Sprague says you
sold her a bottle of this medicine

1739
01:48:08,778 --> 01:48:13,000
and that her little boy gave some of
it to their dog and it killed him.

1740
01:48:13,333 --> 01:48:15,616
Now she wants $10 from us
for a new dog

1741
01:48:15,888 --> 01:48:18,083
Here, let me see that letter.

1742
01:48:18,084 --> 01:48:20,956
Well, he shouldn't have given it
to a dog. It's for humans.

1743
01:48:20,957 --> 01:48:24,327
Why, it's Bartlett's Beneficent Balm,
made from a secret formula.

1744
01:48:24,328 --> 01:48:26,568
Have you been going
around among our friends

1745
01:48:26,569 --> 01:48:28,568
and neighbors selling 
some patent nostrum?

1746
01:48:28,569 --> 01:48:31,477
But it's good medicine, Father.
I can prove that by Mother.

1747
01:48:31,478 --> 01:48:34,428
Vinnie, what do you know about this?
Well, nothing, Clare.

1748
01:48:34,429 --> 01:48:37,444
But I'm sure John...
No, I mean that day Mother was...

1749
01:48:37,445 --> 01:48:39,555
That's enough!
You're going to every house

1750
01:48:39,556 --> 01:48:42,000
where you sold a bottle of that
concoction and buy it all back!

1751
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:45,819
But it's a dollar a bottle!
I don't care how much it is.

1752
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:48,561
Here.
I'll give you the money now.

1753
01:48:48,562 --> 01:48:49,555
How many bottles did you sell?

1754
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:53,180
128...
128?!

1755
01:48:53,181 --> 01:48:56,444
Clare, I always told you John
would make a good businessman!

1756
01:48:57,555 --> 01:49:00,819
Young man, you'll have to come
down to my office with me.

1757
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:03,639
I'll give you the money to
buy back that medicine.

1758
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:07,555
$128, and $10 more
for Mrs. Sprague's dog.

1759
01:49:07,556 --> 01:49:10,136
That's $138.
Thank you, Vinnie.

1760
01:49:10,137 --> 01:49:12,078
But it's all coming out
of your allowance!

1761
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:15,929
That means that you'll not get another
penny until the whole $138 is paid up!

1762
01:49:18,787 --> 01:49:21,771
I'll be 21 years old!

1763
01:49:24,772 --> 01:49:26,333
Oh God!

1764
01:49:26,334 --> 01:49:28,754
What the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1765
01:49:36,777 --> 01:49:40,266
Those gypsies are back!
Don't anyone answer the door!

1766
01:49:40,267 --> 01:49:42,998
They're moving in on us again,
bag and baggage!

1767
01:49:42,999 --> 01:49:45,610
I won't have it, I tell you!
I won't have it!

1768
01:49:45,611 --> 01:49:47,669
Now Clare...

1769
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:49,000
Don't let them in!

1770
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:50,671
Clare, hush up.
They'll hear you.

1771
01:49:50,672 --> 01:49:53,222
Tell them to get back in that cab
and drive right on to Ohio!

1772
01:49:53,223 --> 01:49:55,666
As if we could turn
our own relatives away!

1773
01:49:55,667 --> 01:49:59,111
They're extravagant enough to take cabs
when horse cars run right by our door.

1774
01:49:59,112 --> 01:50:02,777
Now, you be quiet and behave yourself!
John, come help with the baggage.

1775
01:50:02,778 --> 01:50:05,000
Why do they always have to pounce
on us without any warning?

1776
01:50:05,001 --> 01:50:09,707
Shhhh!
Cora! Mary!

1777
01:50:09,708 --> 01:50:12,455
Well, it's so good to
have you back again!

1778
01:50:12,456 --> 01:50:14,333
How are you, Vinnie?
We've been so worried about you.

1779
01:50:14,334 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, I'm fine now.
Did you have fun in Springfield?

1780
01:50:17,001 --> 01:50:18,555
Oh, it was wonderful.

1781
01:50:18,556 --> 01:50:22,444
John, my! You're still growing!
Thank you, Cousin Cora.

1782
01:50:22,445 --> 01:50:24,555
John, go get their baggage.
There's Whitney.

1783
01:50:24,556 --> 01:50:27,888
Whitney, how are you. darling?
Fine, thank you.

1784
01:50:27,889 --> 01:50:30,004
And little Harlan.

1785
01:50:30,005 --> 01:50:33,004
Have you been a good boy?
No...

1786
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:36,136
Clare,
the girls are here.

1787
01:50:36,137 --> 01:50:39,138
Cousin Clare!
Here we are again!

1788
01:50:39,888 --> 01:50:42,111
My my!
It's so nice to be back!

1789
01:50:42,112 --> 01:50:43,777
How do you do, Mr. Day?
How do you do?

1790
01:50:43,778 --> 01:50:45,666
Come in sit down and
have some breakfast with us.

1791
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:47,222
Oh, we had breakfast
at the depot.

1792
01:50:47,223 --> 01:50:49,050
Well, we've practically
finished ours.

1793
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:52,666
I haven't finished my breakfast!
Well then, sit down, Clare!

1794
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:55,725
Come have a cup of coffee anyway.
Mary, sit over there.

1795
01:50:55,777 --> 01:50:59,054
Cora...
Maggie, clear those places.

1796
01:50:59,055 --> 01:51:01,000
My my!
This seems so natural.

1797
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:03,471
Clare, don't let your
kippers get cold!

1798
01:51:03,472 --> 01:51:06,111
Maggie, serve some coffee.
Yes ma'am.

1799
01:51:06,112 --> 01:51:07,760
Where's Clarence?

1800
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:11,666
He must be upstairs moving his things
so you can have his room again.

1801
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:13,888
Oh oh Vinnie,
we can't stay overnight.

1802
01:51:13,889 --> 01:51:17,666
Grandpa Evans has been failing very fast,
and that's why I have to hurry back.

1803
01:51:17,667 --> 01:51:20,555
We're leaving on the 5 o'clock
train this afternoon.

1804
01:51:20,556 --> 01:51:24,193
Well, Cora, it certainly is
good to see again!

1805
01:51:24,194 --> 01:51:30,666
[doorbell ringing]
Well, who can that be?

1806
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:34,917
Well, this time it can't be another
special delivery letter for Clarence!

1807
01:51:34,918 --> 01:51:39,768
Ah, while you were in Springfield,
our postman was kept pretty busy! Hehehe...

1808
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:44,000
It's the cab, ma'am.
Cab? What cab?

1809
01:51:44,001 --> 01:51:46,465
The cab that's to take us
to Audubon Park.

1810
01:51:46,466 --> 01:51:49,777
Oh, who's going to Audubon Park?
We all are!

1811
01:51:49,778 --> 01:51:51,876
Cora, the most wonderful
thing has happened!

1812
01:51:51,877 --> 01:51:54,959
Clare is going to be
baptized this morning.

1813
01:51:58,111 --> 01:52:01,666
Vinnie,
what you saying?

1814
01:52:01,667 --> 01:52:05,777
I'm saying you're going to be
baptized this morning.

1815
01:52:06,778 --> 01:52:10,297
I am NOT going to be baptized
this morning or any other morning!

1816
01:52:10,298 --> 01:52:14,620
You promised yesterday that as soon as I
sent that pug dog that you'd be baptized.

1817
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:17,111
I never said anything
remotely like that!

1818
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:19,029
Clarence was right there
and heard you!

1819
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:21,111
That's why I ordered the cab!

1820
01:52:21,555 --> 01:52:27,613
The cab!
Vinnie, you send that right back!

1821
01:52:27,614 --> 01:52:31,530
I'll do nothing of the kind!
I'm going to see that you go to heaven!

1822
01:52:31,531 --> 01:52:37,614
I can't go to heaven in a cab!
Oh!

1823
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,218
Well, you can start in a cab!

1824
01:52:40,219 --> 01:52:42,093
I'm not sure they'll ever
let you into heaven!

1825
01:52:42,094 --> 01:52:44,385
But I know they won't
unless you're baptized!

1826
01:52:44,386 --> 01:52:47,406
They can't keep me out of
heaven on a technicality!

1827
01:52:48,407 --> 01:52:52,307
Clare! Stop quibbling!
You may as well face it.

1828
01:52:52,308 --> 01:52:55,101
You've got to make
your peace with God!

1829
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:57,692
Until you stirred him up,
I had no trouble with God!

1830
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,525
Harlan. Whitney.
Come get your Sunday hats.

1831
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,620
Clarence! John!
Yes, Mother?

1832
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:08,821
Hurry, we're ready to go.

1833
01:53:09,222 --> 01:53:13,331
Oh, my prayer book.
Harlan, come let me fix your tie.

1834
01:53:14,333 --> 01:53:16,289
Vinnie, are you mad?

1835
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,666
Was it your plan that my own children
should witness this indignity?

1836
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:22,116
Why Clare!
They'll be proud of you!

1837
01:53:22,555 --> 01:53:25,727
I suppose Harlan is
to be my godfather!

1838
01:53:26,728 --> 01:53:29,777
Vinnie, I won't go through with
this thing! That's final.

1839
01:53:29,778 --> 01:53:32,116
Well Clare dear, if you feel
that way about it...

1840
01:53:32,117 --> 01:53:34,756
I do!
Well, we won't take the children with us!

1841
01:53:34,757 --> 01:53:37,999
I'm not talking about the children.
I'm ready, Mother.

1842
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,777
Oh John!

1843
01:53:39,778 --> 01:53:41,555
Vinnie, I haven't time for
anything like that this morning.

1844
01:53:41,556 --> 01:53:43,478
I've got to take John down
to my office with me

1845
01:53:43,479 --> 01:53:45,000
and give him the money to
buy back that dog medicine.

1846
01:53:45,001 --> 01:53:47,222
But it wasn't dog medicine, sir!

1847
01:53:47,223 --> 01:53:49,555
Young man, we're starting
downtown this minute.

1848
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:51,111
You'll do no such thing!

1849
01:53:51,112 --> 01:53:54,409
You gave me your sacred promise
that day I almost died.

1850
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:57,111
Yes, and she would have died if we
hadn't given her some of that medicine.

1851
01:53:57,112 --> 01:53:58,672
That proves it's good medicine.

1852
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,888
You gave your mother
some of that dog medicine?!

1853
01:54:02,889 --> 01:54:05,000
John, you didn't?!

1854
01:54:05,001 --> 01:54:07,951
Yes, we did, Mother.
We put some in your tea that morning.

1855
01:54:07,952 --> 01:54:09,002
Oh John!

1856
01:54:10,751 --> 01:54:14,218
Do you realize you might
have killed your mother?

1857
01:54:15,244 --> 01:54:17,644
You did kill Mrs. Sprague's dog!

1858
01:54:17,645 --> 01:54:22,555
John, I'll have to give considerable thought
as to how you are to be punished for this.

1859
01:54:22,556 --> 01:54:24,542
But Clare...
No, Vinnie.

1860
01:54:24,543 --> 01:54:27,841
When I think of that day! What...
Why, we might have lost you!

1861
01:54:27,842 --> 01:54:29,702
You're all right now,
thank heaven.

1862
01:54:29,703 --> 01:54:32,000
But what I went through
that afternoon...

1863
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:35,222
The way I felt... Well,
I'll never forget it!

1864
01:54:35,223 --> 01:54:39,111
You've forgotten it already.
What do you mean?

1865
01:54:39,112 --> 01:54:41,564
That was the day you gave
me your sacred promise.

1866
01:54:42,555 --> 01:54:44,965
Yes, but I wouldn't have
given you my promise,

1867
01:54:44,966 --> 01:54:46,716
if I hadn't thought
you were dying.

1868
01:54:46,717 --> 01:54:49,515
And you wouldn't have almost died if
John hadn't given you that dog medicine!

1869
01:54:49,516 --> 01:54:51,999
Don't you see?
Well, the whole thing is illegal!

1870
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:56,530
Suppose I had died. It wouldn't
make any difference to you.

1871
01:54:56,531 --> 01:54:59,099
You don't care whether
we meet in heaven or not.

1872
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,666
You don't care whether you ever
see me in the children again.

1873
01:55:02,667 --> 01:55:05,732
Oh Vinnie! You're not
being fair to me.

1874
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:08,315
It's all right,
Clare.

1875
01:55:08,316 --> 01:55:12,815
If you don't love us enough,
there's nothing we can do about it.

1876
01:55:12,816 --> 01:55:15,000
But that has nothing
to do with it!

1877
01:55:16,018 --> 01:55:19,149
I love my family
as much as any man.

1878
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:23,000
All my life, I've struggled
and worked just to...

1879
01:55:24,222 --> 01:55:26,752
Oh God.
There's that cab.

1880
01:55:30,751 --> 01:55:34,111
Vinnie, you're not well enough
to go all the way to Audubon.

1881
01:55:34,112 --> 01:55:35,886
Oh, I'm well enough
if we ride.

1882
01:55:35,887 --> 01:55:38,567
But that trip would
take all morning!

1883
01:55:38,568 --> 01:55:40,567
And those cabs cost
a dollar an hour!

1884
01:55:40,568 --> 01:55:43,000
This is one of
their best cabs!

1885
01:55:43,001 --> 01:55:44,416
This costs $2 an hour!

1886
01:55:46,999 --> 01:55:50,150
Well then why aren't you ready?!
Get your hat on!

1887
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:55,777
Oh, tarnation!
Hallelujah! Amen!

1888
01:55:57,888 --> 01:56:00,000
Young lady,
if I hadn't been for you,

1889
01:56:00,001 --> 01:56:02,711
no one would have known
whether I was baptized or not!

1890
01:56:18,888 --> 01:56:21,993
Oh God!

1891
01:56:25,555 --> 01:56:27,999
Good morning, Mr. Day.
Going to the office?

1892
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,400
NO! I'm going to be
baptized, damn it!

1892
01:56:33,305 --> 01:57:33,907
