1
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,458
The Ring of the Fisherman, which
bears the official papal seal,

2
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,037
must be destroyed immediately
following the Pope's death.

3
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,744
The Papal apartment is then
sealed for nine days of mourning,

4
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:24,997
a period known as "Sede Vacante",
the time of the empty throne.

5
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,919
Over the last several days,
Catholic leaders

6
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,042
from every corner of the world
have flocked to Rome,

7
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:38,646
shocked by the sudden death of
this progressive and beloved pope.

8
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:50,020
Today, in St. Peter's Square,
the faithful pray that there is

9
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,290
among them another leader
who can unite their church,

10
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:57,410
which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.

11
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,757
As the body of the pontif passes by,

12
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,999
we see prayers are being
offered by the Preferiti,

13
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:12,951
favorites among those being considered
to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

14
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,202
At the end of the mourning period,

15
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,887
the College of Cardinals
will lock itself

16
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,704
behind the doors of the
Sistine Chapel for Conclave.

17
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,924
The process by which they
will choose a new leader

18
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,333
for the world's one billion Catholics

19
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,598
who now find their
church at a crossroads,

20
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:39,984
its ancient traditions
threatened by a modern world.

21
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,428
Attention: Control booth going online.

22
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,816
We are powering up.

23
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,748
Attention Category 1 personnel.

24
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,482
Interlock areas are now restricted.

25
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,638
You've blocked all access, Philippe.

26
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,630
You are terrified because
you gave it your all.

27
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:14,200
The accelerator should
never create antimatter.

28
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,248
It's only three cylinders under high
security. I only ask you to wait.

29
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:20,096
We can't wait any longer.

30
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:22,652
Antimatter is only the beginning.
We will have free access.

31
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,078
But listen, even with proper
calibration, we might not be prepared.

32
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,949
Just call the director. Stop this.

33
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:33,507
ATLAS underground is
now a restricted vault.

34
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:35,739
Vittoria, Vittoria...

35
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,436
Protons are being loaded.

36
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,029
This will not blast us to
the other side, so, please.

37
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,894
Powering on LHC magnets.

38
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:49,582
Ionic stage in 4, 3, 2...

39
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:52,553
Start the collision sequence.

40
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,598
Vittoria, what did Phillipe want?

41
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,367
He about shitted. We should
still wait. What do you think?

42
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:04,182
It's now or never.

43
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,817
Beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

44
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,088
ATLAS and CMS checked.

45
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,437
Trigger is set. Collision is imminent.

46
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,581
Let's hope the heavy
ion guys didn't mess up.

47
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:27,064
Luminosity monitors operational.

48
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,767
B-line has no restrictions.

49
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,301
Enable beam capture.

50
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:33,887
Accelerating the beam.

51
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,840
Stage 1: Line up.

52
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:37,902
Magnets to full field.

53
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,640
Last P still too high.

54
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,562
We are moving up the
luminosity 10 to 34.

55
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,582
Eject particle beams.

56
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:49,083
Filling the LHC.

57
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,043
Fusion commenced.
We are back online.

58
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,867
The merger may be any time.

59
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:00,784
Particles in transition.

60
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,920
Collisions are fixed and running.

61
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,770
LHC injecting protons: Beam 1.

62
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,943
Lock the feedback systems.

63
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,549
Particles at 99% the speed of light.

64
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,993
Colliding stable beams.

65
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,237
Enact injection kicker.

66
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,404
We have a signal on
the luminosity monitors.

67
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,645
We have events.

68
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:35,578
Protons are moving.

69
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,581
We have created antimatter.

70
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,889
The unknown has been created.

71
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,837
Silvano, we have succeeded.

72
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,781
We are now in God's hands, Vittoria.

73
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,934
I am on my way.

74
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,572
Silvano?

75
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:26,962
Silvano!

76
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,484
Oh, God.

77
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:56,184
Help! Aiuto! Aiuto!

78
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:56,453
- A swim might help your jet lag.
- I beg your pardon?

79
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,155
The bags under your eyes.
It's five in the morning

80
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,383
and you're from the Vatican.

81
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,706
Crossed keys under the Triregnum.

82
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:06,632
It's a papal symbol.

83
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:13,645
Claudio Vicenze.
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

84
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,852
Vatican Police?

85
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,397
I was expecting another letter.

86
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,362
My request for access to your archives.

87
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,328
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

88
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,770
Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh?

89
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,594
In fact, I was in New York.

90
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:34,543
A detail to the UN. I received a
phone call in the middle of the night.

91
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,062
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.
A matter of great urgency."

92
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,393
They said to show you this.

93
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,756
The Illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

94
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:56,480
Did they?

95
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,639
Look at that again. It's an ambigram.

96
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,992
It's the same image,
forward and backward.

97
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:03,561
Now, that's common for a
symbol like a Yin and Yang

98
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,783
or a swastika but... that's a word.

99
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:09,968
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has
been considered a myth for 400 years.

100
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,096
Supposedly, in the 16th century,

101
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:15,381
some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

102
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,401
It was only gonna be revealed when the
Illuminati had amassed enough power

103
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,056
to resurface and carry
out their final goal.

104
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:24,121
I wrote a book about it.

105
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,973
Which is why you're here.

106
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,330
"The Art of the Illuminati"
by Robert Langdon.

107
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:29,031
Part One.

108
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,473
I haven't been able to finish Part Two

109
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,501
because I'm not allowed
access to your archives.

110
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,873
It's remarkable. Similar.

111
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,859
Someone is trying to make you believe the
Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.

112
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,992
Right after the death of a pope.

113
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:55,405
Four cardinals were kidnapped from
their quarter's inside the Vatican

114
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,273
sometime between 3
and 5 am this morning.

115
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,525
Shortly afterward, that document was
sent to the office of the Swiss Guard

116
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,858
along with the threat

117
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,083
the Cardinals will be
publicly executed

118
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,625
one per hour begining
at 8 pm tonight in Rome.

119
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:20,754
The conclave?

120
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:21,694
Was to begin today.

121
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,887
We have postponed the
start for a few hours

122
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,057
with the story of illness.

123
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,628
There are no suspicions... yet.

124
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:30,217
What do you want from me?

125
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,032
These criminals, who sent this ambigram,
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

126
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:40,799
But Captain Olivetti think if you
can use it to learn their identity,

127
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:43,937
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

128
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,043
Why me?

129
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:53,334
Your expertise. Your erudition.

130
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:57,278
Your recent involvement
with certain church...

131
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,775
shall we say... mysteries.

132
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:04,233
I wasn't under the impression that
episode had endeared me to the Vatican.

133
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,718
Oh, it didn't.

134
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,369
But it did make you,
what is the word for...

135
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:10,625
"formidable"?

136
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,801
Formidable?

137
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,560
A Vatican jet is standing
by twenty minutes from here.

138
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,134
Will you come with me?

139
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:27,130
Professor Langdon.

140
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:31,346
You've spent your life searching for symbols
like the one you now hold in your hand.

141
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:35,711
How much longer are we going to pretend
you have not already decided to come?

142
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,583
If the Illuminati have
returned and are in Rome,

143
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,677
we will hunt them down and kill them.

144
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:53,348
The Illuminati did not become
violent until the 17th century.

145
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,463
Their name means
'The Enlightened Ones'.

146
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,936
They were physicists,
mathematicians, astronomers.

147
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,619
They were concerned with the
church's inaccurate teachings

148
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,816
and they were dedicated
to scientific truth.

149
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,555
But the Vatican didn't like that.

150
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,819
So, the church began
to, how did you say it?

151
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,884
Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.

152
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,984
Drove them underground

153
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,767
into a secret society.

154
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:05,072
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes?

155
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:06,617
Welcome to Vatican City.

156
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:11,035
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector
General of the Vatican Police Force.

157
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,014
My pleasure.

158
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:12,898
This way please.

159
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,658
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

160
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:20,262
- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

161
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:23,669
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls

162
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,247
with the exception of the
security of His Holiness...

163
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:29,088
- Yeah.
- ... and the Apostolic Palace.

164
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:29,914
That is Swiss Guard.

165
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,143
<i>The Roman Carabinieri are here as</i>
well in an advisory capacity.

166
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,326
So jurisdictionally this is...

167
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:36,432
A goddamn nightmare.

168
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:47,352
- Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?

169
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:53,066
1857. Pope Pius IX felt the
male form would inspire lust.

170
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,130
So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-manned' hundreds of these statues.

171
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,166
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

172
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,350
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

173
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:09,923
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

174
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,266
I urge you to guard your tone here.

175
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,309
The Swiss Guard is a
calling, not a profession,

176
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:24,881
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

177
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:29,295
Commander Richter, the head of the
Guard, is a deeply spiritual man.

178
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,616
He was close to the
late Pope. Understood?

179
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:34,717
Look, I dont study symbols because
I consider them unimportant.

180
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,134
Ceremony, traditions,
heavily mark our lives.

181
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,226
I just hope I can help.
- So do I.

182
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,048
You were my idea.

183
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,862
Wait here. Please.

184
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,603
Commander? Commander Richter?

185
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,828
Doctor Vetra?

186
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,414
I'm Commander Richter, principal of
the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming.

187
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,476
Oh. Professor Langdon.

188
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:23,132
What a relief.
The symbologist is here.

189
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,920
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

190
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,084
The situation has changed.

191
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,589
We received another
threat from the kidnapper.

192
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:35,313
The canister was stolen from
my lab around noon yesterday.

193
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:38,767
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Paintivolio

194
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,367
and mutilated him in
order to bypass security.

195
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,747
We use retinal scanners.

196
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:45,839
They cut out his eye.

197
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,611
Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?

198
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:53,619
- Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.

199
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,183
It, too, was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican walls.

200
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:59,417
That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance called antimatter.

201
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,342
We need to locate it immediately.
We evacuate Vatican City.

202
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:04,907
I'm quite familiar with
incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

203
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,169
I've never heard of
antimatter being used as such.

204
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,440
Well, its never been generated
in significant quantities before.

205
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,217
It's a way of studying the
origins of the universe.

206
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:16,121
To try to isolate what some
people call "the God Particle".

207
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,984
But there are implications
for energy, research--

208
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:19,785
"God Particle"?

209
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,103
What you call it isn't important.

210
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:26,709
It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.

211
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:31,290
You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.

212
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,404
The antimatter is suspended there...

213
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,937
in an airtight nano-composite shell
with electromagnets on each end.

214
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,654
But if it were to
fall out of suspension,

215
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,540
and come into contact with matter,
say with the bottom of the canister,

216
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,909
then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.

217
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,543
What might cause it to
fall out of suspension?

218
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,837
The battery going dead.

219
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,852
Which it will just before midnight.

220
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,834
What kind of annihilation? How violent?

221
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:55,588
A cataclysmic event.

222
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:59,744
A blinding explosion
equivalent to about 5 kilotons.

223
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,690
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

224
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,916
Those are the exact
words the kidnapper used.

225
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,679
We will destroy your four pillars.

226
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:17,268
We will brand your Preferiti and
sacrifice them on the altars of science.

227
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:20,260
Then bring your church down upon you.

228
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,921
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

229
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,446
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

230
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:38,024
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.

231
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,947
Four pillars. There's
your kidnapped cardinals.

232
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,492
You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.

233
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,228
Play it again.

234
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,906
We will destroy your four pillars.

235
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,747
We will brand your Preferiti...

236
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:04,715
Wait, stop it. Stop.

237
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,144
Brand them?

238
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,272
That's another Illuminati legend.

239
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:17,390
This one says that there
are a set of five 'Brands'.

240
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,982
Each one an ambigram.

241
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,409
The first four are the
fundamental elements of science:

242
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,443
earth, air, fire and water.

243
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:26,399
Th fifth is a mystery.

244
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,396
Maybe it's this.

245
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,126
You said they'd be killed publicly.

246
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:37,112
Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.

247
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,029
La Purga?

248
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:43,210
Geez, you guys don't even
read your own history, do you?

249
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,592
1668. The church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists

250
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,690
and branded each one of them on the
chest with the symbol of the cross.

251
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:55,588
To 'purge' them of their
sins and they executed them,

252
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,970
threw their bodies out in the street

253
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,708
as a warning to others
to stop questioning

254
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:02,115
church rulings on scientific
matters. They radicalized them.

255
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,247
The Purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati.

256
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,826
One bent on... on retribution.

257
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:12,417
And look how they intend to
finally get it. Using anti-matter.

258
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:16,682
Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.

259
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,411
Is there any more?

260
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:24,054
...and sacrifice them
on the altars of science.

261
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,934
Then bring your church down upon you.

262
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,488
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

263
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:35,173
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

264
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:36,724
Path of Illumination?

265
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,349
I need access to the Vatican archives.

266
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:46,526
Professor, I don't think this
is the appropriate moment--

267
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,931
Your petition has been
denied seven times.

268
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,011
No, no. This has-
This has nothing to do with my work.

269
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:53,697
The Path of Illumination
is a hidden trail through Rome itself

270
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:55,529
that leads to the
Church of the Illumination.

271
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,055
The place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

272
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:03,528
If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path,

273
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:05,672
the four churches along it.

274
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,039
It may be where he intends
to murder your Cardinals.

275
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:13,709
One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.

276
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,624
If we could figure out the first
church and get there before he does,

277
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:19,034
maybe we could stop it.

278
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,280
But I can't find the start of the
path until I get into the archives.

279
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,392
Even if I wanted to help you,

280
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,474
access to the archives
is only by written decree

281
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:30,177
by the curator on the
Board of Vatican Librarians.

282
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,590
Or by papal mandate.

283
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:35,672
Yes, but, as you no doubt have
heard, the Holy Father is dead.

284
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,507
What about il Camerlengo?

285
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:41,483
The Camerlengo is just a priest
here. The former pope's chamberlain.

286
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:45,112
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

287
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,393
Fellas, you called me.

288
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,862
His Holiness once told me

289
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:02,151
the Pope is a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

290
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,093
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

291
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:09,936
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

292
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,002
The Purga is a dark stain
on this church's history.

293
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

294
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:22,365
Commandante, have you begun a
search for this explosive device?

295
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:24,135
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

296
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:26,684
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

297
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,561
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

298
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,871
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave,

299
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:32,601
your security concerns
are at a minimum.

300
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:34,910
Devote as many of your people--

301
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,198
Signore, if you are about to suggest
a naked eye search

302
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,896
of the entire Vatican City,
I will tell you...

303
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,114
- Commander.
- ... I do not have the people.

304
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,379
Although I am not His Holiness,

305
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:44,934
when you are addressing me,
you are addressing this office.

306
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:45,866
Do you understand?

307
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,253
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

308
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,953
Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

309
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:59,709
Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?

310
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:01,895
When the image on the
screen goes dark,

311
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:04,097
you'll have a more specific
idea of the camera's location.

312
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:11,575
Dr. Vetra, beside yourself
and your research partner,

313
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,060
who else knew about
this antimatter project?

314
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,666
No one but the research team.

315
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,405
This project was strictly confidential.

316
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,641
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

317
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,604
If he told anyone else
about what we were doing,

318
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:25,938
he would have made a note of it.

319
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:27,661
And do you have these journals?

320
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,793
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

321
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:31,130
Please.

322
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,124
Professor Langdon.

323
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,315
Mr. Langdon.

324
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,285
You are correct that I may
grant you access to the archives.

325
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,010
Thank you, Padre.

326
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:57,687
I said that you are correct that I may,
not- not that I will.

327
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:02,840
Christianity's most sacred
codes are in that archive.

328
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:07,220
Given your recent
entanglement with the church,

329
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:11,281
there is a question I'd like to ask you
first, here, in the office of His Holiness.

330
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:19,877
Do you believe in God, Sir?

331
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:27,643
Father, I simply
believe that religion...

332
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,355
I did not ask you if you
believe what man says about God.

333
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,673
I asked if you believe in God.

334
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:37,353
I'm an academic.

335
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:42,977
My mind tells me I will
never understand God.

336
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,405
And your heart?

337
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:50,177
Tells me I'm not meant to.

338
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,980
Faith is a gift that
I have yet to receive.

339
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:03,447
Be delicate with our treasures.

340
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:12,587
- The archives are this way.
- Professor Langdon?

341
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,689
If this path really leads to
the Church of Illumination,

342
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,049
that may be where they've
hidden the antimatter.

343
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,053
The shining star at the end
of the path. I thought so, too.

344
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,175
Follow the path and we may find
the canister at the end of it.

345
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:26,738
Can you deactivate the device?

346
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,860
I can change the canister's batteries as long
as we have more than five minutes of life.

347
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:33,212
That would give us another 24
hours to get it safely back to CERN.

348
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,300
- Robert Langdon.
- Vittoria Vetra.

349
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,645
Are you really a symbologist
or was he mocking you?

350
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,822
No. Both. You're a physicist?

351
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,695
Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?

352
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:48,396
Okay.

353
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,356
Your project... it was to give
towards the energy research?

354
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:53,724
Eventually, yes.

355
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:57,063
One pack of antimatter could
power an entire city for a month.

356
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,996
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

357
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,715
What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.

358
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:08,814
- Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.

359
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:11,488
Who didn't think the church
and science were enemies

360
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,930
but just a different language
telling the same story.

361
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:15,685
Anyone of like minds could find
the Church of Illumination.

362
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,181
But he couldn't exactly advertise its
location, so he created a coded path.

363
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,736
Richter has started to turn
off the power at various rates.

364
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:26,254
It will be back on in a minute.

365
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:31,368
Then some unknown Illuminati
master sculpted four statues.

366
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,203
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements:

367
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,777
earth, air, fire, water.

368
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,243
And placed the statues out in
public, in churches throughout Rome.

369
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:42,303
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

370
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,838
At the end of the path was
the Church of Illumination.

371
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,812
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

372
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,710
What makes you think he's going to
murder the cardinals in the churches?

373
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:55,823
The Illuminati called those four churches
by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza".

374
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:59,418
Sacrifice them on the
altars of science, he said.

375
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:00,723
Exactly.

376
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,997
Oh, wow. Look at this.

377
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,969
Excuse me. Signori.

378
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:38,205
Cardinal Strauss, have you
been informed of the situation?

379
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:38,950
Yeah.

380
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,378
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

381
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,047
At this late hour?

382
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:47,099
That would be highly unorthodox.

383
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:50,612
And, yet, was ensured to wrought
my power in great elective.

384
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:52,639
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

385
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,703
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

386
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,283
Only those I hold for my church.

387
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,733
St. Peter's church, which is someday
taken at its most vulnerable moment.

388
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:04,308
And this is not a coincidence.

389
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,094
The church will not fall in a
day. We must evacuate Vatican City.

390
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:12,594
That is exactly what they
want. Publicity and panic.

391
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:16,186
No. We must not give them
oxygen for the media fire.

392
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:19,233
But the people in St. Peter's Square?

393
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:22,566
Care deeply about
their church, as we do.

394
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:25,584
Their faith will sustain them.

395
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:28,157
Their faith will not protect
them from an explosion.

396
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,295
We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?

397
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:37,644
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.

398
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:42,500
Patrick, do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold

399
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,356
with your true place
here at the Vatican.

400
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:49,910
You were a favorite of His Holiness.

401
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:53,988
But His Holiness is with his father now.

402
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,083
Mea culpa.

403
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,406
Seal the doors.

404
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,578
Everyone outside.

405
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:08,505
This way, please.

406
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,337
Oh. Beautiful.

407
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:17,671
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

408
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:21,900
Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible
level. It is a partial vacuum inside.

409
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:24,220
So, extended stays are not recommended.

410
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:28,088
So, don't panic if you
feel light headed at first.

411
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,328
I'll be just outside the door,

412
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,878
watching you, Mr. Langdon.

413
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:33,871
Conclave will go on without us.

414
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,070
It must. Now of all times.

415
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:40,091
May God forgive you
for what you have done.

416
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:50,221
Father, if God has issues,

417
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,867
they won't be with what I've done.

418
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:56,460
They will be with what I'm about to do.

419
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:22,570
It was confiscated from the Netherlands
by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

420
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,878
I've been petitioning to see it
for about ten years.

421
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,596
Ever since I realized what was in it.

422
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,963
What makes you so sure
that this thing is there?

423
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:31,232
The number 503.

424
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:35,458
I kept seeing it, over and over
again. In Illuminati letters.

425
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,124
Scribbled in the margins.
Sometimes just signed '503'.

426
00:33:38,137 --> 00:33:40,448
It's a numeric clue, but, to what? Five?

427
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,813
Well, that's a medieval
number to the Illuminati.

428
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:46,064
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras.
Dozens of other examples in science.

429
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:46,985
But what about 3?

430
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:50,403
It didn't make sense, until I thought:
What if it's Roman numerals?

431
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:54,343
DIII.
- D3. Galileo's third text.

432
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:58,475
Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.

433
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:13,348
Just a few days with this and I
could've actually finished my book.

434
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,179
And sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

435
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:19,308
Il Diagramma Veritatis.

436
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,552
Diagram of Truth.

437
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:24,405
I know about the
Dialogo and the Discorsi.

438
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,333
Galileo laid out his theories about
the earth revolving around the sun.

439
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,618
Right. It said the earth was not
the center of some universe

440
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:31,725
with heaven above, hell below,

441
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,561
as the church had said it was.

442
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:35,905
So, they forced him to
recant his second book.

443
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,081
But what was this one?

444
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:38,835
This is how he got the word out.

445
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:41,605
This is the truth. Not what
the Vatican forced him to write.

446
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,280
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in
Holland on setched papyrus. See?

447
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,947
That way, any scientist
that was caught with a copy

448
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:51,638
could just throw it in water and
Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.

449
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,843
Between that and Vatican burnings

450
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:58,000
it's possible this is the
only copy that remains.

451
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,072
And if I'm correct,

452
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:04,764
the segno is hidden on page number...

453
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,046
Five.

454
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,672
Yeah.

455
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:16,442
Do you need help with the Latin?

456
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,239
Sure.

457
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:29,870
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...

458
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:36,048
Sorry. I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a...

459
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:36,959
Wait, wait, wait.

460
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:38,696
Do that again.

461
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,013
What is that?

462
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:47,684
Wait. It's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

463
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,127
Go back.

464
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,417
It's in English.

465
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,000
English?

466
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,369
Why English?

467
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:58,643
English wasn't used in the
Vatican. It was too polluted.

468
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:04,186
It's free thinking. It was the language
of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

469
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:04,948
Here's another one.

470
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:10,072
"The path of light is laid a sacred test.
" Would you write this down as I dictate?

471
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:11,875
Sorry, Professor. No time.

472
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,031
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what the hell? Yeah.

473
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:36,994
Twenty minutes till eight.
Where are we headed?

474
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,057
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you in a minute.

475
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:40,478
Here. Let me see that page again.

476
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,222
Where did you get that paper?

477
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:50,209
We borrowed it.

478
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:53,607
"From Santi's earthly tomb,
the demon's hole..."

479
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:54,481
Are you insane?

480
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:57,514
"...across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

481
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,549
"The path of light is
laid in a sacred test."

482
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:04,253
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

483
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,934
You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?

484
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:09,590
She did.

485
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:16,628
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

486
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:19,318
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

487
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:22,134
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

488
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,863
- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

489
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:28,834
- So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

490
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:32,293
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

491
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,298
I just pulled a dozen
of my best men for this.

492
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,136
You better be right.

493
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,123
This is one of the busiest
spot in all of Rome.

494
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,908
You can never get away
with it. It's impossible.

495
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:00,636
The poem implies--

496
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:03,155
The poem? Unbelievable.

497
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,817
I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

498
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:10,874
Well, the information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb

499
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:12,581
and Raphael's tomb is
inside that building.

500
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:16,896
And because the Vatican destroyed all
of the pagan statues in the late 1800s,

501
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:17,740
if this is the first marker,

502
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:20,367
whatever clues were here to lead
us to the next are sure gone by now.

503
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,544
The path is dead. So, this
is it. Your only chance.

504
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,224
Seperate approaches.

505
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:30,242
No closer than two blocks and
no uniforms. Three minutes.

506
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,926
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

507
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,889
Excuse me. Two men with symmetric black suits
and earpieces? They're hardly disguised.

508
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:43,624
That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.

509
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:44,776
You don't have communication.

510
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,877
You can't carry a walkie talkie.
It's too conspicuous.

511
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,746
Tourists have cell phones, don't they?

512
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,600
No, no. You can't send
her in there alone.

513
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,633
All right. I won't.

514
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:07,565
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

515
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,100
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today, hmm?

516
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,233
Hold my hand.

517
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:18,413
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry.

518
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,532
Nervous newlywed.

519
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:25,925
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

520
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:28,912
That could be the
demon's hole in the poem.

521
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,842
Why are the tombs at an angle?

522
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,555
They're facing east to
worship the rising sun.

523
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,909
But this is a Christian church.

524
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:38,201
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays

525
00:39:38,202 --> 00:39:40,010
to make conversion less of a shock.

526
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:42,334
Like the 25th of December.

527
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:45,052
It's the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun.

528
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:47,684
It also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.

529
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,299
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

530
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,103
I'll go to the right and
I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

531
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,117
Follow me, please.

532
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,525
Now, the Pantheon, which
means 'Temple of all Gods',

533
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,637
was originally built as a temple to
all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC.

534
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:12,457
Although the building is usually
credited to Agrippa of Damascus...

535
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,146
Robert!

536
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,078
Robert!

537
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:23,360
It's Raphael's tomb,
but it's the wrong one.

538
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:24,427
What are you talking about?

539
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:28,925
It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

540
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:30,703
Where was he originally buried?

541
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:32,840
Urbino, I think.

542
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,624
Santi's earthly tomb. What could
posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

543
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:43,657
Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must
mean the chapel that he built.

544
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,390
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

545
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:49,416
The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

546
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:50,891
Are there any questions?

547
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,030
Yes. Yes!

548
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,647
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary anex

549
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:59,734
in an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic church?

550
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,891
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

551
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,552
One is good.

552
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,885
Wrong? What do you mean wrong?

553
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:11,367
It's the Chigi chapel in the
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

554
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,815
It was once called Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

555
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,317
Earth. The first element. That's it.

556
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,704
- You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.

557
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,598
Back to the Vatican.

558
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:24,670
Back to the Vatican?
You-You can't.

559
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,222
Commandante, if you care at all about
your church, you'll listen to me.

560
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,373
My church?

561
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:33,036
My church comforts the sick and dying.

562
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:36,656
My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

563
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,679
That's right. You don't have one.

564
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,639
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

565
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,054
All right, this makes sense.
Look, look, look!

566
00:41:58,055 --> 00:41:59,265
Right in front of the church.

567
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,244
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

568
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,824
The Egyptian symbol
adopted by the Illuminati.

569
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:05,859
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

570
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:23,678
Eight o'clock.

571
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,543
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

572
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:24,011
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

573
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,116
Must be in one of these areas.

574
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,132
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

575
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:35,593
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

576
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:55,314
The Demon's Hole.

577
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:00,906
Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.

578
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:10,064
Give me your flashlight.

579
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:11,525
What's that?

580
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,494
My Savior Christ will be my judge,
to testify that my voice is His.

581
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:17,956
For I believe that He should
be chosen for the sake of God.

582
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:45,366
I wish to Pontifex,
Dominicus Scolamiero.

583
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:58,637
I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi.

584
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:00,825
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

585
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:03,595
They're waiting for the
Preferiti to be rescued.

586
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,100
Perhaps we should, as well, yes?

587
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,067
Not until the smoke is white

588
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:31,782
will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

589
00:47:31,787 --> 00:47:36,057
For now the Vatican seat of
ultimate power remains vacant.

590
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:44,539
Get the body out of there.
Search the rest of the building.

591
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,100
- Chartrand!
- Sir.

592
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:49,264
Outside a perimeter.
Secure, but invisible.

593
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:51,760
No lights, no guns.
Nobody knows. Understand?

594
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,701
Yes, sir.

595
00:47:56,495 --> 00:47:58,143
Is it Raphael?

596
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,792
The chapel is Raphael.

597
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,618
But the sculptures are Bernini.

598
00:48:06,172 --> 00:48:09,363
The unknown Illuminati master?

599
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,798
Bernini?

600
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:16,318
- He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.

601
00:48:16,741 --> 00:48:20,000
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

602
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,807
There wasn't a powerful organization
on earth they didn't penetrate,

603
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,325
including the Vatican,
by hiding in plain sight.

604
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:32,719
Habakkuk and the Angel.

605
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:36,344
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth.

606
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:40,616
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

607
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:46,214
This is the first marker.

608
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,019
The path is a line.

609
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:02,063
Southwest.

610
00:49:02,164 --> 00:49:03,778
It was pointing southwest.

611
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,422
Earth, air, fire, water.

612
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:09,200
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.

613
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,911
The second church is
somewhere southwest of here.

614
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:13,551
You're sure this time?

615
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:16,378
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

616
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,373
I could use it now.

617
00:49:56,587 --> 00:49:59,492
The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.

618
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:03,447
But nothing intersects the line until
it hits... until it hits St. Peter's.

619
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:05,681
Michelangelo designed
St. Peter's, not Bernini.

620
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:09,354
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

621
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:12,601
The second marker must be a
statue in St. Peter's Square.

622
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,209
It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?

623
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:23,535
Not unless you want the full
attention of the world press.

624
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:34,958
No majority in the first vote,

625
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:40,695
but Cardinal Baggia from
Italy is the clear favorite...

626
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:47,216
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...

627
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:53,470
The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

628
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:57,039
Stem cell research is murder!

629
00:50:58,112 --> 00:51:00,821
You condemn sick people to death.

630
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,580
Man is not God.

631
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,348
There. Another obelisk.

632
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,409
Check the crowd. It's almost
nine. He's got to be here already.

633
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:55,218
Must be a hundred statues up there.

634
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:58,853
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

635
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:03,331
How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

636
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:12,233
Bas relief. Of course.

637
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:13,526
It's still a sculpture.

638
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:15,273
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

639
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:18,009
Look for another having
something to do with air.

640
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:40,600
Vento Ponente. West wind.

641
00:52:42,002 --> 00:52:42,980
Vittoria.

642
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,965
Here it is.

643
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,553
West wind. An angel blowing
out five streaks of air.

644
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:50,035
This is it.

645
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,187
Call the police!

646
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,199
Call an ambulance!

647
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:06,905
He's still alive.

648
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,186
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

649
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:42,409
"And you squeezed the life
out of a bishop of Rome."

650
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,785
And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

651
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:48,311
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

652
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:51,897
It impliess the Illuminati murdered
him with his own medication.

653
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:53,447
What?

654
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,109
It's on here.

655
00:55:56,666 --> 00:56:00,919
"With man's solution
we stilled his heart."

656
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:03,220
"With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy vein."

657
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:06,591
Did the Holy Father take any
kind of medication by injection?

658
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:07,892
Tinzaparin.

659
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:10,668
He had thrombophlebitis.

660
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:13,106
He took an injection every
day, but no one knew that.

661
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,008
Someone knew it.

662
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:17,801
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures, as well.

663
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:20,703
But he took steps to make
sure he was watched for safety.

664
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:24,903
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

665
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,287
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

666
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:31,483
An overdose could cause massive
internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.

667
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:33,414
It might look like a stroke at first,

668
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:35,532
but in few days,
his body would show signs.

669
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,752
This could easily be examined.

670
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:38,364
Ms. Vetra, in case
you're not aware of it...

671
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,506
Papal autopsy is
prohibited by Vatican law.

672
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:45,969
We're not going to defile his Holiness body
just because of these claims.

673
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,519
But why would they
send this letter now?

674
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:48,978
In order to cause panic.

675
00:56:49,248 --> 00:56:51,266
"The sun will blind at midnight..."

676
00:56:51,446 --> 00:56:53,832
"and neither police nor
professors can stop it."

677
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:56,125
He knows I'm here.

678
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:58,608
Obviously, they were hoping
this letter would become public.

679
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:00,860
We might be wise to preempt
their next attempt

680
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:02,300
by making an announcement of our own.

681
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,723
- To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.

682
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,208
Cardinal Strauss has insisted this
entire matter be kept internal.

683
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:11,471
He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

684
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:15,220
His final instructions, before
sealing the doors, were very clear.

685
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:18,482
Cardinal Strauss does not
dictate Vatican protocols.

686
00:57:18,757 --> 00:57:22,190
And to say, yet, technically,
now that conclave has begun,

687
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:25,448
it is privilege and duty to
control public announcements.

688
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,282
I've drafted a press release
about the incident at the piazza,

689
00:57:28,475 --> 00:57:31,562
but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

690
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:36,421
For that, the cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

691
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:42,100
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

692
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:46,915
Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city

693
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,290
- but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

694
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:51,305
How long would you need
to evacuate everyone?

695
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:54,422
If I pull all my men from the
search for the bomb, thirty minutes.

696
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:58,759
Mr. Langdon, you have been
right so far about the path.

697
00:57:58,936 --> 00:58:02,052
It's now 9:15. How quickly
can you find the next church?

698
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:05,668
The lines of breath on the carving pointed
due east directly away from Vatican City.

699
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,006
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

700
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:12,406
About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.

701
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:15,432
So, the Bernini sculpture must
be inside one of them that does.

702
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:17,607
I'm willing to get back
into the archives to find it.

703
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:19,707
- Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

704
00:58:22,572 --> 00:58:25,187
Silvano's journals.
The killer's name could be in here.

705
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:28,114
- May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.

706
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,225
Professor.

707
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,292
Would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you?

708
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,533
It would surprise the hell out of me.

709
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:58,530
The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.

710
00:58:58,738 --> 00:59:01,882
A tourist from Düsseldorf,
whose death is confirmed.

711
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:05,822
Vatican police have
arrested a suspect...

712
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:09,132
The investigation is completed.

713
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:15,999
Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's
again, with strict security measures.

714
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:19,759
The Vatican did admit that, where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

715
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:22,206
We're trying now to get the
name of the tourist who was...

716
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:24,196
But wait.

717
00:59:25,715 --> 00:59:27,682
We're getting word now of smoke.

718
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:32,259
Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.

719
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,051
The smoke is black.

720
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:36,562
Once again, the Cardinals have
failed to reach consensus,

721
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,124
and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.

722
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,156
What are you looking for now?

723
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,900
- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?

724
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,042
Artwork. It's valuable.

725
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,092
Corporations tend to keep
track of their holdings.

726
00:59:58,297 --> 01:00:02,325
The Catholic church is not
a corporation. It's a beacon.

727
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:06,032
A source of inspiration for one
billion lost and frightened souls.

728
01:00:06,245 --> 01:00:08,303
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

729
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:21,733
Commander Olivetti said that I was
not to leave your side this time.

730
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:26,441
It wasn't me. It was her.

731
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:46,011
Power in zone 3 is disabled.

732
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:48,028
No response on the screen.

733
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:50,426
Power on zone 3 again
and continue with zone 4.

734
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:02,977
What sort of signs?

735
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,235
I'm sorry?

736
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:13,377
If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin,

737
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,954
what signs would his body bear?

738
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:19,413
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

739
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,436
His tongue.

740
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:26,056
Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.

741
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:29,928
Even after fourteen days?

742
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:33,464
It wouldn't show up until at
least a week after his death.

743
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:40,076
He was very important to me.

744
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,624
Yeah, I understand.

745
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:50,589
Will you come with me, please?

746
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:00,463
Signore, would you
organize a security team

747
01:02:00,464 --> 01:02:02,349
to escort Ms. Vetra and
myself down to the crypt?

748
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:04,318
Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.

749
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:24,835
Do you smoke?

750
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:27,879
A little bit.

751
01:02:28,195 --> 01:02:31,118
You better sit down
before you keel over.

752
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:41,775
What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

753
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:46,985
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

754
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,729
Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?

755
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:53,317
I don't know.

756
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,948
Here. Translate all of this for me,
and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

757
01:02:59,955 --> 01:03:02,592
I'm looking for a reference of fire.

758
01:03:04,528 --> 01:03:07,535
- Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.

759
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:13,921
His great golden spear. A point of fire.

760
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:19,338
Then "woman left completely afire."

761
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,401
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.

762
01:03:23,406 --> 01:03:26,055
So, this sculpture was
moved to this church?

763
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:30,566
Why are they shuting down the system?
They know we're down here.

764
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:34,216
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

765
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:37,783
- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

766
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:43,207
Well, that's disappointing.

767
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:47,571
- Where are we going?
- To see my father.

768
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:49,402
I don't understand.

769
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:52,222
I was orphaned when I
was nine years of age.

770
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:56,853
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

771
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:01,177
The Archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day.

772
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,984
I was raised by him and by the Church.

773
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:06,907
He was the wisest man I ever met.

774
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:11,065
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained,

775
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,541
but I was brought up in Italy
so I also wanted to do my military service.

776
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:16,478
I wanted to fight.

777
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:19,905
He told me, "Learn to fly."

778
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:23,807
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari.
Flew helicopters.

779
01:04:23,817 --> 01:04:26,219
Bringing the wounded back to hospitals.

780
01:04:26,224 --> 01:04:29,314
- He was a great man.
- Your father died.

781
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:31,857
Fourteen days ago.

782
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,644
Headquarters, you hear me?

783
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:37,912
The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.

784
01:04:37,913 --> 01:04:41,415
- Answer, please. Anybody hear me?
- Did you get anything?

785
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:45,104
No. The walls are lead lined.
There's no signal.

786
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:00,540
This way.

787
01:08:08,446 --> 01:08:12,426
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

788
01:08:12,445 --> 01:08:14,754
Vatican security is impenetrable.

789
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:17,303
No one from the outside
could've got anywhere near him.

790
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:21,392
It was someone on the inside.
We can trust no one.

791
01:08:23,372 --> 01:08:27,318
On my screen, no response in zone 7.

792
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:31,339
We rechon that the
battery will soon be empty

793
01:08:31,558 --> 01:08:33,821
and the device will explode
shortly before midnight.

794
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:57,023
Holy Father...

795
01:08:57,963 --> 01:09:02,009
when I was young, you've told me the
voice in my heart was God's voice.

796
01:09:02,044 --> 01:09:05,467
You said I should follow
it no matter how painful.

797
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,834
Forgive me.

798
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,169
Please, give me strength.

799
01:09:11,354 --> 01:09:15,965
What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believed.

800
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:08,087
God help us.

801
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,321
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

802
01:10:23,794 --> 01:10:26,207
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

803
01:10:42,467 --> 01:10:44,321
I think someone just tried to kill me.

804
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:46,517
Professor, I promise you,
we had no idea.

805
01:10:46,518 --> 01:10:47,729
- He knows I'm here?
- Yes.

806
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,637
You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.

807
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:50,744
Yes, but we had no idea

808
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:53,954
that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building.

809
01:10:54,948 --> 01:10:56,741
Commander Richter was
extending the search.

810
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:58,606
If he had known the archives
were on that grid,

811
01:10:58,607 --> 01:10:59,965
he never would have killed the power.

812
01:11:01,027 --> 01:11:03,087
But there is the other possibility.

813
01:11:03,271 --> 01:11:06,172
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

814
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,203
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

815
01:11:11,846 --> 01:11:13,254
Perhaps.

816
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:25,239
The journals. Where are they?

817
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:29,867
Who took the journals from this desk?

818
01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:42,795
Signore, this is unacceptable.

819
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:46,572
For a Camerlengo to enter the
chapel once conclave has begun.

820
01:11:46,579 --> 01:11:47,656
Forgive me.

821
01:11:47,657 --> 01:11:49,479
There's been a development.

822
01:12:00,037 --> 01:12:02,773
His Holiness Celestine was murdered!

823
01:12:02,774 --> 01:12:06,650
Is it so inconceivable
that it will happen again?

824
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,553
Signori, please, a moment.
Please. Signori.

825
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,467
Our church is at war.

826
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,786
We are under attack from an old enemy.

827
01:12:19,145 --> 01:12:20,970
The Illuminati.

828
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,986
They have struck us from within.

829
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,186
Murdering our Holy Father!

830
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:30,748
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new God 'Science'.

831
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:34,109
They call it retribution.
They think it justified...

832
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:38,291
because of the Church's attacks on men of
science in the distant past and it's true.

833
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:44,064
Since the days of Galileo, this church has
tried to slow the relentless march of progress.

834
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:46,333
Sometimes with misguided means.

835
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:49,934
But science and
religion are not enemies.

836
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:56,220
There are simply some things that
science is just too young to understand.

837
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,396
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

838
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,191
"Slow down."

839
01:13:00,373 --> 01:13:01,721
"Think. Wait."

840
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,765
And, for this, they call us backwards.

841
01:13:04,884 --> 01:13:06,644
But who is more ignorant?

842
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:08,978
The man who cannot define lightning...

843
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:12,450
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

844
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:15,685
The battle is well under way, signori.

845
01:13:16,419 --> 01:13:18,350
We must defend ourselves.

846
01:13:18,558 --> 01:13:21,127
But, what if this time, we fight
their stealth with openness?

847
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:23,989
Combat their wicked
scheme with simple truth.

848
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:27,133
And end this brutish
battle once and for all.

849
01:13:27,328 --> 01:13:30,142
If the outside world could
see this church as I do,

850
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:32,241
looking beyond the
ritual of these walls,

851
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:34,972
they would see a modern miracle.

852
01:13:35,182 --> 01:13:38,753
A brotherhood of
imperfect, simple souls...

853
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:41,900
who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion

854
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:43,794
in a world spinning out of control.

855
01:13:46,049 --> 01:13:48,476
Signori, I ask..

856
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,440
I pray...

857
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,961
that you break this conclave.

858
01:13:55,273 --> 01:13:56,629
Open the doors,

859
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,508
evacuate St. Peter's Square

860
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,804
and tell the world the truth.

861
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:38,936
Get him down.

862
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:53,089
There. There, that
chain. On that pulley.

863
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:54,708
This bench. Get this pew off
here and make it a ladder.

864
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:18,129
Vatican Police.

865
01:17:20,164 --> 01:17:22,895
My son...

866
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:26,371
God answers all prayers, but...

867
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,564
sometimes His answer is no.

868
01:17:30,737 --> 01:17:33,425
The College will not break conclave.

869
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:38,563
May I suggest...
you direct your energies

870
01:17:38,564 --> 01:17:42,151
to helping the Swiss Guard
find this explosive device.

871
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:43,828
If it exists.

872
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:47,733
And leave Church leadership...

873
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:51,282
to its leaders.

874
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:04,592
Eminence.

875
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:09,131
There is a growing fear

876
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:11,980
that without the four Preferiti

877
01:18:11,985 --> 01:18:15,207
it defers much authority
for any candidate.

878
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,964
It will not be possible,

879
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:19,450
- unless...
- Speak plainly.

880
01:18:20,718 --> 01:18:24,449
It is the recommendation of many
that you asked to be removed...

881
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:26,697
from your post as Great Elector.

882
01:18:26,972 --> 01:18:33,384
Thereby making yourself eligible
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

883
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:37,952
Well, if it is God's will.

884
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,525
May His will be done.

885
01:19:00,322 --> 01:19:02,243
Here! I hear someone.

886
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:06,155
Remove the lid.

887
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:09,965
Come on.

888
01:19:14,328 --> 01:19:15,919
Signore, are you okay?

889
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:26,146
I know he is there.

890
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,201
Madam, it is necessary
that you remain quiet.

891
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:32,991
Don't tell me that I should remain calm.
I want to know what he will do.

892
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,389
Commander, here's Ms. Vetra.

893
01:19:40,867 --> 01:19:43,412
Those journals are private property.
I demand that you return them to me.

894
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,551
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

895
01:19:48,852 --> 01:19:49,998
I am an Italian citizen.

896
01:19:49,999 --> 01:19:52,767
My rights do not end just
because I crossed the other side.

897
01:19:52,768 --> 01:19:55,994
This is not Italy.
It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican.

898
01:19:56,019 --> 01:19:58,055
A country with its own laws.

899
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,502
And when those journals passed the
border, they became my property.

900
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:03,231
I will give them back to you

901
01:20:03,657 --> 01:20:06,688
when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

902
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:09,027
Do you have something to
hide, Commandante Richter?

903
01:20:11,952 --> 01:20:13,890
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

904
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:37,870
If it were up to me,
it wouldn't be this way.

905
01:20:39,518 --> 01:20:42,074
It's a sin to kill with pain.

906
01:20:43,324 --> 01:20:45,474
It's a sin to kill
without reason, Father.

907
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,125
They made me a sinner.

908
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:14,549
Saint Theresa on fire.

909
01:21:17,944 --> 01:21:18,925
Professor Langdon?

910
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,695
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

911
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,705
"Across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

912
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:31,629
Piazza Barba Rini is here.
Saint Theresa is here.

913
01:21:32,544 --> 01:21:34,661
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo,
the first altar of science?

914
01:21:34,869 --> 01:21:36,085
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

915
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:39,464
Thank you.

916
01:21:40,339 --> 01:21:41,735
St. Peter's is here.

917
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:44,074
We are here.

918
01:21:46,143 --> 01:21:47,748
A church with water.

919
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,001
Wait. Wait, wait.

920
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:53,195
Across Rome.

921
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:57,138
The poem must mean it's
literally across Rome.

922
01:21:57,865 --> 01:21:58,414
Professor Langdon.

923
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:01,177
Commander Richter has ordered me to
escort you to the Vatican immediately.

924
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:05,969
Piazza Navona. Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

925
01:22:06,403 --> 01:22:08,142
"A-Cross" Rome.

926
01:22:08,695 --> 01:22:10,252
Bernini's Four Rivers.

927
01:22:11,891 --> 01:22:14,841
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists
that I have to take you back immediately.

928
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:17,301
The Vatican is about to see its
fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

929
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:18,611
Now, look.

930
01:22:19,414 --> 01:22:22,239
You can do as they say and
force me back to the Vatican,

931
01:22:22,552 --> 01:22:24,833
where we can all mourn
his death together.

932
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:27,097
Or you can show me how real cops act

933
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:30,620
and take me to Piazza Navona,
where we still might be able to stop it.

934
01:22:34,336 --> 01:22:36,293
Oh. By all means, let's talk it over.

935
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:39,225
In fourteen minutes,
he's going to be dead.

936
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:46,578
Okay. This way, Professor.

937
01:22:55,288 --> 01:22:56,525
Yes, Padre?

938
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:59,718
At 11:15, if the church
is still in peril,

939
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:02,957
give the order to
evacuate the cardinals.

940
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,491
But with dignity.

941
01:23:06,305 --> 01:23:09,207
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

942
01:23:10,171 --> 01:23:12,329
We don't want the last
image of this church to be

943
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:14,400
of frightened old men
sneaking out the back door.

944
01:23:31,304 --> 01:23:32,634
"Where the angels guide thee..."

945
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:40,252
There it is. There it is.

946
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:42,880
Professor, I know this fountain.
There is no angel.

947
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:45,346
The dove. The angel of peace.

948
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:47,520
And it's looking in what direction?

949
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:49,519
Uh... east, I think.

950
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:03,613
Professor, just wait here. Stay put.

951
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,339
Good evening. Can you help me?

952
01:24:42,346 --> 01:24:44,166
I need a doctor.

953
01:24:59,856 --> 01:25:01,034
Come here.

954
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,225
Calm down. Don't shoot.

955
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:44,124
Hey!

956
01:25:57,835 --> 01:25:59,984
Help! Somebody help!

957
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,181
Help! Somebody!

958
01:27:50,738 --> 01:27:51,723
Cardinal Baja.

959
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:53,652
Cardinal Baja.

960
01:27:54,318 --> 01:27:55,344
Si?

961
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:57,172
Where was he hiding you?

962
01:27:58,170 --> 01:27:59,939
The Church of Illumination.
Where is it?

963
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:03,742
Castel Sant'Angelo.

964
01:28:05,294 --> 01:28:07,095
Castle of the Angel.

965
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:30,718
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja.

966
01:28:31,955 --> 01:28:34,816
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

967
01:28:35,594 --> 01:28:37,644
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

968
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:40,872
- Send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

969
01:28:41,422 --> 01:28:42,476
I'm staying here.

970
01:28:55,647 --> 01:28:56,701
Vittoria.

971
01:28:58,065 --> 01:28:59,890
- You're all right?
- I'm all right, yes. What about you?

972
01:28:59,892 --> 01:29:01,668
I just heard about
Olivetti on the radio.

973
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,641
I'm all right. I'm okay.

974
01:29:08,438 --> 01:29:10,579
Robert, we can't trust Richter.

975
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:11,735
He took Silvano's journals.

976
01:29:11,736 --> 01:29:14,209
There must be something in
there he doesn't want us to see.

977
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,348
The head of the Swiss Guard.

978
01:29:17,763 --> 01:29:20,472
From the Castel Sant'Angelo.
It's close enough so the wireless signal

979
01:29:20,473 --> 01:29:22,214
from that camera
could still reach the Vatican.

980
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:26,854
The Church of Illumination
is somewhere here

981
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:29,402
and your canister is inside it.

982
01:29:49,164 --> 01:29:50,605
Come with me.

983
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:57,820
For 400 years, the Illuminati
met right under the Church's nose.

984
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,981
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

985
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:05,551
If the explosion happens here, would
the blast radius take out the Vatican?

986
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:08,315
And part of Rome along with it.

987
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,298
They're pointing to it. The angels.

988
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,317
The container must be down there.
Come on!

989
01:31:15,633 --> 01:31:18,735
- Where are they going?
- Back to search the other castle.

990
01:31:19,085 --> 01:31:20,781
No, no. It has to be here!

991
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:26,985
Robert, it's a dead end.

992
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,622
No, it's not.

993
01:31:29,044 --> 01:31:31,146
See if you can find a flashlight.

994
01:31:47,787 --> 01:31:50,142
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

995
01:31:50,324 --> 01:31:52,594
Except right here. What is this?

996
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,462
It's a pentagram.

997
01:31:58,623 --> 01:31:59,860
An eye...

998
01:32:00,411 --> 01:32:01,842
that leads to...

999
01:32:01,846 --> 01:32:03,002
Nowhere.

1000
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:13,369
Robert?

1001
01:32:15,206 --> 01:32:18,274
These walls overlap and
there's a passageway in here.

1002
01:32:18,342 --> 01:32:19,723
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

1003
01:32:42,207 --> 01:32:45,249
It's a passageway that
leads to the Vatican.

1004
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:47,748
An ancient escape route.

1005
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,454
Oh, God.

1006
01:32:53,363 --> 01:32:54,451
Here.

1007
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:58,751
Look.

1008
01:33:16,852 --> 01:33:20,252
(Final Payment in VW at Via Giulia)
(Key taped to driver side front wheel)

1009
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,566
Get on the radio.

1010
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:34,469
Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

1011
01:33:34,473 --> 01:33:36,432
The Camerlengo gave the
order for evacuation at--

1012
01:33:36,593 --> 01:33:38,018
I'm counter-manning it.

1013
01:33:43,802 --> 01:33:45,791
This is it. This is their church.

1014
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:50,799
The canister should be
lit by artificial light.

1015
01:34:13,843 --> 01:34:15,016
It's not here, Robert.

1016
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:17,361
"The shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

1017
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:19,520
It's not here.

1018
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:21,857
What's the poem say?
- Nothing.

1019
01:34:21,908 --> 01:34:24,865
Nothing. It's all over.
There was just four lines,

1020
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:27,000
each one describing...

1021
01:34:35,947 --> 01:34:37,695
There's a fifth brand.

1022
01:34:37,745 --> 01:34:39,776
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

1023
01:34:40,177 --> 01:34:42,621
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

1024
01:34:43,628 --> 01:34:46,813
No, the papacy.
They intend to kill him.

1025
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:49,097
Before they destroy the Vatican,

1026
01:34:49,098 --> 01:34:51,004
they're going to brand
and kill the pope himself.

1027
01:34:51,054 --> 01:34:51,754
There is no pope.

1028
01:34:51,873 --> 01:34:53,629
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

1029
01:34:54,164 --> 01:34:55,865
The Camerlengo.

1030
01:34:57,505 --> 01:34:59,764
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

1031
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:03,513
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

1032
01:35:06,663 --> 01:35:08,404
Throw it in the fire.

1033
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,625
Murderer.

1034
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,584
You know, when they call me,

1035
01:35:23,234 --> 01:35:24,342
and they all call me,

1036
01:35:24,377 --> 01:35:25,956
it is so important to them

1037
01:35:25,963 --> 01:35:29,509
that I know that what they
ask is the Lord's will.

1038
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:32,620
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

1039
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,859
And I suppose they're right.

1040
01:35:40,303 --> 01:35:44,344
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now, would I?

1041
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,099
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1042
01:35:47,106 --> 01:35:49,398
You're still alive
because you have no weapon.

1043
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:50,974
And they didn't ask me to kill you.

1044
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:54,128
But if you pursue me,
it is another matter.

1045
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:02,278
Be careful.

1046
01:36:02,446 --> 01:36:04,425
These are men of God.

1047
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,084
The Camerlengo.

1048
01:36:26,106 --> 01:36:28,529
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1049
01:36:36,448 --> 01:36:37,462
Here. Here.

1050
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:03,156
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

1051
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:05,690
- I demand to see the Camerlengo!
- He is not available.

1052
01:38:07,377 --> 01:38:08,759
We'll see about that.

1053
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:20,619
Oh. It's a chiusa chiave.
It's a one way portal.

1054
01:38:20,659 --> 01:38:22,781
The only entrance is on the other side.

1055
01:38:23,334 --> 01:38:25,451
No. Hey! Help!

1056
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:35,929
This is Robert Langdon and
Dr. Vetra. Open the door.

1057
01:38:48,806 --> 01:38:50,670
The Camerlengo is in danger.

1058
01:39:03,858 --> 01:39:06,414
He's the one. He's got a gun.

1059
01:39:09,882 --> 01:39:12,104
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1060
01:39:12,673 --> 01:39:13,373
Illuminatus!

1061
01:39:13,507 --> 01:39:14,906
You bastard!

1062
01:39:22,744 --> 01:39:23,709
Padre?

1063
01:39:23,784 --> 01:39:27,237
Order the evacuation.
We only have nineteen minutes.

1064
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:32,608
Here. He's...

1065
01:39:32,693 --> 01:39:34,994
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

1066
01:39:34,995 --> 01:39:35,695
Yes, sir.

1067
01:39:48,913 --> 01:39:49,926
Robert?

1068
01:39:50,089 --> 01:39:52,848
The brand, the symbol.
Could it have another meaning?

1069
01:39:59,184 --> 01:40:02,382
Crossed keys,
but those were upside down.

1070
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:03,982
St. Peter.

1071
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:06,671
The first pope...

1072
01:40:07,774 --> 01:40:10,643
...was crucified upside down.
- On Vatican Hill.

1073
01:40:10,649 --> 01:40:13,512
- A few hundred feet below us.
- Necropolis. City of the dead.

1074
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:16,158
"Upon this rock, I
will build my church."

1075
01:40:16,162 --> 01:40:18,688
"Or bring it down upon itself."

1076
01:40:19,464 --> 01:40:22,682
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

1077
01:40:37,096 --> 01:40:38,635
The grid is still cycling.

1078
01:40:38,636 --> 01:40:40,541
The power to this section must be down.

1079
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:29,012
It must be here. It must be.

1080
01:41:39,806 --> 01:41:40,977
Don't touch it.

1081
01:41:42,482 --> 01:41:44,032
We have seven minutes.

1082
01:41:49,942 --> 01:41:52,139
Robert, hold this.

1083
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:33,893
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1084
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:35,256
What's wrong?

1085
01:42:35,343 --> 01:42:37,879
Cold decreases battery life.

1086
01:42:39,877 --> 01:42:43,202
- We may have less than five minutes.
- So?

1087
01:42:43,237 --> 01:42:46,134
If I pull the power with
less than five minutes...

1088
01:42:46,139 --> 01:42:49,070
the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1089
01:42:50,185 --> 01:42:52,098
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

1090
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:53,269
At least down here the damage--

1091
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:54,602
No!

1092
01:42:56,065 --> 01:42:57,532
- No. Wait!
- Father!

1093
01:43:00,053 --> 01:43:02,086
We are live here at
St. Peter's Square...

1094
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:05,382
where, despite a bomb threat,
and an orderly evacuation,

1095
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:08,074
the crowd is actually growing in size.

1096
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:10,875
As we await an official announcement
from the Vatican spokesman

1097
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,965
as to the exact nature of the threat

1098
01:43:12,969 --> 01:43:15,944
and whether or not they are
treating it as a credible danger...

1099
01:43:24,098 --> 01:43:25,002
This way!

1100
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,383
He's got a bomb with him.

1101
01:43:56,621 --> 01:43:57,682
A bomb?

1102
01:44:02,947 --> 01:44:05,504
Roberto, this is an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1103
01:44:10,219 --> 01:44:12,269
He's got clearance.

1104
01:44:35,814 --> 01:44:38,376
Oh, my God.

1105
01:46:34,912 --> 01:46:36,553
Get down!

1106
01:49:21,828 --> 01:49:23,152
Cardinal Strauss?

1107
01:49:23,952 --> 01:49:27,527
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

1108
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:31,248
He has saved the Church
and he's still alive.

1109
01:49:32,606 --> 01:49:34,617
Praise God. Praise God.

1110
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:41,130
He is alive.

1111
01:49:41,642 --> 01:49:44,378
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1112
01:50:11,566 --> 01:50:14,341
You know the worst thing
we thought would happen

1113
01:50:15,517 --> 01:50:18,831
was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

1114
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:23,300
We thought we could change the world.

1115
01:50:24,178 --> 01:50:27,964
- So naive.
- No, not naive.

1116
01:50:29,074 --> 01:50:30,545
Innocent, maybe.

1117
01:50:31,114 --> 01:50:33,252
But it's not a crime.

1118
01:50:34,702 --> 01:50:36,090
I'm not so sure.

1119
01:50:38,148 --> 01:50:39,906
Go back to work.

1120
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:42,685
Change the world.

1121
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:08,382
A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

1122
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,255
The Carmelengo's age
shouldn't influence the decision.

1123
01:51:11,434 --> 01:51:14,191
Signori, you are no doubt
aware that by Holy Law

1124
01:51:14,192 --> 01:51:17,004
the man is inelligible
for election to the papacy.

1125
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,327
He's not a cardinal.
He's a priest.

1126
01:51:19,328 --> 01:51:20,597
He's of insufficient age.

1127
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:23,678
Or maybe there's a way we
could consider the possibility.

1128
01:51:23,871 --> 01:51:27,839
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1129
01:51:28,008 --> 01:51:30,826
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1130
01:51:31,032 --> 01:51:33,608
But, signore, you
would not hold a ballot.

1131
01:51:33,811 --> 01:51:37,184
Surely, you remember? You gave
up your post as Great Elector.

1132
01:51:37,921 --> 01:51:40,064
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1133
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:42,888
Now, what happened here
tonight transcends our laws.

1134
01:51:43,108 --> 01:51:47,344
Has it? Is it God's will that
we give ourselves over to frenzy?

1135
01:51:47,448 --> 01:51:48,879
Discard the rules of the Church?

1136
01:51:48,919 --> 01:51:51,119
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1137
01:51:52,145 --> 01:51:57,747
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1138
01:51:57,987 --> 01:52:00,881
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly.

1139
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:03,605
Yes. If the Holy Spirit
speaks through us,

1140
01:52:04,126 --> 01:52:06,026
and we call a man's name out loud...

1141
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,972
That is election by adoration.

1142
01:52:09,402 --> 01:52:11,229
- Yes.
- He's God's choice.

1143
01:52:11,509 --> 01:52:17,248
Yes. And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy,

1144
01:52:17,252 --> 01:52:21,338
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1145
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,375
- Signor Camerlengo?
- Yes?

1146
01:52:55,376 --> 01:52:58,857
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

1147
01:52:58,942 --> 01:53:01,434
- Me?
- Yes, Padre.

1148
01:53:24,525 --> 01:53:25,947
What are you doing?

1149
01:53:25,997 --> 01:53:28,342
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1150
01:53:52,572 --> 01:53:54,045
Richter said...

1151
01:53:55,366 --> 01:53:57,700
His Holiness suffered from seizures

1152
01:53:57,705 --> 01:54:00,212
and steps were taken...

1153
01:54:00,421 --> 01:54:02,319
for safety.

1154
01:54:06,324 --> 01:54:08,869
He made sure he was watched, he said.

1155
01:54:10,952 --> 01:54:13,895
What if he were trying
to give me this key?

1156
01:54:15,059 --> 01:54:17,026
That's the Papal office.

1157
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,342
If the Pope was worried about seizures,

1158
01:54:19,343 --> 01:54:22,286
he must've had Richter install
cameras without telling anyone.

1159
01:54:22,321 --> 01:54:25,123
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1160
01:54:26,886 --> 01:54:28,861
Maybe it records.

1161
01:54:38,927 --> 01:54:43,572
- I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?

1162
01:54:43,573 --> 01:54:46,939
- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?

1163
01:54:46,941 --> 01:54:51,541
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.

1164
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:56,405
As such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work

1165
01:54:56,406 --> 01:54:58,426
and in need of spiritual guidance.

1166
01:54:58,434 --> 01:55:00,198
Like Galileo.

1167
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:02,845
About a month ago,

1168
01:55:02,849 --> 01:55:05,180
he requested an
audience with the Pope.

1169
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:06,113
But you know that,

1170
01:55:06,305 --> 01:55:09,586
cause you granted the audience and
you were also present during it.

1171
01:55:09,588 --> 01:55:12,766
The 'God Particle'. To actually
claim an act of creation.

1172
01:55:12,767 --> 01:55:17,154
- The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1173
01:55:17,259 --> 01:55:19,359
He urged him to go public.

1174
01:55:19,364 --> 01:55:22,071
His Holiness thought that
the discovery could actually

1175
01:55:22,172 --> 01:55:25,408
scientifically prove the
existence of a divine power.

1176
01:55:25,411 --> 01:55:28,614
And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1177
01:55:28,618 --> 01:55:31,220
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

1178
01:55:31,222 --> 01:55:32,034
But you...

1179
01:55:32,924 --> 01:55:36,664
You saw the pope's position
as a softening of church law.

1180
01:55:36,669 --> 01:55:40,484
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1181
01:55:40,519 --> 01:55:42,245
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1182
01:55:42,246 --> 01:55:44,337
He raised me to
protect this Church,

1183
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,923
even from within.

1184
01:55:47,667 --> 01:55:52,250
Then you conjured up an old enemy
from the past. The Illuminati.

1185
01:55:52,285 --> 01:55:54,786
You found the ancient brands
in the papal vaults

1186
01:55:54,787 --> 01:55:57,325
and put them to use
to spread fear!

1187
01:55:57,326 --> 01:55:59,792
The Cardinals are men of belief.

1188
01:55:59,829 --> 01:56:03,815
Right now, their belief
in evil is uniting them.

1189
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:06,815
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1190
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:08,402
There is no attack.

1191
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:12,588
You're trying to convince the
Cardinals they're in a war,

1192
01:56:12,593 --> 01:56:14,438
so they will choose a
warrior to lead them.

1193
01:56:14,442 --> 01:56:15,876
We are at war.

1194
01:56:15,878 --> 01:56:17,915
We're weak when we should be strong.

1195
01:56:17,919 --> 01:56:21,814
If science is allowed to
claim the power of creation,

1196
01:56:21,828 --> 01:56:23,586
what is left for God?

1197
01:56:23,621 --> 01:56:25,545
It didn't work, Patrick.

1198
01:56:26,233 --> 01:56:29,219
- It isn't finished.
- Oh yes, it's finished.

1199
01:56:31,491 --> 01:56:32,882
It's finished.

1200
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:36,945
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

1201
01:56:36,951 --> 01:56:39,131
The moment the doors
to the Conclave open,

1202
01:56:39,137 --> 01:56:41,292
he will tell the Cardinals
what you've done.

1203
01:56:42,181 --> 01:56:44,391
I was planning on doing this alone.

1204
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:48,850
Put it down.

1205
01:56:51,865 --> 01:56:53,892
But, perhaps,
it's better that you're here.

1206
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:55,320
Put it down.

1207
01:56:57,219 --> 01:56:58,956
Put it away.

1208
01:57:10,024 --> 01:57:13,620
Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.

1209
01:57:17,264 --> 01:57:19,696
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1210
01:57:20,053 --> 01:57:20,815
Illuminatus!

1211
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:21,967
You bastard!

1212
01:57:26,046 --> 01:57:27,153
Padre.

1213
01:57:37,055 --> 01:57:40,223
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

1214
01:58:29,671 --> 01:58:32,214
I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.

1215
01:59:42,237 --> 01:59:43,556
Gently.

1216
01:59:43,864 --> 01:59:45,238
But within our walls.

1217
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,823
He's on your side.

1218
02:00:46,153 --> 02:00:50,061
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

1219
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,550
Church sources now confirm that
Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna,

1220
02:01:42,551 --> 02:01:46,600
has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall...

1221
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,878
The Catholic church thanks
Camerlengo for his selfless act

1222
02:01:51,879 --> 02:01:54,360
and demands his
immediate canonization.

1223
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:57,324
The Vatican has also confirmed
the deaths of three Cardinals

1224
02:01:57,325 --> 02:01:59,451
and the fire in the
Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1225
02:01:59,546 --> 02:02:03,821
As we await the appearance of the new
Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy,

1226
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:05,525
one of the four original Preferiti,

1227
02:02:06,033 --> 02:02:08,174
who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption

1228
02:02:08,214 --> 02:02:09,759
seems to have been selected

1229
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,822
in one of the swiftest and smoothest
conclaves in modern church history.

1230
02:02:20,916 --> 02:02:22,669
Professor Langdon? Please.

1231
02:02:38,403 --> 02:02:41,859
A token of thanks from His Holiness

1232
02:02:42,361 --> 02:02:44,599
and from his new Camerlengo.

1233
02:02:46,073 --> 02:02:48,828
We are grateful you saved his life.

1234
02:02:48,937 --> 02:02:52,465
And it's our understanding
that you require this text

1235
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:54,965
to complete your scholary work.

1236
02:02:56,197 --> 02:03:00,998
We ask only that in your
last grand testament

1237
02:03:01,067 --> 02:03:03,861
you ensure it finds its way home.

1238
02:03:06,274 --> 02:03:07,623
Of course.

1239
02:03:07,841 --> 02:03:09,811
And when you write of us,

1240
02:03:09,934 --> 02:03:12,583
and you will write of us,

1241
02:03:12,832 --> 02:03:14,776
may I ask one thing?

1242
02:03:15,273 --> 02:03:16,996
Do so gently.

1243
02:03:19,048 --> 02:03:20,485
I'll try.

1244
02:03:20,781 --> 02:03:22,485
Religion is flawed,

1245
02:03:23,158 --> 02:03:26,063
but only because man is flawed.

1246
02:03:26,067 --> 02:03:28,681
All men, including this one.

1247
02:03:43,225 --> 02:03:45,177
He chose the name Luke.

1248
02:03:47,787 --> 02:03:50,862
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1249
02:03:51,967 --> 02:03:53,843
Never a Luke.

1250
02:03:54,208 --> 02:03:56,337
It said he was a doctor.

1251
02:03:56,781 --> 02:04:00,301
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

1252
02:04:01,206 --> 02:04:03,273
