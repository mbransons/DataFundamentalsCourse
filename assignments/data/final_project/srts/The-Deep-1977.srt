1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,578
Previously on Siren...

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:04,587
Just want to know where he is,

3
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:05,855
the one who killed my dad!

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,227
That's the reason you can't
go back in the water.

5
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,397
You help me with my problem,
I help you with yours.

6
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:10,997
I sense he is one of us.

7
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,631
I knew I was different.

8
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,571
Addiction, mental illness,

9
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,877
rare autoimmune condition.

10
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,102
Stop!

11
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:22,043
Your mother. My sister.

12
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,513
Gone.

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,751
- Cute place.
- Glen, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:27,349
I need you, Susan.

15
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,559
You need me, too.

16
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,428
Maddie, when did you get home?

17
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,730
You're high.

18
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,106
Ben is in my dream.

19
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:39,139
You might just be

20
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:40,533
scared of your feelings for him.

21
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,200
Who do you think about?

22
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:43,505
 Ben.

23
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,643
And you.

25
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,790
Good morning.

26
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,929
That was nice.

27
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,532
Being together last night.

28
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,816
Yes.

29
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,302
Together.

30
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,567
Yeah, it was.

31
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:58,728
When we kiss,

32
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,681
why do Ben and Maddie stop?

33
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:04,412
Don't look at me.

34
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,287
Well, we thought maybe
you weren't ready to...

35
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:13,688
Do more.

36
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:15,026
Yes.

37
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,517
Ryn wants more.

38
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:22,958
In water, we mate.

39
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:24,932
On land, we mate, too,

40
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,067
but we also...

41
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:28,268
Make love.

42
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:29,603
Make love?

43
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,313
Yeah. It's, uh... It's like mating,

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,009
just not for making babies.

45
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,404
It's, um...

46
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,412
Mostly we do it because it, um...

47
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,380
Because it feels good.

48
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,116
Because we love the person.

49
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:48,296
I don't think mating
feels so good for them,

50
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,898
especially the males.

51
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,874
The females, uh,

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,941
they bite them,

53
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,715
they hit them with their tails.

54
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:00,842
Sometimes males die
from too much mating.

55
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,658
Right.

56
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:08,319
Um, on land, it feels better
when things are equal.

57
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:09,484
Equal?

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,919
The same. It feels good for everyone.

59
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,989
Everyone gives love and gets love.

60
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:21,696
In water, female, male not equal.

61
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:23,898
Maybe this is bad?

62
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:27,869
No, not bad, just different.

63
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,824
And on land, things aren't
always equal, either.

64
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,623
I would like to make love.

65
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,804
With Ben and Maddie.

66
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,108
I think we'd like that.

67
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,943
Yeah.

68
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,860
Sister's daughter's gone.

69
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,194
What?

70
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:13,131
Maybe she went to see the others.

71
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:16,668
Helen, it's Maddie.

72
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:20,142
Damn! They can't keep doing this.

73
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,232
They're nocturnal,

74
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,346
I'm not.

75
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,582
Okay, I'm not gonna lie. This is, uh...

76
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,529
This is probably gonna hurt, all right?

77
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,021
Ready?

78
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,191
Whoa!

79
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:43,194
Yesterday, your guts were hanging out.

80
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,097
Today, you're healed.

81
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:50,936
All right, so, um...

82
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:52,270
So I think this is gonna work.

83
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,629
Our little arrangement? Win-win.

84
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,004
I scratch your back...

85
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,624
Maybe that's, um...

86
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,248
We both want the same thing.

87
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,515
You want to get back in the water,

88
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,304
I want that, too.

89
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,085
I'll figure out a way
to make that happen.

90
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:10,955
And you,

91
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,759
you're gonna help me get
the one who killed my dad.

92
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,664
Okay.

93
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,100
Let's do this.

94
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,970
Katrina.

95
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,137
Stop!

96
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,708
Down. Now.

97
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,059
Not safe to change.

98
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:51,760
Only when you need.

99
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,493
That's why they came here?

100
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,366
They want to be in water.

101
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,766
In their natural state.

102
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,070
Someday, you can go back home.

103
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,406
Just not right now.

104
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,553
Oh. Thank God, they're here.

105
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,113
I brought a little bit of food.

106
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:19,188
There's not much, Ryn.

107
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,979
They're going to have to share.

108
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,612
You eat now.

109
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,298
You eat with them.

110
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:33,700
Go.

111
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,835
You eat.

112
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,179
Hey! Where you going?

113
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,176
Hey!

114
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,375
Hey, come back here! We had a deal!

115
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,389
Come on!

116
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,152
Okay.

117
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,645
Fine! Fine, just...

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,450
Do it your way.

119
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,760
It was important, what you did.

120
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,696
For them to stay here,

121
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,931
they have to let go of the old ways.

122
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,166
And it won't be forever.

123
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,470
Yes. I know.

124
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,292
Okay. We go.

125
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,442
Ben.

126
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,487
Uh, yeah, sure, you can come with me.

127
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,097
I got work to do.

128
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,028
Come on.

129
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,166
I'll keep a good eye on them.

130
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,742
Is he okay here on his own?

131
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:12,521
Yes. He protects.

132
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,582
It is good for him.

133
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,333
Spaghetti for you!

134
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,642
Spaghetti for you!

135
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:43,211
Mommy, I love you.

136
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,082
Watch! Slide!

137
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,084
Whee!

138
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,302
I really need to go check on my mom.

139
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,396
I've avoided her long enough.

140
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:57,502
Mother makes you sad.

141
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,040
I can handle it.

142
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:14,889
Come.

143
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:31,239
You have pain. Inside.

144
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,284
Mother.

145
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,471
I bring you to her.

146
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,901
Oh, uh, hey.

147
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,518
Finally. You guys really set

148
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,444
your own hours around here, huh?

149
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,296
Uh, yeah, things have been

150
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:33,614
a little unpredictable lately.

151
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:38,096
That is, uh, Levi, my intern.

152
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:39,848
Hey, Levi, what's up?

153
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,887
So what's, uh... What's going on?

154
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,920
Look, I owe you a thank you.

155
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:50,214
You told me that Klesco Oil was

156
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,798
connected with those beached whales?

157
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,371
- Yep.
- You were right.

158
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,497
They were dragging that sonic cannon,

159
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,005
like you said, mapping the ocean,

160
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,403
and looks like they found
something down there.

161
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,881
What did they find?

162
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,182
Oil. Or, actually, the, uh...

163
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:04,732
The potential for oil.

164
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:07,238
Right. So now they
bring in a drill ship,

165
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,206
and they start poking holes

166
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,913
to confirm the deposits.

167
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,877
Did they say where this
might be happening?

168
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,582
Just off the coast here.

169
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,170
If they find oil down there,
none of this is gonna stop.

170
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,041
The mapping, the drilling.

171
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,135
Might have more than a few
beached whales on your hands.

172
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,942
The ecosystem can't handle it.

173
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,344
It'll collapse.

174
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,313
These assholes can't get away with it.

175
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,511
So let's get this out there.

176
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,658
Once my segment's ready,
you do an on-camera with me.

177
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,351
Of course. Whatever it takes.

178
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,820
Did you happen to catch

179
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,389
when the drill ship is being brought in?

180
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,158
If I had to guess, any day now.

181
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,504
Here is mother.

182
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,089
No.

183
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,134
There was a fight.

184
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,171
Your mother was hurt.

185
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,540
Who hurt mother?

186
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,478
A human.

187
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,746
Human?

188
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,184
- Human?!
- It was accident.

189
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,419
Not all humans are bad.

190
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:44,954
Not all humans kill.

191
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,057
You! Human!

192
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,404
When we were at the
Marine Research Center,

193
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,605
that guy came by.

194
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,032
Did you understand

195
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,616
what he was telling me?

196
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,447
Ben?

197
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,316
Shit.

198
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:17,186
- Hey, man, you here?
- Get back. Not a sound, okay?

199
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:22,157
- Hey, Xan, what's up?
- Hey.

200
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,892
We need to talk.

201
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,994
All right, let's, uh...

202
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,529
Let's go down to The Anchor,

203
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:29,464
grab a bite to eat. I'm starving.

204
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:31,299
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

205
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,634
All right.

206
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:46,581
Aw, damn.

207
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,033
Uh, my phone.

208
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,870
I'll be right back.

209
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,692
Yes. Xander.

210
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:59,961
The man you killed,

211
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:02,095
that was Xander's father.

212
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,490
Now, that is why I need you

213
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,505
to stay inside here.

214
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:09,202
If you go out and Xander sees you,

215
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:11,004
bad things will happen.

216
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,375
Tell me you understand what I'm saying.

217
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,611
Yes.

218
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,614
I stay.

219
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,283
Okay. I'll be back.

220
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,222
♪ Nobody's home... ♪

221
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:32,392
Yesterday, when you stopped by the boat,

222
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:34,427
I was hiding something.

223
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,663
Someone.

224
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,465
I found one of them,

225
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,068
the one that was there
the night of the street fight?

226
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:44,304
She was dying in the middle of the road,

227
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,739
so I took her back to The North Star...

228
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,544
Xander, she is dangerous, man.

229
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,193
You gotta be careful.

230
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,746
I know. She's crazy, for sure.

231
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:55,746
I mean, I started calling her Katrina,

232
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,873
- with the hurricane?
- Yeah.

233
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,047
She says that none of
them want to be here.

234
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:01,751
I mean, they want to go back.

235
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,155
I want to help make that happen.

236
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,357
They can't go back,

237
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:06,492
not with the noise pollution out there.

238
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,661
- And it's only getting worse.
- What do you mean?

239
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:10,330
They found oil.

240
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,303
They're bringing in a drill ship.

241
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,553
It's all ramping up.

242
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,134
What's that gonna do
to our fishing lanes?

243
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,404
Honestly? Five, ten years,
there won't be anything left.

244
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,673
Xander, we're gonna stop this.

245
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,343
We're gonna figure it out, Xan,

246
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,122
save our waters.

247
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:29,215
Mom? I'm back.

248
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,419
Mom?

249
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,656
Mom!

250
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:49,934
Mom?

251
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,770
Uh, yeah?

252
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,208
I didn't hear you come in.

253
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:58,577
Are you okay?

254
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,646
What happened?

255
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:06,352
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,053
I was doing good, I was,

257
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,522
and then I... I messed
up, and I called him.

258
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,223
Who did you call?

259
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:13,725
His name is Glen.

260
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,594
- Who is he?
- He's...

261
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,497
He supplies me.

262
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,599
He brought drugs into this house?

263
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,233
I started to get really shaky,

264
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,269
and, um, I don't know,

265
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,171
I knew where he was staying,
so I went there for more.

266
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:41,085
All right, gentlemen,

267
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,573
here are your pancakes.

268
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:43,679
Thanks, babe.

269
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,823
And I'll see you later tonight?

270
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,517
- Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
- Okay.

271
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,330
"Thanks, babe"?

272
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,631
She's nice.

273
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,734
Okay? We're just seeing where it goes.

274
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,469
I'm happy for you.

275
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:00,338

276
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:03,898

292
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,732
Lot of people been
installing these lately.

293
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,966
That right?

294
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,502
Yeah. It's... It's the drugs.

295
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,771
It causes a rise in crime.

296
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,560
We hear about it all.

297
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:39,234
Locksmiths, we are the

298
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,778
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

299
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,071
You have a break-in?

300
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:44,343
Break-out, actually.

301
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,457
My house guests like to wander.

302
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,555
Where are they now?

303
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,161
Upstairs, sleeping.

304
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,731
I shouldn't have stopped by.

305
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,670
No, no, not at all.

306
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:05,001
I'm happy you came.

307
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,936
All set.

308
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,071
Nobody's getting in or out,

309
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,674
unless you want 'em to.

310
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,067
Ooh.

311
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:17,113
I forget every time what
it feels like to come down.

312
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:18,324
Thank you.

313
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,664
Perhaps you should think about

314
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,375
that next time you start using.

315
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,462
There are things that I can't control.

316
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:26,935
Like your father going off to Seattle

317
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,077
and leaving me alone.

318
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,147
Mom, you gotta stop blaming

319
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,670
someone else for your problem.

320
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,700
Have you been cheating on Dad?

321
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,035
No.

322
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,532
I know I'm a lot of things,

323
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,639
but a cheater isn't one of them.

324
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,856
Glen was my dealer up there,

325
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,423
but we were never romantic.

326
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,122
Why did he come find you here?

327
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:54,437
Because I called him.

328
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,530
Yesterday.

329
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,383
I know your father gets back tonight,

330
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,824
and I will tell him the truth,

331
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,471
that I relapsed.

332
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:07,976
And no matter what happens,

333
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,978
I promise you,

334
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:12,546
I will not stop trying to get better.

335
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,651
You're my proof that
I did one thing right.

336
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,956
Glen?

337
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,725
He said he had business in Port Angeles.

338
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:26,827
Stay here.

339
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,499
Ryn.

340
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:35,402
Mom, it's my friend!

341
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:36,970
I'll be right back.

342
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,674
Is everything okay?

343
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,610
I tell sister's daughter what happen.

344
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,047
That human kill her mother.

345
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,498
No more secret.

346
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:52,869
What did she say?

347
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,698
She say Ryn...

348
00:21:58,452 --> 00:21:59,618
Is human.

349
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,476
Hi.

350
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,545
Um,

351
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,475
Helen just went to put
some clothes in the laundry.

352
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,294
That's... That's mine.

353
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:43,069
Uh, I don't think you want that.

354
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,436
That's medicine.

355
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:46,134
Hurt?

356
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,107
Yeah, I... I am.

357
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,011
Oh, good.

358
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,517
You're getting acquainted.

359
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,018
Something like that, yeah.

360
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:08,527
Maddie, aren't you gonna
introduce me to your friend?

361
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:10,829
Mom, this is Ryn.

362
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,612
Nice to meet you.

363
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,750
I'm Susan.

364
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:18,003
Hello, Susan.

365
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,442
You girls don't have to stay out here.

366
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,747
Ryn, do you like tea?

367
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:28,018
Mom, it's okay.

368
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,390
Tea?

369
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:34,452
Be careful, it's hot.

370
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,017
Nice tea.

371
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,966
Ryn, do I, uh, detect an accent?

372
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,095
She's an exchange student.

373
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,296
Oh, okay.

374
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,026
I'm really good at this.

375
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:57,534
I'm gonna say somewhere in Europe.

376
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,902
Scandinavia?

377
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:02,170
Iceland.

378
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:04,240
More like Finland.

379
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:06,412
Okay, that's close!

380
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:14,717
Your face is hurt.

381
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,261
Yes.

382
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:18,821
I got hurt.

383
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,459
Why?

384
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:21,796
Mom, you don't have to...

385
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,302
I spent time with some bad people.

386
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,028
You are bad?

387
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:30,866
No. She's not bad.

388
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,669
She's good.

389
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:38,306
I guess you can say
I'm a work in progress.

390
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,312
No.

391
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:45,848
No.

392
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,783
- No no no no no! No, no!
- What's wrong?

393
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:49,217
- My ring.
- What?

394
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:52,955
I like your mother.

395
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,090
Really?

396
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:58,360
Yes. She love Maddie.

397
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:02,125
It's not in there.

398
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,867
It must be in his room
at the Siren Song.

399
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:06,234
I gotta go! I gotta get my ring!

400
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,637
No way! He might be there.

401
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:11,001
He's gone at least until tomorrow.

402
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,240
I have to get it.

403
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:13,465
Mom, you can't.

404
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,871
It's my wedding ring.

405
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:21,348
I'll take you. Come on.

406
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:25,887
I go with you.

407
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:56,644
_

408
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,750
Mother.

409
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:09,154
Human kill mother.

410
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,889
Yes.

411
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,005
Ryn

412
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:15,327
let human kill.

413
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:19,062
I go home.

414
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,165
To water.

415
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:25,472
Come.

416
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,505
No humans.

417
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,308
No Ryn.

418
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,530
What'd your mother do now?

419
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:06,073
Nothing.

420
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,870
Oh, now you got me really worried.

421
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,009
Yeah. You heard about Klesco,

422
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,757
how they've been mapping
the area for oil deposits?

423
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:13,946
Sure.

424
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,775
They're gonna be moving in a drill ship

425
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,798
just off Thompson Seamount.

426
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,145
Hmm.

427
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:20,780
Where'd you hear that?

428
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,284
A reporter reached out to me.

429
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:27,582
This is gonna destroy our waters.

430
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:28,983
You know that, right?

431
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,285
Let's not overreact, Ben.

432
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,919
First of all, these things take time.

433
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,413
Nothing's going to happen overnight.

434
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,124
If they were just mapping,
you might be right.

435
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,192
But they're not.

436
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:39,327
They found oil, Dad.

437
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,785
Do you get that?

438
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,925
They're not going away.

439
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:44,599
What do you want me to do about it?

440
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:47,902
Form a coalition, local business owners.

441
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,337
Put some pressure on them.

442
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,439
Because, you know, we
can't stop progress.

443
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:53,708
This is not progress.

444
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,678
You got a good heart, Ben.

445
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:01,548
I wish we were all more like you.

446
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,753
I'll make a few calls,
see what I can do.

447
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:08,522
Thanks, Dad.

448
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,371
They know about art?

449
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,428
Oh, they know about a lot of things.

450
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:19,503
Civilized, in their own way.

451
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:23,257
There's something I
have to tell you, Helen.

452
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:27,328
When we first met,

453
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,808
you asked me if I had
any living relatives.

454
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:31,147
I said no.

455
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:32,666
Yeah?

456
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:38,038
This is my sister. Beth.

457
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:42,936
She's like us?

458
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:47,180
I'd always assumed I was the only one,

459
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,216
but of course there are more.

460
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:51,856
Beth isn't like us.

461
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:54,287
How so?

462
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:55,990
She's got a perfect life.

463
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,559
Husband, kids, nice house.

464
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:03,931
I didn't fit into that, obviously.

465
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:06,166
We got into fights,

466
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:10,137
and, uh, she said that
I was a danger to her.

467
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,041
She had me committed
to a state hospital.

468
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:19,446
After that, she refused to see me.

469
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,249
Like I don't exist.

470
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:24,684
I'm so sorry.

471
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:29,022
Maybe if you told her the truth,

472
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:31,558
she'd understand.

473
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:35,908
Maybe your sister has been struggling

474
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:38,981
on the inside the same as you.

475
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,902
- What, a camera?
- Yeah.

476
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:46,038
I want to see what
we're really up against.

477
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:47,373
What, the oil boat?

478
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:49,141
No, they're dragging a sonic cannon

479
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,876
through the water for mapping.

480
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,111
Right.

481
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,080
So, what's my job?

482
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,484
You get me close, then you wait.

483
00:31:58,557 --> 00:31:59,983
Uh, what if they spot me?

484
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,442
Sockeye are running.

485
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:04,390
Just a wayward trawler
out for an evening catch.

486
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:06,525
All right. Dumb fisherman.

487
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,211
Part I was born to play.

488
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:24,409
Let's go.

489
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:38,657
Mom, wait.

490
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:39,992
Do you have the room key?

491
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:41,159
No.

492
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:43,819
We need to be smart about this.

493
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,430
I need to get that ring back.

494
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,500
Mom, you're not gonna
break into a motel room.

495
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:52,337
All right, so then what do we do?

496
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,139
I'll figure it out.

497
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,671
What room is it?

498
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:58,734
Um, 202,

499
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,645
but I don't want you
cleaning up my mess.

500
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,980
I'm not cleaning up your mess.

501
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:04,549
I'm helping you.

502
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,351
Big difference.

503
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:11,017
I find your ring, you
put this behind you,

504
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,192
and we move forward.

505
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,329
Okay. Yes.

506
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,475
Hello?

507
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,843
It's Helen.

508
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,413
Are you here?

509
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,483
We brought you some food.

510
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,852
Ohh...

511
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,204
My God.

512
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,256
You're beautiful.

513
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:21,982
Where did you and Maddie meet?

514
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,747
On land.

515
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,914
I hope so.

516
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,485
I meet Maddie with Ben.

517
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,621
Oh. Okay.

518
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:33,757
Maddie really seems to love that Ben.

519
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,793
Yes. Ben is love.

520
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:39,395
Oh. That's sweet.

521
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,632
I would like to make
love with Ben and Maddie.

522
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,243
Oh.

523
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:46,211
O... kay.

524
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,723
These are restricted waters.

525
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,306
Clear the area.

526
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:45,426
Repeat. Clear the lane.

527
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:46,861
What?!

528
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:50,331
- Clear the area!
- No, I can't hear you!

529
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:53,081
It's a... It's a good
night for sockeye, yeah?!

530
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,720
They're really runnin'!

531
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,890
 Had to push 'em apart
into the wall, but...

532
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,559
As they're coming out of the turn,

533
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,844
he is leaving him absolutely no room.

534
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,950
I mean, they are just screaming tandem.

535
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,311
Family.

536
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,918
You come with.

537
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:53,894
Um, excuse me?

538
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,221
Yeah.

539
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:58,748
Somebody threw a bunch of
lounge chairs into the pool.

540
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:00,851
Seriously?

541
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,335
Seriously.

542
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,878
I don't get paid enough for this shit.

543
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:48,080
Shit.

544
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:04,231
Who the hell are you?

545
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,866
What're you doing here?

546
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:14,138
- The power of that thing.
- Yeah?

547
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,279
Yeah, I had no idea it
would be so intense.

548
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:19,543
It blasted me back, Xander,
like, a hundred feet.

549
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,880
Wow, that's crazy, man.

550
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:27,652
Hey, there they are.

551
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,701
Uh, dude, you should see this.

552
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,357
Well, I appreciate you understanding

553
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:11,748
me needing to get my mom's ring back.

554
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:15,065
No problem. Your mom,
she's very special to me.

555
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,868
I need to get going.
I was just needing to...

556
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,570
Not yet.

557
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,938
Hang out for a bit.

558
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,106
My mom's married to a sheriff.

559
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:25,542
Yeah. Where's he?

560
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:27,077
I don't want any trouble.

561
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,611
No one does.

562
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,115
I was just living my life,

563
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,620
and then, ring, your mom calls up,

564
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:33,650
wants to make things right.

565
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:35,618
She wants to move on with her life.

566
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:36,854
Does she?

567
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:40,790
'Cause she called me.

568
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:45,341
You bitch!

569
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:47,898
No!

570
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,209
All right, you and me time.

571
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:01,344
Come on!

572
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,121
Yah!

573
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:35,731
