My, my, my.

9
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:53,257
- Oh, good afternoon Miss Morrison.
- How you do Mrs. Perkins?

10
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,142
Nice and pretty all this, isn't it?

11
00:03:55,606 --> 00:04:00,718
That one little Mary dancing over there,
the one in the blue dress. Cute, isn't she?

12
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,701
- Yes.
- I was queen of the May once..

13
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,666
Don't look it now, do I?

14
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:13,541
Kip...

15
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,275
You mind if I sit here beside you?

16
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,091
Oh, of course not
Miss Morrison, I'd be very glad.

17
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:23,697
Hardly expected to find you
alone on a day like today.

18
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,440
No? Well I guess a fellow
likes to be alone sometimes.

19
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:31,555
- Where's Barbara?
- I don't know.

20
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,532
- Somewhere around I guess.
- You guess?

21
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:40,542
- You and she haven't quarreled, have you?
- Oh, no.

22
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,352
No, nothing like that.

23
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,819
There's one of those
New York singing teachers in town and...

24
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,719
she's been having auditions.

25
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,502
- Sort of takes up most of her time.
- She didn't tell me about it.

26
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:59,448
Yeah, this fellow says that if she went to New
York and had her voice trained he could...

27
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,387
He could make her an
opera star in about seven years.

28
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,954
You know, a career, success and all that.

29
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,890
- She won't do it.
- I think she will.

30
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,034
You see, her folks
aren't standing in her way.

31
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,069
Just me.

32
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,606
I wouldn't worry too
much about it if I were you Kip.

33
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,294
- It'll all work out, you know.
- Thank you, Miss Morrison.

34
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,931
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

35
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:40,178
- Well, here we are.
- Oh, it was such a beautiful drive.

36
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,897
Oh, you enjoyed it, fine, I'm so glad.

37
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,290
- There.
- Hello Barbara.

38
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,088
- Hello Miss Morrison.
- I was wondering where you were.

39
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:52,245
Well I, oh
Miss Morrison, this is Mr. Bulliet.

40
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,802
- How do you do?
- Miss Morrison.

41
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:57,165
I've missed you these last few days.
When you coming over to see me?

42
00:05:57,195 --> 00:06:00,883
Very soon, I've lots of things to
tell you, I may be going to New York.

43
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,577
Oh, how exciting.

44
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,480
Miss Roberts has an
extraordinarily promising voice.

45
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,809
We're going to try to make a star out of her.

46
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,092
Oh, that is exciting.

47
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,606
- You must tell me all about it child.
- Later this afternoon?

48
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,491
- Yes, I'll be home all day, you stop by.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:21,916
- Good day, Mr. Bulliet...
- Yes, good day Miss Morrison.

50
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,201
Good day.

51
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:27,847
Who was that?

52
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:31,047
Miss Morrison? Oh, she's a
darling, she lives next door to us.

53
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:32,998
Nobody really knows anything about her.

54
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:35,213
Her cupboard is rattling with skeletons, eh?

55
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:37,742
Not really, she's a very
sweet, sheltered old lady.

56
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,241
Well, I've be leaving Mr. Bulliet.
Thanks so much for the drive.

57
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,642
That's quite all right
my dear, glad to have you.

58
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:50,616
Morning.

59
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,838
There you are, I was
wondering what had happened to you.

60
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:09,453
I only walked as far as
the maypole on the green.

61
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:17,822
You haven't made yourself
tired walking all that way?

62
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:19,931
No, no, no.

63
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:24,483
- Of course not.
- I'll make you some nice, hot tea.

64
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,481
You shouldn't have gone, you know, not today.

65
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:45,667
May day seems almost
the same as any other day...

66
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:50,525
- sometimes.
- Yes, yes.

67
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:52,784
I'll get the tea.

68
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:30,199

I've heard enough,
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

77
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,629
But Kip, you don't understand,
you just Ben pig-headed.

78
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,583
All I know is that I can offer you a
home and my love, like keep in comfort.,

79
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,713
That's not good enough for you, I'm sorry.

80
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,370
And I'll be as pig
headed as I darn well choose.

81
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,998
- I have the right to a career.
- Sure, you got a right to a career.

82
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:12,912
And I got a right to a home and wife
but that can go hang itself, can't it?

83
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,089
All right.

84
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,915
Go ahead and have your career.
See how far it gets you, I'm through.

85
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:22,186
Well, I'm through too
and I never want to see you again.

86
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,558
I, I don't want to see
you again either, goodbye.

87
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:26,588
Goodbye.

88
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:31,868
Barbara.

89
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Oh...

90
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,618
I think I'm going to cry, you mind?

91
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,692
Oh, there, there, child.

92
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:47,144
It really isn't as terrible
as it seems, you know.

93
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:48,845
There...

94
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,833
But I was right, wasn't I? I was right.

95
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,401
You mean you never want to see him again?

96
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,339
No, I never meant that.

97
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,118
But I'm right about
going to New York, aren't I?

98
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,169
Why, I regret it all my life if I didn't.

99
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:08,151
That's what he won't
see, why won't he see it?

100
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,982
How can he be so selfish?

101
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,207
Perhaps it's because he loves you child.

102
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:17,307
- Couldn't love me and talk to me like that.
- Oh, I think he could.

103
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,476
If losing you meant
losing everything else too.

104
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:24,415
Oh, it isn't that. It's just selfishness.

105
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,708
He doesn't want me even to have a chance.

106
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:33,407
Can you understand Miss Morrison?
I want to try, that's all.

107
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:39,066
I just want the chance to become a famous singer
like, like Tetrazzini or Jenny Lind or...

108
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,800
or Marcia Mornay.

109
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,421
Yes...

110
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,933
Yes, I can understand.

111
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,307
- But I can understand other things too.
- What other things?

112
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,230
I've never talked to you
about myself, have I child?

113
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:03,380
No I...

114
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:07,999
I never talk to anyone usually, but...

115
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,365
I'm going to talk to you about myself now.

116
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,457
You see...

117
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,546
I was Marcia Mornay.

118
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,275
You...

119
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:24,956
Yes...

120
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:29,246
Many, many years ago.

121
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,856
I was very young.

122
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,879
It's Paris...

123
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,514
In the court of Louis Napoleon...

124
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,613
Oh Nicolai, I'm beginning to feel nervous.

125
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,816
- For no reason.
- For every reason, I'm frightened of kings.

126
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,209
- Louis Napoleon is an emperor.
- Same thing.

127
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,202
Not at all, kings descend from kings.

128
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:22,439
Louis Napoleon descended from
little corporals, there is a difference.

129
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:31,731
- Oh, you see, I'm still nervous.
- You mistrust my judgment?

130
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,098
Oh Nicolai.

131
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,728
I present my singers at court...

132
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:38,079
when they are fit to be presented
at court, neither before or later.

133
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,827
You're walking too fast.

134
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:44,558
- It's undignified.
- I feel undignified.

135
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:45,829
Getting sticks.

136
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,795
Now, what do I do when I'm
presented to the emperor?

137
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,736
- Curtsy.
- Nothing else?

138
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,739
- You mistrust my sense of etiquette too?
- No Nicolai.

139
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:03,160
Mademoiselle Mornay and monsieur Nazaroff.

140
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,562
After hearing you at
the opera the other night...

141
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,299
we're all impatient to hear
you sing again mademoiselle.

142
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,448
Mademoiselle Mornay is
deeply honored your majesty.

143
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,200
Would mademoiselle care to
rest herself a few moments...

144
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:24,466
- after her journey from the theater?
- Oh, thank you your majesty.

145
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,056
Shall we waltz?

146
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:49,380
I do anything wrong?

147
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,139
Curtsy was a little
stiff, only the empress noticed it.

148
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,637
- Oh, I feel much better now, thank you.
- Naturally.

149
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:30,711
So that's his latest protegee or
is protegee quite the right word?

150
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,512
- There is another.
- I don't envy her.

151
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:38,337
- I hear he drives his singers unmercifully.
- Oh no, not all the time.

152
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:39,977
He can be very human.

153
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,007
- What?
- Yes?

154
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,287
So I hear.

155
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:50,392
You see that gentleman
a bubble with gaiety over there?

156
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,107
That is Trentini.

157
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,331
The great composer? Oh, Nicolai.

158
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,753
Sounded almost naive.

159
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:05,768
Now, if Trentini wrote an opera
for you, you would become immortal.

160
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,828
Oh but, do you think he
would write an opera for me?

161
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,875
No, not without persuasion.

162
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:21,500
- Mademoiselle Mornay.
- See that you sing well.

If I may pay you a sincere
compliment mademoiselle Mornay...

193
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,422
you are the first singer I've met in years...

194
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,609
that did not open the conversation by
asking me to write an opera for her.

195
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,310
Thank you very much.

196
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,790
You know, I'm afraid I
must claim credit for that.

197
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,704
It was I who told
mademoiselle Mornay you had retired.

198
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,921
- You did what?
- So Patellli told me.

199
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:21,938
- And who told Patellli?
- You mean it's not true?

200
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:26,017
It is not, I haven't the
slightest intention of retiring.

201
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:28,039
Oh, a relief.

202
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,162
- When did Patellli tell you this?
- Oh, let me see, I...

203
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:39,085
I've gone to him to commission an opera for
Mlle. Mornay, it must be nearly a week ago.

204
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:45,176
- So you admire Patellli's music, eh?
- I think it will live.

205
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,631
- So will mine.
- Oh longer, far longer sir.

206
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:49,604
But...

207
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:55,060
when genius is hard to approach, one
is forced to approach Patellli instead.

208
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,090
Quite.

209
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:05,545
- Is he writing this opera?
- So he gave Mlle. Mornay to understand.

210
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:08,531
Treacle, he writes treacle.

211
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:14,533
Mlle. Mornay needs a composer to
serve that voice, not a ballad scribbler.

212
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:20,591
- Mlle. Mornay, another compliment.
- Oh, thank you signore Trentini.

213
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,079
You want quality, inspiration...

214
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:27,239
not tum tum tum, tum tum tum.

215
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:33,298
You need a, a Schubert a Mozart a...

216
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:34,501
A Trentini?

217
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:38,798
- You are too kind.
- I give honor where honor is due sir.

218
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,908
But then, don't give it to Patellli.

219
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,302
And deprive mademoiselle of her opera?

220
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:46,823
Other composers write operas beside Patellli.

221
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:50,118
But not by request, for example you, sir.

222
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,045
I have not yet been requested.

223
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,294
Then on behalf of Mlle. Mornay,
may I ask you to write her an opera?

224
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,973
I would be honored.

225
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,387
Thank you signore.

226
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:12,971
Oh, Nicolai, Nicolai, I'm so happy.

227
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,714
Ellen, I'm to have an opera written
specially for me by the great Trentini.

228
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:23,618
- Oh mademoiselle, how splendid.
- It isn't wonderful? An opera by Trentini.

229
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:25,778
By Trentini...

230
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:32,655
Oh Nicolai, I can never, never thank you.
You, you've been so kind, so patient, so...

231
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,096
so wonderful, I can hardly believe it's true.

232
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,191
Oh, I can't believe it's really true.

233
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:43,294
It...

234
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,656
it'll gradually penetrate.

235
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,125
Oh, you remember when I met
you that day in New York?

236
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,832
How you told me if I obeyed
you, you'd make me famous.

237
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:56,139
And how I laughed because I
didn't believe anyone could.

238
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:00,403
Oh Nicolai, Oh, Nicolai...

239
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,933
How could you know then
what I was going to become?

240
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:07,045
I was so plain and gawky
and I know I croaked when I sang.

241
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:08,719
Marcia...

242
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,390
- Come here.
- Yes, Nicolai.

243
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:21,452
- Do you realize what tonight means?
- Yes, I think so.

244
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,595
- Means my share of the work is over.
- Oh no, Nicolai...

245
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,985
You've worked, you always obeyed me.

246
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:32,402
You've let nothing stand between you and
your career, you deserve your success.

247
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,139
During all our association,

248
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:37,225
I've never once come
into your private life, have I?

249
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:41,759
- No.
- I've never demanded anything of you, have I?

250
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,405
No, you've been very sweet Nicolai.

251
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:46,797
You've been half afraid I would, haven't you?

252
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:49,057
Now and then I've seen it in your eyes...

253
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,909
wondering when the
lightning was going to strike.

254
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:54,852
- No Nicolai.
- You were right to.

255
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,467
After all, I've trained other
women and demanded things of them.

256
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:00,688
You knew all about it.

257
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:05,471
I owe all of my
success to you, I always will.

258
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:10,966
If there, is any way I can repay you?

259
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,589
There is.

260
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,972
Poor Marcia, I'm asking a very high price.

261
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,714
I want to marry you.

262
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,468
- Oh Nicolai...
- You've only to say yes or no.

263
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,267
I know you don't love me, now...

264
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:36,276
but I love you.

265
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,882
Well? Which is it?

266
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,358
Oh, I should be very happy to marry you.

267
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,114
Oh Ellen, I was worried, it's quite late.

268
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,733
Yes, I know. I'll be
along in just a few minutes.

269
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:05,128
Ellen is right, you've 3
hours' sleep to make up young lady.

270
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:10,171
Ellen, close the curtains and don't
wake mademoiselle till midday tomorrow.

271
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:12,351
- Oui monsieur...
- Oh, not as late as that.

272
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:16,061
You're singing tomorrow night.
By Jove, it's tonight now.

273
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:18,802
What sort of voice do you think you'll be in?

274
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:21,281
After the alarums and
excursions of this evening.

275
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,173
I may not wake you till
just before the performance.

276
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,940
- Good night.
- Good night.

277
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,970
Good night.

278
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,847
Dear Nicolai.

279
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:50,352
- Oh Ellen?
- Oui mademoiselle?

280
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,804
Ellen, I'm going to be married.

281
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,809
Why, that's very nice Mlle,
I'm sure. May I congratulate you?

282
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:02,137
Thank you.

283
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:07,657
- Aren't you surprised?
- No mademoiselle, I rather expected it.

284
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:11,211
- I hope you'll be happy.
- Thank you.

285
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:16,049
It's really a tremendous
compliment, isn't it?

286
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:21,325
I mean, he's such a great man.

287
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,827
Of course, I'm a little
confused about everything.

288
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,678
So many things have happened at once.

289
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:30,236
Singing for an emperor and having an opera
written specially for me and now this. I...

290
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:33,749
I sort of can't make anything seem real.

291
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:39,325
I'd just go to sleep and forget all about it
till tomorrow, otherwise you'll be tired.

292
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,510
But I'm not the least bit sleepy, I...

293
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:45,065
I feel restless and, and unsettled and...

294
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Oh I...

295
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,666
I want to do something to
bring me back to my senses.

296
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,304
- Ellen...
- Oui mademoiselle?

297
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,083
- Give me a dress.
- Whatever for?

298
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:16,304
I'm going out for a ride, just a little ways.
I must get some fresh air to make me wake up.

299
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:18,887
- What sort of a dress?
- The brown moire.

300
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:19,958
Ah, oui, oui.

301
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:23,265
But mademoiselle, do you think
monsieur Nazaroff would approve?

302
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:25,681
Oh, but he needn't know,
I only be gone a few minutes.

303
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,282
He'd be furious if he finds out.

304
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,917
- Oh, you won't tell him Ellen darling.
- What happens if he finds out for himself?

305
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:34,518
Oh mademoiselle, there's no sense
in what you're doing, it's, it's silly.

306
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:38,098
Yes, I know, I know but I keep telling
you, I'm only going a little way.

307
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:40,158
I only be gone 10 minutes at the most.

308
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,807
I simply must get away by
myself Ellen, just for once in my life.

309
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,885
- Driver.
- Where to madame?

310
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:13,365
Just keep driving
until I tell you to turn around.

311
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,288
- Just anywhere?
- Yes, just anywhere.

312
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:17,959
It shall be so, giddup Jemmy.

313
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:28,496
- Have you had a quarrel?
- What?

314
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,107
He'll have cooled down
by the time you get back.

315
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:36,211
Oh yes, yes, I hope so.

316
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,820
- Oh driver, driver...
- Had enough?

317
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,133
- Yes, yes. Take me back home please.
- It shall be so.

318
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,272
Jemmy, Jemmy, come back.

319
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:40,820
Don't worry ma'am,
don't worry, don't go away.

320
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,855
I'll be back in a minute.
Jemmy, come back do you.

321
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:49,476
I'm mad at you, why you do this?
Come back, I'll kill you.

322
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:53,152

00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,221
- Do it again.
- Oh, no.

362
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,884
- Jumping swordfish, you're American.
- Yes.

363
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:00,384
- Yippee.
- Please.

364
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:02,727
But don't you realize how wonderful
it is? You've been sent from heaven.

365
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:05,912
I've been starved, starved for the sound of
one, good, clean, healthy American voice...

366
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:07,149
and then suddenly you come into my life.

367
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,066
Not only an American voice,
not only an American woman...

368
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,917
but a beautiful, adorable,
glamorous, glorious, radiant...

369
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:14,543
indescribable vision
of perfected loveliness, shake.

370
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,751
- Anyone ever tell you all that before?
- No, not all at once.

371
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:19,585
Well, then I'll tell you again when I get my
breath back. You're the most beautiful...

372
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,786
No, don't trouble. I think I can remember it.

373
00:39:21,787 --> 00:39:25,714
It's no trouble. Who are you? Where
you come from? Will you be in Paris long?

374
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,218
May I see you tomorrow?

375
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:28,769
- No.
- No.

376
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,349
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Why not?

377
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,752
I'm a prima Donna.

378
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:37,614
- And you don't like prima Donnas.
- Nonsense. Why, I adore prima Donnas.

379
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:38,069
Oh, yes?

380
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,665
If there's anything I like before and
above everything else it's a prima Donna.

381
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:44,416
Any of these fellows will tell you.
Hey fellows, don't I adore prima Donnas?

382
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,329
Yes.

383
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,559
There, you see? Now, may I see you tomorrow?

384
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:50,639
Ecoutez mes amis, it's
mademoiselle Marcia Mornay, the singer.

385
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,740
Yes, I saw her last night at the opera.

386
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:54,386
Marcia Mornay?

387
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,932
Let's have a song.
Come on, let's go have a song.

388
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,329
Belay, haul off, give the lady air.

389
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,759
Where are your manners, you blocks,
you stones, you senseless idiots.

390
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,929
- But we want a song.
- But mademoiselle wants privacy.

391
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:15,281
Back to your old
sofas and cheeses, you termites.

392
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,023
I saw her first.

393
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,998
- The thing is now become intimate.
- Thank you.

394
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:24,520
- I'm glad I have a champion.
- Mademoiselle, you have an adoring slave...

395
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,344
a protector, a worshiper who
would give his life for you.

396
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,142
The least you can do is
to have supper with him.

397
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,413
No, I'm awfully ashamed
but I'm afraid I'll have to refuse.

398
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,998
Give me one good reason why.

399
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,901
Well, I've just had supper.
I couldn't eat another.

400
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:38,810
I'm crushed, humiliated.

401
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:40,519
Also a little offended.

402
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,861
What about a small ration
of bacon and two eggs? No.

403
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,367
About, one egg?

404
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,730
La belle dame sans merci.

405
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,256
Will you have supper
with me tomorrow night then?

406
00:40:50,257 --> 00:40:53,729
- I'm singing at the Opera.
- After the opera? Before the opera?

407
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,402
Lunch, have lunch with me.
You can't shake your head at that too.

408
00:40:57,403 --> 00:41:00,501
- I can, I must...
- I see, you don't like me, eh?

409
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:04,207
Oh, but I like you very much
and I like your voice too.

410
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:07,203
Oh, but really you have a
wonderful voice, really but...

411
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:11,017
Well, I, I'll just be awfully busy
during the rest of my stay in Paris.

412
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:13,134
I really can't see you again.

413
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:16,291
Oh, just for a few minutes,
3/4 of an hour for lunch tomorrow.

414
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:17,822
I've a real Virginia ham...

415
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,571
if you're a true American,
you can't look a gift ham in the frill.

416
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:22,155
Oh Noah, lost your ark?

417
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,862
- There's my cabby, I really must be going.
- I'll see you to your coach.

418
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:26,639
Oh no, please. Please, I'd rather you didn't.

419
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,540
You're not going mademoiselle.
We can't let her go, can we?

420
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,574
No, not without a song, eh?

421
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,270
- Then I'm never going to see you again?
- No.

422
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,749
Will it matter to
you if I die of a broken heart?

423
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:44,829
Oh, you won't.

424
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:47,440
I'm in a terrible hurry, good night.

425
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,722
Thank you so much for
taking such good care of me.

426
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:50,873
Come to lunch tomorrow.

427
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:53,689
- Oh, but I can't, besides I, I...
- I'm Paul Allison.

428
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,613
And I live on the top floor of this house.

429
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:58,992
I'll expect you for lunch tomorrow and I won't
let go of your hand till you say you'll come.

430
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:02,093
Oh well, it won't do any good,
quite impossible, I promise you.

431
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,537
- Let go of my hand please.
- Not till you promise to come to lunch.

432
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:07,069
Virginia ham, promise?

433
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,222
Why, I can't.

434
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,085
- Please let go.
- No.

435
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:12,605
Oh Mr. Allison, I may get into
terrible trouble through all this.

436
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:15,627

It shall be so, Jemmy..

Really, really, this has gone far enough now.

439
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:24,340

- Not till you promise.

440
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,341
- Oh Mr. Allison, get off.
- I won't let go till you promise.

441
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:30,692
Let go of my hand.
Will you hurt yourself. Do be careful.

The loveliest woman in Paris.

With humility and tears in
my eyes, I'm asking you.

480
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:07,529
How do you expect me to train your voice
when you come home at this time of the night?

481
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:09,805
- I mean, of the morning.
- Night.

482
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:13,121
Morning, the sun is already rising.

You bad boy.

Making fun with strange ladies.

486
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:29,548
Will I ever put you into the opera when
you play such, such shnookety gooks.

487
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:31,090
Mit your voice, eh?

488
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,424
I ask you, how do you expect me to do it?

489
00:46:35,454 --> 00:46:39,057
- How do you expect anyone to do it?
- I don't.

490
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:43,127
There you got it, there you
are putting your thumbs on it.

491
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,092
You, you, you ain't got ambition.

492
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:48,368
You ain't got application.

493
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,345
You are fooling about it, ain't it?

494
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:55,952
Honestly Paul Allison,
you are breaking my heart.

00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,289

- Oh, but Archipenko...

00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,117
guess who's coming to lunch.

497
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:04,805
Guess who? Now we're going to play games, eh?

498
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,639
- Marcia Mornay.
- And another thing I want to...

499
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:13,602
- Hello, please, what was that name?
- Marcia Mornay is coming to lunch.

00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,229

- Yes, how much is it?

506
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,662
On account of Jem it's
discounted. I'll make it 10 francs.

507
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:41,245
Oh I, I seem to have...

508
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,161
Well, I'll have to throw the money
to you from that window up there.

509
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,545
- That'll be all in all ma'am.

Oh Ellen...

511
00:48:25,376 --> 00:48:28,041
May I ask for an explanation.

512
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,531
If there is one?

513
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:34,465
I'm sorry, I've been
very foolish, forgive me.

514
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,704
- Where have you been?
- I went for a drive in a cab.

515
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,613
- With whom?
- With no one.

516
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,672
- With whom?
- I'm not lying.

517
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:50,556
That was a very sane and rational thing
to do at this time of night, wasn't it?

518
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:56,833
Oh Nicolai, please try to understand.
I was excited, overexcited and happy I...

519
00:48:56,863 --> 00:49:01,004
I couldn't sleep, I only intended
to drive a little way so I could sort of...

520
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:03,388
think things over and calm down.

521
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:06,316
And then there was
an accident, the horse broke loose.

522
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:09,553
I had to wait in the cab
until the driver caught him.

523
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,083
That's what happened, honestly.

524
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:17,579
Well, the driver's still downstairs, I didn't
pay him, you can ask him if you like.

525
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:20,407
I'll go down and pay him.

526
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,640
- How much does mademoiselle owe you?
- 40 francs.

527
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:42,369
She, she tells me you've had an accident.

528
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:45,614
Yes, the harness broke and Jemmy ran away.

529
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:48,527
But it's always happening
monsieur, think nothing of it.

530
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:51,644
I...

531
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,043
Never, never mind about the change.

532
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:05,506
He's coming back now.
Oh mademoiselle, I implored you not to go.

533
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,639
But I haven't done anything I shouldn't.

534
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,806
Was he very angry?

535
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:15,720
He didn't say anything, he just stood
there, waiting. He never moved once.

536
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,549
- Forgive me.
- Oh, it was nothing.

537
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:34,478
- You had a right to be angry.
- I had no right whatever.

538
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,500
- Good night.
- Good night.

539
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:51,778
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.

540
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:52,860
Goodbye.

541
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:07,304
- Hello Paul.
- Hello.

542
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:13,643
You wish you were
going there tonight, don't you?

543
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:15,949
- Well, don't you?
- I am going.

544
00:51:15,979 --> 00:51:17,846
- So am I.
- Got your tickets?

545
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:20,203
- Not yet.
- Oh, then you're not going.

546
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:23,518
- The house was sold out days ago.
- I'm going in the gallery.

547
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:28,967
Have you seen that line of people waiting?
It's halfway around the opera house already.

548
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,019
Tell me, is Mornay
really as great as they say?

549
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,545
Oh, what a voice she has, what a voice.

550
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:41,523
There's never been anything like it.
I've got two seats in the front row.

551
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:43,189
Front row?

552
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,538
And what a trouble it took to get them.

553
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:46,914
Hey, waiter.

554
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:49,126
- Monsieur?
- Here.

555
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:55,721
Here they are. My friend, all the money
in Paris wouldn't buy those two tickets.

556
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:59,291
You wish you'd booked early now, don't you?

557
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:01,484
- Your change monsieur.
- Oh, yes.

558
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,688
- Hey, what are you doing there? What is...
- Pardon monsieur.

559
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,670
- Fool you...
- Sorry.

560
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,763
Clumsy.

00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,736
- Oh, allow me.
- Thank you.

562
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:12,632
For that, you get no tip.

563
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,459

Well, I shouldn't.

578
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:24,216
And you're just as beautiful in the daytime.

579

Come in.

580
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:35,589

- All that matters is that you're here.

Oh, excuse me.

582
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:42,117
This is August Archipenko,
Mademoiselle Marcia Mornay.

583
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,569
- How do you do?
- Oh mademoiselle, what an honor.

584
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,822
- I can only say what an honor.
- Thank you.

585
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,502
Archipenko is my maestro.

586
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,876
He try to make an opera singer out of me.

587
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:51,901
Yeah.

588
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:53,620
Professor of music...

589
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,301

590
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:00,729

591
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,805
- But no pupils except me.
- Yeah.

592
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,797
- How do you like our little suite?
- Oh, I like it.

593
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,279
It sort of reminds me
of when I first started.

594
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,796
Oh, but you haven't seen it all.

595
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:19,281
Well, over here, the view from the
balcony embraces the Tuileries,

596
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:23,011
the Place de la Concorde, the Louvre
and the backyard of the local milkman.

597
00:54:23,012 --> 00:54:25,162
We see him watering the milk every morning.

598
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:28,631
- But I can't stay Mr. Allison.
- Ah, no?

599
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:31,661
I really only came because I
didn't want to break my promise.

600
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:33,537
I'll have to go right along.

601
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,414
But I'm awfully sorry.

602
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:40,061
- Oh, but we...
- Oh, is all for me?

603
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:43,700
Yeah, we got a Virginia ham too.

604
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,529
- Ham?
- Yeah.

605
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,916
And eggs.

606
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:50,736
Eggs?

607
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:53,579
Ham and eggs.

608
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,512
Awfully sweet of you.

609
00:55:00,136 --> 00:55:02,786
You, you couldn't just
stay for 10 minutes, could you?

610
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:05,087
It wouldn't take that to
have everything ready.

611
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,369
- Well?
- Could you?

612
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:10,877
- Just 10 minutes?
- Not another second, Archipenko.

651
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:44,992
Excuse please, I was just a little bit
listening, I didn't want to disturb you...

652
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,545
Makes you kind of homesick, doesn't it?

653
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,841
Oh no, I, I don't have time to get homesick.

654
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,471
But you would like to go
back sometime, wouldn't you?

655
01:00:11,498 --> 01:00:16,764
- Oh, sometime yes.
- Are you from Virginia too?

656
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:19,177
Me?

657
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:22,808
- Oh no.
- Maryland?

658
01:00:23,683 --> 01:00:26,860
- But you are from the south?
- Oh yes sir.

659
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,983
- Mississippi? Georgia.
- No, sir.

660
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,066
- Alabama?
- No.

661
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:32,996
- North Carolina? South Carolina?
- No.

662
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:33,921
- Louisiana?
- No.

663
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:37,822
- But you must've come from someplace honey.
- Oh yes, I sure enough did.

664
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:38,873
Where from?

665
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:44,596
- Virginia.
- Virginia?

666
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:49,980
All right then, I'll, I'll remember
you to the folks when I go back.

667
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:53,607
- Oh, you not going back, are you?
- I've been thinking about it.

668
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,484
Oh no, you mustn't, I mean...

669
01:00:55,703 --> 01:00:59,853
with a voice like yours, you, you really
should stay here and become a great singer.

670
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:04,742
That's just, exactly, explicitly
what I am always saying, aint it?

671
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,900
Oh, I don't want to be an opera singer.

672
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,372
But, don't you like to sing?

673
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:12,202
Oh, I like it all right when
I'm happy about something...

674
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,471
or when I sang to you like I did then.

675
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:19,046
But mademoiselle, he ain't
got ambition, he ain't got application.

676
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,326
Oh, Archipenko wants to sell me into slavery.

677
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:25,501
I want to sell him into slavery,
I want to put him into the opera.

678
01:01:25,621 --> 01:01:28,215
That's where he belongs, but will he work?

679
01:01:28,245 --> 01:01:33,774
Oh no, not if I get wild horses
to drag him there, he will not work.

680
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:35,951
That bad boy.

681
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:40,503
Oh mademoiselle, please say something.

682
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,830
Do something that will make him work.

683
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:47,088
Oh, but he wouldn't
listen to me, why should he?

684
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:50,000
I could think of a lot
of good reasons why I should.

685
01:01:53,372 --> 01:01:54,822
Then how can I make you work?

686
01:01:55,156 --> 01:01:57,399
How? You can...

687
01:01:57,836 --> 01:01:59,127
Oh, the time.

688
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,509
- What I've been doing here all this time?
- You can't go now.

689
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,753
You don't understand,
I've got to go, I'm, I'm awfully sorry.

690
01:02:04,783 --> 01:02:06,583
- Auf wiedersehen.
- Auf wiedersehen.

691
01:02:06,753 --> 01:02:07,753
- Please.
- Goodbye.

692
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:08,627
Oh, I'll come down with you.

693
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,841
Oh no, please don't. I'd rather you didn't.

694
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:12,962
And Paul, I mean Mr. Allison...

695
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,813
- I'd like you to promise me something.
- Anything.

696
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,700
Don't ask to see me again, ever.

697
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,380
- Oh, I won't promise that.
- Oh, but you must please.

698
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:22,181
I can't very well explain but...

699
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:24,887
I shouldn't have come
here in the first place.

700
01:02:25,235 --> 01:02:26,349
Then why did you?

701
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,315
Well, I told you I didn't
want to break a promise.

702
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:36,335
- Is that all?
- Yes, yes. Oh, please try to understand.

703
01:02:36,637 --> 01:02:40,720
It's been lots of fun and I've loved it
but it's all over now, it's finished, bye.

704
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:49,634
Home, quickly.

705
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:09,755
But I Tell you the tickets were stolen.

706
01:03:10,014 --> 01:03:12,787
I even remember the numbers, row 8, 6 and 7.

707
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,186
- Row 8, 3 and 4.
- 6 and 7.

708
01:03:15,216 --> 01:03:17,714
- 3 and 4.
- Will you keep out of this a minute.

709
01:03:17,744 --> 01:03:19,203
Please, take us to our seats.

710
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,309
It's impossible monsieur,
those seats are occupied.

711
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,387
- But call the manager.
- I'm sorry, the manager isn't here.

712
01:03:23,388 --> 01:03:25,914
Why not? It is
his duty to be here, where's he?

713
01:03:25,944 --> 01:03:28,129
- I do not know monsieur.
- Oh please, go and get him.

714
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,085
I cannot go, monsieur.

715
01:03:29,115 --> 01:03:31,565
- Don't be so insulting.
- I cannot leave my post.

716
01:03:31,566 --> 01:03:34,415
Let us through to our
seats, I told you the numbers.

717
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:36,261
I think I even know who is in them.

718
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,338
- Row 8, 3 and 4.
- 7 and 8.

719
01:03:38,368 --> 01:03:41,018
Sir, kindly step aside,
you are causing a disturbance.

720
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:45,487
I am going to have you discharged for this.
Come on Mimi, we find the manager.

721
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:53,778
There she is.

722
01:06:04,224 --> 01:06:06,862
Look those eyes, aren't they marvelous?

723
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:25,490
She's beautiful.

724
01:06:43,984 --> 01:06:47,154
Watch how she moves
her hands, isn't she graceful?

725
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:53,719
Well?

726
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:56,318
Oh...

727
01:10:00,306 --> 01:10:03,410
- How you get in here?
- I did my best to make him go, but...

728
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,731
Will you get out of my dressing room
at once or must I call an attendant?

729
01:10:06,732 --> 01:10:08,048
Oh, no, no, no. I'll go.

730
01:10:08,273 --> 01:10:09,823
I only came to tell you that...

731
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:13,974
I think you sing more beautifully than I
thought anyone ever could and to thank you.

732
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:17,375
- I told you I didn't want to see you again.
- But I want to see you.

733
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:19,532
Well, now you've seen me.

734
01:10:20,177 --> 01:10:23,299
- Ellen, open the door for him.
- But there's one thing before I go.

735
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,900
- Quickly.
- Tomorrow is May day.

736
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:27,595
- It's a fair at Saint-Cloud, may I take you?
- No.

737
01:10:27,735 --> 01:10:29,393
- Goodbye.
- Please?

738
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:30,905
Oh, don't be
absurd, you know it's ridiculous.

739
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:33,742
- But it isn't.
- Will you go? You mustn't be found here.

740
01:10:33,853 --> 01:10:36,053
I'll go if you come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow.

741
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:39,186
I can't, I mean, I don't want to.
Won't anything make you go?

742
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,236
- What?
- Come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow.

743
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:46,006
Who is it?

744
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:50,107
Monsieur Nazaroff wishes to know if you
will receive the critics in 3 minutes Mlle.

745
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,660
Yes, yes I will.

746
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,706
Now you must go. I mean it. You really must.

747
01:10:55,707 --> 01:10:57,367
- Come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow?
- Yes, yes I will.

748
01:10:57,368 --> 01:10:59,146
- I'll call for you at 10 o'clock.
- Oh, for goodness sakes, don't do that.

749
01:10:59,147 --> 01:11:00,241
- I'll meet you there.
- At 10 o'clock?

750
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:01,842
- Yes, yes. Only go, go.
- Right.

751
01:11:01,843 --> 01:11:02,872
Go.

752
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,928
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a moment.

753
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:10,904
- Oh, I beg your pardon, sorry. Excuse me.
- Not at all sir.

754
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:14,075
- I'm afraid I was in your way.
- Oh, no, it's my fault.

755
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:21,552
I'll see if mademoiselle
Mornay is ready to receive you.

756
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,017
Who was the visitor?

757
01:11:37,195 --> 01:11:40,407
Oh, just a silly young man.
He wasn't troublesome Nicolai.

758
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:44,426
He'd been out front and wanted to see
me so he could talk about it afterward.

759
01:11:44,427 --> 01:11:45,957
Wasn't important, really.

760
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:52,339
The critics are outside scratching
at the door, shall I let them in?

761
01:11:52,763 --> 01:11:54,253
- Well I...
- Remember...

762
01:11:54,608 --> 01:11:57,758
these critics are the people
who count in your life from now on.

763
01:11:58,094 --> 01:12:02,686
They fill the orchestra
seats for us, silly young men...

764
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:04,969
only fill the gallery.

765
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,346
Yes Nicolai.

766
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:16,053
- Monsieur, are you not coming to the fair?
- Sure.

767
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,333
- Where's your sweetheart?
- Oh, she's coming.

768
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:20,784
Good, you can't have any
fun without a sweetheart.

769
01:13:36,552 --> 01:13:38,507
Thank heaven, I was
afraid you weren't coming.

770
01:13:38,508 --> 01:13:40,611
I know, I couldn't get away any earlier.

771
01:13:40,818 --> 01:13:43,768
Ellen, take the carriage
and wait over there somewhere.

772
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,625
Lovely.

773
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,627
Oh yes, but I was mad to have come.

774
01:13:53,657 --> 01:13:54,323
Look...

775
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:56,477
until we leave, you are
going to forget who you are and...

776
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:59,178
what you are and
everything else except it's May day...

777
01:13:59,179 --> 01:14:01,896
and the sun is shining
and we're going to have fun, eh?

778
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:27,058
- Swing?
- Love it.

779
01:14:40,436 --> 01:14:41,897
- Fun?
- Oh yes.

780
01:15:19,752 --> 01:15:20,752
Here...

781
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:23,659
Well, I'm showing you how to do it.

782
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:32,467
- Bravo.
- Oh, right in the middle.

783
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:36,828

Well, are you sorry you played truant today?

01:19:46,438 --> 01:19:48,431
- No.
- Have you had fun?

800
01:19:48,461 --> 01:19:52,108
Fun? I never knew there
was such fun, such happiness.

801
01:19:52,696 --> 01:19:55,546
I've never been so
happy in my life, it's been wonderful..

802
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:57,876
- I know something much more wonderful.
- What?

803
01:19:58,007 --> 01:19:59,007
You.

804
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:01,812
Oh, have you forgotten I'm a prima Donna?

805

- No, but you have.
- Oh, no, I haven't.

806
01:20:05,543 --> 01:20:11,168
No, in about 3 hours I'll be singing the page
song from The Huguenot's in a boy's wig.

807
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:13,698
This will all seem as though
it had never happened.

808
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:18,330
By, by tomorrow,
I'll have forgotten all about it.

809
01:20:18,562 --> 01:20:20,614
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I do.

810
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:23,429
No. I'm going to sing you
a song to remember it by.

811
01:20:24,139 --> 01:20:26,689
Unless you'd rather I just
went on talking nonsense.

812
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,007
Oh no, do sing it please.

813
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:32,230
- It's about more things than May day though.
- Oh, what?

814
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:36,220
Sweethearts. See, you're mine.

Oh, Paul. Paul, darling.

836
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:28,937
Please...

837
01:23:30,692 --> 01:23:32,373
- There's someone else.
- Yes?

838
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:36,022
The one at the theater, Nazaroff, isn't it?

839
01:23:36,773 --> 01:23:37,773
Yes.

840
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:42,268
- Do you love him?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

841
01:23:44,276 --> 01:23:47,734
- Do you love him?
- I'm going to marry him.

842
01:23:52,408 --> 01:23:56,126
Oh Paul, Paul, it shouldn't have
happened, I shouldn't have let it happen,

843
01:23:56,741 --> 01:24:00,499
But was such fun, so exciting and...

844
01:24:00,991 --> 01:24:04,135
I kept hoping it would
end like that and not like this.

845
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:08,308
Can you forgive me?

846
01:24:10,153 --> 01:24:13,009
I find it hard not to, the way things are.

847
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:16,222
Paul, I want you to know this.

848
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:20,179
I'm not just marrying him
because he's good and kind...

849
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:21,887
and because he needs me.

850
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:24,962
There are stronger ties than that, you see...

851
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,861
everything I have,
everything I am, I owe to him.

852
01:24:27,983 --> 01:24:31,113
Even being here today,
even meeting you the other night.

853
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:34,684
He's made all those
things possible for me, all of them.

854
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:38,534
When I first met him, I was nothing.

855
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:43,249
Nobody believed in me.
I'd even stopped believing in myself...

856
01:24:44,971 --> 01:24:48,647
and yet he gave up everything,
his whole career, all his other pupils...

857
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,209
just so he could guide me to success.

858
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,101
That was 4 years ago.

859
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,776
In all that time, he's never
stopped believing in me.

860
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,644
In all that time, he's never
once broken a promise.

861
01:25:03,956 --> 01:25:05,227
Nor failed me.

862
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,370
That's why I can't fail him now Paul.

863
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:10,844
Even...

864
01:25:12,252 --> 01:25:14,070
Even for something I want far more.

865
01:25:17,173 --> 01:25:18,457
I understand.

866
01:25:20,302 --> 01:25:22,831
I met you too late.

867
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:26,972
Yet something inside
me won't let me believe it.

868
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:28,093
Please Paul...

869
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,767
let's, let's just remember this day.

870
01:25:41,213 --> 01:25:42,302
We will Marcia.

871
01:25:43,523 --> 01:25:45,805
One day to last us all the rest of our lives.

872
01:25:45,835 --> 01:25:47,746
It will, it will.

873
01:25:48,866 --> 01:25:50,411
I'll always love you dear.

874
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:52,420
And I'll always...

875
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:54,934
remember you...

876
01:25:55,686 --> 01:25:57,018

Goodbye.

889
01:31:34,424 --> 01:31:37,992
Mr. Nazaroff, we greatly appreciate
your having selected our hotel.

890
01:31:38,022 --> 01:31:40,164
Not at all sir, we've
always been very happy here..

891
01:31:40,165 --> 01:31:41,433
- Genaro.
- Si, signore.

892
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:42,609
- Adolph.
- Ja.

893
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,236
See that madame's
broth is prepared immediately.

894
01:31:48,585 --> 01:31:52,306
I trust that this suite will prove
adequate and satisfactory in every way.

895
01:31:52,336 --> 01:31:55,204
- Yes, very nice.
- Madame's room is through here.

896
01:31:56,352 --> 01:31:58,987
Whatever you may wish
will be attended to instantly.

897
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,036
Thank you very much.

898
01:32:05,535 --> 01:32:09,045
Gentlemen, tell, tell the
press they needn't wait.

899
01:32:09,231 --> 01:32:11,232
- We no interview today.
- Very well.

900
01:32:13,014 --> 01:32:14,014
- Fanchon.
- Yes sir?

901
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:15,845
Where's the board of
directors from the opera house?

902
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:18,446
Well sir, I had arranged
with the hotel management...

903
01:32:18,447 --> 01:32:21,236
I'm sorry sir, but the
gentlemen haven't arrived as yet.

904
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:24,203
They were to met me here,
I'm accustomed to punctuality..

905
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:27,104
- See what's delayed them please.
- Certainly sir, at once.

906
01:32:32,772 --> 01:32:36,369
- It's a very pleasant suite madame.
- Yes, they all are.

907
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:46,291
Wish we'd stay in one place long
enough so we could take a house.

908
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:47,713
I'm tired of hotels.

909
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:51,646
I'd like a hot bath Ellen, you ask
them if they'll arrange for one please?

910
01:32:51,647 --> 01:32:52,711
Oui, oui, madame.

911
01:32:59,668 --> 01:33:03,134
We'll have to leave for your
official reception in an hour.

912
01:33:03,692 --> 01:33:07,530
I've left word you're not
to be disturbed till we go.

913
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:08,985
Thank you Nicolai.

914
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:12,270
Mary.

915
01:33:14,626 --> 01:33:17,424
The gentlemen from the opera are late.

916
01:33:18,299 --> 01:33:19,415
Doesn't really matter.

917
01:33:19,568 --> 01:33:22,253
You don't have to see them at all,
as a matter of fact, I'll attend to them.

918
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:23,318
Thank you Nicolai.

919
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:27,965
- You tired, after your voyage?
- Oh, not very.

920
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,536
Wish we didn't have to go
to that reception though.

921
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:32,707
Oh, so do I.

922
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:36,335
Oh, by the way, you'd better wear
your jewelry, they'll expect it..

923
01:33:36,576 --> 01:33:37,576
All right.

924
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,081
- You glad to be back in America?
- Oh yes.

925
01:33:41,912 --> 01:33:43,289
You don't exactly show it.

926
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:45,575
Do I have to?

927
01:33:46,756 --> 01:33:48,374
When I'm not on parade?

928
01:33:48,768 --> 01:33:51,068
Poor darling, you are
rather tired, aren't you?

929
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:52,600
Oh, I'm sorry Nicolai.

930
01:33:53,218 --> 01:33:56,050
I'm just not awfully excited
about anything, that's all.

931
01:34:13,697 --> 01:34:14,834
I'm sorry.

932
01:34:15,676 --> 01:34:19,776
I should've remembered that, that
excites you less than anything else.

933
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,230
Why do you say things like that, Nicolai?

934
01:34:22,947 --> 01:34:23,947
I don't know.

935
01:34:24,609 --> 01:34:25,859
Have no right to, have I?

936
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:28,545
After all, you've been a perfect wife.

937
01:34:29,245 --> 01:34:33,171
You've been faithful and
loyal, obedient and affectionate.

938
01:34:34,188 --> 01:34:36,788
In the face of all that,
it's unimportant, I suppose.

939
01:34:37,697 --> 01:34:40,879
Never once, in all the
years that we've been married...

940
01:34:42,059 --> 01:34:44,378
have I ever felt I completely possessed you.

941
01:34:46,685 --> 01:34:48,385
You've no right to feel like that.

942
01:34:49,407 --> 01:34:52,589
I know, all I regret is...

943
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,754
it's made me love you too much.

944
01:34:59,673 --> 01:35:00,755
Come in.

945
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:05,942
- The directors from the opera are here sir.
- Tell them I'll be with them immediately.

946
01:35:05,943 --> 01:35:06,547
Very well.

947
01:35:06,704 --> 01:35:08,854
I wouldn't worry too much about it Nicolai.

948
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:24,567
Your bath will be ready in a moment madame.

949
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:27,090
Thank you.

950
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:37,031
- Will you be seated gentlemen?
- Thank you.

951
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,467
Oh Mr. Nazaroff...

952
01:35:40,469 --> 01:35:44,350
it's a great pleasure to welcome
you and madame Mornay to New York.

953
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,569
It's a very proud day
for us sir, a very proud day.

954
01:35:47,815 --> 01:35:49,565
Very generous of you to say so sir.

955
01:35:50,253 --> 01:35:52,703
Now, we have here the
contracts, the arrangements,

956
01:35:52,704 --> 01:35:56,954
and all the other formalities to be observed.
I think you'll find them quite in order.

957
01:35:59,013 --> 01:36:02,403
- Traviata?
- Yes, Traviata, yes.

958
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:06,573
We sold out the opening night already and the
booking for the season is exceptionally high.

959
01:36:06,574 --> 01:36:10,625
Our advance publicity has been out two weeks,
entire supporting cast is been contracted.

960
01:36:10,626 --> 01:36:13,026
And the scenery and costumes
are almost complete.

961
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,416
So, you see, we've
not been idle Mr. Nazaroff.

962
01:36:15,446 --> 01:36:16,926
No, far from it.

963
01:36:17,547 --> 01:36:22,589
In fact, you've gone to enormous pains
to cast, dress and advertise an opera...

964
01:36:23,141 --> 01:36:26,870
that madame Mornay has not the
slightest intention of appearing in.

965
01:36:27,013 --> 01:36:30,582
- Not Traviata?
- Not Traviata?

966
01:36:30,715 --> 01:36:34,505
- But the cast is been signed.
- The scenery is cost $1,000 to date.

967
01:36:34,823 --> 01:36:38,541
- Yes, and all the costumes.
- Traviata is a beautiful opera.

968
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:43,663
- We decided on it after long discussions.
- But without consulting madame Mornay.

969
01:36:43,777 --> 01:36:46,342
But naturally, we
took it for granted that you'd...

970
01:36:46,946 --> 01:36:48,356
Which is so unwise.

971
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:52,005
What opera do you suggest then?

972
01:36:52,241 --> 01:36:54,500
- Czaritza.
- Czaritza?

973
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:55,643
Czaritza.

974
01:36:56,295 --> 01:36:58,878
But Czaritza has never
been presented here before.

975
01:36:58,908 --> 01:37:02,451
Quite, but Trentini wrote it
especially for madame Mornay.

976
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,854
What could be more perfect
for her opening in New York?

977
01:37:05,884 --> 01:37:07,877
But Czaritza needs a baritone.

978
01:37:08,014 --> 01:37:11,364
We have no baritone important
enough to sing opposite madame Mornay.

979
01:37:11,365 --> 01:37:13,658
I'm afraid that is a slight exaggeration.

980
01:37:13,849 --> 01:37:16,309
We have a very
efficient baritone in Paul Allison.

981
01:37:16,912 --> 01:37:19,699
- Perhaps you may know him Mr. Nazaroff.
- No.

982
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:23,843
I've heard him spoken of to
his credit, as a matter of fact...

983
01:37:24,456 --> 01:37:26,888
Madame Mornay will be quite
satisfied to have him sing with her.

984
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:29,281
But he's not well enough known to the public.

985
01:37:29,596 --> 01:37:34,034
The public will be there to
hear and see madame Mornay.

986
01:37:34,064 --> 01:37:36,714
I'll get in touch with Paul
Allison when I leave here.

987
01:37:37,072 --> 01:37:38,097
Thank you.

988
01:37:38,127 --> 01:37:41,377
Then that concludes the discussion gentlemen.

989
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,614
- Where's madame?
- She's in the bath.

990
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:50,739
- Marcia?
- Yes?

991
01:37:50,944 --> 01:37:53,992
I've arranged the details.
You open with Czaritza.

992
01:37:54,237 --> 01:37:58,287
- 4 weeks rehearsal, starting this afternoon.
- Will that be time enough for them?

993
01:37:58,288 --> 01:37:59,447
It'll have to be.

994
01:37:59,704 --> 01:38:02,205
- Who they got for Petrov?
- Paul Allison.

995
01:38:03,886 --> 01:38:04,886
Paul.

996
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:10,108
Well...

997
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:16,364
- Couldn't they get someone better known?
- Why should they?

998
01:38:16,699 --> 01:38:20,099
Nothing to worry about dear,
he's got a very fine voice they tell me.

999
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,478
I've heard of him before.

1000
01:38:23,505 --> 01:38:27,805
Don't want to hurry you, but we got to go
straight on to rehearsal after the reception.

1001
01:38:28,165 --> 01:38:29,750
The hour is drawing close.

1002
01:38:31,008 --> 01:38:33,126
Yes, yes, yes. I'll be there.

1003
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:24,158
See, half an hour late.

1004
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:26,759
She think we got nothing better to do...

1005
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,560
than to kick our heels
all day long in this blasted barn?

1006
01:39:29,561 --> 01:39:33,061
Drown all prima Donnas, I say.
If I were president, that's what I'd do.

1007
01:39:33,062 --> 01:39:37,277
I'd drown all prima Donnas and replace
them with the choir boys, they're punctual.

1008
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,107
- You called the rehearsal for 1:30.
- Well?

1009
01:39:40,804 --> 01:39:42,635
- It's just 1:30.
- 2 o'clock.

1010
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:44,672
1:30.

1011
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:52,203
Well, what I said about drowning
all prima Donnas still holds good.

1012
01:40:03,466 --> 01:40:07,210
Permit me madame Mornay, May I
present Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Abrams.

1013
01:40:07,369 --> 01:40:10,369
- How do you do?
- You gentlemen of course know Mr. Nazaroff.

1014
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:12,786
It's a great honor madame, a great honor.

1015
01:40:12,816 --> 01:40:14,631
Very great honor, yes.

1016
01:40:14,945 --> 01:40:17,795
- Now, if you are ready for rehearsal madame.
- Oh, quite.

1017
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:40,154
Permit me to introduce our stage director.
Madame Mornay, Mr. Rudyard.

1018
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:43,268
- How do you do?
- I am honored madame, deeply honored.

1019
01:40:43,269 --> 01:40:45,369
- This is Mr. Nazaroff.
- Your servant sir.

1020
01:40:45,443 --> 01:40:47,943
- Our conductor, signore Pugliemi.
- How do you do?

1021
01:40:47,944 --> 01:40:48,422
Signore.

1022
01:40:48,452 --> 01:40:52,427
And now madame, Mr. O'Brien,
may I present the cast to you?

1023
01:40:53,753 --> 01:40:54,753
Of course.

1024
01:40:56,527 --> 01:41:00,586
This is Mr. Paul Allison, our baritone.

1025
01:41:03,073 --> 01:41:05,520
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1026
01:41:06,668 --> 01:41:08,661
It's an honor madame, to sing with you.

1027
01:41:09,661 --> 01:41:10,836
Thank you...

1028
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:14,007
Very much.

1029
01:41:14,037 --> 01:41:16,262
Mr. Nazaroff, Mr. Allison.

1030
01:41:17,138 --> 01:41:20,349
- How do you do sir?
- How do you do?

1031
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:23,246
And this is our basso, Mr. Dubrovsky.

1032
01:41:23,276 --> 01:41:25,578
- Enchante madame.
- Merci bien, monsieur.

1033
01:41:26,444 --> 01:41:29,544
- Excuse me Archipenko.
- Mr. Archipenko to you, if you please.

1034
01:41:29,545 --> 01:41:32,854
Hello. Hello. Good afternoon, good afternoon.

1035
01:41:32,884 --> 01:41:35,334
My dear Paul, I'm
awfully sorry I'm a little late.

1036
01:41:35,335 --> 01:41:36,335
How do you do?

1037
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:40,275
Oh, madame, how wonderful to see you again.

1038
01:41:40,522 --> 01:41:43,972
You know, all these years I have
been saying little prayers for you...

1039
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:48,175
because on account of you giving Paul
the incentive, the ambition, the application.

1040
01:41:48,571 --> 01:41:50,116
You remember that day Paris...

1041
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:53,454
When I was a student
in Paris several years ago...

1042
01:41:53,484 --> 01:41:56,327
madame was kind enough
to encourage me with my career.

1043
01:41:56,518 --> 01:42:00,243
That's the truth, from
that day on, he began to work.

1044
01:42:00,502 --> 01:42:02,957
Mr. Rudyard, will you begin rehearsal please?

1045
01:42:02,987 --> 01:42:04,137
Oh yes, yes, of course.

1046
01:42:04,138 --> 01:42:06,432
- If you please Mr. Archipenko.
- Excuse me.

1047
01:42:06,462 --> 01:42:07,466
If you please.

1048
01:42:07,914 --> 01:42:08,914
Places.

1049
01:42:09,363 --> 01:42:12,113
On account of the chorus,
we'll begin with the last act.

1050
01:42:12,253 --> 01:42:15,318
- Madame Mornay, you are familiar with yours.
- Yes sir.

1051
01:42:15,619 --> 01:42:20,279
Personally Mr. Nazaroff, I'm delighted you
insisted on Czaritza instead of Traviata.

1052
01:42:20,489 --> 01:42:23,739
You know, it's just the chance
young Allison has been waiting for.

1053
01:42:24,262 --> 01:42:25,613

You've never had such a reception madame.

01:54:59,007 --> 01:55:03,407
It was wonderful, I heard the director saying
it's the greatest success they've ever had.

01:55:03,408 --> 01:55:04,408
Ellen...

1106
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:07,211
I'd like you to take a
message to Mr. Allison for me.

1107
01:55:07,437 --> 01:55:08,495
Tell him...

1108
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:13,135
Tell him not to do anything until I see him
tomorrow morning, I'll come to his flat.

1109
01:55:13,136 --> 01:55:15,549
Well, go on. Go, hurry, hurry.

1110
01:55:23,365 --> 01:55:24,834
Madame will see no one.

1111
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:27,716
Postpone our press
reception till sometime tomorrow.

1112
01:55:27,717 --> 01:55:28,717
Yes sir.

1113
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,938
Tonight you surpassed even yourself.

1114
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:46,869
They're referring to it...

1115
01:55:47,778 --> 01:55:49,309
as a living emotion.

1116
01:55:58,459 --> 01:55:59,491
Whatever it was...

1117
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:01,975
it was extremely effective.

1118
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,560
Thank you.

1119
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:08,831
Was a great deal that you never thought
important enough to tell me, wasn't there?

1120
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,482
Very little.

1121
01:56:12,278 --> 01:56:13,278
Very little?

1122
01:56:14,098 --> 01:56:16,267
Yet it stood between us for 7 years.

1123
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:19,053
And I brought you two together again.

1124
01:56:20,151 --> 01:56:22,154
It has its humor, hasn't it?

1125
01:56:23,903 --> 01:56:26,653
Or doesn't it strike you as
being particularly humorous?

1126
01:56:28,932 --> 01:56:32,090
Nicolai, I'm very tired and confused.

1127
01:56:32,981 --> 01:56:36,331
Will you wait till we get back to
the hotel? We can discuss it then.

1128
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:38,023
Very well.

1129
01:56:39,104 --> 01:56:40,104
Thank you.

1130
01:56:58,069 --> 01:57:01,482
Oh madame, you were glorious, glorious.

1131
01:57:01,512 --> 01:57:03,612
- Wonderful, simply wonderful.
- Thank you.

1132
01:57:03,613 --> 01:57:06,187
We're having a
little reception at Delmonico's and...

1133
01:57:06,188 --> 01:57:09,331
- I wondered if madame isn't too tired...
- Most charming of you sir.

1134
01:57:09,332 --> 01:57:12,734
As a matter of fact, madame is exhausted.
I'm taking her directly back to the hotel.

1135
01:57:12,735 --> 01:57:16,235
- I'm very sorry Mr. O'Brien.
- Oh, please, please. I quite understand.

1136
01:57:16,236 --> 01:57:18,836
- Some other evening then, perhaps.
- Yes, thank you.

1137
01:57:29,583 --> 01:57:30,583
Mr. Allison...

1138
01:57:30,584 --> 01:57:33,671
permit me to thank you
for a most magnificent performance.

1139
01:57:33,995 --> 01:57:38,842
We are deeply indebted to you
for your indispensable cooperation.

1140
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:43,037
- It's for me to thank you sir.
- Not at all sir, not at all.

1141
01:57:43,067 --> 01:57:44,067
Good night.

1142
01:57:45,143 --> 01:57:47,364
- Good night madame.
- Good night sir.

1143
01:57:48,283 --> 01:57:49,283
Good night.

1144
01:58:04,678 --> 01:58:05,913
Supper is ready sir.

1145
01:58:28,489 --> 01:58:29,489
Now...

1146
01:58:30,624 --> 01:58:33,485
Suppose we find out exactly how we stand?

1147
01:58:36,678 --> 01:58:39,028
Nothing could've
stopped this happening Nicolai.

1148
01:58:39,836 --> 01:58:42,986
I never realized what a terrible
mistake I made when I left him.

1149
01:58:44,734 --> 01:58:47,979
I, I thought then that
I had to keep my promise to you...

1150
01:58:48,530 --> 01:58:52,090
after all you'd done
for me, I tried to forget him.

1151
01:58:52,781 --> 01:58:56,262
I tried to put him out
of my mind but I was never able to.

1152
01:58:57,557 --> 01:59:00,689
And now tonight, I, I realize that...

1153
01:59:01,257 --> 01:59:03,407
I love you more than anything else in life.

1154
01:59:04,677 --> 01:59:06,527
But I can't go on living without him.

1155
01:59:08,167 --> 01:59:13,214
- So you wish to be set free, is that it?
- Oh Nicolai, yes.

1156
01:59:14,491 --> 01:59:15,491
Yes Nicolai.

1157
01:59:28,592 --> 01:59:29,592
Nicolai...

1158
01:59:31,681 --> 01:59:34,838
Very well, if that's what you really want...

1159
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:38,388
I won't stand in your way.

1160
01:59:41,476 --> 01:59:42,476
Good night.

1161
02:00:51,532 --> 02:00:54,978
It's very late and you're tired.
It's time you were asleep madame.

1162
02:00:55,486 --> 02:00:57,486
It couldn't have happened any other way.

1163
02:00:57,656 --> 02:00:59,706
You've nothing to reproach yourself with.

1164
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:04,522
Now go to bed madame.
I'll stay with you until you fall asleep.

1165
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:10,778
- What's that?
- Just a door banging.

1166
02:01:15,256 --> 02:01:17,806
When things happen
you never thought could happen...

1167
02:01:17,807 --> 02:01:19,907
something inside won't let you believe it.

1168
02:01:19,908 --> 02:01:20,908
You...

1169
02:01:21,946 --> 02:01:24,903
You'd have to keep on
repeating to yourself it's true.

1170
02:01:27,449 --> 02:01:29,863
A door banging? Well, who...

1171
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:44,803
Nicolai? Nicolai?

1172
02:02:01,432 --> 02:02:04,598
- Ellen, Ellen, Ellen...
- Yes, madame?

1173
02:02:04,628 --> 02:02:05,998
Get me a cloak quickly.

1174
02:03:40,169 --> 02:03:41,469
I'm glad you've come here.

1175
02:03:42,224 --> 02:03:44,824
I suggest we get this over
as reasonably as possible.

1176
02:03:46,161 --> 02:03:47,161
We will.

1177
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:50,596
I'm giving Marcia her freedom.

1178
02:03:52,526 --> 02:03:54,159
And you yours...

1179
02:03:57,055 --> 02:03:58,055
Mr. Allison.

1180
02:04:12,515 --> 02:04:13,565
What have you...

1181
02:04:15,048 --> 02:04:16,819
Paul, Paul...

1182
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,170
Paul, no...

1183
02:04:20,677 --> 02:04:21,677
No.

1184
02:04:23,415 --> 02:04:25,365
Paul, Oh...

1185
02:04:27,797 --> 02:04:28,797
No...

1186
02:04:33,867 --> 02:04:35,398
That day...

1187
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,530
Did last me...

1188
02:04:40,209 --> 02:04:41,434
all my life.

1189
02:04:47,479 --> 02:04:48,940
Don't cry, Marcia...

1190
02:04:51,084 --> 02:04:53,839
You won't be lonely.

1191
02:04:57,399 --> 02:04:58,737
I'll be close.

1192
02:05:02,017 --> 02:05:03,017
Always...

1193
02:05:19,021 --> 02:05:20,021
Paul...

1194
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:23,246
Oh, Paul...

1195
02:05:51,081 --> 02:05:53,329
So that's why I live here alone.

1196
02:05:53,469 --> 02:05:56,557
Where nobody knows me, except Ellen.

1197
02:05:59,924 --> 02:06:01,429
Poor Miss Morrison.

1198
02:06:03,362 --> 02:06:04,761
Marcia.

1199
02:06:07,307 --> 02:06:10,088
I only told you to help you decide about Kip.

1200
02:06:12,231 --> 02:06:13,945
I found Paul too late.

1201
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:18,380
But you and Kip have the
whole world ahead of you...

1202
02:06:19,272 --> 02:06:21,713
- If you want to take it.
- Oh, I do.

1203
02:06:22,894 --> 02:06:24,827
I've been such a fool about Kip.

1204
02:06:26,838 --> 02:06:28,789
Thank you so much.

1205
02:06:29,017 --> 02:06:31,267
And I'm going to come
see you much more often.

1206
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,192
Then you won't be so lonely.

1207
02:06:36,985 --> 02:06:38,489
That's very sweet of you.

1208
02:06:41,996 --> 02:06:43,239
Oh, there's Kip now.

1209
02:06:45,085 --> 02:06:46,650
Thank you for helping me.

1210
02:06:47,018 --> 02:06:49,432
I'll never forget it, never.

1211
02:06:58,548 --> 02:07:00,612
- Hello Kip.
- Hello.

1212
02:07:02,755 --> 02:07:05,624
- Came by to apologize.
- I'm sorry too.

1213
02:07:07,165 --> 02:07:08,165
I've been...

1214
02:07:08,705 --> 02:07:09,912
thinking things over.

1215
02:07:10,576 --> 02:07:13,376
Well, I haven't any right to
stand in your way like that.

1216
02:07:13,377 --> 02:07:14,377
Oh Kip...

1217
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:18,178
I, I came by to wish you luck in New York.

1218
02:07:19,044 --> 02:07:20,172
Thank you.

1219
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:23,496
I'm not going.

1220
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:25,841
- Not going?
- No.

1221
02:07:27,266 --> 02:07:28,266
Oh, gee.

1222
02:07:29,076 --> 02:07:30,493
Gee, that's swell.

1223
02:07:32,575 --> 02:07:33,575
Well...

1224
02:07:54,087 --> 02:07:59,417
It's time you came in, it's turning a little
chilly and you let your tea get all cold.

1225
02:08:01,685 --> 02:08:04,501
I'll only be a moment or two.

1226
02:08:05,949 --> 02:08:08,983
Yes, yes. I'll make you some fresh tea.
