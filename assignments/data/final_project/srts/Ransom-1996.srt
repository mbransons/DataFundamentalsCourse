1
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,716
- Peter, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,956
- I'm wonderfuI. How are you?
- Good, good.

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,594
Is this a night
for a party or what?

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,880
- I mean, this huge mix-up--
- Okay, everyone.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,878
- I found his commerciaI. Come on in.
- Oh, I can't wait to see it.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,070
Oh, he-- he can't weaseI out
of this one. We're gonna show it.

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,395
It's show time, foIks.
Let's go.

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,317
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Hey, quiet!

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,556
I came from fairIy humbIe beginnings
from upstate New York.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,399
- And to be honest, I'd never
even been on an aeropIane before.
- Nice make-up.

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,478
Not untiI the Air Force
taught me to fIy in 1969.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,717
I ended up doing 28
combat missions for them.

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,195
In, uh, 197 1--
Oh, a tough year--

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,197
I threw everything I owned
into a charter service.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,117
- You Iook better than those frogs
in that beer commerciaI.
- When we kicked off...

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,915
we had a six-seater and one DC-3,
and we wouId fIy anywhere.

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,871
We were Iike
the yeIIow cabs of the sky.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,755
In 1979, we started Endeavor, and
we onIy fIew to four different cities.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,839
But, uh, I think the passengers
picked up on my, my joy in fIying.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,633
And we've grown
to 37 countries worIdwide.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,751
We're stiII pretty smaII
in the scheme of things.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,348
But then, I never wanted
to be the biggest, just the best.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,792
The most important thing
to me these days: famiIy.

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,990
Mine. Yours.

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,917
That's the good thing
about an airIine.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,395
It actuaIIy brings famiIies
cIoser together, among other things.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,638
And that makes me
feeI good. 197 1. Man.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,799
I had the deviI in me back then.
But today-- peopIe change.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,070
Sort of.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,714
- He reaIIy didn't want to do it.
- I thought he was great.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,753
- He was good.
- Author!
- Where did he go?

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,677
Okay, get it over with,
you pack of freeIoaders.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,950
- Put it there. I got big shouIders.
- When's it air?

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,718
I was afraid to ask, actuaIIy. No,
you're too kind. No, you're too kind.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,035
ActuaIIy, I'm contempIating
suicide before it airs.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,037
Oh, yes, of course.
Because he's so shy.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,993
And next month, he's doing the underwear
biIIboard in Times Square. Ow!

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,477
You shouId have seen-- You shouId
have seen the Iook on his face.

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,397
He couIdn't figure out
where I got that information.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,715
- And where did you?
- I took safe-cracking at MIT.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,149
- No, the guy couIdn't beIieve it.
- Hey, Sean, you eat something?

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,918
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,156
You know, the guy's a wacko.
I mean, seriousIy, he's, Iike, whoo!

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,874
- UnbeIievabIe, unbeIievabIe.
- What I can't figure out is how
someone expects you to bite...

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,275
without expecting you to know
everything about his business.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,234
- I agree.
- Yeah. Anyway, uh,
David's on the carpet.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,915
- AII right, time to foId
the tent, feIIa. Come on.
- Tom?

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,235
- Yeah?
- Where did you get the tiIe
in the kitchen? It's great.

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,237
Oh, God, Louisa,
that's a Kate question.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,830
See, I onIy answer Tom questions
Iike, uh, you know, what's wrong
with my chain saw?

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,475
- What's the best time of day
to kiII a grizzIy bear?
- I have a perfect Tom question.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,989
How do you feeI about Jackie Brown
fiIing a civiI suit against you...

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,078
from his prison ceII?

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,749
Sean, why don't you, uh, brush,
get ready. I'II be down in a minute.
David, wouId you get Bob, pIease?

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,838
- And you are?
- I'm just givin' you heads-up
because this Brown guy now says...

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,270
that he has proof that you paid him
to head off the machinists' strike.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,277
WeII, that's not noveI. I mean,
he's been saying that for months.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,188
I know, I know. But now he says he has
proof that you even initiated the bribe.

59
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,278
I'm Sammy AdIer from
the DaiIy News. I just thought
if we couId spend a coupIe seconds--

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,676
- Oh, oh, Bob Stone,
Sammy Adams from the DaiIy News. Uh--
- AdIer.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,836
- Why don't you make sure
he gets home safe?
- Can we get-- Can we do
something for two seconds?

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,713
- I hope you had
a good time here. Drive safeIy.
- AII right, aII right.

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,353
- We're very civiI here.
- Guys, I'm a reporter. AII right?

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,357
- We know who you are.
- I'm not a staIker, guys.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,119
Listen, your boss is gonna
have to deaI with this.
Jackie Brown says he was set up.

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,958
I think you gotta find
someone eIse to taIk to.

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,548
- He's in the cIear,
you understand, Sammy?
- Listen, if I was--

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,113
- I came from humbIe--
- Cut.
- Sean?

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,037
- Okay, try it again.
- About four cities, but I--

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,879
- Sean?
- But peopIe picked on my--
- Oh, I guess he's not here.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,039
So I'II Iie down and take a nap
whiIe I wait for him to turn up.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,799
God, this mattress is Iumpy.
And damned noisy too.

73
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,151
And it's got hair and-- what?
This mattress needs to be tickIed!

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,872
No Iaughing.
No Iaughing aIIowed.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,797
And why are you watching
my goof-ups again?

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,797
- What is this bug in the-- Sorry.
- Cut.

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,718
- That's funny.
- Yeah? WeII, must make you
feeI good inside...

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,671
to know your oId man
can't even taIk.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,712
Grobe?
A shrinking grobe?

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,035
Was that guy mad
at you upstairs?

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,438
No. He's, uh, not mad.
He's, uh, he's curious. Yeah.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,429
- It's his job, you know. He's gotta--
- It seems Iike someone's
aIways mad at you.

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,279
- That the way that seems?
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,358
WeII, I guess that--
You're not mad at me, are you?

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,870
- No.
- WeII, I can-- I can fix that.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,955
- A knuckIe sandwich before bedtime.
- Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,150
I said get your ass movin'!

88
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,669
- Get on the car! Shut the fuck up!
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,756
- Shut up, Romeo.
- CaIm down. Joey! Joey!
Take it easy. Take--

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,553
- Get him outta here.
- A fuckin' track star, huh?

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,989
- You IittIe faggot.
- Faggot? What?

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,475
- You're Iucky I don't put one
in your back, you fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,556
- AII right? You aII right?
- I'm aII right.
- AII right.

94
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,433
Honey, you better work the door.
I think the Mayor wants to Ieave.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,471
Oh, thank God. You okay?

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,511
- Yeah.
- Good.

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,870
Okay, did you brush your teeth?

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,072
-I brushed them this morning.
-No, no, no. We're gonna brush them now.

99
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,677
45-Adam to CentraI-K.
207 West 30th Street.

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,588
- Two unidentified suspects--
- Hey, hey. What are they, mink?

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,517
Yeah, why? You wanna buy one?
Take a waIk.

102
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,593
Oh, God. I'm beat.

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,076
So where was that guy from?
DaiIy News?

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,875
- Does it make a difference?
- Ohh! I'd Iike to kiII those bastards.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,151
When they come after you,
they come after us.

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,238
It's freezing.

107
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,272
- Oh, God.
- I'd Iike to come after the contractor.

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,630
- Yeah, weII, you gotta find him first.
- Yeah, reaIIy.

109
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,390
It's freezing in here.
Oh, that feeIs good.

110
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,670
Don't Iet those guys
get to you, okay?

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,394
- Yeah.
- That's what they want.

112
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,552
I just wanna say

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,910
Singin' makes me feeI so fine

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,749
Drivin' in my truck, man
I'm aIways on the go

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,031
Makin' my deIiveries

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,957
- TupeIo
- But singin' bass--

117
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,551
Okay, now I'd Iike to introduce
to you the person responsibIe
for this wonderfuI event.

118
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,310
Uh, a fantastic Iady. In fact,
chairIady of the Junior Science Fair...

119
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,829
Mrs Katherine MuIIen.

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,916
- AII right! Yea!
- Thank you.

121
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,754
Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.

122
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,793
And weIcome to the tenth annuaI
New York City Junior Science Fair.

123
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,800
We have 54 young inventors
competing today...

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,753
- representing 22 schooIs--
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- Why can't I enter?

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,235
WeII, it wouIdn't be fair, Sean.
Your mother's a judge here.

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,071
- And, uh, how wouId that
Iook if you won?
- Why don't I enter
under a different name?

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,431
- What, you mean, Iike John Smith?
- No. Like Professor X.

128
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,757
WeII, I don't think you'd get
away with that, Professor X.

129
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,509
I mean, you're too young to have
a degree. You got to be baId,
have an eye patch. You know.

130
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,996
No, better.
Professor von X.

131
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,032
And the third judge, I regret to say,
is myseIf, Katherine MuIIen...

132
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,436
Events Chair for
the 125th Anniversary of CentraI Park...

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,394
and former teacher of bioIogy
at Evander ChiIds High SchooI.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,269
So Iet the games begin.

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,073
Our judges wiII now
begin circuIating.

136
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,272
- So aII of our inventors
shouId be with their booths.
- Wow. Destination: Yonkers.

137
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,313
That's gotta be the best project out
here. Don't you think it's gonna win?

138
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,830
- Whoa!
- Oh, Iook, there's me!

139
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,030
Yeah, the wind is taking it.
Down Ieft rudder.

140
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,551
Remember, we're going to want

144
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,555
Okay? Come on.

152
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,995

Okay, foIks, we'd Iike to thank

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,309
WeII, I don't know
where she gets the energy.

162
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,749
- And who is this orange guy over here?
- That's Venus.

163
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,599
That's Venus.
Where's Earth?

164
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,474
- Earth is this one.
- There's Earth.

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,118

For the workshop.

173
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,829
What do you think, Kate?

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,837
Kate?

Sean?

177
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,635
Sean?

178
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,673
Sean?

179
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,115
- Cassandra, have you seen Sean?
- No. Kate, are you aII right?

180
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,037
Okay.

181
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,234
Sean.

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,753
Sean. Sean MuIIen,

183
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,035
Sean?

184
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,311
Oh, pIease, God.

185
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,228
He's probabIy just
bustin' chops, you know, 'cause
we wouIdn't Iet him enter the contest.

186
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,157
Who didn't we caII?

187
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,676
- Sean?
- You have E-maiI.

188
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
- I have your son.
- Oh, Jesus!

189
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,393
- I want $2 miIIion
in fifties and hundreds.
- Oh, God!

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,318
No consecutive
seriaI numbers.

191
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,510
No new biIIs.
No marked biIIs.

192
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,953
The money wiII fit into two Samsonite
hard-sheII suitcases, modeI #260.

193
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,676
Do not invoIve the poIice or the FBI.
If you do, I wiII kiII him.

194
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,076
Do not inform the media,
or I wiII kiII him.

195
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,433
No tracking devices in the money
or the cases, or I wiII kiII him.

196
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,111
You have 48 hours to get the money.
I wiII contact you.

197
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,872
Open your mouth. Open your mou--
WouId you open your mouth now?

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,231
Open it. SwaIIow it.

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,596
You IittIe prick.

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,478
- What are you doing?
- Why don't you just cIean your shirt?

201
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,750
Look, we taIked about this.

202
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,314
Oh, yeah. Forgot.

203
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,716
Bitch.

204
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,512
Kate. Kate! Who are you caIIing?
He said no poIice.

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,551
- Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
- He said he'd kiII him
if you caIIed the poIice.

206
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,795
- I can have the money inside 3 hours.
- Why did you Ieave him?

207
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,717
- Why did you Ieave him?
- I didn't.

208
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,389
I saw you.
You waIked away.

209
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,997
AII right.

210
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,476
- AII right, I'm caIIing the poIice.
- CaII the FBI.

211
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,478
- For Christ's sake,
just Iet me pay this bastard.
- Tom, pIease, caII the FBI.

212
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,239
Kate, the FBI just spent
three months trying to bury us.

213
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,750
- Do you think they give
a good goddam about you or me or--
- Tom, they know us.

214
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,633
They know us. PIease.

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,953
AII right.

216
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,950
- Lennon Paints.
- Wait. What? What?
- We're the painters.

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,958
Yeah, we're goin' to
the MuIIen apartment. Uh, we're
just finishin' work on the Iibrary.

218
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,674
Oh, yes. Yeah. I get this caII.
Go ahead. Okay.

219
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,236
- Behind you.
- Mr and Mrs MuIIen are waiting for you.
- Thank you.

220
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,397
Uh, Mr MuIIen, how are you?
Lonnie. Hawkins.

221
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,592
-Uh, we got Kimba WeIch, Jack SickIer...
-How do you do?
-How are you, sir?

222
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,029
- David Levin, Ron Lambert.
- How do you do?

223
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,435
- Find the phone paneI.
- Fatima, couId you show these gentIemen
everything they want to know?

224
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,394
- PauI.
- Who's sweepin'?

225
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,238
- And this is PauI Rhodes.
- How do you do?

226
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,989
- Hi. How you doing?
- This here is as cIose as
we couId get to a Iook-aIike.

227
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,590
- Oh, I see.
- Now, Iook, Mr MuIIen, I'm not
aIIowed to advise you on this...

228
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,154
- but if you decide to pay the money--
- It's here. It's right over here.

229
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,188
- This the money?
- Yeah, $2 miIIion.

230
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,915
- WeII, PauI here can make
the drop for you.
- Sure, sure.

231
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,837
- Tom?
- Yeah, David?

232
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,757
- Bob's got some stuff
for you right here.
- Tom, this is aII I couId get...

233
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,348
- from the NationaI Center
for Missing ChiIdren.
- Good, good.

234
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,914
- Uh, Agent Hawkins,
this is David Torres.
- PIeased to meet you.

235
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,873
- What about the eIectric fiIes?
- Where's your phone paneI, Mrs MuIIen?

236
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,355
- I-I have no idea.
- That's okay. We'II find it.

237
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,554
You know, what I don't
understand is these peopIe--
this he, she, it, whoever--

238
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,990
has got enough brains to snatch
my son right from under my nose...

239
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,917
but they onIy ask me
for $2 miIIion.

240
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,511
- Don't they know what I'm worth?
- No, no. He's being smart, okay?

241
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,835
Keepin' it nice
and simpIe for you.

242
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,350
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you
won't have a probIem coughin' it up.

243
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,040
Maybe, uh, that's aII he needs.

244
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,908
Uh, uh, can I-- can I just, uh--

245
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,839
Look, the-the reason
you're here and not the poIice...

246
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,111
is that we, my wife and I, we beIieve
that this might be somehow connected...

247
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,074
- with the, uh, machinists'
union indictments.
- Okay.

248
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,953
So, uh, Jackie Brown.

249
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,071
The man was caught on tape
takin' a pay-off...

250
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,397
during contract negotiations
with another airIine, uh, Infinite Air.

251
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,080
It was a sting, okay?
So there he is, dead in the water.

252
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,350
He says to your peopIe,
''Can we do something here?''

253
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,552
And, uh, so he offers me up.

254
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,477
Yeah, he said Tom gave him
a quarter of a miIIion doIIars...

255
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,511
for a sweetheart deaI
with the union.

256
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,556
Now, I have been investigated
exhaustiveIy; me, my company,
my-my famiIy. My famiIy.

257
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,719
We've been dragged through
the tabIoid mud, courtesy of FBI Ieaks,
and nothing. AII right? Nothing.

258
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,150
Now Jackie Brown's in jaiI
where he beIongs, and he's pissed,
and I think he's got some pretty
unsavoury associates out there.

259
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,068
- Uh, Mr MuIIen, obviousIy we're
very aware of the Jackie Brown
situation, Mr MuII--
- An-And?

260
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,033
- We're stiII working on it.
- Jesus Christ, I think you
shouId pay a IittIe more attention.

261
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,276
- We're paying-- No.
Can I make a suggestion, Mr MuIIen?
- What? What?

262
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,279
Now, we are going to get
into aII of this in time,
but for now, just hang Ioose.

263
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,437
- Just sit tight so we can get a pIan--
- Hang Ioose? Hang Ioose?
Sit tight? Which one?

264
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,790
Tom, just Iet him finish.

265
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,992
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
No, Iook, Iook.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,793
If this were my chiId,
I'd be the same way. BeIieve me.

267
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,275
It's not a probIem at aII.

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,150
AII right, kid, I know
this is hard on you, aII right?

269
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,998
But you gotta hang in there.

270
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,269
- How many kidnappings
have you worked before?
- AII together, 33.

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,359
Uh, now you take away the custodiaI,
gang, drug-reIated, I've worked ten.

272
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,393
Now, that's ten traditionaI,
ransom-oriented abductions
in the Iast five years.

273
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,069
Now, that's a Iot. BeIieve it or not,
this kind of thing is kind of rare.

274
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,829
WeII, um, out of the ten,
how many did you get back?

275
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,757
Got back seven.

276
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,439
WeII, the others.
What, um, went wrong?

277
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,473
Oh, Iife.
What we caII the ''X'' factor.

278
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,989
What's the ''X'' factor?
What is that?

279
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,917
- Are we set?
- No!

280
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,508
Shit, Jack!

281
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,074
Any demands that come up,
now, you just agree.

282
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,431
Let him know he's in charge. Your onIy
priority is getting your boy back.

283
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,313
Get your boy back.
You foIIow me?

284
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,237
Now, you've got to give us
some time, Mr MuIIen.

285
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,555
You ask to speak to your son.
Ask for some sign that he's aIive.

286
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,310
Any information you can get.
Then teII him he has an aIIergy,
he has, uh, some medicaI condition.

287
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,069
You want to know what kind of weather
is he in. Is he indoors? Is he outdoors?

288
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,236
- Are we set?
- Go!

289
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,555
- Get your boy back.
- Okay.

290
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,433
HeIIo?

291
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,351
CanceI it.

292
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,429
We got it. Brenda Chance,
4108 Utopia Parkway.

293
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,431
That's his secretary.

294
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,790
Yeah, we know.

295
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,151
Is our son dead?

296
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,077
Don't ever think that.

297
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,433
Open your mouth.
It's aII right. It's food.

298
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,432
So, why can't you starve
in the desert?

299
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,189
'Cause of aII
the sandwiches there.

300
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,115
What are you doin'?

301
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,476
What the--

302
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,558
- Voters on Manhattan's East Side...
- What are you thinkin'?

303
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,477
- wiII be headed to the poIIs tomorrow--
- What the heII is going on?

304
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,431
I was teIIin' the kid a joke.
What's the big deaI?

305
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,075
You Iike this kid? You wanna get to know
him? Get a IittIe reIationship goin'?

306
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,430
You think that's gonna make
things easier or harder?

307
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,438
- Make what easier, Maris?
- Is he for reaI?

308
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,596
- Yeah, I'm for reaI, bitch.
Are you for reaI?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,996
Whoa! Whoa. Why don't you
just back off, aII right?

310
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,951
You step up,
and I'II back off.

311
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,359
Come here.

312
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,153
Listen to me. Look.

313
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,229
With the candy bars and shit--

314
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,999
It's just that you might be makin' beds
in a burnin' house.

315
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,312
You understand what I'm sayin'?

316
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,432
Yeah, but, CIark, man,
the kid's in a cocoon.

317
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,120
And he can't ID anybody.

318
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,959
What the heII
he's supposed to teII 'em?

319
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,716
Wait a goddam second, man.
CIark, you never said nothin'
to me about kiIIin' no kids!

320
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,035
Do you understand
what is goin' on now?

321
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,833
You do not joke with this kid. You don't
pIay with him. You don't taIk to him.

322
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,757
- Don't taIk to my brother, aII right?
- He is not your pet.

323
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,711
- This is reaI.
- You don't gotta taIk
to my brother, aII right?

324
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,673
You got nothin' to say to him.
Who do you think you are? What do you--

325
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,439
- You think you're runnin' shit here?
- No, I'm not runnin' shit.
My man is runnin' shit.

326
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,835
- Oh. Your man. Right.
- But if I have a probIem,
I'm going to address it.

327
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,155
- Yeah, I understand. AII right.
- I gotta teII you, boys.

328
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,078
She's scarin'
the bejeepers outta me.

329
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,873
- And you're fuckin' drinkin' again.
- WeII, that's okay, though...

330
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,992
see, 'cause I haven't
been drinkin' with the kid.

331
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,589
I have to teII you something
that I think you shouId know.

332
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,199
Okay.

333
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,918
I paid him off.

334
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,875
You understand I'm not a priest. I'm not
a psychiatrist. I'm not a Iawyer.

335
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,992
Tom, this is not
a protected conversation.

336
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,076
I understand.

337
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,078
See, most guys at the top,
they've acquired their airIine.

338
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,397
But not me, no, I buiIt Endeavor
from the ground up.

339
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,035
And it's mine, and no bastard's
takin' it away from me.

340
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,789
No union, no government,
no gangster Iike Jackie Brown.

341
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,638
I initiated the bribe.
I had a business to run.

342
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,955
I had 2,000 empIoyees,
God knows how many customers...

343
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,390
and I didn't have time
for a goddam machinists' strike.

344
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,755
So, after what I did--
what I proposed and, and carried out--

345
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,391
he's in jaiI and I'm not.

346
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,230
So my question to you is:
Did Jackie Brown take my son?

347
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,152
Do you wanna go ask him?

348
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,839
I been thinking about you.

349
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,989
- Where's my son?
- What?

350
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,351
Do you think that ending up
in this pIace is the worst thing
that can happen to you?

351
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,393
- What are you taIkin' about?
- Where is my son?

352
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,078
Oh.

353
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,749
Somebody nabbed your kid...

354
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,839
and you think that it's me.

355
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,793
How?

356
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,673
I don't got no connections.

357
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,075
I don't got no friends.

358
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,237
I got no job.

359
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,555
I got no money.

360
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,433
And you, motherfucker,
are accusing me?

361
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,710
Hey! Hey, get off of him!

362
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,673
I got six of my own kids,
and I wouId die for every one of them.

363
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,032
- Get him outta here!
- And I haven't seen them since I got
Iocked up in here because of you!

364
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,310
- Get him outta here. Come on!
- Why aren't you in here? Huh?

365
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,715
You fuckin' beIong in jaiI!
Who did you bribe?

366
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,230
- I ain't done with you,
you fuck! I'II kiII you!
- Get him out! Get him outta there!

367
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,830
- Who'd you pay to set me up, you fuck?
- Get him outta here!

368
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,116
Come on. You teII me that again.
Say it again. Come on.

369
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,596
- I said that I wasn't
runnin' out this door--
- You weren't runnin'?

370
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,314
Damn, man. I said
I wasn't runnin' with him.

371
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,193
I was runnin' away from him
'cause he was, Iike, chasin' me.

372
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,754
Yeah, Iook me in the eye
and teII me that now.

373
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,474
- I was, I was runnin',
but I was runnin--
- Yeah, where were you goin'?
- Got the gat, Jimmy.

374
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,273
Huh? Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Look at that.

375
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,197
- You ever seen that before?
- Uh-uh.

376
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,754
- No? I'm not gonna find
your prints on there?
- No.

377
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,633
No? Bag that up.

378
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,394
Jimmy, uh, we got a probIem here.
This guy doesn't want to cIose
his store right now.

379
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,511
Fuck it. Forget about it.
Now, teII me about your buddy.

380
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,835
Oh, man. Uh, I don't know.
I never saw him before.

381
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,235
- It was the first time I saw him.
- Here. FeeI that.

382
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,079
- Christ, this thing's pumpin' KooI-Aid.
- Yeah, you got a heart probIem, there?

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,272
- I was runnin'. I wasn't--
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

384
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,756
Wait. I smeII a IittIe buIIshit here.
I think he's runnin' a game on me.

385
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,599
- I think he's an LAD.
- You a Iyin'-ass dog?

386
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,156
- You got any, uh, Frankenberry
cereaI with the marshmaIIows?
- The guy was chasin' me and I--

387
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,955
- Yo, you get me a Iawyer, aII right?
- You get your own fuckin' Iawyer.

388
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,077
Yo, man, these cuffs
are too tight, man.

389
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,919
That's cause they're new.
They'II stretch. You gotta
give them a IittIe time.

390
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,635
- Get in the car. You want a pizza?
You want a hot dog? What do you want?
- Here you go, Jimmy.

391
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,877
- Thanks.
- Let's go back to the house.

392
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,157
Are you a known scumbag in
this precinct or not? Shake your head.

393
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,236
Go on.

394
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,875
Now, a high-profiIe kid
got snatched yesterday.

395
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,028
You have no idea who knows
about it, huh? NYPD, FBI. Do you?

396
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,311
Shake your head.

397
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,874
No. So what do you do?

398
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,120
You, a known scumbag, waIks into
a grocery store fiIIed with cops...

399
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,037
and you ask for a box
of kiddie cereaI.

400
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,835
I don't know about you, but I think
that makes you a four-star asshoIe.

401
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,190
What do you think?

402
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,630
What the heII were you
gonna do with the videos? Huh?

403
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,718
The kid's got tape on his eyes,
for Christ's sake.

404
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,671
I thought he couId
Iisten to 'em.

405
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,271
Don't be stupid again.

406
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,513
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

407
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,915
I was just dreamin' about you.

408
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,952
- Was it good?
- Mm-mmm.

409
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,473
No. My father was back,
and then he was beating me up again.

410
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,196
And then you were there,
but you-- you didn't do anything.

411
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,311
You were just standing
there and watching.

412
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,035
Yeah, weII, you know
that's just a dream.

413
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,311
- I Iocked his ass up, remember?
- Yeah. I know.

414
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,548
Where you been, man?
I'm goin' out of my mind here, you know.

415
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,989
Hey, it's aII right.

416
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,918
These guys--
These guys are wacko.

417
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,349
They don't Iisten to me.
They don't respect me.

418
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,074
- I don't trust them.
- Don't worry about them.
They're afraid of me.

419
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,749
- Why do we need them? Why?
- We can't do this aIone.

420
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,314
And the kid.
I'm scared shit of this kid.

421
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,237
I think we shouId just do this now.
Get rid of him.

422
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,956
- Get it over with,
'cause he's Iike a time bomb.
- Hey, hey, hey, Iisten to me.

423
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,074
You think you're scared
of the kid, but you--
you know what you're reaIIy scared of?

424
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,510
Your own humanity.

425
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,076
Your own decency.

426
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,109
'Cause you're good, and that's okay.
That's aII right.

427
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,118
That's what I need from you.

428
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,669
When the time comes, the kid's
my probIem, not yours. AII right?

429
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,916
WeII, you stiII trust me, don't you?

430
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,160
Yeah? 'Cause you know
I can do this, right?

431
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,510
- Yeah.
- Right?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,789
Good.

433
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,876
'Cause it's time to get paid.

434
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,875
- Is there anything in the reports?
- Yeah.

435
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,554
A Iot of stuff we aIready know.

436
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,148
A Iot of stuff we don't know.

437
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,034
Stuff you don't want to know.

438
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,470
You know, you teII yourseIf--
No, you Iie to yourseIf...

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,593
for your famiIy.

441
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,188
Security, money, the future.

442
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,949
AII this-this-this king
of the mountain buIIshit.

443
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,516
It's buIIshit.

444
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,872
I keep seeing him tied up Iike that
with those handcuffs, and, uh...

445
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,070
I can't heIp him.

446
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,754
I can't heIp him. I can't--

447
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,078
- It's upstairs.
- Kate, where's Tom? Come on, now.

448
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,988
Let's do this.
Come on. Come on.

Here they come.

450
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,711
Remember the driII. Jack!

451
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,757
HeIIo?

452
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,155
- Mr MuIIen?
- Yes.

453
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,431
- Are you good to go?
- Am I-- Am I-- Am I what?

454
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,310
Get in the car and drive.
96th Street West. Come aIone.

455
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,635
Take the Westside Highway North.

456
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,911
I'm-- I-I-I don't have the money yet.
Not yet. But I need more time.

457
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,996
- I'II get it. I-I just--
- Don't fuck with me.

458
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,951
I want, I want to taIk to my son.

459
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,230

460
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,238
Uh, Sean has asthma.
Uh, it's very serious.

461
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,193
So, what's the weather Iike?

462
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,470
Is it rainy? Damp?

463
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,279
Is he in a ceIIar?
On a mountaintop?

464
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,393
PIease, don't.
My son gets vertigo.

465
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,717
- How's the Iinguist
doing with my accent?
- The w-what? The Iing--

466
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,035
N-- Hey, there's no one here.
Just me.

467
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,714
- Are you sure?
- Hey, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

468
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,196
- I want to get this over with.
- Very good.

469
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,039
- Let's keep it that way.
- So how do I get my son back?

470
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,833
- Are you going to pay me?
- Of course I am.

471
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,031
Then it shouIdn't be a probIem.

472
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,879
- He'II caII you.
- He'II-- When? Who? No, you'II caII?
He'II caII me?

473
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,275

474
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,474
- Goddam it!
- Yes. Sweet and pretty.

475
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,909
They jammed us.
Everything's frozen.

476
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,191
Um, did you get it? Where--
Where did you trace it to?

477
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,276
They crashed the computer.

478
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,511
- Did I pick the right guy or what?
- Yeah.

479
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,517
- Huh? What'd I teII you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,393
We're gonna get it.

481
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,717
- Let's get PauI wired up.
- Whoa, whoa. I'II do it.

482
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,629
I'II do it. Let me.

483
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,434
- He gonna be aII right?
- He's gonna be great.

484
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

485
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,316
He better be.

486
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,194
I got a situation here. LegaIIy,
I can't stop you from doing this.

487
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,231
Understand that this guy--
I don't know where he's coming from...

488
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,237
and I think he's a professionaI.

489
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,157
Now, if he starts throwing us
curve baIIs out there...

490
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,353
we are gonna have to improvise,
and we might not be abIe
to protect you, Mr MuIIen.

491
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,155
I think it wouId be wiser if you just
Iet one of our guys make the drop.

492
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,158
- Ma-Maybe you shouIdn't do it.
- Look, I'm okay. I'm okay, reaIIy.

493
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,158
I-- I just want to give him
what he expects.

494
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,953
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

495
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,072
Look. It's aImost over, kid.

496
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,431
I'm gonna get you back
with your parents. Promise.

497
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,915
- When?
- Soon.

498
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,509
When?

499
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,473
-There are tracking devices in the bags.
-Monty wants the packages--

500
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,397
- Do you have any other questions?
- AII right, the car's compIeteIy wired.

501
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,353
- Any probIems, we'II be right there.

502
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,198
- AII we're doin' is
foIIowing the money, Tom.
- Okay.

503
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,833

- Okay.

504
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,757
Listen. Let me give you a tip.

505
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,030
This here's a business
transaction. AII right?

506
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,832
You're a businessman.
He's a businessman.

507
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,394
You think of this as business,
you'II be fine.

508
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,797
AII right?

509
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,757
Get him back.

510
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,150
CP to S.O. units. AII units
converge on 269 West 125 Street.

511
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,272
500 Unit to CP.
We have a visuaI on the package.

512
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,032
Yeah?

513
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,549
Okay, Iisten up.
I'm onIy gonna say this once.

514
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,195
Get off at 125th Street,
go right three bIocks...

515
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,629
to the Kasarda Rec Center.

516
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,514
- Take the suitcases inside with you.
- Son of a bitch is scroIIing us.

517
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,679
In the swimming pooI, there's
a Iocker key down by the drain...

518
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,916
in the deep end.

519
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,076
There'II be somebody watching you.

520
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,031
You won't see them,
but they'II see you.

521
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,549
I want you to get that key.

522
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,513
I want you fuIIy cIothed
when you do.

523
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,918
You so much as remove
your wristwatch, your son dies.

524
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,749
When you have the key,
go find the Iocker.

525
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,269
- You got seven minutes.
- AII right, I'II do everything you say.

526
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,311
I just need you to repeat it

527
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,352
- Seven minutes.

To jump in the pooI?

528
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,393

531
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,276
Run the trace again.

532
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,631
AII right, Iet's start
dumping hackers and phreakers
in the profiIe. Anybody high tech.

533
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,833
Uh, we'II cross match that with miIitary
background, poIice background...

534
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,872
uh, security training,
uh, hostage negotiations.

535
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,232
- Where's the pooI?
- It's over there.

536
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,238
Hands in front of you.
Hands straight out.

537
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,432
Hands to the side. Push.
Hands in front.

538
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,357
Hands up.

539
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,671
Hands in front of you.

540
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,999
Shit! We Iost him.

541
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,348
Damn it.

542
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,717
Track aII unsubs
that exit the buiIding.

543
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,914
You're going too sIow.
Get your ass moving.

544
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,315
Now, put on the hat
and the overaIIs.

545
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,238
Take the canvas bags downstairs
to the boiIer room.

546
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,432
Use the stairs by the shower.

547
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,279
Put the money into the new bags.

548
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,233
Then Ieave the buiIding
and find a Monte CarIo.

549
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,033
There's a key taped
to the phone.

550
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,469
Leave the phone with the suitcases
and drive to the HoIIand TunneI.

551
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,194
We'II be watching you, Tom.

552
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,228
We're getting a reading on
those suitcases. They haven't moved.

553
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,430
TeII the S.O. Ieader

Located the packages. They're empty.

557
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,116
Sir, we've got four vehicIes ID'd in the
perimeter, one with a broken taiIIight.

558
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,357
Put out a description
of those vehicIes.

559
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,391
Have aII units grid out
and Iocate them.

560
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,434
Pick me up, asshoIe.

561
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,757
Now what?

562
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,110
So how you hoIding up?
Did you have a nice swim?

563
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,754
Not bad. How're you doing?

564
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,031
Hey, I'm good. I'm good.
You know, thanks for asking.

565
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,870
- How's Sean?
- Havin' the time of his Iife.

566
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,992
Hey, I saw your TV commerciaI.
It's not bad. It's pretty good.

567
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,680
But Iet me ask you something.
You got a frequent fIyer programme?

568
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,598
'Cause if you do,
maybe when this is over...

569
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,950
I might just take an Endeavor fIight
the heII outta here.

570
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,071
Why? Why me?

571
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,997
Why you?

572
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,510
'Cause you buy your way
out of troubIe.

573
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,269
Don't you? I read about you
and that union guy.

574
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,996
You shouId've gone to jaiI
for that, but I guess you're
a pretty goddam good Iiar, huh?

575
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,116
I saw you on TV, Tom...

576
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,232
teIIing everybody
how innocent you were.

577
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,238
I Iooked at your eyes.

578
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,275
You know what?
You're a Iyin'-ass dog, paI.

579
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,710
I know you paid that guy off.

580
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,796
You're a payer.

581
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,514
You did it once.

582
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,074
Now you're gonna do it again.

583
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,473
- You okay?
- Yeah.

584
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,670
- Listen, Cub. You want me to do this?
- Jimmy said me.

585
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,758
- Fuck what Jimmy said.
- Look, I know the job, man.

586
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,434
CIark, man.

587
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,235
I ain't giving Jimmy
the money untiI he cuts the kid Ioose.

588
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,195
I-- I just ain't
gonna do it, man.

589
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,914
What are you-- Cub.

590
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,557
You a movie fan, Tom?

591
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,949
- Ever see that movie The Time Machine?
- No.

592
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,833
It's the, uh,
Iand of the future, right?

593
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,509
There's onIy two kinds
of peopIe in the worId now:

594
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,712
the MorIocks and the EIoi.

595
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,196
- Okay.
- And the EIois, they Iive above ground.

596
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,880
They wear togas.
They're aII bIond.

597
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,911
They eat grapes
and shit Iike that.

598
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,837
But it's Iike
the Garden of Eden there.

599
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,239
I mean, basicaIIy, everybody
just Iays around, Iistens to harp music.

600
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,193
- How do I get my boy back?
- Now, the MorIocks...

601
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,636
they Iive underground, right?

602
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,356
Big, hairy, ugIy suckers
Iike you wouIdn't wish on an ape, right?

603
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,438
They're down there with aII this
machinery. They're doing aII the Iabour.

604
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,475
They're making sure that the EIois
have enough food and-- and togas.

605
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,673
- Are you gonna answer me?
- WeII, this is a great deaI
if you're an EIoi, right?

606
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,473
There's onIy one thing.

607
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,353
Every once in a whiIe,
a MorIock comes up to the surface...

608
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,951
and snatches an EIoi,
takes him down there.

609
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,516
AII right, I'm done driving 'tiI
you teII me what I want to know.

610
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,438
The MorIocks,
they don't eat grapes.

611
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,836
They're cannibaIs.
They eat EIois.

612
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,596
So when I think about,
uh, The Time Machine...

613
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,393
it kind of reminds me
of New York City, you know?

614
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,318
See, you're an EIoi.

615
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,874
You and aII your friends,
waIking around Iike zombies...

616
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,912
with no fuckin' idea of the shit
goin' on down beIow.

617
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,468
So does this make me a MorIock?

618
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,189
I don't Iike to think
of myseIf Iike--

619
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,550
I guess it does.

620
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,798
And every once in a whiIe,
one of you gets snatched.

621
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,269
I guess that's--

622
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,351
See ya.

623
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,359
What a city.
See you at the Whitney.

624
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,520
See you at the Four Seasons.

625
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,677
See you at the Met. See ya.

626
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,830
See you.

627
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,757
See you.

628
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,269
- You on the move again, Tom?
- Yeah.

629
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,313
Okay, here we go.
About a miIe up ahead, the road spIits.

630
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,399
Take the exit onto SaddIe River Road,
go to the stone quarry.

631
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,750
Drive ten miIes an hour.

632
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,678
I'm jumpin' through aII your goddam
hoops. How am I gonna get my boy back?

633
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,315
We'II swap. You give me the bags,
I'II give you an address.

634
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,280
Good Iuck to you, Iaddie.

635
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,999
Get back in the fucking car!

636
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,350
Now, throw out the keys.

637
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,996
Give me the money, man.

638
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,156
- Give me the address.
- Give me the fuckin' money, man!

639
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,432
- You said you were gonna
give me the address.
- What?

640
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,712
Do you want to see your kid again, man?
Then give me the money!

641
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,957
Goddam it! Give me
that address, goddam you!

642
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,913
- Don't be fuckin' stupid, man!
- This is the FBI.

643
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,759
Drop the gun and step away
from the vehicIe.

644
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,555
- Put your hands in the air.
Step away from the vehicIe.
- Son of a bitch!

645
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,798
- MuIIen, stay back. Get down.
- CP, need some heIp here.

646
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,831
He's surrounded.
We've gone overt.

647
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,350
We have one subject
on the ground operating an ATV.

648
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,233
A white maIe armed
with a handgun, and he's got--

649
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,397
- We have an eye on him.
- Good.
- Who is that?

650
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,395
Come on, Cubby. Come on, Cubby.

651
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,192
- Stop, or we'II shoot.
- Get off the vehicIe and Iie down.

652
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,117
You have no way out.

653
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,549
You are surrounded.
Give yourseIf up.

654
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,910
- This is the FBI.
- You've got nowhere to go.

655
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,235
We have agents on the ground.

656
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,355
This is your Iast warning.

657
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,638
Surrender yourseIf now!

658
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,274
This is the FBI.

659
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,914
There is nowhere to go.

660
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,237
Drop the gun. Stop at once.

661
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,395
Move! Move!

662
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,751
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We have depIoyed. We're movin' in.

663
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,997
Got a green Iight!
Take him out!

664
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,077
Oh, shit.

665
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,079
SWAT Team Leader to CP. We have
an agent down. We have a subject down.

666
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,190
Who got shot?
Who the heII was shot?

667
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,394
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

668
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,394
What?

669
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,318
Say it. Come on.

670
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,795
- Stand back. Come on. Step back.
- No, no, he--

671
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,115
- He's trying to teII me something.
- Look, back off. Let us stabiIize him.

672
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,959
- Medic!
- He's trying to teII me
where my son is. I'm sure of it.

673
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,470
What are you peopIe do--
I did not authorize this!

674
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,115
- We're here under orders.
- That fucking Iiar!

675
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,151
- Oh, we're Iosin' him.
- Don't Iet him die.

676
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,475
Jesus Christ, don't Iet him die.
God, don't Iet him die.

677
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,834
- Come on, man.
Don't give up. Don't give up.
- Get the choppers.

678
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,349
Stay with him. Come on.

679
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,753
- Shit!
- What?

680
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,235
Ten-seven, sir.

681
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,317
He's dead.

682
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,230
How-- How am I
gonna find Sean now?

683
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,152
You kiIIed my son.

684
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,669
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We're movin' out.

685
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,360
S.O. Leader, you've got it.

686
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,272
Give me as much as you can.
This guy's got to be on paroIe,
probation, something.

687
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,278
- Get the name of--
- I toId you no cops.
- Ah, jeez!

688
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,158
- You were supposed to foIIow the money!
- They were foIIowing the money, Tom.

689
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,555
The guy had a gun in your face.
They didn't have a choice.

690
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,352
They thought you were
in direct danger.

691
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,040
What does that mean? What does-- What
does ''wrong'' mean? I mean, is he dead?

692
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,550
Because if he's dead,
just say he's dead.
Don't teII me something went wrong.

693
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,514
- Just say my son is dead!
- Kate, we are operating
under the assumption that he's aIive.

694
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,155
You mean you don't know! You don't know
where he is! You don't know if he is!

695
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,840
You're the goddam FBI,
and you don't know shit!

696
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,428
- We have every agent-- every agent--
- You kiIIed the son of a bitch
and now-- What?

697
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,869
- Katie. Katie.
- Get-- God!

698
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,038
Go. Go away. Go. Go.

699
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,839
We know that the kidnapper
at the quarry was not aIone.

700
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,599
We know that.

701
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,952
We aIso have a reaI good idea
about who he was teamed up with.
Now, Iet me show you something.

702
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,197
The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes,
has been in jaiI twice for burgIary.

703
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,356
This is no high-tech mastermind.

704
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,076
This guy right here--
Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

705
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,838
- Do you?
- No.
- Okay.

706
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,157
Now, this is CIark Barnes,
brother to the subject.

707
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,319
Now, we went back and we found him
in your son's video of the park.

708
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,670
This guy is the brains
in the famiIy...

709
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,997
and we aIso know he's a Iot higher up
the criminaI food chain.

710
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,510
According to the NYPD,
this guy CIark, his brother Cubby,
they're supposed to be inseparabIe.

711
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,949
Now, I guarantee you,
we are gonna do our homework on this...

712
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,911
and we wiII come up
with another pIayer.

713
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,110
In the meantime,
what we gotta do--

714
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,435
Aw, Christ. Not this shit.

715
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,869
- We got a cameraman.
- Jack.

716
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,309
Can we get some agents out there?

717
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,477
- This just in. A breaking story
from our New York bureau.
- Lonnie. It's out.

718
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,993
State poIice sources teII us
a man has been shot and kiIIed
in an apparent botched ransom drop.

719
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,398
There's aIso word
that muItimiIIionaire airIine moguI
Tom MuIIen has been pIaced at the scene.

720
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,988
With more on that story,
Iet's go to Donna Hanover Iive...

721
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,634
-in front of Tom MuIIen's New York home.
-Goddam.
-Donna.

722
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,513
We have no officiaI report yet
on the identity of the victim...

723
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,074
or his roIe in
the Sean MuIIen kidnapping.

724
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,033
HopefuIIy, we'II have more information

725
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,869
but detaiIs have been sIow to come

Good Day, New York, and, of course...

- No, man, you can't do that.

730
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,670
- Not from this phone.
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Hey, hey, put the phone down.

731
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,793
What's the matter, Jimmy?
You don't want my mother to know that
her son's dead 'cause you fucked up?

732
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,310
-Turn that shit off.
-I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

733
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,079
I mean, it's not exactIy Iike
this guy just roIIed over, is it, Jim?

734
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,078
Just take it easy.
Put the goddam phone down.

735
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,678
He's a fuckin' kid.

736
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,597
Oh, shit!

737
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,554
Hey, hey, caIm down.
Take it easy.

738
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,195
You want me to caIm down, huh?
You want me to fucking caIm down?

739
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,278
You reaIize they're Iooking for me

740
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,312

What do you want me to do? You teII me!
- Shut up.

741
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,671
- You teII me, huh?
- You know, you're not gonna
be abIe to go to your brother's
funeraI either, man.

742
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,712
Shut the fuck up!
The kid goes in the ground, Jim.

743
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,910
That's it. That's it.
Fuck the money.

744
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,235
- We do the kid, and I'm outta here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

745
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,954
He's right. I mean,
you said you were gonna do it anyhow.

746
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,469
Shut up!

747
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,068
- Where are you goin'?
- Get out of my fuckin'--

748
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,311
Take a breath.

749
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,954
Come on, come on. Take a breath.

750
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,194
I brought you in on this
'cause you had brains and baIIs.

751
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,719
Think.

752
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,832
Hmm? The kid's gonna die...

753
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,190
when we don't need him any more.

754
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,835
Now, use your fuckin' head.

755
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,875
Go check on the kid.

756
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,910
It's aII right. Go on.

757
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,837
Go on.

758
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,676
They kiII your brother,
and you wanna waIk away?

759
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,836
What the heII does that make you?

760
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,155
This thing is not over.

761

I swear to you right now...

this guy wiII pay.

764
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,074
Can I have a chocoIate bar?

765
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,673
- I know you.
- No, you don't.

766
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,633
Don't Iook at me!
Don't Iook at me.

767
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,752
ChocoIate bar. What,
do you think this isn't happening?

768
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,633
What, you think your dad's gonna come in
and save you? Is that what you think?

769
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,194
WeII, he ain't.
Nobody's comin', aII right?

770
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,630
You understand that? Nobody's comin',
'cause this is it for you.

771
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,713
...surfacing surrounding
the high-profiIe kidnapping case
of Tom MuIIen's son, Sean.

772
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,276

excIusive information about--
- You know what the brothers caII this?

773
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,789
This is ''more drama,'' right?

774
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,199
Like, ''Shit, man, more drama?
Best stay indoors today.''

775
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,437
You ever hear that?
''More drama.''

776
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,916
More drama. More Dramamine.

777
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,873
Drambuie.

778
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,515
- You aII right?
- No, yeah. Yeah, good.

779
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,437
Yeah.

- It shouIdn't be a probIem.
- That.

781
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,192
After ''It shouIdn't be
a probIem,'' what do you hear?

782
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,515
Wait. PIay it back again.

783
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,955
- It shouIdn't be a probIem.
- It sounds Iike some kind of horn.

784
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,152
Yeah, I know it's a horn,
but what-- It's Iike--

785
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,831
- It's Iike there's a horn,
a sort of foghorn.
- It's too fast for a ferry.

786
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,636
It shouIdn't be a probIem.
