1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,780
I dare say, you wish you'd 
never left Versailles.

3
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,017
You had a very pleasant time at court...

4
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:00,039
...with those gallant young officers.

5
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,567
With one in particular, I recall.

6
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,886
Why have we come here?

7
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,437
For YOUR sake. my love!

8
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,887
In order that you may have a husband...

9
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:09,973
....who IS a husband...

10
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,585
...and not just an invalid!

11
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,881
I'll soon be well...

12
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,292
Three months at the baths should cure me.

13
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:21,777
Welcome to the Chateau de Résance

14
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,906
your Excellency.

15
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,214
At last!

16
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,770
Help me, help me, someone...

17
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,977
This coach is an infernal rack!

18
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,834
That's it... steady... easy...

19
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,762
Easy!

20
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,657
Easy! Dolts! Easy!

21
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,559
Easy... easy!

22
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,298
Your Excellency

23
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:06,508
need not bother with the stairs...

24
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:08,619
We will prepare a room on the ground floor.

25
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,232
How far is it to the baths?

26
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,128
About an hour's drive.

27
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,404
I'll go the first thing in the morning.

28
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,736
Thank you, your Excellency.

29
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,391
A fine way to spend a honeymoon!

30
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,154
You'll find the days rather long, I'm afraid.

31
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,076
The time will pass.

32
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,691
They've sent for a maid.

33
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,028
Not necessary... I'm quite capable.

34
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,989
My dear...

35
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:36,966
You may be capable...

36
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,668
as the daughter of a Scottish merchant...

37
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:40,943
in Leghorn...

38
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:43,921
But as Madame la Marquise de Vincitata...

39
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,516
...wife of a grandee of Spain...

40
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,791
...who is envoy to the King of France...

41
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,568
At all times!

42
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,849
Yes, your Excellency.

43
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,088
There!...

44
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,396
You must be tired.

45
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,503
Don't let ME keep you any longer.

46
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,699
Good night, your Excellency.

47
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,150
Good night, Maria.

48
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:40,961
At what hour

49
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:42,538
will we leave for the baths, your Excellency?

50
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,196
Eight!

51
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,159
Denis...

52
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,722
Dear Denis...

53
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,455
Oh, Merciful Mother... help me to forget him.

54
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,587
Madame...

55
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:55,299
Yes?

56
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:56,398
My name is Lucia, madame...

57
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,700
I am the new maid.

58
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:02,087
What time is it?

59
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:03,414
It's scarcely daybreak...

60
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,560
But I was told it was a matter of life and death.

61
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,267
- Who gave you this?  - The cook's sister.

62
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,859
- And she?   - Don't worry, madame...

63
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,815
She told me to tell you...

64
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,220
...that she can hold her tongue.

65
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,813
And the rest of the servants are asleep.

66
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,043
Madame...

67
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:30,155
If there is any way in which I can help...

68
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,839
"By the mill at the first bridge".

69
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,930
Denis!

70
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,710
Maria!

71
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,091
Oh, I never dreamt you'd come!

72
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:00,014
How could it be otherwise?

73
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,671
But here is so far...

74
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:03,827
Ten days from Paris!

75
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,685
Oh, darling, what's going to happen to us?

76
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,625
- I do love you... I do!    - Dearest!

77
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,435
These are for always.

78
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,529
Always!

79
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:34,901
And you WILL take me away from him?

80
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,496
- Yes, I swear it!   - When?

81
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:37,501
You must trust me, my dear...

82
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:38,387
It will take planning...

83
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,267
Your husb...

84
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,608
The Marquis has powerful friends...

85
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:42,693
It would never do to fail.

86
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,580
First, I must go back to Paris.

87
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,064
Back to Paris?!

88
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,178
We'll need money, if we're to get out of France.

89
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,255
Besides, I'm an officer...

90
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,139
I can't desert.

91
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,927
I'd have to resign my commission.

92
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,910
Denis, I'm frightened!

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,176
Let's not think of it now, dearest...

94
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,939
We've many days to talk it over.

95
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,599
Meanwhile...

96
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,084
We mustn't wait too long.

97
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,401
In 2 or 3 months, he'll be well, and...

98
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,735
Madame...

99
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,395
He's back from the baths.

100
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,816
Tomorrow?

101
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,861
Provide he isn't home...

102
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,169
I'll get a message to you somehow.

103
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,310
Au revoir, dearest.

104
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,990
You've made extraordinary progress

105
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,698
in 3 months, monsieur.

106
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,617
In few days...

107
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,638
you'll be able to continue your honeymoon.

108
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,342
That's a nice way to put it, doctor!

109
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,345
But the truth is...

110
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,649
My honeymoon has never quite started!

111
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,357
And to think you've been all the way to Paris!

112
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,795
- Did you miss me?   - Oh, darling!

113
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,414
What is it, Maria?... You're frightened!

114
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,129
You're trembling!

115
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,283
Can't you guess?

116
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,901
I'm yours now... All yours!

117
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,380
Oh, my dearest!

118
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,224
We must leave at once... Tonight!

119
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,669
What if Don Luis returns?

120
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,281
He's been staying at the baths lately...

121
00:10:58,287 --> 00:10:59,555
But I know he's ever so much better...

122
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,597
I'll watch for your signal.

123
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,397
One candle if I can go...

124
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,987
Two, if I can't.

125
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:05,515
And if you're in trouble my dear...

126
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,253
If anything should happen...

127
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:08,631
Then, I'll light three!

128
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,744
Dearest!

129
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,379
Rejoice, my dear!

130
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,407
Your husband is complete again!

131
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,369
I shan't say good night...

132
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,508
Dismiss your maid, when you've retired.

133
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,882
Did you hear someone running about?

134
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,421
Yes, master!

135
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,904
What does this mean?

136
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,260
Come here!

137
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,992
No!

138
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,742
What name?!

139
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,696
His name?!

140
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,550
Denis!

141
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:36,943
You...

142
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:40,771
...a merchant's daughter!

143
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,090
To soil the honour of my name!

144
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,878
The world will never know...

145
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,557
Do you hear me?!  Never!

146
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:49,545
That I vow!

147
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,548
There was no message, monsieur.

148
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,946
They left early this morning...

149
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:55,986
...bag and baggage.

150
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:56,717
Madame too?

151
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,568
Madame, the maid, the marquis...

152
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:00,278
Which way did they go?

153
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:01,940
By the road to Issoire.

154
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,536
Thank you.

155
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,922
I'm looking for a coach...

156
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:20,993
A large coach...

157
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,515
with a bearded man and two women.

158
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,355
It's here... came a little while ago.

159
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,138
When her supper comes...

160
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:45,863
...serve it quickly...

161
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:48,153
We may leave very soon.

162
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:52,463
Did you know my dear that I have the reputation

163
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,010
of being one of the best swordsman in Europe.

164
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:57,119
However, it's too late to think of that,

165
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:58,474
I'm afraid.

166
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,694
And he's so tired, poor boy...

167
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,764
So tired!... So worried!

168
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,064
Not in the house, please...

169
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:53,199
You are quick, m'sieur!

170
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:55,589
Quick to betray... quick to dishonour!

171
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,443
He's clumsy...

172
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,308
He can't harm the young man.

173
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,402
Denis!

174
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,660
Order the coach Sancho...

175
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,113
We'll continue our journey at once.

176
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,667
Poor boy!

177
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,551
Open up!

178
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,304
Who are you?

179
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:32,503
Never mind who we are...

180
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:34,471
Give her money, and hold your tongue.

181
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:35,727
Oh, m'lord!

182
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,351
It's come, master!

183
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,144
It's come... It's a boy!

184
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:27,460
Alive?!

185
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,914
Drive on, Sancho!

186
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,139
I thought you were in Paris.

187
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:47,860
Where's Maria?

188
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,091
Didn't you bring her?

189
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:53,866
I want to speak to your master.

190
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,003
I see... I'm just a servant...

191
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:59,402
Well, I'm not Maria's maid any longer.

192
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,991
I'm her father's housekeeper.

193
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,575
And his heiress, too, perhaps!

194
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,568
Who knows?

195
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:09,197
If you'll keep his house... well!

196
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,383
Isn't he a darling?!

197
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,222
Poor little fellow!

198
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,561
I respect your feelings, sisters...

199
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:30,314
In fact, I share them!

200
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,918
But this is a girl's school...

201
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:34,016
The child must be disposed of.

202
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:36,350
Well...

203
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,527
I'll speak to Father Xavier in the morning.

204
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,988
He isn't an ordinary foundling...

205
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:42,700
A satin cloak... a purse of gold...

206
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:44,621
A male child cannot be reared

207
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,393
in a school for little girls.

208
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,662
Oh, Sister...

209
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,323
This is St Anthony's feast day, too.

210
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,245
Sister, we implore you!

211
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:53,592
You may rest assured...

212
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,875
Everything was done, that could be done.

213
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,511
Buried in the The Alps!

214
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,975
Maria... my only child!

215
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,838
And the baby was buried, too.

216
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:08,861
Maria, and the infant.

217
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:10,380
Both of them.

218
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,387
You understand?

219
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:16,325
Aye!

220
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,451
It's hard to be the bearer of such news.

221
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:24,252
For a husband, especially.

222
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:26,679
My little girl!

223
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:29,656
Her bonny soul's at peace.

224
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,968
If you'll pardon my mentioning it, at this time...

225
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:43,832
There's just one other matter

226
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,664
while I'm here in Leghorn...

227
00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:48,451
Your lease on this property is about to expire.

228
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,222
If it suits you...

229
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,123
I'd be glad to renew it on the same terms...

230
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,198
...for as many years as you choose.

231
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,885
Thank you, seńor.

232
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:58,863
I shall want to keep it.

233
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:01,742
It's where my daughter grew up.

234
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,519
Au revoir, seńor.

235
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,544
Gone!

236
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,519
No trace of her!

237
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,619
Nothing!

238
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:30,370
Nothing left!

239
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,068
Nothing.

240
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,002
But you're a great merchant!

241
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:38,110
You still have your work, your ships!

242
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:39,851
Aye!

243
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,934
But for whom?

244
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:17,625
Anthony...

245
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:20,838
AN-thony!

246
00:26:40,837 --> 00:26:42,159
Daydreaming?!

247
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,711
Father...

248
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:45,904
Could I go for a walk outside the walls?

249
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:47,963
When school is closed for summer, you may...

250
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,401
But not before.

251
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:50,633
I want to go now!

252
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,080
Oh...do you?!

253
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,490
And how do you think it would look...

254
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:55,100
...to see a great big boy like you...

255
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:57,077
...going in and out of a girls' convent.

256
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:59,162
Mother Marie-José would be very angry.

257
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,318
But she has REAL people to talk to.

258
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,195
I have no one.

259
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:04,641
No one?

260
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:05,713
Only YOU.

261
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,009
Pardon me, Father.

262
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,192
Have you read your lesson?

263
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,672
We shall see!

264
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,865
<i>Quid proxima...</i>

265
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:26,626
<i> quid superiore...</i>

266
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:28,549
<i>nocte egeris...</i>

267
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:33,266
<i>ubi fueris, quos convo-cheris...</i>

268
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,210
<i>"quos conVOCAVEris"!</i>

269
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,941
<i>quid consili ceperis...</i>

270
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,546
<i>quid nostra...</i>

271
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,784
<i>quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris.</i>

272
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,514
<i>Arbitraris?</i>

273
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:50,554
What we did last night...

274
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,123
what you did the night before...

275
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,549
where you were...

276
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,742
whom you called together...

277
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,585
what plans you made.

278
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:03,245
Whom of us do you think

279
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,583
is ignorant of these things?

280
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:08,144
Now continue.

281
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:11,444
<i>O tempora, o mores!</i>

282
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:16,141
"Alas for the times...alas for its..."

283
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,232
It's...?

284
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,557
Mores...morals.

285
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:23,684
An important word, Anthony...

286
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,709
You should never forget it.

287
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:27,213
Why not?

288
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:30,124
Because morals are the foundation

289
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,008
of a man's soul.

290
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,903
With bad morals...

291
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:35,747
..a man is dishonest, ungodly.

292
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,621
And his house soon decays to the ground.

293
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,764
But the man with good morals...

294
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,393
...lives in honour and truth...

295
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:43,037
...and builds for himself

296
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,775
a great and beautiful mansion...

297
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,866
...that lives for all eternity...

298
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,122
...through his children

299
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,951
and his children's children.

300
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:51,240
Someday I'm going to have

301
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,372
a great and beautiful mansion.

302
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:54,446
It'll have towers so high...

303
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,140
...that I can see the whole world.

304
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,321
And it'll have a...

305
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,342
Father Xavier...

306
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,116
Sister Marie-José wishes to see you.

307
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,056
Thank you, sister.

308
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,126
<i>Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris?</i>

309
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:06,607
That's a question!

310
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,298
Be sure you make it one.

311
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:09,937
You'll meet plenty of others.

312
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,652
Sister Ursula...

313
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:14,840
Later, my dear...

314
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,164
Sister Ursula is very busy now.

315
00:30:58,867 --> 00:30:59,699
You can have it!

316
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:02,235
Oh, how sweet...

317
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,131
I couldn't make out what it was.

318
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:05,907
I have pigeons, too.

319
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:07,858
And I. I have a rabbit.

320
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,106
A rabbit?

321
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,863
His name is Oliver Cromwell.

322
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:15,689
You see, we're English.

323
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:16,801
What are you?

324
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:18,770
Is everybody something?

325
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,996
Of course!

326
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,107
What are rabbits?

327
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:25,139
Silly! They don't count!

328
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,020
But they're alive, aren't they?

329
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,728
Certainly... Everybody knows that!

330
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:34,431
I don't. I've never seen one.

331
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,865
I can't keep Anthony much longer, Father.

332
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:39,403
We'll have to place him.

333
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:46,475
Look!

334
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,959
My tall hat.

335
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,891
The scoundrel! Who is the other child?

336
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:51,965
Florence Udney...

337
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,728
The daughter of the British consul at Leghorn.

338
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,193
Father...

339
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,851
We must find him a place immediately.

340
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,514
Why in a few years...

341
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,453
...we'll send him to Rome to study...

342
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,096
Can't we wait until then?

343
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,938
No... this is a girls' school...

344
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,187
I've no place for a boy of 10.

345
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,738
He's such a child!

346
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,009
It's no use arguing Father...

347
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,426
I've made up my mind.

348
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:15,897
I'm sure there's someone to take him...

349
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,441
...right here in Leghorn.

350
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:19,215
A merchant, for instance...

351
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:21,875
There are several in the British colony.

352
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,615
Isn't he rather young to be apprenticed?

353
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:26,920
It's never too young to learn a trade.

354
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:28,599
Particularly for an orphan.

355
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,104
Well... have you any suggestions?

356
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:36,141
Perhaps Martin and Forsyth may take him.

357
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,115
They're very prominent.

358
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:41,274
What about the Casa da Bonnyfeather?

359
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,848
Mr Bonnyfeather is a good churchman.

360
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:46,729
He's been very lonesome since his daughter died.

361
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:48,441
Well, then... let it be...

362
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:49,813
The Casa da Bonnyfeather.

363
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:55,158
Yes...Casa da Bonnyfeather.

364
00:33:07,614 --> 00:33:08,985
Look!

365
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,925
Please tell Mr Bonnyfeather

366
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,043
that Father Xavier has arrived.

367
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:41,554
He's expecting us.

368
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,879
Yes, Father... please go sit down.

369
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:47,665
Dear me!

370
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,443
Here... there you are.

371
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:58,882
Alright, Father.

372
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:00,815
Wait here, Anthony.

373
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,354
Father!

374
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,070
You've brought him?

375
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,575
Bag and all!

376
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:24,428
He comes to you, exactly as he came to us!

377
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:26,520
Including the 10 gold pieces.

378
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,762
10 gold pieces!

379
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:29,812
That's a goodly fortune for a lad his age!

380
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,168
He hasn't any clothes, though.

381
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,882
Cut that, man... we'll soon fix that!

382
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:33,792
Here... give me the receipt.

383
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:35,098
I'll sign it now.

384
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,245
Thank you.

385
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,583
Buried in The Alps...

386
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:23,378
I'm sorry, father.

387
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,734
For a moment,

388
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:27,118
the child reminded me of my daughter.

389
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,748
Bring him into the study.

390
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,351
Anthony... come and meet your benefactor.

391
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,456
How do you do, young man?!

392
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,235
Do you think you'll like it here?

393
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,125
I can't tell yet, Signore.

394
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,867
That's alright!

395
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:07,338
Be frank, and we'll get along fine!

396
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,374
May God bless you for this deed, Mr Bonnyfeather.

397
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:12,175
Thank you Father...

398
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,571
We'll take good care of him...

399
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:15,973
Never fear!

400
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,984
Goodbye, Anthony.

401
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,635
I want to stay with YOU, Father!

402
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,577
This is where you commence your future, Anthony.

403
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:42,217
You must have courage.

404
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:04,599
Come... we'll look for some clothes for you.

405
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,961
Guessippi...

406
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,597
Ah...signora...

407
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,863
Oh, the kitchen's so big!

408
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:19,382
And there's the cook...Signora Guessippi

409
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:24,780
We built the kitchen around her!

410
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:29,917
Signora... this is Master Anthony...

411
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,080
...our new apprentice.

412
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,089
He's in need of clothes... temporarily.

413
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,762
Perhaps you could spare a shirt

414
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:36,937
from one of your children.

415
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,495
It'll be done, Signore.

416
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,608
Who's the little girl?

417
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,087
That's Angela, her daughter.

418
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:43,582
Angela...

419
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,927
Say hello to the little gentleman.

420
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:46,789
Hello!

421
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,003
May I play with Angela, Sr Bonnyfeather?

422
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,283
Young man, you're here to work...

423
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,908
You've lots to learn!

424
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,155
I beg your pardon, sir.

425
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:58,481
Of course you may play with Angela...

426
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:00,048
Whenever you like!

427
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,091
Oh, thank you, sir!

428
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,754
And now, master Anthony, we'll go upstairs...

429
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,605
...and find a room you can sleep in.

430
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:06,725
I'll search for the clothes right away, Signore!

431
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,702
Angela... Angela...

432
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,600
Yes, Mama?

433
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,685
Come on!

434
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:39,465
He's sleeping.

435
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,936
It's Maria's, beyond a doubt.

436
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,013
She might have given it to someone.

437
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,834
She had a child, 10 years ago.

438
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:04,172
The baby didn't live.

439
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:06,001
How do we know?

440
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,349
But Don Luis told us!

441
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,902
After all, he was her husband...

442
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,286
He was there at the time.

443
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:14,513
Don Luis lied.

444
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,923
Of course...

445
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:19,215
If the Marquis de Vincitata...

446
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:22,595
...saw fit to abandon his wife's baby...

447
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:25,773
...there can be only one explanation!

448
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:26,472
Oh, no!

449
00:39:26,522 --> 00:39:28,645
I won't have it thought that he...

450
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:32,856
He's a foundling.

451
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,574
And he'll remain a foundling.

452
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,135
That's all very well to say...

453
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,896
But if he bears YOUR name...

454
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,130
He'll NOT bear it.

455
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:43,653
We'll give him one.

456
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:47,278
No father!

457
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,021
No mother!

458
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:51,949
No name!

459
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:57,357
A child of sorrow and adversity...

460
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,086
Adversity...

461
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:06,672
Yes... by all the saints, he's earned it!

462
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:10,497
We'll call him "Adverse"!

463
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,019
Now...

464
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:16,426
and forever.

465
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:21,592
Anthony Adverse.

466
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:42,480
Angela... good morning!

467
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:47,053
Anthony, get up!  It's late!

468
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:48,387
Are we market today?

469
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,835
If you hurry, it's after 7...

470
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,901
Mr Bonnyfeather's having his breakfast already.

471
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,526
Why didn't you call me?

472
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:55,529
We've been making enough noise

473
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,994
to wake everyone in Leghorn!

474
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:59,084
Angela... Angela!

475
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:01,378
Yes, Mama, I'm coming.

476
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:19,714
Good morning, Faith.

477
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,235
Good morning, sir.

478
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,775
Good morning, my boy.

479
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,415
Any news from Paris?

480
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:31,225
Louis XVI has been put to death, as I expected.

481
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,118
Marie-Antoinette will follow.

482
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,805
Tony... watch what you're doing!

483
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:37,650
You've become fairly impossible.

484
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,772
Well, who wouldn't, with 10 children!

485
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:40,793
Eh, Tony?

486
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:42,782
Si, si Signore!

487
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,571
Excuse please.

488
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,993
7 hens.

489
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:52,073
No... 8.

490
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,976
Fill up the teapot, someone!

491
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,482
Fill it up yourself, you idiot!

492
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:13,946
Woman!

493
00:43:27,453 --> 00:43:29,010
Then she burst out crying...

494
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,032
and threw the dishrag in Poppa's face!

495
00:43:32,491 --> 00:43:34,747
Poor Tony... What's happened to him?

496
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:35,955
It's the big state lottery...

497
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:38,399
He's used up all our savings, buying tickets.

498
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:40,588
You can imagine Mama,

499
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,680
if he doesn't win something.

500
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,518
I've been wasting all my pity

501
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:46,361
on the King of France.

502
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:48,299
Speaking of lottery tickets...

503
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:50,034
Look.

504
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,466
Is it yours?

505
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:54,562
What would you do if you won?

506
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,311
Well, first, I'd marry YOU!

507
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:59,398
Then I'd buy a real villa...

508
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:00,468
...with vineyards...

509
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,031
and a huge fountain in the courtyard.

510
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:03,973
And a goat?

511
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:06,227
The finest goat in Leghorn!

512
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,334
No you wouldn't...

513
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,888
You just say that.

514
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:13,538
Haven't I always said it?

515
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,284
It's different now...

516
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,590
We're not children any longer.

517
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,042
It's all the more reason to believe me.

518
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:23,614
I wish I were a great lady!

519
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:25,391
With beautiful clothes

520
00:44:25,404 --> 00:44:27,134
and a carriage all my own.

521
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,717
Then you'd be proud of me...

522
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,612
...instead of being ashamed of me.

523
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:33,106
I'll never be ashamed of you, Angela.

524
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,042
Never in a thousand years!

525
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:39,214
You will... some day.

526
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,157
Look at me!

527
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:48,534
You mustn't.... not on a road like this!

528
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,507
Let's sing!

529
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:55,968
<i>Oh the spring will not be there forever...</i>

530
00:44:56,018 --> 00:45:01,580
<i>And this day will return to us never...</i>

531
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:07,466
<i>All the promises made...</i>

532
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:09,771
<i>You have all mislaid...</i>

533
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:16,284
<i>I will wait here for you, oh my love.</i>

534
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:24,093
<i>I'll wait for you my love.</i>

535
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:31,668
Attention, please!

536
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:39,544
An American brig is docking...

537
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:40,863
with merchandise from London.

538
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,500
You'll report to McNab at once...

539
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,095
He's over thee now, with the invoices.

540
00:45:45,663 --> 00:45:46,810
Anthony!

541
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:53,053
You've become quite a man!

542
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,565
I might even say, a handsome young man!

543
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:00,352
Handsome enough to turn the heads

544
00:46:00,402 --> 00:46:02,150
of the finest young ladies in Leghorn.

545
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:05,004
Tell me...

546
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,839
Why don't you linger longer with younger people?

547
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:10,230
I have work to do!

548
00:46:10,255 --> 00:46:11,697
You've plenty of time to spend

549
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,245
with the cook's daughter.

550
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:14,714
Oh, not that I object!

551
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:17,420
She's a charming girl, but...

552
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,686
But you've got to take your proper place

553
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,273
in the world.

554
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:23,644
What IS my proper place?

555
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:25,793
Does anyone know?

556
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,524
You're...

557
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,469
You're a man, Anthony...

558
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:34,097
You'll make your own place.

559
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:36,855
Just run over to the quay...

560
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:39,235
...and welcome Capt. Jorham for me, will you?

561
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:41,180
I'm told he's a diminutive old fellow...

562
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:42,740
But he's proud!

563
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:43,955
As all the Yankees are...

564
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:45,593
You'll need tact!

565
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:47,015
You can depend on me, sir.

566
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,184
I hope so.

567
00:46:49,363 --> 00:46:50,688
I should like to find someone...

568
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:53,714
...with whom I could share my responsibilities.

569
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:57,125
Sometimes, the great house of Bonnyfeather...

570
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,015
becomes too heavy a burden

571
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:01,029
for one man's shoulders.

572
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:03,440
My shoulders are broad, sir!

573
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,571
They belong to you...

574
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:07,818
...to use as you see fit.

575
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:13,232
Run along.... and don't forget...

576
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,503
Be sure to invite Capt. Jorham to dinner.

577
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:17,016
Yes, sir!

578
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:31,556
What was that crowd, out in the square?

579
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:32,491
When?

580
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:33,815
They're picking the winning numbers

581
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:35,475
in the lottery tonight.

582
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,254
Gambling! Did you hear that?!

583
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:39,630
These foreigners 'd corrupt the devil himself!

584
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:41,466
Thar she spouts!

585
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:44,270
Pipe down, Mrs Jorham!

586
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,965
Elisha, you're drunk!

587
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:48,204
Belay your sheets, woman!

588
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:52,309
So would ye be, if you'd had as much as me!

589
00:48:09,737 --> 00:48:11,350
Listen!

590
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,855
They've finished... They're celebrating.

591
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:25,279
It's Tony Guessippi!

592
00:48:25,304 --> 00:48:26,935
He's won the lottery!

593
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:29,173
It's Papa!

594
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:09,804
Wait... what's this?!

595
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,330
Yes... look at me!

596
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:15,729
It is me... Tony Guessippi!

597
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:18,329
I have won the lottery!

598
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:22,421
Insult me now, if you dare!

599
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,982
Shut up, you fool!

600
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:27,059
Wait!

601
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:28,696
How much money did he win?

602
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:30,245
40,000 scudi...

603
00:49:30,248 --> 00:49:32,016
But it will not last him long!

604
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:33,712
He has ordered 12 carriages!

605
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,049
One for each member of the family!

606
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,178
One moment, please!

607
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:47,021
Tony, where are you going?

608
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:50,698
Far away... to the home of my ancestors...

609
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:53,290
And I am not coming back!

610
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:01,106
Wait!

611
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:04,569
Very well... Go!

612
00:50:04,594 --> 00:50:08,041
Take your family... Get out!

613
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:10,859
And never let me see you again!

614
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:18,717
Angela... you mustn't go!

615
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:20,662
You don't know Papa when he's like this...

616
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,404
I must take care of the little ones.

617
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,155
I'll go with you.

618
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:24,501
No... that would make things worse.

619
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:27,082
Anthony, if you love me, find me later...

620
00:50:27,132 --> 00:50:29,048
But don't come now!

621
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,149
Stop it!

622
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:08,055
Angela, you can't go... you mustn't go!

623
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:09,311
Anthony, I must!

624
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:12,930
Let me go!

625
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:31,075
I give up!

626
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:35,921
Your name is Adverse, isn't it?

627
00:51:35,946 --> 00:51:37,487
Why did you grab me?

628
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:38,924
Don't worry... I won't again!

629
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:43,764
I'm Vincent Nolte, in case you're interested.

630
00:51:43,814 --> 00:51:45,269
My father's a banker...

631
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:47,633
He does a lot of business with Mr Bonnyfeather.

632
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:48,647
She's gone!

633
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:50,839
Forget it... She'll come back.

634
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:52,957
You couldn't catch her now, anyway.

635
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:54,730
Oh, good evening Mr Bonnyfeather.

636
00:51:55,133 --> 00:51:56,987
I was just saying, my father's a friend of yours.

637
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,894
Herr Nolte... the banker.

638
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:01,868
Why, upon my soul... How big you've grown!

639
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:03,802
Scarcely recognised you!

640
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:06,280
Mr Adverse ought to get around more.

641
00:52:06,305 --> 00:52:08,098
I can't understand why we've never met.

642
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:09,614
Anthony, why don't you and young Nolte

643
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:11,126
spend the evening together.

644
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:14,145
Thank you sir, but I'm not a man of leisure...

645
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,752
I've work to do.

646
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,912
I think you've worked too hard lately...

647
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:20,162
It's time you relaxed and had a little pleasure.

648
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:22,527
Later.

649
00:52:22,577 --> 00:52:25,000
He's right, you know... What do you say?

650
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,541
Well... good night gentlemen!

651
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:30,034
Have a good time!

652
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:33,066
No thanks... I don't think I'll...

653
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,577
Oh, come on!

654
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:22,208
Does this mean you're closing down for good sir?

655
00:53:22,258 --> 00:53:24,305
Yes... I'm afraid so.

656
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:26,960
Tell the men they're to have a month's salary...

657
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,438
...and their freedom.

658
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:30,043
And you might add...

659
00:53:30,093 --> 00:53:31,907
I'm revising my will today.

660
00:53:33,702 --> 00:53:35,496
Each one of you will be remembered.

661
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,470
Thank you, sir!

662
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:51,892
The remainder of my estate...

663
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:55,064
...I bequeath to my apprentice...

664
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:57,488
...Anthony Adverse....

665
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:01,894
...provided he is still living at the time

666
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:04,171
this will is executed.

667
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:06,984
If he is not living, at such a time...

668
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:10,000
...I desire that the residue of my estate...

669
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:13,498
...shall be divided equally...

670
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:16,853
...between the aforesaid Faith Peliolegus...

671
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:20,916
...and the Convent of the Holy Child.

672
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,339
That's all you hear...

673
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:38,140
Business is at a standstill.

674
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,768
We're shutting down completely at the bank.

675
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:40,951
So are we.

676
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:43,364
And Bonaparte calls himself a liberator!

677
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:44,591
He has to enslave people first...

678
00:54:44,592 --> 00:54:45,527
...before he can liberate them!

679
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:47,105
That's the way with conquerors.

680
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:48,805
- What can we do?   - Fight him!

681
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:50,564
We'll fight him!

682
00:54:50,564 --> 00:54:51,245
It's no use, Tommy...

683
00:54:51,245 --> 00:54:52,685
He's in Florence already.

684
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:53,947
In a few days, he'll be here...

685
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:56,207
...and not a soul will lay a hand to stop him.

686
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:57,454
Instead, he'll be hailed...

687
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:58,808
Let's forget about Bonaparte...

688
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:00,492
Think of something else.

689
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,289
How about going to the opera tonight?

690
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:04,117
There's a new company from Milan.

691
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,267
Music before the battle, eh?!

692
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:07,939
It may be the last we hear, for a long time.

693
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:09,617
You're right... I'd like to go!

694
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,367
Come along... let's buy the tickets.

695
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:52,908
Look, Vincent... There's Angela!

696
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,238
- Angela!  - Where?

697
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:57,314
The shepherdess, there in the middle.

698
00:56:24,529 --> 00:56:25,555
I'm going down to see her!

699
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,792
No, wait until the act is over...

700
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:28,522
You won't be able to see her till then,

701
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:29,899
in any case.

702
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,056
Good night!

703
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:46,779
Signora Bovino.

704
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:47,883
Si, signorina.

705
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:09,620
Signorina Guessippi.

706
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,876
Si Signore... is she expecting you?

707
00:57:13,955 --> 00:57:15,232
I'm an old friend.

708
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:17,311
Come in!

709
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:28,315
Who is it?

710
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,891
A gentlemen here to see you.

711
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,048
Gentleman? What gentlemen?

712
00:57:32,054 --> 00:57:35,723
Adolfo, Maria, Nicolo, Pietrica, Vittoria...

713
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:37,322
Anthony!

714
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:42,925
Let me see you... It's been so long!

715
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,076
That's right... So hard to find you!

716
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,154
I've searched everywhere!

717
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:49,381
Oh, Angela mia!

718
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:58,326
Signora... and ovation... magnificent!

719
00:57:58,351 --> 00:57:59,416
Just as you predicted!

720
00:57:59,429 --> 00:58:00,451
Oh, I'm glad.

721
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:02,204
Debrulle, they shouted... Debrulle!

722
00:58:02,254 --> 00:58:03,887
As though I were the whole troupe!

723
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:05,995
The stars never lie...

724
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,216
From now on your troupe will prosper!

725
00:58:08,229 --> 00:58:10,904
Bless you! Come... give us some wine!

726
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,460
- We must celebrate!   - No, not now.

727
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:13,106
Why not?!

728
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,531
She doesn't need wine... She's happy!

729
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:16,998
Let her be.

730
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:19,785
She's asleep?

731
00:58:23,987 --> 00:58:25,874
Aren't you proud of me?

732
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:27,458
I adore you!

733
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:30,017
I mean... the singing.

734
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:31,611
I adore your singing, too!

735
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,169
Oh... silly!

736
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,980
You couldn't possibly hear me

737
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:36,378
with all those other girls pitching

738
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,636
at the top of their lungs!

739
00:58:37,637 --> 00:58:38,752
Oh you're different!

740
00:58:38,802 --> 00:58:40,191
You stood right out!

741
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:44,704
I'm awkward perhaps... Or do I sing off-pitch?

742
00:58:45,928 --> 00:58:47,798
You've learned how to get compliments!

743
00:58:47,823 --> 00:58:49,000
Not compliments, Anthony...

744
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:50,058
I want the truth.

745
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:51,592
Signore Debrulle...

746
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:56,901
He's been very kind to me.

747
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,667
He's a nice man... full of encouragement.

748
00:59:01,183 --> 00:59:03,644
But unless I can be a great singer...

749
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:07,317
...I'd rather not go on.

750
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,624
Even if you could, I wouldn't let you.

751
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:12,236
But I must earn my living somehow!

752
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,841
Have you forgotten already?

753
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,543
Forgotten?

754
00:59:19,227 --> 00:59:21,305
The finest goat in Leghorn!

755
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:31,673
Do you still love me, Angela?

756
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,375
Of course!

757
00:59:33,388 --> 00:59:35,433
What is it?!

758
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,733
Your career?

759
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:40,860
Yes... that is...

760
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,028
Oh, Anthony, don't you understand?

761
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:46,173
It's Bonnyfeather.

762
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:47,705
He's never give his consent!

763
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,591
Oh, I can make him understand!

764
00:59:50,597 --> 00:59:53,254
- I know I can!   - And if you can't?

765
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,665
Angela, these 2 years have changed me...

766
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:57,447
I've worked...

767
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:59,002
I've earned a real place for myself

768
00:59:59,002 --> 01:00:00,653
in the house of Bonnyfeather.

769
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:02,385
I repaid, in a way...

770
01:00:02,385 --> 01:00:04,483
a part of the kindness he's shown me.

771
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:06,542
Then, if he needs you, he'll never let you go.

772
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,260
The House of Bonnyfeather's closed its doors.

773
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,154
Once again, I'm Anthony Adverse, orphan.

774
01:00:11,154 --> 01:00:12,037
I have nothing...

775
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:14,100
I mean no inheritance... no tradition.

776
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,954
But I have my self!

777
01:00:16,954 --> 01:00:18,603
And the name that was invented for me.

778
01:00:18,603 --> 01:00:20,664
With you, Angela...

779
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:22,935
I could make that name stand for something.

780
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:25,207
For a new generation...

781
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:27,391
A great new family tradition.

782
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,015
Are you willing to give up your career...

783
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,559
...and your name?

784
01:00:34,572 --> 01:00:36,036
For a man who hasn't even a real name

785
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:38,053
of his own to give you?

786
01:00:38,103 --> 01:00:40,182
Oh, Anthony, I love you!

787
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,783
Does he know you're leaving?

788
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,098
No.

789
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:57,419
Don't tell him then.

790
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:58,882
Just go.

791
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:00,284
Why?

792
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:02,512
Because he's so selfish!

793
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:04,524
He'll want to keep you.

794
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:07,836
Not when he knows Angela and I are married.

795
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:09,137
Anthony... take my advice.

796
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,893
Bonnyfeather's through!

797
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:13,233
From now on this house will be a mausoleum...

798
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,108
A place to rot in!

799
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:16,764
So will Leghorn, so will Europe, for that matter!

800
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:19,706
If I were you, I'd go as far away as possible.

801
01:01:20,795 --> 01:01:22,160
Come in.

802
01:01:23,337 --> 01:01:25,335
Mr Bonnyfeather would like to see you.

803
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:40,264
Put this in, too.

804
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:44,731
When are you meeting her?

805
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:46,506
At noon.

806
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:49,558
Outside the convent.

807
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:56,023
Goodbye, Maria.

808
01:01:57,809 --> 01:01:59,477
And good riddance!

809
01:02:01,332 --> 01:02:03,465
Come in, Anthony.

810
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,303
Sit down.

811
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,689
I want to talk to you.

812
01:02:18,187 --> 01:02:19,810
Anthony...

813
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:24,482
How would you like to go to Havana?

814
01:02:25,978 --> 01:02:27,672
Go to Havana?!

815
01:02:27,722 --> 01:02:30,181
It's for you to decide, of course.

816
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:33,059
But first let me do a little explaining.

817
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:34,795
Now as you know...

818
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:38,315
I'm being forced into retirement...

819
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:40,760
...by circumstances over which I have no control.

820
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,907
And even if conditions should change...

821
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:45,866
...I feel I'm too old...

822
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:47,839
...ever to become active again.

823
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:50,825
The wealth that I have accumulated, therefore...

824
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,978
...is of the utmost importance to me.

825
01:02:52,991 --> 01:02:54,502
But unfortunately...

826
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,945
that wealth is in the form of credit.

827
01:02:56,948 --> 01:02:58,016
Money that is owing to us

828
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,113
in all parts of the world.

829
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:02,141
Now, among our debtors...

830
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:05,212
...is a firm known as Gallego and Son...

831
01:03:05,262 --> 01:03:07,420
...which has its headquarters in Havana.

832
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:10,673
Now, their debt is a very large one.

833
01:03:10,698 --> 01:03:14,891
It amounts to 75% of my entire estate.

834
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:18,125
And so far, I've been unable to collect it.

835
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,311
They refuse to pay it?

836
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:24,074
Precisely.

837
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:25,814
And with Europe in the throes of war...

838
01:03:25,864 --> 01:03:29,188
...there's no possible way to force them...

839
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,742
...other than to send someone there.

840
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:38,074
Haven't we an agent in Havana?

841
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:40,337
We have... but he's failed repeatedly.

842
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,358
Gallego and Son are slippery customers.

843
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:44,271
One has to resort to all manner of tricks.

844
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:46,354
Unless I'm mistaken...

845
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:49,129
It will require months of constant effort.

846
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:52,743
The employment of tact, influence...

847
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:57,223
...and above all, determination.

848
01:03:59,395 --> 01:04:00,676
Now, the reason I want YOU

849
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:01,773
to undertake this mission...

850
01:04:01,823 --> 01:04:04,548
...is because you're nearer to me

851
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,707
than anyone I know.

852
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:09,895
It's the sort of thing

853
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:11,711
a man would entrust to a son...

854
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:15,812
...if he had a son.

855
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:30,955
This is...

856
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:37,197
...the first real service you ever asked of me.

857
01:04:42,565 --> 01:04:44,553
When would you want me to go?

858
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:46,516
I've arranged with Capt. Jorham...

859
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,884
You can sail tomorrow.

860
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:51,475
As soon as that?!

861
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,341
Aye!

862
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:54,019
The French fleet's on its way to Gibraltar

863
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:56,171
to effect a blockade.

864
01:04:56,496 --> 01:05:00,049
In that case, won't I have trouble getting back?

865
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:03,930
It might take a year... possibly 2!

866
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:09,937
Would you be so good as to tell Capt. Jorham...

867
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:13,024
...to make accommodation for 2.

868
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:14,316
Why?

869
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:18,551
I should like my wife to accompany me.

870
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:21,731
Your wife!

871
01:05:21,781 --> 01:05:23,151
Yes.

872
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:27,576
I was married to Angela Guessippi...

873
01:05:27,626 --> 01:05:29,471
...this morning.

874
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:52,660
What time is it now?

875
01:05:52,685 --> 01:05:54,562
1 o'clock.

876
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:57,670
Well, I can't wait any longer...

877
01:05:57,677 --> 01:05:59,413
...will you please fasten this note

878
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,203
to the bell-pull, over there.

879
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,304
Alright... drive on!

880
01:07:20,142 --> 01:07:23,737
You'll be sure to locate Angela... and tell her.

881
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:25,683
Aye... that I will...

882
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:28,242
And remember my boy, whatever happens...

883
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:31,152
...your home is here.

884
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:33,377
Some day, God willing...

885
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:35,829
...the doors of Casa Bonnyfeather will open again...

886
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:40,403
...for you... if not for me.

887
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:43,491
Thank you sir.

888
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:46,042
I shan't forget.

889
01:08:09,581 --> 01:08:12,876
And how is our thrifty merchant getting along?...

890
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:15,043
...The Honourable John Bonnyfeather.

891
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:17,911
That old fool?!

892
01:08:17,936 --> 01:08:21,377
The bigger fool... the better for you!

893
01:08:21,427 --> 01:08:23,160
Your inheritance.

894
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:28,810
You flatter me... Your Excellency!

895
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:32,046
Why do you always call me 'Your Excellency'?

896
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:35,485
Well, perhaps if i saw you oftener

897
01:08:35,497 --> 01:08:37,344
than once every 2 or  years

898
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:40,244
when you happen to be passing through Leghorn...

899
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:41,341
If you think it's on my way...

900
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,704
...you're mistaken.

901
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:44,975
When I left Madrid I had orders from the king...

902
01:08:45,025 --> 01:08:46,964
...to proceed direct to Paris.

903
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,025
So, you see?!

904
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,280
Then take me with you, please!

905
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:55,381
You promised!

906
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:58,441
My dear...

907
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:01,192
...an attractive woman doesn't go to Paris...

908
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:05,075
...she lets Paris come to HER!

909
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:08,479
Meaning YOU, I suppose?!

910
01:09:13,027 --> 01:09:15,043
You are so wise!

911
01:09:15,093 --> 01:09:17,322
So clever!

912
01:09:18,794 --> 01:09:21,935
But I know something that would kill you...

913
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,363
...if you knew!

914
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:29,412
And when will I have the pleasure of knowing?

915
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:33,508
When Paris no longer comes to Faith.

916
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,302
Well, goodbye Capt. Jorham...

917
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:05,452
It was a splendid voyage and I enjoyed it.

918
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:07,202
Pretty smart navigating, too...

919
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:09,005
The last time I hit Cuba...

920
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:11,712
...I was aiming for Charleston, South Carolina!

921
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,612
Welcome!

922
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:19,082
Welcome for the good Capt. Jorham!

923
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:22,665
And this, I'm certain, must be Seńor Adverse!

924
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:25,420
Delighted to meet you!

925
01:10:25,426 --> 01:10:27,654
I'm Carlo Cibo.

926
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,696
Mr Bonnyfeather's representative.

927
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:32,599
And how's the enchanting Mrs Jorham?

928
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,483
She's waiting for me on board.

929
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:37,487
- Well, God bless you.  - Thank you sir.

930
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:40,136
Now, Mr Bonnyfeather...

931
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:42,904
Oh, yes, his letter about you arrived last week.

932
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:44,910
Unfortunate. Quite futile!

933
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,818
You might have saved yourself a journey.

934
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,971
Oh... you shall see!

935
01:10:50,275 --> 01:10:51,840
My servant... devoted to me...

936
01:10:51,865 --> 01:10:53,344
He'll bring your luggage to my house.

937
01:10:53,357 --> 01:10:56,078
- But what...?    -We still have plenty of time!

938
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:58,166
Bring Seńor Adverse's luggage to my home.

939
01:10:59,262 --> 01:11:00,777
Don't sleep on your way...

940
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,177
...or you'll get a beating!

941
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,264
My house is yours.

942
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,907
We shall drink to the past...

943
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,085
...forget the future...

944
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:08,936
...and pleasantly live the present.

945
01:11:08,937 --> 01:11:10,695
I have a million questions about Europe...

946
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:11,819
...to ask you.   - Yes, but time is...

947
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,026
Please...time is unlimited in Havana.

948
01:11:15,026 --> 01:11:16,519
I'm a gentleman of leisure...

949
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:17,867
With a house full of servants...

950
01:11:17,867 --> 01:11:19,732
...and charming disposition.

951
01:11:19,782 --> 01:11:21,508
And an overwhelming power of persuasion.

952
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:26,264
You'll be glad I persuaded you, my friend!

953
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:28,587
But wait till you see Havana!

954
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,987
Seńor, let me make myself clear...

955
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:36,931
I've come to Cuba for one reason...

956
01:11:36,943 --> 01:11:38,215
...and one only...

957
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:40,336
...to collect the just debt to Mr Bonnyfeather.

958
01:11:40,616 --> 01:11:42,166
And to return to my home and my wife,

959
01:11:42,191 --> 01:11:43,884
as speedily as possible.

960
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:46,588
An admirable ambition, but quite futile.

961
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:50,104
- Why?   - Because Gallego has quit! Gone away...

962
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:52,055
There's nothing left of the firm

963
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:54,135
but an old trading post in Africa.

964
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:57,078
Well, I shall have to go there.

965
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,182
Take it over, if need be.

966
01:11:59,195 --> 01:12:00,298
You can probably have it...

967
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:01,843
But who wants it?!

968
01:12:01,893 --> 01:12:03,768
It's only good for slave trading.

969
01:12:05,115 --> 01:12:06,506
Slave trading?!

970
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,106
Sure!... Gallego and Son were slave traders.

971
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:10,727
Didn't you know that?

972
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:16,762
My friend... the strongest men break

973
01:12:16,787 --> 01:12:19,030
when they try to battle with fate.

974
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,440
Now, let me see...

975
01:12:21,964 --> 01:12:24,588
You need a bit of tailoring, the first thing...

976
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:25,984
And then...

977
01:12:27,296 --> 01:12:29,268
Tony... did you hear me?

978
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:34,004
Anthony!

979
01:12:35,908 --> 01:12:37,729
I said you need completely new

980
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,308
and different clothes.

981
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:40,751
I shall arrange with my tailors to...

982
01:12:41,753 --> 01:12:43,210
You remind me of Mr Bonnyfeather...

983
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:44,560
The first time I met him...

984
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:46,335
He thought I needed clothes too!

985
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:47,316
And did you?

986
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:49,963
As I recall, I was stark naked!

987
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:57,649
My boy... you haven't stopped to figure out yet

988
01:12:57,674 --> 01:13:00,397
that life is just a series of sensations.

989
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,696
Some to be desired...

990
01:13:01,746 --> 01:13:04,491
...others to be avoided. That's all that matters!

991
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:06,076
For instance...

992
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:07,451
...at this moment you and I

993
01:13:07,464 --> 01:13:09,012
are riding comfortably in a carriage...

994
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:10,235
enjoying ourselves...

995
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:11,695
...while over there in that courtyard...

996
01:13:11,697 --> 01:13:13,639
...a poor devil who is doubtless

997
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,490
a much better Christian than we are...

998
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,630
...is being beaten to death.

999
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:19,856
Hey... stop!

1000
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:28,977
Enough! Stop it!

1001
01:13:29,002 --> 01:13:30,798
I'll start with you!

1002
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,229
Wait! Tony...

1003
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:33,791
To interfere with a master and slave

1004
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:34,959
is punishable by death!

1005
01:13:38,261 --> 01:13:39,268
Come back to the carriage!

1006
01:13:39,459 --> 01:13:40,237
Stop it!

1007
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:41,254
Back to the carriage!

1008
01:13:41,304 --> 01:13:42,701
Listen!

1009
01:13:44,023 --> 01:13:45,396
Bring the monk!

1010
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:51,786
I know you, Carlo Cibo!

1011
01:13:51,836 --> 01:13:53,226
I know you!

1012
01:14:16,026 --> 01:14:18,301
You've seen what happens to slaves...

1013
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:21,253
You've seen how a wicked system...

1014
01:14:21,278 --> 01:14:24,334
...has given one man the right of life and death...

1015
01:14:24,347 --> 01:14:25,495
...over his fellow men.

1016
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:29,561
You've seen a man beaten, tortured, killed...

1017
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:32,068
...because he was unfortunate enough

1018
01:14:32,118 --> 01:14:34,018
to have been born poor.

1019
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:35,857
My son...

1020
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,737
You'll meet a lot like her in Africa.

1021
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:50,642
I want to speak to Seńor Cibo!

1022
01:14:58,009 --> 01:15:00,473
We're honoured by a visit from the police.

1023
01:15:00,498 --> 01:15:02,225
Be quiet... both of you!

1024
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:04,105
Tell them to keep on playing.

1025
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:13,089
Seńor, I'm sorry to disturb you...

1026
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:14,918
...but we're looking for a monk.

1027
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:17,735
A monk with Carlo Cibo?!

1028
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:20,115
Upon my soul!

1029
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:22,697
You know me better than that!

1030
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:24,904
- He was seen in your company.  - Impossible!

1031
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:27,308
Nevertheless, I must search your house!

1032
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:31,489
Have you a warrant from the governor?

1033
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:33,680
Not yet, seńor, but nevertheless...

1034
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,081
Nevertheless you have to get one.

1035
01:15:36,358 --> 01:15:37,549
Goodnight!

1036
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:42,789
- Has he gone?   - For the moment.

1037
01:15:42,814 --> 01:15:43,503
- What can we do?

1038
01:15:43,515 --> 01:15:45,675
There's no chance for François, I'm afraid...

1039
01:15:45,682 --> 01:15:47,835
Unless you can smuggle him out of Cuba.

1040
01:15:47,838 --> 01:15:50,048
You've both been very kind to me...

1041
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,838
I thank you...

1042
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,803
...and I'll pray for you.  - Where are you going?

1043
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:55,440
To give myself up.

1044
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,733
There's no need for you to become involved.

1045
01:15:57,733 --> 01:15:59,276
- Come with me.   - Where to?

1046
01:15:59,276 --> 01:16:00,667
- To Africa.  - Anthony, no!

1047
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:02,723
In heaven's name, I implore you not to go...

1048
01:16:02,723 --> 01:16:04,177
You'll destroy yourself...

1049
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:05,517
You'll live in eternal horror...

1050
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:08,011
Unable to sleep... unable to think!

1051
01:16:08,011 --> 01:16:10,716
Followed always by the cries of those

1052
01:16:10,716 --> 01:16:11,982
you've sold into misery.

1053
01:16:11,982 --> 01:16:14,515
You cannot barter in human souls!

1054
01:16:14,565 --> 01:16:15,823
My debt is to Bonnyfeather.

1055
01:16:16,696 --> 01:16:18,214
It's a greater sin, not to repay it.

1056
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,369
I think you're making a terrible mistake, Anthony.

1057
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:22,003
Cuba is flourishing...

1058
01:16:22,009 --> 01:16:23,833
You can go into some business here...

1059
01:16:23,836 --> 01:16:25,808
...and eventually pay off Mr Bonnyfeather.

1060
01:16:25,809 --> 01:16:26,910
It may take longer...

1061
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:27,890
But it mustn't take longer.

1062
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,877
It must be done as quickly as possible.

1063
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,769
I must get back to my wife.

1064
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:36,384
My son... I will go with you to Africa.

1065
01:16:38,018 --> 01:16:40,662
Now you'll have to withstand salvation, Tony...

1066
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:43,547
Morning, noon and night!

1067
01:16:44,936 --> 01:16:47,316
Perhaps I'll need salvation.

1068
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,226
Receipts... 221 slaves at auction...

1069
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:32,394
Ł14,229.25

1070
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:36,015
Total proceeds today... Ł18,404.

1071
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,123
Net profit on last shipment...

1072
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:42,408
Ł12,878.67

1073
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,034
A nice profit.

1074
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:46,122
With luck, today's trading

1075
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:47,982
should settle the Bonnyfeather debt.

1076
01:17:51,753 --> 01:17:52,851
Yes.

1077
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,475
And you'll be free to go back to Europe.

1078
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:07,101
I imagine you'll be glad to get away

1079
01:18:07,151 --> 01:18:09,029
from this infernal noise!

1080
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,993
What do you want, Neleta?

1081
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:36,859
You have not ordered the food

1082
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:39,516
prepared for the feast after the trading.

1083
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:42,192
There's plenty of time.

1084
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:45,518
Please... you won't go away.

1085
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:47,143
Isn't there work for you to do?

1086
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:24,343
Ferdinando... welcome the chiefs for me.

1087
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:25,746
But they expect YOU!

1088
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:27,921
- They will be insulted!  - Do as I say!

1089
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:06,388
Mr Adverse...

1090
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:08,687
You ARE coming back with me, aren't you?

1091
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,956
I'm sure that Mr Bonnyfeather...

1092
01:20:09,962 --> 01:20:11,361
Bonnyfeather! What does HE care?!

1093
01:20:11,364 --> 01:20:13,129
Has he ever once written me?

1094
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,929
3 years in this hole, and not a word!

1095
01:20:14,979 --> 01:20:16,841
- Nothing!   - Well, perhaps...

1096
01:20:33,057 --> 01:20:34,319
The master of Futa Jaloon

1097
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:36,949
must be welcomed by the master of Belagos...

1098
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:37,918
Not a servant.

1099
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:39,213
I give you my greetings...

1100
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,390
And by the blessing of Allah...

1101
01:20:41,415 --> 01:20:42,701
trading will begin this day

1102
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:44,040
at the firing of the gun.

1103
01:21:00,211 --> 01:21:01,617
I'll give Ł6.

1104
01:21:01,642 --> 01:21:03,680
I'll take Ł8.25.

1105
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,323
Ł6.25

1106
01:21:05,329 --> 01:21:07,607
Look! The strength of a horse...

1107
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:09,324
Teeth like pearls!

1108
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:10,392
He is worth 8!

1109
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:11,240
7!

1110
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,241
8!

1111
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:12,929
7!

1112
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:14,858
Ł7.25

1113
01:21:14,908 --> 01:21:16,691
7... and no more.

1114
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:19,857
Done!

1115
01:21:30,703 --> 01:21:31,979
What's wrong here?

1116
01:21:32,004 --> 01:21:33,454
This one thinks he's been cheated.

1117
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:36,619
- Only Ł7! He is worth...  - Quiet!

1118
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,796
If there's any more trouble,

1119
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:39,199
the trading will stop!

1120
01:21:39,795 --> 01:21:40,825
You can go back to your villages

1121
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:41,837
as you came here...

1122
01:21:42,134 --> 01:21:43,006
Penniless!

1123
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:45,659
Take him away!

1124
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,424
Bring another one.

1125
01:21:58,906 --> 01:22:01,775
I see François is still helping the cripples.

1126
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,701
The chiefs hate him.

1127
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:07,150
They call him the White Devil-Doctor.

1128
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,666
Have you no pity?

1129
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:24,823
I told you I wanted no more trouble.

1130
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:27,567
I've said that Brother François

1131
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:28,960
may have the rejected slaves...

1132
01:22:28,973 --> 01:22:30,108
And I say it again!

1133
01:22:30,114 --> 01:22:32,076
He protects runaway slaves!

1134
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:34,215
He only protects those slaves that you's kill...

1135
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:35,392
because they've been rejected.

1136
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:40,190
Take your cripple away from here!

1137
01:22:43,368 --> 01:22:45,150
Go on with the trading!

1138
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,186
Bring another one!

1139
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:52,427
Brother François!

1140
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:56,362
There is one other you might save.

1141
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:58,039
Who?

1142
01:22:58,089 --> 01:23:00,600
Mr Adverse... Today settles the debt.

1143
01:23:06,839 --> 01:23:08,387
I told you to go back to your huts!

1144
01:23:08,437 --> 01:23:11,109
The time has come when you said you'd leave.

1145
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:23,882
My son, there can be no justification for sin.

1146
01:23:23,907 --> 01:23:26,185
But what little justification

1147
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:27,378
you thought you had...

1148
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:29,281
no longer exists.

1149
01:23:29,284 --> 01:23:31,186
You must go back.

1150
01:23:31,188 --> 01:23:32,396
To do what?

1151
01:23:32,397 --> 01:23:33,256
You have a wife.

1152
01:23:33,256 --> 01:23:33,959
How do I know?

1153
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:35,013
Have I once heard from her?

1154
01:23:35,063 --> 01:23:36,675
Maybe she's dead.

1155
01:23:37,148 --> 01:23:38,265
In love with someone else.

1156
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,947
Find out.

1157
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,358
If she still loves me,

1158
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:42,939
she can wait a little longer.

1159
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:45,460
There's money here... money and power!

1160
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,036
For the first time in my life

1161
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:48,953
the name Adverse means something.

1162
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:50,272
It's respected and feared.

1163
01:23:50,272 --> 01:23:51,715
By savages!

1164
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,501
You yourself call them brothers.

1165
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:55,578
Yet YOU would make slaves of them!

1166
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:56,368
Well, what am I?

1167
01:23:56,368 --> 01:23:58,356
I'm slaving to pay a debt!

1168
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,713
And a slave to conventions and gratitude.

1169
01:24:00,713 --> 01:24:02,970
Now, I pay a debt to myself.

1170
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,499
I owe myself wealth and power.

1171
01:24:06,443 --> 01:24:07,720
I owe the name that was invented for me

1172
01:24:07,745 --> 01:24:08,785
the right to perpetuate itself.

1173
01:24:08,798 --> 01:24:10,684
It will not live, Anthony...

1174
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,560
It will die of its own evil...

1175
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:15,313
....unless you give it back to honour and truth.

1176
01:24:15,315 --> 01:24:16,554
I won't let it die.

1177
01:24:16,604 --> 01:24:17,692
I'll stay here.

1178
01:24:18,747 --> 01:24:21,088
When I can afford to leave, I will.

1179
01:24:21,113 --> 01:24:22,103
Afford?

1180
01:24:22,116 --> 01:24:25,446
Is it only the rich who can afford to be kind?

1181
01:24:25,452 --> 01:24:26,996
And live without sin?

1182
01:24:27,046 --> 01:24:30,125
I shan't come here to trouble you any more.

1183
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:31,934
If you want to see me,

1184
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,839
you'll have to come to my hut.

1185
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:11,008
The ship's going.

1186
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:13,752
With a big cargo, too.

1187
01:25:15,763 --> 01:25:18,375
The last until the rains are over.

1188
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:23,108
Rains!

1189
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:50,360
Neleta, you've had your wish...

1190
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,630
The boat went away without me.

1191
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,776
I am glad!

1192
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:11,240
Master... Brother François refuses to come here.

1193
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,204
Very well...

1194
01:26:26,869 --> 01:26:29,056
Why do you stare at me?

1195
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,546
Go in the other room! Get out!

1196
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:52,080
Get out of here!

1197
01:26:59,651 --> 01:27:03,257
It's your move, Mr Adverse.

1198
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:42,008
Brother François!

1199
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:52,011
My son, what is it? You have a fever!

1200
01:29:52,061 --> 01:29:54,770
Father Xavier!

1201
01:29:57,356 --> 01:29:59,180
Where have you been?

1202
01:30:00,519 --> 01:30:03,371
Anthony! Come... help me!

1203
01:30:16,717 --> 01:30:22,668
<i>Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris...</i>

1204
01:30:25,769 --> 01:30:28,078
Father Xavier!

1205
01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:33,451
Could I go for a walk outside the walls?

1206
01:30:40,597 --> 01:30:41,994
What do you want?

1207
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,786
I've come to see Anthony.

1208
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:46,450
Get out!... We don't want you here!

1209
01:30:54,713 --> 01:30:56,861
Angela mia!

1210
01:30:58,068 --> 01:31:01,585
He hates you.  He said to go away!

1211
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:04,192
Help me to save him!

1212
01:31:04,205 --> 01:31:06,505
If you don't go away from here...

1213
01:31:06,555 --> 01:31:09,005
I'll take your flock, and ship them to Havana!

1214
01:31:09,853 --> 01:31:12,060
Children, cripples and all!

1215
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,590
Your master wouldn't let you!

1216
01:31:14,729 --> 01:31:16,713
How can he stop me?

1217
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:18,683
He is sick.

1218
01:31:18,733 --> 01:31:22,200
I am master, now!

1219
01:31:28,078 --> 01:31:29,587
Please!

1220
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:32,196
Remember what I said...

1221
01:31:32,246 --> 01:31:34,675
I'll give you until tomorrow to be gone!

1222
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:00,785
Anthony, you must go back to bed!

1223
01:32:00,835 --> 01:32:02,927
No word from Brother François?

1224
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:10,908
You told him I was still down with fever?

1225
01:32:12,096 --> 01:32:15,440
I told him, but he will not come.

1226
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:20,203
Don't worry any more!

1227
01:32:20,228 --> 01:32:23,390
You are better... You are getting well!

1228
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,858
In a few days the sun will shine!

1229
01:32:27,662 --> 01:32:29,567
There will be trading again.

1230
01:32:30,621 --> 01:32:32,662
Anthony will stay here...

1231
01:32:33,077 --> 01:32:36,716
For great power... Grow rich!

1232
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:39,023
Power...

1233
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,251
Money...

1234
01:32:47,009 --> 01:32:49,493
I must see Brother François!

1235
01:33:06,388 --> 01:33:07,914
It's nothing!

1236
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:10,814
How do you know?

1237
01:33:15,737 --> 01:33:17,759
Where is Brother François?!

1238
01:33:17,809 --> 01:33:19,421
- In his hut, I tell you!   - You lie!

1239
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:20,885
He's out in the jungle...

1240
01:33:20,910 --> 01:33:23,026
- They're after him to kill him!   - No!

1241
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:24,723
- Tell me the truth!   - I am telling the truth!

1242
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:25,943
You sent him away, that's what you did!

1243
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,189
You hated him and wanted him to leave Africa...

1244
01:33:30,994 --> 01:33:33,726
You beast... You savage!

1245
01:34:45,574 --> 01:34:47,034
Brother François!

1246
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:53,551
Brother François!

1247
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:57,161
You're dying!

1248
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:02,240
No, Anthony...

1249
01:35:03,298 --> 01:35:08,107
It is you who are dying... Not I.

1250
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,504
Forgive me, I didn't know that...

1251
01:35:09,554 --> 01:35:11,216
They didn't tell me you'd been driven away.

1252
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:14,282
Promise...

1253
01:35:14,307 --> 01:35:19,515
Promise me you'll leave Africa.

1254
01:35:19,565 --> 01:35:20,997
I promise!

1255
01:35:26,248 --> 01:35:27,866
Brother François!

1256
01:36:03,773 --> 01:36:04,983
Where do you go, Signore?

1257
01:36:05,008 --> 01:36:06,544
Casa da Bonnyfeather.

1258
01:36:06,557 --> 01:36:08,528
- On business?  - Why?

1259
01:36:08,534 --> 01:36:10,590
The Casa da Bonnyfeather has been closed

1260
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,676
for the past 5 years,

1261
01:36:13,445 --> 01:36:15,403
I expected it would be.

1262
01:36:15,453 --> 01:36:17,007
Drive along.

1263
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,896
Your Excellency has lived in Leghorn?

1264
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:26,062
Yes... some years ago.

1265
01:36:26,957 --> 01:36:28,996
Do you remember a Vincent Nolte?

1266
01:36:32,447 --> 01:36:35,200
Yes... yes... I remember!

1267
01:36:35,225 --> 01:36:36,526
He's in Paris, now.

1268
01:36:36,539 --> 01:36:38,423
A great banker they say...

1269
01:36:38,429 --> 01:36:40,191
A friend of Napoleon.

1270
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:42,222
He come here every now and then.

1271
01:36:42,272 --> 01:36:43,615
What brings him back?

1272
01:36:44,484 --> 01:36:46,226
Surely it can't be on business.

1273
01:36:46,251 --> 01:36:47,746
He's searching for a friend...

1274
01:36:47,796 --> 01:36:51,068
A young clerk, who went to sea and disappeared.

1275
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:53,220
Disappeared?

1276
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:54,947
Si, Signore, disappeared.

1277
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,812
Too bad!

1278
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:59,056
When the old Bonnyfeather died...

1279
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:01,260
...left him a big fortune.

1280
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,876
Bonnyfeather is dead?!

1281
01:37:03,926 --> 01:37:05,896
Yes... Over a year.

1282
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:13,218
Mr Bonnyfeather's housekeeper?

1283
01:37:14,186 --> 01:37:15,992
Couldn't she locate this young clerk either?

1284
01:37:16,017 --> 01:37:19,080
No... Lucky for her too.

1285
01:37:19,093 --> 01:37:21,687
If this clerk will not come back...

1286
01:37:21,737 --> 01:37:24,093
...she will get all the money!

1287
01:37:25,809 --> 01:37:30,104
Adverse, yes... Anthony Adverse!

1288
01:37:30,129 --> 01:37:31,230
That was his name.

1289
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,394
Ever hear of him?

1290
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,941
There used to be an inn on the Strada Calypso...

1291
01:37:47,966 --> 01:37:50,914
- Si... Signora Bonino's place.   - That's right.

1292
01:37:50,927 --> 01:37:52,418
Drop my luggage there please.

1293
01:37:52,424 --> 01:37:53,750
You trust me, Signore?

1294
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,918
Oh, I think so...

1295
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:58,549
Just say it's for Mr Adverse. Mr Anthony Adverse.

1296
01:37:58,599 --> 01:38:00,149
Can you remember that?

1297
01:38:20,389 --> 01:38:23,793
- You!   - May I come in?

1298
01:38:41,245 --> 01:38:44,089
Did you think I'd died in Africa?

1299
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:46,920
I didn't know what to think...

1300
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:49,388
Your letters...

1301
01:38:49,413 --> 01:38:50,957
You knew where I was,

1302
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:52,575
but you weren't going to tell, were you, Faith?

1303
01:38:52,581 --> 01:38:54,461
Mr Bonnyfeather didn't want it known

1304
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:56,797
that you were engaged in slave-trading.

1305
01:38:59,263 --> 01:39:02,065
Anthony... why do you take this attitude?

1306
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:04,447
We've always been friends.

1307
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,711
On the contrary...

1308
01:39:05,717 --> 01:39:08,808
You've hated me from the first time I came here.

1309
01:39:08,811 --> 01:39:12,018
But why? That's what I want to know!

1310
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,866
And why was Bonnyfeather so fond of me...

1311
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:15,094
...to leave me his money?

1312
01:39:16,061 --> 01:39:18,012
Why... he was in his dotage!

1313
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:20,414
That isn't true.

1314
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:22,775
You know the real reason... Now tell me!

1315
01:39:22,788 --> 01:39:24,092
Tell me!

1316
01:39:24,142 --> 01:39:25,634
Oh... Don Luis!

1317
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:28,584
This is Mr Adverse...

1318
01:39:29,823 --> 01:39:32,258
The heir to Bonnyfeather's estate.

1319
01:39:36,167 --> 01:39:38,318
Congratulations, Signore.

1320
01:39:39,963 --> 01:39:43,111
Your arrival is most opportune.

1321
01:39:44,677 --> 01:39:47,003
Would you join us?

1322
01:39:47,053 --> 01:39:48,951
We have much to talk over.

1323
01:39:59,805 --> 01:40:01,390
It's strange that I never heard

1324
01:40:01,415 --> 01:40:02,449
Mr Bonnyfeather speak of you.

1325
01:40:02,461 --> 01:40:04,456
I might say the same, Signore.

1326
01:40:04,463 --> 01:40:05,445
At one time,

1327
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:07,605
Mr Bonnyfeather and I were very intimate.

1328
01:40:07,607 --> 01:40:09,403
But that was before you were born.

1329
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:11,893
At least, before you were adopted.

1330
01:40:11,943 --> 01:40:12,757
Don Luis...

1331
01:40:13,588 --> 01:40:15,518
Do you know if Mr Bonnyfeather had any...

1332
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:17,181
...unwelcome relatives?

1333
01:40:17,231 --> 01:40:20,493
Anyone, of whom he might have been ashamed?

1334
01:40:21,497 --> 01:40:22,641
What makes you ask?

1335
01:40:22,691 --> 01:40:24,905
I can't help feeling that I'm related to him.

1336
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,176
The first time we met... I remember distinctly...

1337
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:32,684
He was sitting at his desk in the other room...

1338
01:40:32,734 --> 01:40:34,426
..talking to a priest.

1339
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,217
And when he looked in my direction,

1340
01:40:36,242 --> 01:40:37,768
he stopped suddenly...

1341
01:40:37,818 --> 01:40:39,820
...and just stared.

1342
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:42,664
And tears came to his eyes.

1343
01:40:42,689 --> 01:40:46,034
Your parents might have been friends of his.

1344
01:40:46,084 --> 01:40:47,936
Perhaps.

1345
01:40:49,303 --> 01:40:51,262
Yet, why should he make me his heir?

1346
01:40:51,287 --> 01:40:53,333
You have no recollection?

1347
01:40:53,345 --> 01:40:56,697
Only that I was raised by a group of nuns...

1348
01:40:56,747 --> 01:40:58,815
...at the Convent of the Holy Child...

1349
01:41:01,408 --> 01:41:04,046
Anyone who could help prove Mr Adverse's identity

1350
01:41:04,071 --> 01:41:05,601
would be very welcome, I'm sure.

1351
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:08,223
I know how eager he is.

1352
01:41:10,502 --> 01:41:13,730
You...enquired at the convent?

1353
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,856
Records are meagre.

1354
01:41:15,906 --> 01:41:20,247
I was left there on the 17th January, 1773.

1355
01:41:21,591 --> 01:41:23,110
Abandoned?!

1356
01:41:23,135 --> 01:41:25,151
Yes... in a black bag...

1357
01:41:25,164 --> 01:41:28,139
...containing a Madonna and a few gold pieces.

1358
01:41:28,145 --> 01:41:29,437
Rather interesting...

1359
01:41:29,487 --> 01:41:31,571
Don't you think, Don Luis?

1360
01:41:33,055 --> 01:41:35,333
Young man... if I were you,

1361
01:41:35,358 --> 01:41:36,844
I wouldn't seek to know more.

1362
01:41:36,894 --> 01:41:39,554
You've been extraordinarily fortunate, as it is.

1363
01:41:40,273 --> 01:41:41,559
But isn't it only natural...

1364
01:41:41,584 --> 01:41:43,033
Considering the circumstances...

1365
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:45,455
...it might also be dangerous.

1366
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,577
Why?

1367
01:41:48,594 --> 01:41:50,293
For many reasons.

1368
01:41:50,343 --> 01:41:51,699
I advise you to forget it!

1369
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:55,309
You are going to Paris?

1370
01:41:55,334 --> 01:41:57,593
At once... about the will.

1371
01:41:57,606 --> 01:41:59,887
I'll see Mr Nolte.

1372
01:41:59,893 --> 01:42:01,174
I trust you'll have no difficulty

1373
01:42:01,224 --> 01:42:02,925
in establishing your claim?

1374
01:42:04,409 --> 01:42:05,586
Thank you, Seńor.

1375
01:42:09,227 --> 01:42:12,183
I really came here to locate Angels... my wife.

1376
01:42:12,233 --> 01:42:14,742
I don't suppose you know what became of her?

1377
01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:15,987
Angela?!

1378
01:42:16,012 --> 01:42:17,310
Let's see...

1379
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:19,752
The last I heard, she was touring the provinces

1380
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:21,198
with an opera company.

1381
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:22,278
How long ago was that?

1382
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,574
3 years... no, 4 years.

1383
01:42:24,575 --> 01:42:26,296
And Mr Bonnyfeather

1384
01:42:26,346 --> 01:42:28,155
never tried to get in touch with her?

1385
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:30,672
I couldn't say, I'm sure.

1386
01:42:32,669 --> 01:42:34,656
Wouldn't it be more truthful to admit that you

1387
01:42:34,706 --> 01:42:36,522
prevented him from getting in touch with her.

1388
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:39,404
Pray that I'll find her, Faith...

1389
01:42:39,429 --> 01:42:42,073
...and ease your conscience.

1390
01:42:42,086 --> 01:42:43,730
If you have one.

1391
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,895
Goodbye, Don Luis.

1392
01:42:50,782 --> 01:42:52,113
I'm indebted to you.

1393
01:42:53,665 --> 01:42:55,415
For the tea.

1394
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,955
I told you I had a secret.

1395
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,565
I told you, years ago.

1396
01:43:06,577 --> 01:43:08,302
You couldn't prove it.

1397
01:43:08,308 --> 01:43:09,713
Oh, couldn't I?!

1398
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:11,336
There's an old picture of Maria...

1399
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:12,928
...locked away in my drawer.

1400
01:43:12,929 --> 01:43:15,183
The resemblance is still remarkable...

1401
01:43:15,183 --> 01:43:17,386
Even a stranger would know.

1402
01:43:17,386 --> 01:43:19,335
I should have let him die.

1403
01:43:19,335 --> 01:43:22,315
I'd be a rich woman, if you had.

1404
01:43:22,315 --> 01:43:24,013
I'd be in Paris, claiming an estate.

1405
01:43:24,013 --> 01:43:26,500
Keep quiet! You'll have it yet!

1406
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:28,867
No I won't... There's not a chance.

1407
01:43:30,297 --> 01:43:32,552
But I'll have SOMETHING for the life I've lived.

1408
01:43:33,405 --> 01:43:36,190
The disappointment. The years of boredom.

1409
01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:39,471
And you're the one who'll give it to me!

1410
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:42,562
- I?!   - For the price of that picture.

1411
01:43:42,575 --> 01:43:44,852
For the honour of a grandee of Spain

1412
01:43:44,902 --> 01:43:47,373
whose pretty wife had a child...   - Silence!

1413
01:43:48,193 --> 01:43:51,410
Hurts, doesn't it?  Makes you cringe!

1414
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,968
You detestable creature!

1415
01:43:53,972 --> 01:43:55,053
What is it you want?

1416
01:43:55,816 --> 01:43:58,619
Your name... in marriage!

1417
01:44:22,307 --> 01:44:23,986
- Are you sure?  - Yes!

1418
01:44:28,055 --> 01:44:30,201
Sancho... Don't let that coach get past!

1419
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:49,615
What are you stopping for?

1420
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,692
There is a coach ahead...

1421
01:44:50,705 --> 01:44:52,292
Pretty close, I should say...

1422
01:44:52,298 --> 01:44:54,143
...judging from the tracks.

1423
01:44:54,193 --> 01:44:55,877
Never mind... keep going.

1424
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,504
Mr Adverse!

1425
01:45:15,568 --> 01:45:18,231
- Have you any enemies?   - Why?

1426
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:20,366
Take a look at that coach down there...

1427
01:45:20,416 --> 01:45:22,874
See it?... hiding behind the boulder...

1428
01:45:26,328 --> 01:45:28,440
It looks to me as if they were waiting

1429
01:45:28,465 --> 01:45:30,917
to shove someone into the gorge.

1430
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:31,738
Of course, they may not...

1431
01:45:31,788 --> 01:45:34,706
But on the other hand, there is that precipice.

1432
01:45:35,596 --> 01:45:37,121
How are the brakes?

1433
01:45:37,146 --> 01:45:38,666
Hold the coach maybe...

1434
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:40,355
But the horses would drag us.

1435
01:45:40,361 --> 01:45:42,323
Could you hold the coach, without the horses?

1436
01:45:42,326 --> 01:45:43,781
Without the horses?!

1437
01:45:43,831 --> 01:45:45,007
Come down here... I'll show you what I mean.

1438
01:45:48,519 --> 01:45:51,010
If we could get that pin out, quickly enough...

1439
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:41,265
He was the best servant I ever had.

1440
01:46:41,315 --> 01:46:43,524
The coach was rather handy, too!

1441
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:07,117
Let's see your papers!

1442
01:47:08,247 --> 01:47:09,442
Come on... hurry up!

1443
01:47:16,444 --> 01:47:18,170
What's all the excitement around here?

1444
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,815
None of your business!

1445
01:47:20,906 --> 01:47:21,925
Are we far from Paris?

1446
01:47:22,401 --> 01:47:24,439
2 or 3 hours.

1447
01:47:33,131 --> 01:47:34,484
Thank you.

1448
01:47:34,509 --> 01:47:37,585
Major... I have some information for you...

1449
01:47:37,598 --> 01:47:38,630
Yes, your Excellency?

1450
01:47:38,636 --> 01:47:40,144
Some way back, we met an Englishman...

1451
01:47:40,147 --> 01:47:41,856
...who I recognised as a spy...

1452
01:47:41,858 --> 01:47:43,760
He's travelling this way.

1453
01:47:43,761 --> 01:47:44,481
An Englishman?!

1454
01:47:44,482 --> 01:47:45,483
There isn't a doubt of it!

1455
01:47:45,483 --> 01:47:48,149
He's travelling under the name of Anthony Adverse.

1456
01:47:48,149 --> 01:47:50,141
Don't pay any attention to his passport!

1457
01:47:50,141 --> 01:47:51,319
Thank you, your Excellency!

1458
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:53,129
We'll watch out for him!

1459
01:47:53,179 --> 01:47:55,267
- Pleasant journey!   - Thank you, major!

1460
01:48:08,989 --> 01:48:10,687
- What's the trouble?   - No trouble, monsieur...

1461
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,870
If your papers are in order,

1462
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,492
you'll be allowed to continue.

1463
01:48:20,644 --> 01:48:22,822
Anthony Adverse? From Leghorn?

1464
01:48:22,847 --> 01:48:23,912
Yes.

1465
01:48:23,925 --> 01:48:26,132
Are you a native of Leghorn?

1466
01:48:26,182 --> 01:48:27,834
- I was born there.   - Have you any proof?

1467
01:48:28,318 --> 01:48:29,789
My passport.

1468
01:48:29,839 --> 01:48:31,312
Step out, please.

1469
01:48:34,542 --> 01:48:35,812
Is that not sufficient?

1470
01:48:35,837 --> 01:48:37,814
You are perhaps unaware, Mr Adverse...

1471
01:48:37,864 --> 01:48:39,593
...that France and England are still at war.

1472
01:48:40,717 --> 01:48:42,793
I may be English, but I'm an Italian subject.

1473
01:48:42,818 --> 01:48:43,791
And your parents?

1474
01:48:43,841 --> 01:48:45,838
Your father... What was he?!

1475
01:48:47,614 --> 01:48:49,227
Don't you know?!

1476
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,772
Arrest him!

1477
01:48:59,765 --> 01:49:01,287
The general will see you, Herr Nolte...

1478
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,539
that you'll do him the honour

1479
01:49:02,552 --> 01:49:03,430
of remaining for dinner.

1480
01:49:03,437 --> 01:49:04,585
Thank you Mr Bourrienne.

1481
01:49:04,589 --> 01:49:07,072
It won't be much in the way of food, I'm afraid...

1482
01:49:07,122 --> 01:49:09,550
- Just a military mess...   - I'll be delighted.

1483
01:49:15,805 --> 01:49:17,167
What is it Doumet?

1484
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:18,976
I've arrested this fellow on grounds of suspicion.

1485
01:49:19,328 --> 01:49:21,283
Also, for insulting an officer of the French army.

1486
01:49:21,308 --> 01:49:23,576
- An Englishman.  - That's good enough.

1487
01:49:23,589 --> 01:49:25,289
- Anthony!   - Hello, Vincent!

1488
01:49:25,339 --> 01:49:26,759
How did you get here?

1489
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,379
Ask the major.

1490
01:49:28,404 --> 01:49:29,996
Do you know him?

1491
01:49:30,046 --> 01:49:31,079
Certainly I know him...

1492
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:33,616
His name's Anthony Adverse.

1493
01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:34,756
We grew up together in Leghorn.

1494
01:49:38,284 --> 01:49:39,997
I was told the gentleman was a British spy.

1495
01:49:40,022 --> 01:49:41,361
By whom?

1496
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:42,508
A traveller in the poste-chaise...

1497
01:49:42,514 --> 01:49:43,968
A Spanish nobleman.

1498
01:49:44,018 --> 01:49:46,656
A Spanish nobleman travelling in a public coach?

1499
01:49:47,827 --> 01:49:49,327
It does seem strange somehow...

1500
01:49:49,352 --> 01:49:51,653
Strange? It's incredible.

1501
01:49:51,666 --> 01:49:53,672
HE's the man you should have arrested.

1502
01:49:53,722 --> 01:49:55,336
Sorry, sir.

1503
01:49:58,410 --> 01:49:59,657
Release the guard.

1504
01:50:00,691 --> 01:50:02,142
My apologies, Mr Adverse...

1505
01:50:02,192 --> 01:50:04,857
I trust you won't mention this to the General?

1506
01:50:05,882 --> 01:50:08,007
I'm glad to be relieved of the necessity.

1507
01:50:09,091 --> 01:50:10,794
It's extremely regrettable, but unfortunately...

1508
01:50:10,844 --> 01:50:12,228
- De Bourrienne...   - Yes, I'm coming.

1509
01:50:13,154 --> 01:50:13,933
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1510
01:50:42,591 --> 01:50:44,196
Tell me some more of this business.

1511
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:46,240
Well, the main thing is this...

1512
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,541
We advanced a huge sum of money to Bonaparte...

1513
01:50:48,554 --> 01:50:50,152
...with the understanding he would pay us back...

1514
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:51,183
...the moment he could lay his hands

1515
01:50:51,233 --> 01:50:53,244
on a lot of gold that is owing him in Mexico.

1516
01:50:53,801 --> 01:50:54,425
He learned recently

1517
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:56,009
that the gold can't be shipped to France

1518
01:50:56,059 --> 01:50:58,215
without the payment of an exorbitant tax.

1519
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:00,848
So he's refused to authorise its collection.

1520
01:51:00,873 --> 01:51:03,278
Until he does, we don't get our money.

1521
01:51:03,291 --> 01:51:05,410
Meanwhile, his failure to pay

1522
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:07,223
has brought us to the verge of bankruptcy

1523
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:10,147
And you too... personally!

1524
01:51:10,148 --> 01:51:11,461
As well as my clients.

1525
01:51:11,462 --> 01:51:13,128
Oh, it's frightful, Tony.

1526
01:51:13,129 --> 01:51:15,069
Why don't you let me lend you the money

1527
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:16,980
that I've inherited from Mr Bonnyfeather.

1528
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,401
That'll tide you over...

1529
01:51:18,451 --> 01:51:21,466
...at least until this gold affair is settled.

1530
01:51:25,659 --> 01:51:27,726
I wish there was some other means, Ouvrard.

1531
01:51:28,324 --> 01:51:30,373
Frankly... I'd rather lose everything...

1532
01:51:30,398 --> 01:51:31,575
than have Anthony run the risk

1533
01:51:31,588 --> 01:51:32,921
of impoverishing himself.

1534
01:51:32,928 --> 01:51:34,344
There isn't any risk...

1535
01:51:34,347 --> 01:51:37,052
I'm absolutely certain the gold will be delivered.

1536
01:51:37,054 --> 01:51:38,733
I too, monsieur.

1537
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:39,994
I've even got Mademoiselle Georges

1538
01:51:40,044 --> 01:51:42,041
to use her influence with Napoleon.

1539
01:51:42,565 --> 01:51:44,634
Mademoiselle Georges? Who's she?

1540
01:51:44,659 --> 01:51:46,013
A new prima donna...

1541
01:51:46,026 --> 01:51:47,910
Bonaparte's infatuated with her.

1542
01:51:47,916 --> 01:51:49,370
An exquisite creature.

1543
01:51:49,373 --> 01:51:51,074
I'm to have the honour of escorting her

1544
01:51:51,076 --> 01:51:52,545
to the ball tomorrow night.

1545
01:51:52,546 --> 01:51:53,570
You don't say!

1546
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,006
Would you like to go, Tony?

1547
01:51:55,549 --> 01:51:56,829
Perhaps we'd better.

1548
01:51:57,571 --> 01:51:58,719
It's entirely up to you.

1549
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:00,413
Well, gentlemen...

1550
01:52:00,425 --> 01:52:02,304
I guess there's nothing more to discuss...

1551
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:03,680
Is there?

1552
01:52:03,684 --> 01:52:04,628
Au revoir, monsieur...

1553
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:06,897
and thank you for your generosity.

1554
01:52:06,898 --> 01:52:08,723
The money you're placing at our disposal...

1555
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:11,048
...will just about save our skins.

1556
01:52:11,048 --> 01:52:11,922
You're quite welcome.

1557
01:52:11,972 --> 01:52:13,962
- Goodnight Vincent.   - Goodnight.

1558
01:52:19,992 --> 01:52:22,356
Tony... do you realise what you've done?

1559
01:52:24,539 --> 01:52:25,855
Yes.

1560
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,967
You may lose your entire fortune.

1561
01:52:27,979 --> 01:52:29,398
Everything!

1562
01:52:29,448 --> 01:52:30,598
I know.

1563
01:52:31,931 --> 01:52:33,803
Don't you care for money?

1564
01:52:33,828 --> 01:52:35,566
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

1565
01:52:35,616 --> 01:52:36,933
Not very much, Vincent.

1566
01:52:38,857 --> 01:52:40,822
A man died so that I might learn

1567
01:52:40,847 --> 01:52:42,999
there was something besides money and power.

1568
01:52:43,012 --> 01:52:45,048
Tell me, what's happened to you?

1569
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:47,117
If you don't want money and power...

1570
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:49,237
...what DO you want?

1571
01:52:50,018 --> 01:52:51,460
Angela.

1572
01:52:54,371 --> 01:52:55,388
Good heavens, man...

1573
01:52:55,438 --> 01:52:57,145
You're not still looking for HER?

1574
01:52:57,868 --> 01:52:59,013
She's probably...

1575
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:01,610
Probably dead... probably forgotten me...

1576
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:03,229
Probably this, that, or 1000 other things.

1577
01:53:04,454 --> 01:53:06,264
I think about it till I'm ready to go mad.

1578
01:53:07,366 --> 01:53:09,512
Then I assure myself that one thing is possible...

1579
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,668
SOMEWHERE... Angela is waiting for me.

1580
01:53:12,718 --> 01:53:14,557
Be reasonable Anthony...

1581
01:53:15,571 --> 01:53:16,975
Why should she wait for you?

1582
01:53:17,025 --> 01:53:18,326
Because she's my wife.

1583
01:53:19,304 --> 01:53:21,839
Because we pledged ourselves to the future...

1584
01:53:21,889 --> 01:53:23,710
...of the name that was invented for me.

1585
01:53:24,235 --> 01:53:26,502
With her, I can give it roots in the present...

1586
01:53:26,527 --> 01:53:28,510
..and have children to carry it to the future.

1587
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,613
Love, a home, a tradition!

1588
01:53:31,362 --> 01:53:33,797
These are the very essence of a man's soul.

1589
01:53:33,822 --> 01:53:36,553
There are his wealth and his power.

1590
01:53:36,603 --> 01:53:40,552
Without them, he has nothing.

1591
01:54:00,671 --> 01:54:02,696
The general is early tonight.

1592
01:54:02,746 --> 01:54:06,053
Naturally... He's expecting Mademoiselle Georges.

1593
01:54:09,765 --> 01:54:11,088
According to Mr Nolte...

1594
01:54:11,113 --> 01:54:13,456
You had some very exciting adventures in Africa.

1595
01:54:13,506 --> 01:54:15,166
Please tell us about them!

1596
01:54:16,133 --> 01:54:17,259
I assure you I never had one

1597
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,248
quite the equal of this.

1598
01:54:24,987 --> 01:54:27,066
Your friend's quite intriguing!

1599
01:54:27,116 --> 01:54:29,408
And I think very handsome.

1600
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:32,988
Wait until you see him without his mask!

1601
01:54:33,038 --> 01:54:34,981
I can hardly wait till we unmask at midnight.

1602
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,989
Mlle Georges has just arrived.

1603
01:54:50,844 --> 01:54:53,233
- Mademoiselle... your mask.  - Thank you.

1604
01:55:00,043 --> 01:55:01,894
Mademoiselle... May I have the honour?

1605
01:55:01,919 --> 01:55:02,841
Pleasure, monsieur.

1606
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,059
This is once, Ouvrard...

1607
01:55:04,065 --> 01:55:05,104
...that I am willing to acknowledge

1608
01:55:05,154 --> 01:55:06,495
my indebtedness to a banker.

1609
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:41,917
I've been told that Napoleon is a bad dancer.

1610
01:55:41,967 --> 01:55:44,271
You were told right, Mr Adverse... watch!

1611
01:56:20,893 --> 01:56:22,332
A friend of yours?

1612
01:56:22,614 --> 01:56:23,871
No!

1613
01:56:25,296 --> 01:56:26,759
I thought...

1614
01:56:28,232 --> 01:56:29,748
Mr Ouvrard must be hiding...

1615
01:56:29,773 --> 01:56:31,451
I can't see him anywhere.

1616
01:56:31,501 --> 01:56:33,537
- Allow me...   - No, please!

1617
01:56:57,799 --> 01:57:00,962
Can't seem to place him... Show him in.

1618
01:57:07,738 --> 01:57:09,121
I hope you'll pardon me...

1619
01:57:09,146 --> 01:57:10,589
The nature of my visit...

1620
01:57:10,602 --> 01:57:12,455
Debrulle! Why of course I remember!

1621
01:57:12,461 --> 01:57:14,286
It's been a long time since Leghorn.

1622
01:57:14,336 --> 01:57:16,196
Nevertheless, I should've remembered the name.

1623
01:57:17,275 --> 01:57:18,263
Where is Angela?

1624
01:57:18,288 --> 01:57:19,741
Surely you must know!

1625
01:57:19,754 --> 01:57:21,344
I do... that's why I'm here!

1626
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:23,673
Oh my friend... My friend!

1627
01:57:23,676 --> 01:57:25,718
Tell me, Debrulle, is she still with the troupe?

1628
01:57:25,719 --> 01:57:26,782
No... no more.

1629
01:57:26,783 --> 01:57:27,790
Has she given up her singing?

1630
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,662
Well... not entirely!

1631
01:57:29,662 --> 01:57:31,976
She still sings a little.

1632
01:57:31,976 --> 01:57:33,135
Where is she now?

1633
01:57:33,135 --> 01:57:34,636
She's taken a cottage out near Passy.

1634
01:57:34,636 --> 01:57:36,785
Passy? Then I can see her at once!

1635
01:57:36,785 --> 01:57:37,559
Why not!

1636
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:39,186
Bless you! Come on... hurry!

1637
01:57:49,957 --> 01:57:52,068
Why does she live in such an out-of-the-way place?

1638
01:57:52,118 --> 01:57:54,689
Well, perhaps because she prefers it.

1639
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:58,664
Go... Go, she's waiting for you!

1640
01:57:59,558 --> 01:58:01,466
Anthony!

1641
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:16,113
Don't talk!

1642
01:58:17,232 --> 01:58:20,127
Just let me hold you close to me!

1643
01:58:24,735 --> 01:58:28,778
You've changed, but your eyes are still the same.

1644
01:58:29,683 --> 01:58:31,348
Oh darling, what happened?

1645
01:58:31,373 --> 01:58:32,947
What EVER happened?!

1646
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,084
Bonnyfeather promised to tell you...

1647
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:34,730
He didn't!

1648
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:35,742
I went there once...

1649
01:58:35,744 --> 01:58:36,729
...but he sent word by Faith

1650
01:58:36,729 --> 01:58:38,043
that you didn't wish to see me.

1651
01:58:38,043 --> 01:58:40,282
- Faith lied!  - Is it true you went to Africa?

1652
01:58:40,282 --> 01:58:41,458
Faith would have told you that...

1653
01:58:41,458 --> 01:58:42,558
She knew that I was planning...

1654
01:58:42,558 --> 01:58:44,324
Let's not think of her now!

1655
01:58:44,324 --> 01:58:45,963
She doesn't matter.

1656
01:58:45,963 --> 01:58:48,247
All I want is to see you...

1657
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:50,190
...feel your presence...

1658
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:52,778
...and to know we're together.

1659
01:58:53,461 --> 01:58:55,542
Forever, this time.

1660
01:58:55,592 --> 01:58:57,699
Nothing must ever separate is again...

1661
01:58:58,617 --> 01:59:00,495
Nothing!

1662
01:59:03,792 --> 01:59:05,523
Why, Anthony?!

1663
01:59:08,516 --> 01:59:10,128
I've died a thousand times

1664
01:59:10,153 --> 01:59:11,643
since I saw you last.

1665
01:59:11,656 --> 01:59:13,130
I've been greedy and cruel...

1666
01:59:13,136 --> 01:59:15,545
I've wanted wealth and power.

1667
01:59:15,548 --> 01:59:18,277
Now I know there's nothing I want, but you.

1668
01:59:18,279 --> 01:59:20,142
Only you.

1669
01:59:20,192 --> 01:59:22,032
And the future that we'll make together...

1670
01:59:33,517 --> 01:59:34,737
- Anthony...  - Yes, mother?

1671
01:59:34,762 --> 01:59:36,075
You won't have to go to Havana

1672
01:59:36,088 --> 01:59:38,765
to find your father.  He's come back!

1673
01:59:38,815 --> 01:59:40,582
This is he!

1674
01:59:55,038 --> 01:59:56,905
My son!

1675
02:00:13,882 --> 02:00:15,020
And then what?

1676
02:00:15,045 --> 02:00:16,462
He took the child in his arms.

1677
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:17,930
Was I right?

1678
02:00:17,936 --> 02:00:19,310
As usual.

1679
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,297
That is all... you may go.

1680
02:00:23,293 --> 02:00:25,754
A child in his arms...

1681
02:00:25,779 --> 02:00:26,789
Do you want him arrested?

1682
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:28,383
For being in love? Don't be a fool!

1683
02:00:28,389 --> 02:00:30,081
We can order him out of France.

1684
02:00:30,084 --> 02:00:30,769
No, that's wrong.

1685
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:32,798
He must leave of his own accord.

1686
02:00:39,496 --> 02:00:40,928
Congratulations!

1687
02:00:40,978 --> 02:00:41,906
What for?

1688
02:00:43,627 --> 02:00:43,627
Bonaparte's agreed to our scheme.

1689
02:00:43,652 --> 02:00:44,886
- On the Mexican gold?  - Yes.

1690
02:00:44,899 --> 02:00:46,331
I've never seen him more amiable.

1691
02:00:46,337 --> 02:00:47,469
And whom do you think he's chosen

1692
02:00:47,472 --> 02:00:48,380
to go to America?

1693
02:00:48,381 --> 02:00:49,979
- How would I know?  - YOU, Tony!

1694
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,833
None other than you, Anthony Adverse.

1695
02:00:51,834 --> 02:00:54,229
Provided you're willing, of course... sit down...

1696
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:55,633
Let's talk it over.

1697
02:00:55,633 --> 02:00:57,284
The gold will be smuggled into New Orleans...

1698
02:00:57,284 --> 02:00:58,119
where you will receive it...

1699
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:00,291
and arrange for its transfer to Philadelphia.

1700
02:01:00,291 --> 02:01:01,562
There it can be shipped on a neutral boat,

1701
02:01:01,562 --> 02:01:03,070
direct to France.

1702
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:04,940
It's our only chance to get hold of it, Tony.

1703
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:06,831
Failure means bankruptcy.

1704
02:01:06,881 --> 02:01:08,613
For you, as well as for us.

1705
02:01:11,107 --> 02:01:12,990
You don't seem to relish the idea.

1706
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:18,519
Yesterday I should have welcomed it... now...

1707
02:01:18,544 --> 02:01:20,992
Decisions of this sort take time, naturally.

1708
02:01:21,005 --> 02:01:23,132
On the other hand we can't disguise the fact

1709
02:01:23,138 --> 02:01:24,883
that it's a matter of the gravest importance...

1710
02:01:24,886 --> 02:01:26,487
for all concerned.

1711
02:01:26,537 --> 02:01:28,633
I understand.

1712
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:35,072
I'll give you my answer within 48 hours.

1713
02:01:37,081 --> 02:01:38,805
Don't worry, Vin.

1714
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:47,828
It's your, now.

1715
02:01:55,924 --> 02:01:58,288
I want you to keep it always.

1716
02:02:11,344 --> 02:02:13,918
- Goodnight mummy.  - Goodnight, darling.

1717
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:37,791
You've won him completely.

1718
02:02:48,786 --> 02:02:49,862
Angela...

1719
02:02:51,505 --> 02:02:54,182
Have I won you?... That's the question.

1720
02:02:54,207 --> 02:02:57,106
Anthony... you must go to America,

1721
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:58,424
regardless of me.

1722
02:02:58,430 --> 02:02:59,800
I couldn't.

1723
02:02:59,803 --> 02:03:01,632
Not even to save Vincent.

1724
02:03:01,634 --> 02:03:03,563
But you're own money's at stake, as well as his.

1725
02:03:03,564 --> 02:03:05,872
Some day it should go to our son.

1726
02:03:05,922 --> 02:03:09,285
You wouldn't want him to be poor, as WE were.

1727
02:03:11,859 --> 02:03:13,691
You're my wife, Angela.

1728
02:03:14,554 --> 02:03:15,582
I can't understand

1729
02:03:15,632 --> 02:03:17,322
you're not wanting to come with me.

1730
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:20,985
You're hiding something... What is it?

1731
02:03:21,035 --> 02:03:22,957
I have my career.

1732
02:03:24,345 --> 02:03:25,979
You told me once, you didn't want a career

1733
02:03:26,004 --> 02:03:27,324
unless you could be a great singer.

1734
02:03:27,336 --> 02:03:28,675
Truly great.

1735
02:03:28,682 --> 02:03:31,116
Yes... I remember.

1736
02:03:31,166 --> 02:03:33,421
After all, what does it mean to be great?

1737
02:03:33,943 --> 02:03:35,859
Look at Mlle Georges and Bonaparte...

1738
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:38,894
Everyone knows how she managed to succeed.

1739
02:03:40,158 --> 02:03:42,227
Is that what they're saying?

1740
02:03:42,252 --> 02:03:44,384
You don't envy HER, do you?

1741
02:03:44,397 --> 02:03:47,938
No... I don't envy her.

1742
02:03:47,944 --> 02:03:51,291
Why won't you come with me... Why?

1743
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:53,651
Oh, my darling!

1744
02:03:54,638 --> 02:03:56,942
My sweet!

1745
02:03:56,967 --> 02:03:59,207
You're all the world to me.

1746
02:03:59,257 --> 02:04:01,307
You're everything I ever wanted.

1747
02:04:02,312 --> 02:04:04,279
I only know that, now.

1748
02:04:04,304 --> 02:04:05,486
Don't say any more, Anthony!

1749
02:04:05,536 --> 02:04:06,913
Please don't say any more!

1750
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:15,750
I didn't mean to make a scene.

1751
02:04:15,775 --> 02:04:17,318
I must be nervous...

1752
02:04:17,368 --> 02:04:20,525
I always am when I'm going to sing.

1753
02:04:21,574 --> 02:04:23,991
Sing? Where?

1754
02:04:27,688 --> 02:04:29,056
Tomorrow night.

1755
02:04:30,363 --> 02:04:33,590
- At the Opéra.   - Here?! In Paris?!

1756
02:04:33,615 --> 02:04:35,110
Yes.

1757
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,299
That's wonderful!

1758
02:04:36,723 --> 02:04:38,441
Did you think I'd mind?!

1759
02:04:38,466 --> 02:04:39,824
I'll be there to hear you!

1760
02:04:39,874 --> 02:04:42,359
Oh, I'll be so proud!

1761
02:04:43,265 --> 02:04:44,549
Oh, Anthony!...

1762
02:04:44,599 --> 02:04:46,940
Oh, my husband... Hold me close!

1763
02:05:09,686 --> 02:05:11,747
Have you heard the rumour about the necklace?

1764
02:05:11,772 --> 02:05:14,448
The one Josephine has been begging for.

1765
02:05:14,461 --> 02:05:17,040
They say Bonaparte's given it to Mlle Georges!

1766
02:05:17,046 --> 02:05:19,027
No! He wouldn't dare!

1767
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:20,101
Will she wear it, do you think?

1768
02:05:20,103 --> 02:05:22,295
No woman could resist a triumph like that!

1769
02:05:22,345 --> 02:05:25,236
Good evening, Ouvrard... Greetings!

1770
02:05:26,257 --> 02:05:27,477
How DO you do?!

1771
02:05:28,227 --> 02:05:30,253
This is quite a surprise, Don Luis!

1772
02:05:30,278 --> 02:05:33,189
I didn't expect to see you in Paris.

1773
02:05:33,202 --> 02:05:36,241
Nor I to see you, Monsieur.

1774
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:39,228
Allow me to present my wife.

1775
02:05:45,664 --> 02:05:49,677
Life is strange, is it not, monsieur?

1776
02:05:49,727 --> 02:05:51,703
Incredibly.

1777
02:06:56,435 --> 02:06:59,321
I can't find Angela's name on the program.

1778
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:02,268
Ssh! Mlle Georges is about to appear!

1779
02:07:20,054 --> 02:07:22,127
That's her voice!

1780
02:07:22,177 --> 02:07:24,988
That's Angela!

1781
02:07:26,261 --> 02:07:28,686
Quiet! That's Mlle Georges!

1782
02:09:01,742 --> 02:09:04,611
That girl used to wash my clothes.

1783
02:09:05,297 --> 02:09:07,221
I remember.

1784
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:09,630
The necklace! You see it?

1785
02:09:38,013 --> 02:09:40,750
Goodbye, Anthony!

1786
02:09:41,688 --> 02:09:44,013
Goodbye.

1787
02:10:41,847 --> 02:10:43,114
<i>Dearest Anthony...</i>

1788
02:10:44,923 --> 02:10:47,049
<i>You are far better fitted than I</i>

1789
02:10:47,099 --> 02:10:48,906
<i>to take care of...</i>

1790
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:52,541
<i>...of our son.</i>

1791
02:10:53,772 --> 02:10:58,627
<i>I send him to you with all the love in my heart...</i>

1792
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:02,946
<i>I know he will be happy.</i>

1793
02:11:05,488 --> 02:11:06,966
<i>Forgive me...</i>

1794
02:11:08,398 --> 02:11:11,515
<i>for not seeing you again.</i>

1795
02:11:12,867 --> 02:11:15,104
<i>Angela.</i>

1796
02:11:25,074 --> 02:11:29,004
Mummy said that I'm to go away with you.

1797
02:11:29,054 --> 02:11:30,582
On a big ship.

1798
02:11:32,676 --> 02:11:34,608
Your mother said that?

1799
02:11:34,658 --> 02:11:37,487
She did... Honestly!

1800
02:11:38,735 --> 02:11:41,069
Are you sure you didn't ask her?

1801
02:11:41,094 --> 02:11:42,523
All I said was...

1802
02:11:42,536 --> 02:11:44,641
"Why don't you come, too?"

1803
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:45,420
And she said...

1804
02:11:45,423 --> 02:11:47,963
Well, she would make it, some other time.

1805
02:11:47,965 --> 02:11:50,135
But that YOU had to go, and it seems a shame

1806
02:11:50,136 --> 02:11:51,651
not to have someone to go with you.

1807
02:11:51,701 --> 02:11:54,228
So I said... "Alright, I'll go!"

1808
02:11:56,876 --> 02:11:58,249
Did you mean it?

1809
02:11:59,945 --> 02:12:01,697
Do you really want to go?

1810
02:12:03,086 --> 02:12:04,828
Oh, Father!

1811
02:12:11,785 --> 02:12:15,392
Set tight all tacks and braces!

1812
02:12:18,767 --> 02:12:21,831
Well, here we are... off to America!

1813
02:12:22,402 --> 02:12:24,022
- Ever been there?    - No, never.

1814
02:12:24,047 --> 02:12:25,690
Lots of people going nowadays.

1815
02:12:25,702 --> 02:12:27,659
And they ain't coming back, either.

1816
02:12:27,665 --> 02:12:28,411
Looks as though

1817
02:12:28,415 --> 02:12:30,573
they'll have a big country over there!

1818
02:12:30,575 --> 02:12:32,405
Peace of mind.

1819
02:12:32,406 --> 02:12:34,619
That's all they're looking for.

1820
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:37,297
A chance to lead lives of their own making.

1821
02:12:37,297 --> 02:12:39,143
Great place for youngsters, too...

1822
02:12:39,143 --> 02:12:41,404
They grow up big and strong!

1823
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:43,700
You'll like it Master Adverse.

1824
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:49,955
"Adverse"?  Is THAT my name?

1825
02:12:51,155 --> 02:12:52,323
Yes.

1826
02:12:52,857 --> 02:12:54,823
It's a new name, son.

1827
02:12:54,848 --> 02:12:56,876
Three people made it.

1828
02:12:56,889 --> 02:12:59,505
Father Xavier gave it a mind...

1829
02:12:59,511 --> 02:13:01,783
Father François, a soul...

1830
02:13:01,833 --> 02:13:04,641
And your mother, a heart.

1831
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:07,922
We must never forget them Anthony.

1832
02:13:07,972 --> 02:13:10,651
- "Anthony Adverse"?   - Yes.

1833
02:13:15,014 --> 02:13:16,695
Anthony Adverse.

1834
