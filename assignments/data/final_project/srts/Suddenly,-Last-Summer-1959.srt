1
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,117
Gentlemen, I wanna welcome
you medical schoolmen...

2
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:36,258
...to our new operating theater.

3
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:39,461
Although, as you can see,
it isn't exactly what you'd call new.

4
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,926
Used to be a library
when this was a school...

5
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,431
...and maybe before that
some kind of a sugar warehouse.

6
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,695
But makeshift or not, the important
thing is that we got it.

7
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,875
The first to be devoted
to psychosurgery in this state.

8
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,237
And that is a great step forward.

9
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,640
Now you're going
to witness an operation...

10
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:00,009
...never performed before
in this state.

11
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,913
A lobotomy on the brain of a woman...

12
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:05,145
...suffering from acute
schizophrenic withdrawal.

13
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,450
Our new staff member,
Dr. John Cukrowicz from Chicago...

14
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,888
...will perform this operation.

15
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:52,774
Swab.

16
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,175
Sew up, will you?

17
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,745
You have just witnessed a delicate
operation on the human brain...

18
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:09,479
...performed under the most
primitive surgical conditions...

19
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:12,886
...that I hope any of you
will ever encounter.

20
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,263
Excuse us, please.

21
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,635
- Son, I know just how you feel.
- For six months...

22
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,543
...I have listened to you
promise me this and that.

23
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,082
- But I am not...
- I know, I know, I know.

24
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,654
You are not the state board of health.
Well, I am not a witch doctor.

25
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,291
I need properly trained assistants.

26
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:47,496
I need an operating room
that doesn't fall apart.

27
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,426
At least lights that stay lit.

28
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,295
I know, but this is
a state hospital...

29
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,299
...and there isn't
enough money for us.

30
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:57,063
I can't promise you
that there ever will be enough.

31
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:01,667
I'll go back to Chicago
or someplace where there is.

32
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:02,776
John.

33
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,640
Before you do that...

34
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,077
...read this.

35
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,154
Who is Violet Venable?

36
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,621
You reveal your ignorance
of our fair city...

37
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,459
...of which Mrs. Venable
is the richest lady.

38
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,532
At one time,
her husband owned most of it.

39
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,029
Now she's a widow and she owns it.

40
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:30,935
"...and was very interested
in the work of your Dr. Cukrowicz."

41
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:34,010
She must have read your write-up
in the Herald.

42
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,978
"And I wonder if the foundation
I am establishing...

43
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,549
...might be of some assistance."

44
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,682
Son, with one signature
on one check...

45
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,552
...she can solve
all the problems we got.

46
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,791
"Also there is a matter
of some urgency...

47
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,431
...I should like to discuss with him.

48
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,935
Would 4:30 on Tuesday be convenient?"

49
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,635
That's today.

50
00:07:58,405 --> 00:07:59,998
What is her urgency, do you know?

51
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:03,574
No, but I know what ours is.
Lack of money. Her money.

52
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:05,245
She is serious?

53
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,414
4:30 this afternoon, you'll know.

54
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,116
I can tell you this much.

55
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,751
I've been trying for years
just to see the Venable lawyers.

56
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:16,287
You've been invited by her.
That's a command performance.

57
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,721
That's how serious I think it is.

58
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:20,995
And this is serious too.

59
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,894
More than 1200 mental cases
Lions View can't afford to handle.

60
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,084
Good afternoon.

61
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,651
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,115
Take a seat, please.

63
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,450
Thank you.

64
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,234
Mrs. Venable?

65
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,445
I am Miss Foxhill,
Mrs. Venable's secretary.

66
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,705
And you are Dr. Cukrowicz?

67
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,577
Your appointment was for...?

68
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,842
Four-thirty.

69
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,715
You are 23 seconds early.
Sit down, please.

70
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,551
Thank you.

71
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,889
Sebastian always said,
"Mother, when you descend...

72
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,361
...it's like the goddess
from the machine."

73
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:32,195
- Mrs. Venable's on her way down.
- I feel just like an angel...

74
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,272
...coming to earth
as I float, float into view.

75
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:36,939
Sebastian...

76
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:41,048
...my son, Sebastian, was
very interested in the Byzantine.

77
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,445
Are you interested
in the Byzantine, Dr...?

78
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:44,978
Cukrowicz.

79
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,415
I don't know very much
about the Byzantine.

80
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:51,557
The emperor of Byzantium,
when he received people in audience...

81
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:54,319
...had a throne which,
during the conversation...

82
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:56,429
...would rise mysteriously
in the air...

83
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,066
...to the consternation
of the visitors.

84
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:02,295
But as we are living in a democracy,
I reverse the procedure.

85
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,233
I don't rise. I come down.

86
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:07,171
How do you do, Dr...?
Oh, I'm sorry, your name?

87
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,469
Cukrowicz.

88
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,509
It's a Polish word meaning "sugar."

89
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,450
Am I only wearing one earring?
Have I forgotten my lip rouge?

90
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,481
Excuse me, I...

91
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:21,816
I guess I had been told
you were a widow.

92
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,287
I am. I'm in mourning.

93
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,963
White was my son's favorite color.

94
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,633
Perhaps, Dr. Sugar...

95
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,165
...you expected an old widow.

96
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,838
With a garnet brooch, a cane
and an ear trumpet.

97
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,065
Well, I have all that
to look forward to.

98
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,770
Life is a thief. Sebastian always
said, "Life steals everything."

99
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,107
I want to show you his garden.

100
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,543
Are you sure you should go out,
Mrs. Venable?

101
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:48,878
Quite sure.
They treat me like an invalid.

102
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:51,056
You see, last spring I had a slight...

103
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,488
...a tiny convulsion
of a tiny blood vessel.

104
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,219
What did your doctor call it?

105
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:57,725
A malady of living.

106
00:10:57,964 --> 00:11:02,333
After all, I've buried a husband
and a son. I'm a widow and a...

107
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,703
Funny, there's no word.

108
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,134
Lose your parents, you're an orphan.

109
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,606
Lose your only son and you are...

110
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,271
...nothing.

111
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,008
Foxhill.

112
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:19,045
Where are they?

113
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,550
I put them in the patio.

114
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,749
They sent them parcel post from
Pensacola. That's why they were late.

115
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:29,590
Another day and we'd have starved
to death. Come on, doctor.

116
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,760
In your letter,
you said an "urgent" matter.

117
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:37,370
I must say, you're handsomer
than your photograph in the paper...

118
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,634
...without that awful paraphernalia
you doctors wear.

119
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:43,540
Your son's favorite color, white.

120
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,147
Such extraordinary eyes.

121
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:47,611
So like his.

122
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,182
You must...

123
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,050
I almost said, "You must meet
my son, Sebastian." Force of habit.

124
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,691
Is he the son who died?

125
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,484
Yes, last July, in Europe.

126
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,253
He must have been young to die.

127
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:00,690
All poets...

128
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:04,528
...whatever age they may seem
to others, die young.

129
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:38,164
It's unexpected.

130
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,532
Like the dawn of Creation.

131
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,605
It was Sebastian's idea.

132
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:46,439
Part of his lifelong war
against the herbaceous border.

133
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:50,549
Not unlike a well-groomed jungle
and, frankly, a little terrifying.

134
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,514
So was Creation.

135
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,020
So is Creation.
Listen to them buzz, buzz.

136
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,691
What's in there?

137
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,588
This way, before our poor Lady
dies of hunger.

138
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:03,696
The Latin names to the plants
are printed on tags...

139
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,026
...attached to them,
but the print's fading.

140
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,135
Those ones there are
the oldest plants on earth.

141
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,899
Survivors from the age
of the giant fern forest.

142
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,838
And here's my poor Lady.

143
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,335
They never get away.

144
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,913
The Lady exudes
this marvelous perfume...

145
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,584
...which attracts them.

146
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,650
They plunge into her chalice.

147
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,550
And they never come out.

148
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,525
This operation
you perform is called...?

149
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,990
Lobotomy.

150
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,130
- That's an unusual...
- I hate these flies.

151
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:35,559
Foxhill!

152
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,960
Foxhill!

153
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:41,027
She loves feeding our wicked Lady.
Foxhill's rather a brute.

154
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,437
Such an extravagance, really,
from early fall to late spring...

155
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:46,507
...Lady must be kept under glass...

156
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:50,237
...we have to provide her with flies
flown in at great expense.

157
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,610
Foxhill, you do the honors.

158
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:56,412
- Lady's very hungry today.
- Of course, Mrs. Venable.

159
00:13:56,655 --> 00:14:00,525
I've never seen an insectivorous
plant before. What is it called?

160
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,854
The Venus's-flytrap.

161
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,164
A devouring organism...

162
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,630
...aptly named
for the goddess of love.

163
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:13,095
What was your son's work?
I mean, aside from this garden.

164
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:16,435
As many times as I've had
to answer that question...

165
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:18,669
...it still shocks me
a little to realize...

166
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:21,882
...that Sebastian Venable the poet
was quite unknown...

167
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:25,279
...outside of a small coterie
of friends, including his mother.

168
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,486
Your son was a poet?

169
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,814
Strictly speaking,
his life was his occupation.

170
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:31,617
Yes. Yes, Sebastian was a poet.

171
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,853
That's what I meant when I said
his life was his work.

172
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:39,757
Because the work of a poet is
the life of a poet. And vice versa.

173
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:42,266
I mean, you can't separate them.

174
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:45,530
I mean, a poet's life is his work.

175
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:50,074
And his work is his life,
in a special sense.

176
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:57,747
- Are you all right?
- Right as rain, however right that is.

177
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:01,118
This operation of yours,
does it really work?

178
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,388
Yes, yes, it does.

179
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,618
However, it is very experimental.

180
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:09,924
I was struck by something
you said in the paper.

181
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,932
About the sharp knife in the mind.

182
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,934
That kills the devil in the soul?

183
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,100
I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.

184
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,344
No, what you said
was almost poetic itself.

185
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,914
Mrs. Venable, the work
of a doctor is his life too.

186
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:33,750
But we need help, particularly
in a field as experimental as mine.

187
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:37,622
Particularly at a state hospital
like Lions View.

188
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,759
Yet we have little money,
practically none.

189
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,524
Yes, I know.

190
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:44,061
Doctor...

191
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,335
...I have a niece by marriage...

192
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,507
...at a place called St. Mary's.

193
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:50,039
I've heard of it.

194
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,504
It's a custodial home for the insane.

195
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:56,307
She suffers from something
called dementia praecox.

196
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,676
Dementia praecox?

197
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:01,082
Which is to say, she's mad
as a hatter, poor child.

198
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,119
Would you like to
see Sebastian's studio?

199
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:06,885
It's at the end of the jungle
in what used to be the garçonničre.

200
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,755
That's an old
New Orleans convenience.

201
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:12,023
A place where the young men
could go to be private.

202
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,997
You're not from New Orleans?

203
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:18,639
No, Chicago. Actually, dementia
praecox is a meaningless phrase...

204
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:22,742
Chicago. I've always wanted
to see two places before I die.

205
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,174
Hong Kong...

206
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,109
...and Chicago.

207
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,675
Now I shall never see either.

208
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,886
Because I must use every inch and ounce
of what little strength I have...

209
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,614
...in doing just what I'm doing.

210
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,486
The foundation you referred to?

211
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,390
Building a memorial to my son.

212
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:45,034
You see, Sebastian had
no public name as a poet.

213
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,237
He didn't want one.

214
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,566
He refused to have one.

215
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,835
He abhorred the false values
that come from being publicly known...

216
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,776
...from fame,
from personal exploitation.

217
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,748
He'd say to me, "Violet, Mother,
you're going to live longer than me.

218
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,480
When I'm gone, it will be yours
to do whatever you please with."

219
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,760
Meaning, of course,
his future recognition.

220
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,162
- You're very like him, doctor.
- ln what way?

221
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,233
Because you, a doctor, a surgeon...

222
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,336
...are dedicated to your art.

223
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,836
Yes, to your art.
It is an art, what you do.

224
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,170
Using people the way he did.

225
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,574
Grandly, creatively.

226
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,448
Almost like God.

227
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,175
I'm afraid my art is to help.

228
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,889
Not to use, but to be used.

229
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,761
Well, it comes to the same,
doesn't it?

230
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,226
I mean, in the end.

231
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,167
Oh, I don't know what I mean.

232
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,597
There is the atelier,
Sebastian's studio.

233
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,141
Most people's lives...

234
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:56,239
...what are they
but trails of debris?

235
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,743
Each day more debris, more debris.

236
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,417
Long, long trails of debris...

237
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,278
...with nothing to clean it all up
but, finally, death.

238
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:08,585
I guess...

239
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:12,994
...quiet desperation
is the word for most lives.

240
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:16,299
But ours were different.

241
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,728
Sebastian's and mine.

242
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,806
I know it sounds
hopelessly vain to say...

243
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,271
...but we were a famous couple.

244
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,445
People didn't speak of
Sebastian and his mother...

245
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:31,205
...or Mrs. Venable and her son.

246
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:33,350
They said Sebastian and Violet.

247
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,577
Violet and Sebastian
are staying at the Lido.

248
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,083
They're at the Ritz.

249
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:41,085
And every appearance,
every time we appeared...

250
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,761
...attention was centered on us.

251
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,031
Everyone else eclipsed.

252
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,501
My son, Sebastian...

253
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,597
...and I...

254
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,806
...constructed our days.

255
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,272
Each day, we would carve each day
like a piece of sculpture.

256
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:02,181
We left behind us a trail of days...

257
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,714
...like a gallery of sculpture...

258
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,616
...until suddenly, last summer...

259
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,856
Your son died?

260
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,737
You say that your niece suffers
from dementia praecox.

261
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:26,338
There must have been
a more exact diagnosis.

262
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,736
Such a pretty name for a disease.

263
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:32,413
Sounds like a rare flower,
doesn't it?

264
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,209
Night-blooming dementia praecox.

265
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,721
What form does her disturbance take?

266
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,082
Madness.

267
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,455
Obsession, memory.

268
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,287
She lacerates herself with memory.

269
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,996
Memory of what?

270
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,563
Visions, hallucinations.

271
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,200
It all started last summer.

272
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:56,167
The first I knew, there was a cable...

273
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,272
...from this clinic in Paris...

274
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,604
...saying, "Your niece is out
of her mind. What shall we do?"

275
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,837
I was almost out of
my own mind last summer.

276
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:07,744
Sebastian had just died, I was ill,
but I did everything I could.

277
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,785
I said, "Send her straight home
with a nurse."

278
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,651
So they put her on the Berengaria...

279
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,822
...locked in her stateroom
like a wild animal.

280
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,293
She was taken straight to St. Mary's.

281
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:23,491
And now they can't keep her there,
they can't help her...

282
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,761
...or cope with her fits of violence.

283
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,567
Her babbling,
her dreadful obscene babbling.

284
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,768
- What kind of babbling?
- Fantastic delusions and babblings...

285
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,481
...of an unspeakable nature...

286
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:38,048
...mostly taking the form
of hideous attacks...

287
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:41,550
...on the moral character
of my son, Sebastian.

288
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:45,157
And now they tell me at St. Mary's...

289
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,292
...the mother superior tells me...

290
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:50,223
...that we must find
another place for her.

291
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,391
And then I read about you...

292
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:59,003
...about your operation,
and I thought:

293
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,607
"This may be the answer
to all our prayers."

294
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,205
You must realize
the operation I do...

295
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:07,644
...is only for the unapproachable,
for the hopeless.

296
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:10,648
If she isn't unapproachable
and hopeless, I don't know who is.

297
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,377
- The things she says.
- What?

298
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:14,715
- Terrible, obscene things.
- Such as?

299
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,720
Oh, anything.

300
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,188
Such as?

301
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,655
All right, you asked.

302
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:23,366
This happened recently at St. Mary's.

303
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,036
Catherine accused an elderly gardener
of making love to her.

304
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,569
They questioned the gardener,
an old man.

305
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,434
It was the other way around.

306
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:35,544
Catherine had made advances to him,
spoken obscenely to him.

307
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,079
When confronted with her lies,
she fought, she screamed.

308
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,341
It took four nuns to control her.

309
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:44,351
And now I'm put on notice that they
won't keep her there after this week.

310
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,181
You see why I said urgent.

311
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:48,222
Yes, I do. I certainly do.

312
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,690
It's important I see her
as soon as possible.

313
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,659
And help her because if you can't,
I'm at my wits' end.

314
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:57,063
I can transfer her to Lions View.
She won't be as comfortable...

315
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:58,633
I understand, I understand.

316
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,998
But the important thing
is you, doctor.

317
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,731
You'll be happy to know
that at this very minute...

318
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:07,879
...my lawyers are working on the
Sebastian Venable Memorial Foundation...

319
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:11,710
...to subsidize the work
of young people like yourself...

320
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:15,183
...who are pushing out
the frontiers of art and science...

321
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:16,889
...but have a financial problem.

322
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:21,384
Mrs. Venable, loving your niece
as you do, you must know...

323
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:24,461
...there's great risk
in this operation.

324
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:26,690
Whenever you enter the brain
with a foreign object...

325
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:29,160
...even a needle-thin knife...

326
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:31,703
...in the hands of
the most skilled surgeon...

327
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,508
...there still is
a great deal of risk.

328
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,301
But it does pacify them,
I've read that.

329
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:41,778
It quiets them down.
It suddenly makes them peaceful.

330
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:43,882
Yes, that it does do, but...

331
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,349
But what?

332
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:49,718
Well, it will be years before
we know if the immediate benefits...

333
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,520
...of the operation are lasting...

334
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:55,231
...or just passing or perhaps...

335
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:59,767
There's a strong possibility that
the patient will always be limited.

336
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,371
Relieved of acute anxiety,
yes, but limited.

337
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:07,771
But what a blessing to them, doctor,
to be just peaceful.

338
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,408
To be just suddenly peaceful.

339
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:15,151
After all that horror...

340
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:17,646
...after those nightmares...

341
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,626
...just to be able to lift up
their eyes to a sky...

342
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,226
...not black with savage,
devouring birds.

343
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:27,659
You said a sky filled with savage,
devouring birds?

344
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:28,889
Did I?

345
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:32,832
How odd. I hadn't thought
about all that in years.

346
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:34,972
Now, why should I suddenly...?

347
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,439
Yes, we saw those birds
one summer in the Pacific.

348
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:43,046
You see, my son,
Sebastian, was looking for...

349
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,308
Looking for what?

350
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,713
Rare, hungry birds.

351
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:50,083
That isn't what you started to say.

352
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,153
You're too quick for me.

353
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:56,421
No. I was going to say my son,
Sebastian, was looking for God.

354
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:59,631
But I stopped myself
because I thought you'd think:

355
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,028
"What a pretentious young crackpot."

356
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:04,271
Which Sebastian was not.

357
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,001
This is something
I've never told anyone before.

358
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:09,871
Something so strange, so terrible.

359
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:14,405
Forgive me if I sound quite mad,
but it's true all the same.

360
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:17,710
Sebastian saw the face of God.

361
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:20,119
I'd like to hear about that.

362
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,683
Yes, yes.

363
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:28,823
One long ago summer,
sitting right here in this garden...

364
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,659
...Sebastian said to me,
"Mother, listen to this."

365
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:35,463
And he read me
Herman Melville's description...

366
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:38,766
...of the Encantadas,
the Galápagos Islands.

367
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,445
He read me that description
and said we had to go there.

368
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,671
And so we did go there that summer...

369
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,510
...on a chartered boat,
a four-masted schooner...

370
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,314
...the sort of boat that
Melville would have sailed on.

371
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,719
We saw the Encantadas.

372
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,587
But on the Encantadas
we saw something...

373
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,923
...that Melville hadn't written about.

374
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,399
We saw the great sea turtles
crawl up out of the sea...

375
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,467
...for their annual egg-laying.

376
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,901
Once a year, the female
of the sea turtles...

377
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,703
...crawls up out of the equatorial sea
onto the blazing sand beach...

378
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,972
...of a volcanic island
to dig a pit in the sand...

379
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,708
...and deposit her eggs there.

380
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:24,151
It's a long and dreadful thing,
the depositing of the eggs in the pits.

381
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,984
And when it's finished...

382
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:28,718
...the exhausted
female turtle crawls...

383
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:31,830
...back to the sea half-dead.

384
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,258
She never sees her offspring.

385
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,637
But we did.

386
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:41,204
Sebastian knew exactly when
the sea turtle eggs would be hatched...

387
00:25:41,442 --> 00:25:43,502
...and we returned in time for it.

388
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:44,541
You went back?

389
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,408
In time to witness
the hatching of the sea turtles...

390
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,948
...and their desperate flight
to the sea.

391
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:54,885
The narrow beach, the color
of caviar, was all in motion...

392
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:58,581
...but the sky was in motion too,
full of flesh-eating birds.

393
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,557
And the noise of the birds...

394
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:03,288
...their horrible savage cries
as they circled...

395
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,968
...over the narrow black beach
of the Encantadas...

396
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:09,729
...while the new-hatched sea turtles
scrambled out of their sandpits...

397
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:11,703
...and started their race to the sea.

398
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:12,908
Race to the sea?

399
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:15,338
To escape the flesh-eating birds...

400
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:18,308
...that made the sky
almost as black as the beach.

401
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:21,210
And I said, "Sebastian, no.

402
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:23,682
No, it's not like that."

403
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,545
But he made me look.

404
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,088
He made me see that terrible sight.

405
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:30,759
- What was not like that?
- Life.

406
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:32,653
I said, "No.

407
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:36,061
No! That's not true!"

408
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,160
But he said it is.

409
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:42,271
He said, "Look, Violet.
Look, there on the shore."

410
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:46,968
And I looked and saw the sand
all alive, all alive...

411
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:50,445
...as the new-hatched sea turtles
made their dash to the sea...

412
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:54,050
...while the birds hovered
and swooped to attack...

413
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:57,346
...and hovered and swooped to attack.

414
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:01,353
They were diving down
on the sea turtles...

415
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:03,586
...turning them over...

416
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,857
...to expose their soft undersides...

417
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:10,127
...tearing their undersides open...

418
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:14,440
...and rending and eating their flesh.

419
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:20,304
Sebastian guessed that possibly...

420
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,484
...only a hundredth
of 1 percent of their number...

421
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,584
...would escape to the sea.

422
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:31,354
Nature is not created
in the image of man's compassion.

423
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,356
Nature is cruel!

424
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,421
Sebastian knew it all along,
was born knowing it, but not I.

425
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:42,331
I said, "No, no, those are
only birds, turtles, not us."

426
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:44,699
I didn't know then it was us.

427
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:49,504
That we are all of us trapped
by this devouring creation.

428
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:53,812
I couldn't, wouldn't face
the horror of the truth...

429
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:56,577
...even that last day
in the Encantadas...

430
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,686
...when Sebastian left me...

431
00:27:58,923 --> 00:28:02,087
...and spent the whole
blazing equatorial day...

432
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,888
...in the crow's-nest of the schooner,
watching that thing on the beach...

433
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,224
...until it was too dark to see.

434
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:12,733
And when he came down the rigging,
he said, "Well, now I've seen Him."

435
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,368
And he meant God.

436
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:16,537
Do you believe he saw God?

437
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:20,412
He saw the whole thing there
that day on the beach.

438
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:23,411
But I was like you. I said no.

439
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:25,709
I refused to believe...

440
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:30,355
...until suddenly, last summer,
I learned my son was right.

441
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,220
That what he had shown me
in the Encantadas...

442
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,926
...was the horrible...

443
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,630
...the inescapable truth.

444
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:53,380
Oh, Violet, honey.

445
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:55,708
You gave me a turn,
coming in like that.

446
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,746
Hi, Aunt Vi.

447
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:58,718
What are you two doing here?

448
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,320
We came for cousin Sebastian's
clothes, like you said.

449
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,582
Remember?

450
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,420
So we just kind of let ourselves in.

451
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,893
I must have just got hold of
this letter when you frightened me.

452
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,157
Caught on your sleeve probably.

453
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:15,462
This is Mrs. Holly, the mother
of the girl at St. Mary's...

454
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,695
...and that is her son, George.

455
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,502
Apparently, in a weak moment, I said
he could have Sebastian's clothes.

456
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:26,182
You haven't forgotten what you said
last week at Elaine Tutweiler's?

457
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,384
Said since I was going
off to college...

458
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,485
...I could have his clothes,
which were going to waste.

459
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,053
That's right, you said that.

460
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,555
I heard you say
that son here could have...

461
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:39,426
All right, I stand accused of
generosity. Now will you please...?

462
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:43,660
Aunt Violet is generous,
so generous to her family, Mr...

463
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:45,130
I didn't catch your name.

464
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,862
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Doctor? Are you a doctor?

465
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,872
- Violet, you're not ill again?
- No, Grace...

466
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:52,576
Oh, I'm so relieved.

467
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,940
I was afraid you had another
of those strokes of yours.

468
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:57,375
Those hysterical seizures.

469
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:01,485
I've never had a seizure nor a stroke.
We were discussing your daughter.

470
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:02,779
Cathy?

471
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:06,053
My poor lamb, my poor little girl.

472
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,816
Doctor, can you help her?

473
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:09,358
I'll try to if I can.

474
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:12,723
Mama, look here! White silk.

475
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,896
"Made in Rome."

476
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:18,436
Oh, boy. Is this one gonna
pick up lipstick?

477
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:22,107
I said take the clothes, George.
Don't flaunt them in my face.

478
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,245
Why don't you both
kindly let yourselves out?

479
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,744
Get the rest of the clothes
another time.

480
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:30,178
It won't take me two seconds
to finish up.

481
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:32,045
It's impossible to believe...

482
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,915
...that Sebastian won't
walk through that door again...

483
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:38,524
...with all those bright young people
he used to know.

484
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:40,557
All laughing and carrying on...

485
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:44,926
...saying those witty, sophisticated
things that were way over my head.

486
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,464
He was such a tease too.

487
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:47,600
You know, doctor...

488
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:51,398
...he told me that the piece of lace
on this table...

489
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,575
...was made by these blind nuns...

490
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,334
...in Belgium. Imagine!

491
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,878
I thought I'd gone through everything.

492
00:30:59,115 --> 00:30:59,946
Who is that?

493
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:03,209
- lt's the girl.
- Why, that's my poor angel.

494
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:06,149
- That's Catherine.
- I wonder why he put it there.

495
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,154
Well, maybe he liked her.

496
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:11,394
George, take your plunder
and get out of here.

497
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:16,164
- Okay, Aunt Vi.
- This must have been taken last spring.

498
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,699
Cathy's wearing her
Mardi Gras ballgown.

499
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:23,170
Remember, Vi, how lovely she was?
And you loaned her your fur coat.

500
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,603
I remember everything.

501
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,606
I guess it was not exactly
a happy evening.

502
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,278
What did happen?

503
00:31:31,518 --> 00:31:34,543
She was... She is a lovely girl.

504
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:37,517
And I must say, of all my relations...

505
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:42,387
...my delightful relations,
she was the one most like me.

506
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,794
That's why you've got to save her...

507
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:48,330
...because madness is the most horrible
doom there is on this earth.

508
00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:52,505
Every item here has been
inventoried by the insurance people.

509
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,868
I'm sure they'd be upset
if anything were missing.

510
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,770
What do you think I am?

511
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,846
On that subject, George,
my lips are sealed.

512
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,410
Now, both of you, please go.

513
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:06,085
- lt's almost 5:00.
- That's right.

514
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:08,949
Violet always has,
I mean, used to have...

515
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,183
...her 5:00 daiquiri
here with Sebastian.

516
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:14,019
Now I have it here alone.

517
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:17,020
Well, we must fly now.

518
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:20,962
I do pray you can help my poor Cathy.
Goodbye, doctor.

519
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:25,663
Violet, bye now.
Say thank you, George.

520
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:28,843
Bye, Aunt Violet.
Thanks. Thanks for everything.

521
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:33,482
Aren't they awful?
Sebastian and I used to speculate...

522
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,878
...on how that family
of Neanderthals...

523
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,282
...could have produced a girl
as rare as Catherine.

524
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:42,018
You would have liked Sebastian...

525
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,625
...and he would have been
charmed by you.

526
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,629
He wasn't a family or a money snob,
but he was a snob, all right.

527
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:52,324
He was a snob about loveliness
and elegance in things...

528
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:56,768
...about personal charm
and physical grace in people.

529
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,839
We had a perfect little troupe...

530
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:03,708
...of young and beautiful people
around us always whenever we traveled.

531
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,582
- May I sit here?
- Sebastian's seat.

532
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,288
- Oh, well...
- No, no, please.

533
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:15,119
It's a court jester's chair.
A rare one, 500 years old.

534
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,893
Please, sit on it.

535
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:22,199
Say something funny.
Make me stop wanting to cry.

536
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,567
I'm afraid I'd make a miserable jester.

537
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,466
You see, I get concerned when
people stop wanting to cry.

538
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:33,236
Time for your medicine
and your frozen daiquiri.

539
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:35,108
In that order.

540
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:39,580
Isn't it nice of the drugstore
to keep me alive?

541
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,413
- Thank you.
- Foxhill.

542
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:46,117
See the Hollys off the premises.
They're apt to remove the silver.

543
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:47,691
Yes, Mrs. Venable.

544
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:52,032
He would sit in his chair,
I in mine, at 5:00 every day...

545
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:55,964
...and we'd have our daiquiris
with St. Sebastian brooding above us.

546
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,098
But you stayed here last summer.

547
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,867
Yes, I did. I wasn't well.
He took Catherine with him.

548
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:05,104
- And he died.
- Of a heart attack.

549
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:06,675
Was she with him?

550
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:11,714
She was there with him when he died.
It was that day that she lost her mind.

551
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:14,355
When will you see her, doctor?

552
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,886
As soon as I can.

553
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:22,296
What can I tell Dr. Hockstader
about your interest in helping us?

554
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,933
Can't it wait until
you've met my niece...

555
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:28,662
...and decided if you think
your operation could help her?

556
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:30,931
Yes, of course it can wait.

557
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:33,667
Surely there's no connection between...

558
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:38,542
Aren't we always more interested in
something that concerns us personally?

559
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,815
Aren't we, doctor?

560
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,281
I understand.

561
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:48,322
Please don't bother.
I can find my way out.

562
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,726
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs fed
on the leaves of those trees.

563
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,867
They were vegetarian.
That's why they became extinct.

564
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:58,604
They were just too gentle
for their size.

565
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:02,272
Then the carnivorous creatures,
the ones that eat flesh...

566
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:05,069
...the killers, inherited the earth.

567
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,906
But then they always do, don't they?

568
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:30,132
Catherine.
It's Sister Felicity, Catherine.

569
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:33,466
Please get up. You're to come with me.

570
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,139
Catherine.

571
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,443
I'm not being violent, sister.

572
00:36:58,565 --> 00:36:59,658
What are you doing?

573
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,736
Just smoking a cigarette.

574
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,205
No.

575
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:11,573
You know we're not allowed
to smoke at St. Mary's.

576
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,248
Please let me smoke.

577
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:14,813
- Please.
- Give it here.

578
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,417
Don't be a bully!

579
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,779
Disobedience has to be paid for later.

580
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:22,320
- All right, I'll pay for it later.
- Now, Catherine.

581
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:25,049
I'm putting out my hand for it.

582
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:27,796
- All right then! Take it!
- You burned me!

583
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,591
- I'm sorry...
- You deliberately burned me.

584
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:31,664
You said to...

585
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:34,394
You stuck the lighted end of it
into my hand.

586
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,302
I'm so sick of being bossed
and bullied.

587
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:40,101
I'm sick of being t...

588
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:44,279
You saw that, doctor.
Saw her deliberately burn me.

589
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:48,051
- You better put something on that hand.
- I can't leave her.

590
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:51,456
- Patients who are classified violent...
- Sister.

591
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:55,425
Very well, doctor.
I'll wait outside.

592
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:00,361
Just outside the door.

593
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:06,697
You know, you're very brave
being in the room alone with me.

594
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,407
Do you plan to burn me too?

595
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:09,938
Oh, much worse.

596
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:13,144
You see, I'm classified as violent.

597
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:16,817
I'm apt to attack you physically
and then accuse you of rape.

598
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:18,846
Do you do that sort of thing?

599
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,681
Of course. That's why
I'm in isolation.

600
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:26,224
I molested an elderly gardener
of great virtue.

601
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,260
When he refused my advances,
I denounced him as a lecher.

602
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:32,198
After that, I was punished.

603
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,967
Was it true?

604
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,565
That I was punished?
Yes.

605
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:39,563
That you accused him unjustly.

606
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:41,966
Of course I accused him unjustly.

607
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,101
After all, I'm insane.

608
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:46,974
It's the sort of thing
an insane woman would do.

609
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,012
Besides, haven't you noticed how...

610
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:53,982
...oddly I've looked at you?

611
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:55,379
Have you?

612
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:58,787
How I've been staring at your eyes.

613
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:03,096
Your beautiful, blue,
frightened eyes.

614
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,393
Why are they so frightened?
Do you need help?

615
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,701
Do you want help from me?

616
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:12,136
I'm making you nervous.

617
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,106
You have every reason to be.

618
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,514
Because now I'm going
to attack you. Yes, attack.

619
00:39:20,785 --> 00:39:22,753
But it won't be for your beauty.

620
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,388
No, it's for these cigarettes.
Doctor, let me have one.

621
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,286
Of course. Help yourself.

622
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:31,894
You are good.

623
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,531
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

624
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:39,830
- Sent by my aunt?
- Yes.

625
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:43,898
- Because I didn't respond to treatment.
- So they say.

626
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:48,706
You have been invited to try your
hand at what is clearly a hopeless case.

627
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:50,007
Is it hopeless?

628
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,183
What do you think?

629
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:57,246
Where are you from?

630
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:58,515
Lions View.

631
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,294
The state asylum.

632
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:09,464
Where they have The Drum.

633
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:13,339
What you call "The Drum"
is not a torture chamber.

634
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,835
It's really a recreation hall.

635
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,247
They'll keep me there forever.

636
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,545
Like an animal in a cage.

637
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,288
She is merciless, isn't she?

638
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:27,490
Who?

639
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:30,488
Aunt Violet. Why else
do you think I'm here...

640
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,161
...where no one can see me, hear me?

641
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,762
You sound as if you
think she hates you.

642
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,526
Doesn't she?

643
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,201
Do you hate her?

644
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,795
What, hate?

645
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,473
No.

646
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,308
I don't understand what hate is.

647
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:49,411
I don't see how anyone could hate
and still be sane.

648
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,581
I really do think I am sane...

649
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,712
...despite considerable evidence
to the contrary.

650
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:59,546
Your aunt, Mrs. Venable...

651
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,089
Can no more help herself than I could.

652
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,795
Help herself? How do you mean?

653
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:08,132
You see, we all loved Sebastian.

654
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:12,666
Women, men, children, animal,
mineral, vegetable...

655
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,202
Sebastian was a vocation, not a man.

656
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:20,910
Poor Aunt Vi was hooked
from the beginning.

657
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:24,345
Loved Sebastian from the beginning
and nobody else.

658
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:27,054
She gave up everything for Sebastian.

659
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,516
Even her husband.

660
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,119
What was Mr. Venable like?

661
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:35,427
Mr. Venable was a good man...

662
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:38,391
...but dull to the point of genius.

663
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,630
That was Sebastian
you just heard talking.

664
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:45,806
He would've said that, and it
wouldn't have sounded cruel.

665
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,478
When I talk like him or when Aunt Vi
talks like him, we sound heartless.

666
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,807
And we're not really.

667
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,176
Though we do terrible things.

668
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,584
What do you consider terrible?

669
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:02,387
Aunt Vi let her husband die
because of Sebastian.

670
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:04,984
Killed him, some people thought.

671
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:07,891
How, killed him?

672
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:12,831
One summer, Sebastian decided
to give up the torments of this world...

673
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:16,470
...and become a Buddhist monk.
That was in Tibet in the Himalayas.

674
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:20,973
He shaved his head, was given a wooden
bowl to beg rice with and was happy.

675
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:22,975
Till Aunt Vi came.

676
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,875
Why? What did she do?

677
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:29,682
Lived in a hut, even took vows, or
whatever women do in such countries.

678
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,549
Anything to be near him, to get to him,
to make him come home.

679
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,828
While they were there, word came.

680
00:42:37,062 --> 00:42:40,293
Mr. Venable was dying.
He had to see her.

681
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,392
And she chose to stay?

682
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,098
She chose to let her husband
die alone.

683
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,943
If you'd known Sebastian, you'd
understand how she had no choice...

684
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:56,444
...how none of us ever had a choice,
once Sebastian had decided we were...

685
00:42:57,817 --> 00:42:59,410
...to be used.

686
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:00,779
Used?

687
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,688
You mean he used people?

688
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:05,416
Yes.

689
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,119
Isn't that what love is?
Using people?

690
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:15,297
And maybe that's what hate is.
Not being able to use people.

691
00:43:15,737 --> 00:43:17,761
- Go on.
- Go on where?

692
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:19,200
Anywhere.

693
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:23,205
To the first memory you come to.

694
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,004
My first memory?

695
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,617
It was once at a Mardi Gras ball.

696
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,482
The Mardi Gras ball? Yes?

697
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,421
My very first memory.

698
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,458
It was last spring.

699
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,190
Before last spring, I remember...

700
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,797
...nothing, nothing at all.

701
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:49,165
It's as if my life began
and ended that night.

702
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,410
Tell me about it.

703
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:57,172
At the ball...

704
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:03,776
I was taken there by some boy
who got too drunk to stand up.

705
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:07,286
I wanted to go home. My coat
was in the cloakroom.

706
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:11,553
They couldn't find the check for it
in his pocket. I said, "Let it go"...

707
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:13,765
...and started out for a taxi.

708
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,768
Then somebody took my arm and said:

709
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:19,698
"I'll drive you home."

710
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:25,407
As we left the hotel, he took off his
coat and put it around my shoulders...

711
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,441
...and then I looked at him.

712
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,550
I don't think I'd ever
seen him before then, really.

713
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:34,587
He took me home.

714
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:36,949
He took me another place first.

715
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,986
Near the Dueling Oaks at the end
of Esplanade Street.

716
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:45,689
We stopped. I asked what for.

717
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,457
He didn't answer.

718
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,000
Just struck a match
to light a cigarette...

719
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,732
...and I looked at him,
and I knew what for.

720
00:44:58,814 --> 00:45:03,342
I think I got out of the car before
he got out of the car, and we...

721
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:08,479
...walked through the wet grass
toward the great misty oaks as if...

722
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:12,290
...as if somebody were...

723
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:15,019
...calling for help there.

724
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:21,729
And after that?

725
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:28,201
I lost him.

726
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:32,342
He took me home.

727
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:35,982
Then he said an awful
thing to me. He said:

728
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:39,184
"We'd better forget it.

729
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:43,088
My wife's expecting a child."

730
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:50,425
I just entered the house
and sat there thinking a while.

731
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:56,372
Suddenly, I called a taxi and rushed
back to the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom.

732
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,577
The ball was still going on.

733
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:01,438
I thought I'd gone back
to pick up my borrowed coat.

734
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,549
But I hadn't. I hadn't gone back
for that at all.

735
00:46:05,784 --> 00:46:09,016
I'd gone back to make a scene
on the floor of the ballroom.

736
00:46:09,356 --> 00:46:13,259
I didn't pick up Aunt Violet's
old silver fox in the cloakroom.

737
00:46:13,693 --> 00:46:18,255
I rushed right into the ballroom,
spotted him on the floor...

738
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:21,066
...ran up to him and started to...

739
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:25,403
...beat him in the face and
the chest with my fists till...

740
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:31,569
...cousin Sebastian took me away.

741
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:35,705
Miss Catherine.

742
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:43,551
Miss Catherine.

743
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:48,524
She's here. Miss Catherine's here.

744
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:52,299
In spirit as well as flesh.

745
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:56,635
And now you want to play a game.
Look at pictures?

746
00:46:56,873 --> 00:47:01,436
Tell you the first thing that comes
into my mind, my poor deranged mind.

747
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:02,941
All right.

748
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:09,051
That shadow on the wall.
What does it look like to you?

749
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,448
Like a shadow on a wall.

750
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,716
I thought we were gonna play a game.

751
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:16,486
All right.

752
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:20,297
I see forests.

753
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,864
Trees, a girl.

754
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,562
And those trees are
the Dueling Oaks...

755
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:31,799
...and that tormented figure is
the girl, Catherine, losing her...

756
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:33,272
...honor.

757
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:36,780
I'm trying to make you
feel sorry for her.

758
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:38,214
I hope I am.

759
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:40,544
I am sorry.

760
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:43,813
I believe you really are.

761
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:50,090
Tell me about your cousin Sebastian.

762
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:54,992
He liked me, so I loved him.

763
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:58,399
How? I mean, in what way
did you love him?

764
00:47:59,306 --> 00:48:01,298
The only way he'd accept.

765
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,349
- I tried to save him, doctor.
- Save him from what?

766
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:15,756
Completing a sort of image
he had of himself as...

767
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:19,592
...a sort of a sacrifice to...

768
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:22,092
- ...a terrible sort of a...
- God?

769
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:27,694
Sebastian, who was gentle, kind...

770
00:48:27,937 --> 00:48:31,429
...saw something not gentle, not kind,
in the universe.

771
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:36,043
Something terrible in himself.

772
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:38,547
What was it?
Can you tell me?

773
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:42,916
- One day at Cabeza de Lobo...
- Where?

774
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:49,625
That's where we were last summer.
That's where...

775
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:52,322
That's where Sebastian died?

776
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,456
Yes.

777
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,162
How did he die?

778
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,604
They say a heart attack,
but I don't remember.

779
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,569
I really don't.

780
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:06,767
You see, afterwards,
I was hysterical, taut.

781
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:09,610
Said things I don't remember.

782
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,775
That's why I'm here.

783
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:15,487
Because I say things people don't...

784
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,622
...and then I don't even remember.

785
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:20,553
Try to remember.

786
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:28,459
You and Sebastian, last summer...

787
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:30,995
Try to remember.

788
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:42,815
The beach was very white.

789
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,449
Oh, how the sun burned.

790
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:52,386
It was like the eye of God watching us.

791
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,123
Burning, burning.

792
00:49:56,232 --> 00:49:58,496
There was no air that day.

793
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:01,567
The sun had burned up all the air.

794
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:06,769
Outside it was like inside a furnace.

795
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:13,512
- Then they came.
- Who came?

796
00:50:14,684 --> 00:50:16,948
From all parts of the beach.

797
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,850
And that awful noise they made.

798
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,720
The noise of musical instruments
all made of tin.

799
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:28,694
Who is "they"?

800
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,968
And that... That music.

801
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:37,036
That awful music.

802
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,801
I hear that music!

803
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,706
I still hear it!

804
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:47,612
It's getting closer and closer!

805
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:50,212
Sebastian!

806
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:59,497
- What happened? What happened then?
- I don't remember after that!

807
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,632
Stop that this minute.
Stop that noise.

808
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:05,430
- Doctor, I must see you at once.
- Get out of here.

809
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:09,341
Sister, get out and don't
come back until I call you.

810
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:19,752
I can't remember.

811
00:51:19,988 --> 00:51:24,117
- I can't remember!
- lt's all right.

812
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:26,027
Don't worry, it's all right.

813
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:28,889
But I have to, I want to!

814
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:30,563
Then you will.

815
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:32,356
Will you help me?

816
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,628
- lf you let me.
- Yes.

817
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,773
I shouldn't have done that.

818
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:44,809
Why not?
It was a friendly kiss, wasn't it?

819
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:47,605
Maybe it wasn't.

820
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,687
Maybe now you'll think
that all those...

821
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,890
...stories about the gardener are true.

822
00:51:54,124 --> 00:51:56,388
Whatever's true, we'll find.

823
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:14,835
I want you to know that
I can look attractive...

824
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:17,472
...if I had my hair done and if...

825
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:21,845
When I'm at Lions View,
may I wear a pretty dress?

826
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:23,521
If you like.

827
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:30,654
Just imagine, once again
to be able to do...

828
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,592
...one thing I'd like.

829
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:58,092
Come out here, son.
I want you to see something.

830
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:10,437
Take a good long look.
Tell me, what do you see?

831
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:15,010
Old tires, tin cans,
and a "Drink Nehi" sign.

832
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:17,075
That's the past you're looking at.

833
00:53:17,313 --> 00:53:19,873
Thanks to a certain young man
from Chicago...

834
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,483
...there'll be a new building
on that lot...

835
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,589
...devoted to psychosurgery, dedicated
to the memory of Sebastian Venable.

836
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:30,684
I wish I were that optimistic.

837
00:53:32,596 --> 00:53:35,327
I've been working with
the lawyers and accountants.

838
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,501
And we're getting, listen to this...

839
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:42,001
...in big, round, beautiful figures,
$1 million.

840
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,199
- Just like that, no strings attached?
- No strings attached.

841
00:53:46,444 --> 00:53:49,607
She wants you, and nobody else,
to do the operation on her niece.

842
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:53,079
You can't blame her for that.
There isn't anybody better.

843
00:53:55,153 --> 00:53:58,681
Something horrible happened
to that girl last summer.

844
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:04,090
Some dreadful, traumatic experience
of some kind.

845
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:05,490
What?

846
00:54:06,065 --> 00:54:08,261
I don't know.
I haven't found out yet.

847
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:12,164
And she refuses to allow herself
to remember.

848
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:15,535
She's gonna have to be made
to remember it.

849
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:18,209
Come in.

850
00:54:18,645 --> 00:54:20,204
Excuse me, Dr. Hockstader.

851
00:54:20,448 --> 00:54:23,507
Mrs. Holly and her son are here
to see the new patient.

852
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,183
Have them wait in my office, will you?

853
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:28,616
- How's Miss Catherine?
- She looks lovely.

854
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:32,815
She had her hair done this morning.
She's wearing her own clothes.

855
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,191
I've never seen clothes like
that girl's got. From Paris!

856
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:41,060
Thank you, Miss Benson.
I'll be along.

857
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:45,635
But she's a patient. You can't
let her wear her own clothes.

858
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,935
I put her in the nurses' wing.
I don't want her in the ward.

859
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:50,873
The nurses' wing?

860
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,510
I know I'm taking a risk...

861
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:57,016
...but for a while I don't want her
to feel she's a patient.

862
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:01,349
I want her to feel she's free of
restrictions, free of being watched.

863
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:02,888
This is very unorthodox.

864
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:05,284
So is insanity.
That's why we're here.

865
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:08,964
Your whole approach has little
to do with neurosurgery.

866
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,059
- For the time being.
- That's what this new building is for.

867
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:16,338
Dedicated to neurosurgery.

868
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:17,404
Yes, I know.

869
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:22,045
Mrs. Venable thinks you're prepared
to go ahead with the operation.

870
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:24,546
Yes, I know.

871
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:42,160
Cathy's in there?
George, hold me now.

872
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,499
I'm so nervous, I could jump
clear out of my skin.

873
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:47,866
Well, don't, Mama.

874
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:55,847
Kitten.

875
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,712
Miss Benson, why don't you
go to lunch now?

876
00:55:58,953 --> 00:55:59,816
Thank you, doctor.

877
00:56:00,053 --> 00:56:03,581
My poor baby. My angel.

878
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:07,386
- ln this place.
- lt's all right, Mama. I'm just fine.

879
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:10,598
Say, you look pretty good,
Cathy, considering.

880
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:14,269
- So do you, George, considering.
- We wanted to see you...

881
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:17,232
...but Violet said not while
you were at St. Mary's.

882
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:21,342
The doctors there didn't want
anybody to see you, so we didn't.

883
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:23,908
Oh, my, that's a pretty dress.

884
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,477
When did you get that, honey?

885
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,910
In Paris. Cousin Sebastian
bought it for me.

886
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,450
Yeah? I'm wearing one of his suits.

887
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:33,848
Yes, I recognize it.

888
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,149
Wasn't it sweet of Vi to give George
Sebastian's wardrobe?

889
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,658
Nothing else she
could have done with it.

890
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:43,628
It's the thought behind
the deed that matters.

891
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,196
Have you seen Aunt Vi recently?

892
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:49,304
Yes, we saw her last night.
At her house.

893
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,304
She invited us to
a little private supper.

894
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,011
She's had this elevator installed.

895
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,272
- Cutest little thing.
- We got business to talk about.

896
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:01,645
You know how children are,
how critical they are.

897
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,283
What did Aunt Vi say last night?

898
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:07,981
That you were in extremely
capable hands.

899
00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:11,218
And I can tell they are capable too.

900
00:57:11,463 --> 00:57:14,297
Mr. Brossard, the new lawyer we got...

901
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,298
Such a nice man too,
a tower of strength...

902
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:20,506
...in all these awful months
since Sebastian's been gone.

903
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,141
It nearly killed Violet.
I know, I was right there.

904
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:28,940
You didn't see her the way I did,
grieving like a madwoman.

905
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,985
I mean, like her heart would break.

906
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:37,281
He was her whole life.

907
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:39,788
She worshiped the ground
beneath his feet.

908
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:43,828
When she got this letter
from that place with the funny name...

909
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:44,963
What letter?

910
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,695
From the authorities, I suppose,
telling what happened to him at...

911
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:53,066
What was the name of that place?
Where he passed on?

912
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,069
- Cabeza de Lobo.
- That's it.

913
00:57:55,343 --> 00:57:56,971
- Did you see the letter?
- No.

914
00:57:57,213 --> 00:58:00,671
I guess it told all about how
he had this heart attack...

915
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,509
...and how Catherine was...

916
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:04,680
...not quite herself, poor baby.

917
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,946
I'm myself now.
Aren't l, doctor?

918
00:58:08,658 --> 00:58:09,921
Of course you are.

919
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:12,693
And don't you worry
about what people say.

920
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:15,865
Nobody in the city knows
what you've been through.

921
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:17,829
Do they, George?
Not a thing.

922
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:20,560
Nobody even knows you've
come back from Europe.

923
00:58:20,805 --> 00:58:22,669
When they question us...

924
00:58:22,906 --> 00:58:27,138
...we just say that you stayed abroad
to study something or other.

925
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,312
Can we talk to her alone?

926
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,277
Yes, on a little private
family matter.

927
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:36,682
Just some papers got to be signed.
Some business.

928
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:40,615
Is that all right with you?

929
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:44,990
Don't worry. Since I've been allowed
to smoke, I've become a perfect lamb.

930
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,393
My little girl was
always a perfect lamb.

931
00:58:50,836 --> 00:58:51,995
Thank you.

932
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:04,742
- Cathy, Sebastian left a will.
- A generous, thoughtful will.

933
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:08,546
He bequeathed to us, to you and to me,
$50,000 each...

934
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,585
...after taxes are paid.

935
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:14,056
- Sebastian always was very kind.
- lsn't that the truth?

936
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:15,625
There is a legal problem.

937
00:59:15,863 --> 00:59:20,163
It's very complicated, but
Mr. Brossard, this new lawyer, is...

938
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:24,498
- ...trying to get it through probate.
- Only it won't go through probate.

939
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,263
- Why not?
- Aunt Vi.

940
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:30,706
Well, you see, it has to do with you.
With your being ill.

941
00:59:31,646 --> 00:59:36,208
- She doesn't trust me with the money?
-50 grand is chicken feed to Aunt Vi.

942
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:39,979
- Then what is it?
- When you went off your rocker...

943
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:44,182
Shut up, Mama. Cathy's not
that far gone. Are you, Cathy?

944
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:47,955
- When I "went off my rocker"?
- Yeah. You said something.

945
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:50,632
You made up some crazy story
about Sebastian.

946
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:53,303
- When she heard whatever it was...
- Last night...

947
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:57,133
...not a word would she say
except that you babbled.

948
00:59:57,374 --> 01:00:01,436
That was her word for it. You "babbled"
some story about Sebastian...

949
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:04,807
- ...and how he lived and...
- Died...

950
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:08,310
...in a place called Cabeza de Lobo.

951
01:00:08,787 --> 01:00:11,517
What you said gave her a real turn.

952
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:16,591
When the doctors decided you were crazy,
she wanted you to stay at St. Mary's.

953
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:20,662
Or even right here. This seems
such a nice place too.

954
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,994
- With that nice, capable doctor.
- Go on.

955
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:27,131
Written permission was needed
to keep you here.

956
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:31,036
So that was the point
of the private supper.

957
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,172
You've got to understand.

958
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:36,177
This $100,000 is the most
important thing ever.

959
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:39,283
George will have all sorts
of advantages now.

960
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,650
Things we couldn't give, since 1929
killed your father and our nest egg.

961
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:46,792
Mother, you didn't sign those papers?

962
01:00:47,027 --> 01:00:50,326
- You didn't commit me to Lions View?
- Not yet.

963
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:54,296
But, Cathy, the way Aunt Vi put it,
there was no choice at all.

964
01:00:54,536 --> 01:00:55,866
Mama's got to sign.

965
01:00:56,103 --> 01:00:59,971
Besides, honey, it's not like
it was for always.

966
01:01:00,209 --> 01:01:03,076
They say in no time
after the little operation...

967
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,509
...you'll be able to...

968
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:10,047
What "little operation"?

969
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:14,119
Oh, Cathy! Oh, Cathy!

970
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:18,521
There's only one "little operation"
they perform here.

971
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:22,060
It's on the brain.
It's called a lobotomy.

972
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:25,199
You may have heard
or read about it. I have.

973
01:01:25,434 --> 01:01:28,564
It's that nice, young
doctor's specialty.

974
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:32,435
In cases of hopeless lunacy...

975
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:36,237
...he bores holes into the skull
and operates on the brain!

976
01:01:36,481 --> 01:01:40,473
Oh, honey, please don't
talk about it. Please!

977
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:44,780
- You can't let them!
- Stop. It's not the end of the world!

978
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:47,786
- Don't sign.
- They say it don't hurt at all.

979
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:50,722
- Don't let them!
- No worse than having your tonsils out.

980
01:01:50,962 --> 01:01:53,955
And then, afterwards,
you're all right again.

981
01:03:58,198 --> 01:04:00,063
Miss Catherine.

982
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:04,235
- Those faces!
- Look, for the love of...

983
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,441
- Get her back to her room.
- What are you doing here?

984
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,705
Doctor, we've just come
from your office.

985
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:18,282
- What is all that noise? Is it fire?
- What happened?

986
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,820
I don't know. We were having this
little chat about your treatment...

987
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:26,689
...and all of a sudden, she flew
out of the room and down the hall.

988
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:31,127
I'm sure it's the right thing,
what you and Violet are doing.

989
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,665
- lt is the right thing for her.
- Come on.

990
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:36,269
- We're so grateful to you.
- Come on.

991
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,131
Having you look after her...

992
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,741
Will you get me Dr. Van Vitch?

993
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,137
- Yes.
- Thank you.

994
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:49,479
I'm sorry they upset you.

995
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:53,248
Miss Catherine, don't ever run away.

996
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,616
Where will you cut, doctor?

997
01:04:56,828 --> 01:04:58,797
I'm not at all sure that I will.

998
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,521
Where will you cut my brain, doctor?

999
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:05,362
In front? Or further back?

1000
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:07,969
I suppose I'm to have my head shaved.

1001
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:12,840
It seems like a waste.
I just had my hair fixed this morning.

1002
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:16,047
Then to have it all cut off
right after it.

1003
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:18,575
I tell you, it's funny.

1004
01:05:20,453 --> 01:05:22,819
You were the one
who was going to help me.

1005
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:26,080
Help me!

1006
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:27,816
Don't talk like that.

1007
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:31,087
Why not?
Now I sound insane, don't I?

1008
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,266
- Are you trying to?
- No, and I'm not.

1009
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:37,061
You've got to believe me, doctor.
I am not.

1010
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:40,339
Insane is such a meaningless word.

1011
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:44,040
But lobotomy has a precise meaning,
hasn't it?

1012
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:49,181
Are you going to operate?
Tell me, please, are you going to?

1013
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:51,884
I don't know yet.

1014
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:56,287
Poor doctor.

1015
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:59,894
I bother you, don't I?

1016
01:06:00,563 --> 01:06:01,996
Yes, you do.

1017
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:04,758
Well, I'll try not to anymore.

1018
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:11,773
- Three cc, please.
- Yes, doctor.

1019
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,503
Must I take off my pretty dress?

1020
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:16,235
Of course not.

1021
01:06:20,752 --> 01:06:24,380
I want to help you.
Trust me.

1022
01:06:25,556 --> 01:06:27,387
I want to trust you.

1023
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:32,995
It seems to me that
I need help very much.

1024
01:06:41,273 --> 01:06:44,242
- His eyes are so blue.
- Who?

1025
01:06:44,643 --> 01:06:45,870
The doctor.

1026
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:49,546
Wonder why he isn't blond.

1027
01:06:49,782 --> 01:06:52,216
They usually are with eyes that blue.

1028
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:54,477
- I'm blond.
- Are you?

1029
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:58,486
Funny. We were going to blonds next.

1030
01:06:58,892 --> 01:07:01,292
Blonds were next on the menu.

1031
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:05,328
Now you just relax.
Let yourself go.

1032
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:11,663
All last summer, Sebastian was
famished for blonds.

1033
01:07:12,005 --> 01:07:14,064
Fed up with the dark ones.

1034
01:07:14,442 --> 01:07:16,603
Famished for blonds.

1035
01:07:17,143 --> 01:07:19,169
The travel brochures he picked up...

1036
01:07:19,413 --> 01:07:22,974
...were advertisements of blond,
northern countries.

1037
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:27,311
Think he'd already booked us
to Stockholm and Copenhagen.

1038
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:32,687
Fed up with the dark ones,
famished for the light ones.

1039
01:07:33,694 --> 01:07:37,597
That's the way he talked about people,
as if they were...

1040
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,328
...items on a menu.

1041
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:43,460
That one's delicious-looking.

1042
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,402
That one's appetizing.

1043
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,309
Or that one is not appetizing.

1044
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:55,573
I think really he was half-starved...

1045
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:59,118
...from living on pills and salads.

1046
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:02,454
You just relax now.

1047
01:08:06,897 --> 01:08:09,457
We'll fly north, little bird.

1048
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:14,832
It's what he called me sometimes.
Little bird.

1049
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:21,611
We'll walk under those radiant,
cold northern lights.

1050
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:27,043
I've never seen the aurora borealis.

1051
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:35,359
He never saw those northern lights.

1052
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:41,700
Who said, "We're all of us children...

1053
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:44,434
...in a vast kindergarten...

1054
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:48,000
...trying to spell God's name...

1055
01:08:48,242 --> 01:08:51,302
...with the wrong alphabet blocks"?

1056
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:15,236
Thank you.

1057
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:20,639
I do want to speak with you...

1058
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:24,643
Oh, this forgetfulness,
my greatest failing.

1059
01:09:24,882 --> 01:09:27,544
I have a little gift for you,
this book.

1060
01:09:27,784 --> 01:09:29,183
Thank you.

1061
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:32,815
- Poem of Summer.
- By my son, Sebastian Venable.

1062
01:09:33,057 --> 01:09:36,548
That volume contains one poem,
as do the others I have at home.

1063
01:09:36,793 --> 01:09:40,127
Each with the title Poem of Summer
and the date of the summer.

1064
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:42,958
If you like that one,
I'll bring you the others.

1065
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,895
He wrote one poem a year?

1066
01:09:45,136 --> 01:09:48,470
One for each summer
that we traveled together.

1067
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:52,742
The other nine months of the year
were only a preparation.

1068
01:09:52,977 --> 01:09:54,445
Nine months?

1069
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:56,612
The length of a pregnancy, yes.

1070
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,174
I gather the poem was hard to deliver.

1071
01:10:00,419 --> 01:10:01,409
Even with me.

1072
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,582
Without me, impossible.

1073
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:07,281
Doctor, he wrote no poem last summer.

1074
01:10:07,527 --> 01:10:08,687
He died last summer.

1075
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:10,691
Without me, he died.

1076
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:12,727
That was his last summer's poem.

1077
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,494
Mrs. Venable, how exactly
did your son die?

1078
01:10:19,372 --> 01:10:22,398
I told you, heart attack.

1079
01:10:22,642 --> 01:10:24,611
Is that what the letter said?

1080
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:29,009
How did Catherine know
I received a letter?

1081
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,514
Catherine? She knows very little.

1082
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,847
She can't remember.

1083
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:38,115
That's her illness. She was there,
but she can't remember.

1084
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:39,958
Mrs. Holly told me.

1085
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:44,565
You've seen her too?
I must say, you have been observing.

1086
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,325
There was no letter,
only a death certificate.

1087
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,298
- I'd like to see that.
- Why?

1088
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:51,270
I think it's important.

1089
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:54,271
I want to know what happened
the day your son died.

1090
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,904
You shall have it tomorrow.

1091
01:10:57,781 --> 01:11:01,444
And tomorrow you shall also have
the permission to operate.

1092
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:03,312
And now I'd better go.

1093
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:05,988
I've got lawyers waiting for me.

1094
01:11:06,223 --> 01:11:11,093
You'd think giving a building was
simple. I must sign papers till I drop.

1095
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:14,492
Not that I'm not used to it.
Sebastian never signed anything.

1096
01:11:14,732 --> 01:11:17,326
- He must have suspected...
- Mrs. Venable.

1097
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:19,393
Your son...

1098
01:11:20,404 --> 01:11:21,633
What about my son?

1099
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:25,701
What sort of personal life
did he have?

1100
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:28,345
He was chaste.

1101
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:30,412
You mean he was celibate?

1102
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,414
You don't believe me, do you?

1103
01:11:36,787 --> 01:11:39,188
- Do you believe that he never...?
- Never.

1104
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:41,756
As strictly as if he'd taken a vow.

1105
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:45,363
This sounds like vanity...

1106
01:11:45,598 --> 01:11:48,567
...but I was actually
the only one in his life...

1107
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:51,793
...that satisfied the demands
he made of people.

1108
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:54,734
My son would let people go,
dismiss them...

1109
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:58,035
...because their attitude toward
him was not...

1110
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:01,806
- As pure?
- As pure as my son, Sebastian, demanded.

1111
01:12:02,216 --> 01:12:04,207
Would you want to see Catherine?

1112
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:07,078
Is that wise?

1113
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,921
It might help me.

1114
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,521
But the lawyer.

1115
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,923
Surely you've kept the lawyer
waiting before.

1116
01:12:15,263 --> 01:12:16,787
Yes, I have.

1117
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:22,296
Such a strong,
such a persuasive doctor.

1118
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:42,888
She's been under sedation.
She's just coming out of it.

1119
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:46,558
She looks lovely, doesn't she?

1120
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,124
Doesn't she?

1121
01:12:57,575 --> 01:12:59,201
Where are we going?

1122
01:12:59,477 --> 01:13:00,637
His eyes.

1123
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:04,538
This one's eyes are so blue...

1124
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:07,410
...such strange, frightened...

1125
01:13:12,524 --> 01:13:15,982
I'm sorry. I must have been dreaming.

1126
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,391
Hello, Catherine.

1127
01:13:23,002 --> 01:13:26,962
I thought l... We would have
seen each other before this.

1128
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:30,240
At St. Mary's they wouldn't
let any of us see you.

1129
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:33,238
Mama was here today.

1130
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:37,946
It was today, wasn't it? I lose all
track of time with all these shots.

1131
01:13:38,185 --> 01:13:39,880
You look very well.

1132
01:13:40,454 --> 01:13:44,857
Mama told me how you got her
to agree to commit me here...

1133
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:46,650
...and then let them...

1134
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:49,089
She seems disturbed, doctor.

1135
01:13:49,463 --> 01:13:53,594
Aunt Violet! I am disturbed.

1136
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:57,399
Don't you think I have
every reason to be?

1137
01:13:58,174 --> 01:14:00,768
Forcing my mother
into signing a paper.

1138
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:03,806
I've never forced anybody
to do anything.

1139
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:05,514
Oh, yes, you have.

1140
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:06,874
Always.

1141
01:14:08,117 --> 01:14:10,984
And now you're holding
$100,000 under...

1142
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,122
...Mother and George's
poor greedy noses...

1143
01:14:14,357 --> 01:14:16,417
...to force her to sign a paper...

1144
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,150
...authorizing this doctor...

1145
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,132
I see no purpose in remaining here
listening to this.

1146
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:25,029
I'll wait for you in that sun room.

1147
01:14:57,837 --> 01:15:00,432
Doctor, I wanted to speak
to you alone.

1148
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,835
She wanted to see you again
before you left.

1149
01:15:04,644 --> 01:15:07,636
I didn't want to take your place
last summer.

1150
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:10,209
Please believe that, Aunt Vi.

1151
01:15:10,685 --> 01:15:12,948
But Sebastian insisted. He said...

1152
01:15:13,186 --> 01:15:16,281
...you weren't well enough
to travel with him.

1153
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:19,151
He couldn't travel alone,
so he insisted...

1154
01:15:19,392 --> 01:15:21,690
...that I go along with him
in your place.

1155
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:24,289
And he died last summer.

1156
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,895
Aunt Violet, would you like me
to tell you?

1157
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:53,793
You fell in love with Sebastian,
didn't you?

1158
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:57,330
I tried to give him what
you had always given him:

1159
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:00,230
The tender understanding
and love...

1160
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:05,407
My son and I had a rare and wonderful
love and trust between us.

1161
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,669
A contract, a covenant between us...

1162
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:10,404
- I know about the covenant.
- He broke it when...

1163
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:14,415
...he took her, not me, to travel
with him while he created his poem.

1164
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:18,186
Even when I was with him,
he would sometimes be frightened.

1165
01:16:18,423 --> 01:16:19,981
I'd know when and what of.

1166
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:23,718
I'd reach across a table to him
and touch his hands.

1167
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:28,194
Say not a word, just look,
and touch his hands with my hand.

1168
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:33,161
Then in the morning, the summer poem
would be continued...

1169
01:16:33,406 --> 01:16:34,930
...until it was finished.

1170
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,972
- I couldn't help him.
- Naturally. He was mine.

1171
01:16:38,212 --> 01:16:40,146
I knew how to help him.
You couldn't.

1172
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,573
- I tried.
- I'd say, "You will."

1173
01:16:41,815 --> 01:16:43,442
All right! I failed him.

1174
01:16:43,684 --> 01:16:47,518
I knew that the day we flew down
to Cabeza de Lobo from...

1175
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,722
...where he'd given off
writing his poem.

1176
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:53,519
- Because he had broken our...
- Yes, something had broken.

1177
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:57,093
- That string of pearls old mothers...
- Old?

1178
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:59,322
- ...hold their sons by.
- Hold them from death.

1179
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:01,398
No, life! Hold them from life!

1180
01:17:01,636 --> 01:17:04,162
What do you know?
You were the destroyer.

1181
01:17:04,406 --> 01:17:06,965
- We were life.
- You fed on life.

1182
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,938
Both of you. Taking!

1183
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:12,510
People were objects for your pleasure.

1184
01:17:12,747 --> 01:17:14,773
That's what you taught each other.

1185
01:17:15,017 --> 01:17:19,455
- You were superior to mere mortals.
- We needed no one but one another.

1186
01:17:20,122 --> 01:17:24,856
Sebastian only needed you
while you were still useful.

1187
01:17:25,095 --> 01:17:28,962
- Useful?
- I mean young, able to attract.

1188
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:31,030
She's babbling and lying.

1189
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,930
- He left her home because she lost...
- You stole him!

1190
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,071
Lost her attraction!

1191
01:17:36,306 --> 01:17:39,299
What would attraction have to do
with a son and a mother?

1192
01:17:39,543 --> 01:17:40,339
I'll tell you.

1193
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:44,172
- Can we stop these lies?
- Yes! Have my brain cut.

1194
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:45,780
This was a mistake.

1195
01:17:46,017 --> 01:17:48,781
The mistake was my going
with Sebastian.

1196
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:51,617
When he left her home,
she had a stroke.

1197
01:17:51,856 --> 01:17:52,788
Not a stroke!

1198
01:17:53,024 --> 01:17:54,754
A hysterical stroke.

1199
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:58,096
Sebastian left her home
like a toy he tired of.

1200
01:17:58,329 --> 01:18:01,356
And he took me with him
like a new toy.

1201
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,126
- On his last voyage.
- Lies.

1202
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,099
You see, doctor, we both...

1203
01:18:07,606 --> 01:18:09,542
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?

1204
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:12,870
For Sebastian.
He used us as bait!

1205
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:18,142
When she was no longer able to lure the
better fish into the net, he let her go.

1206
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:21,012
Bait for what?
What were the better fish?

1207
01:18:21,254 --> 01:18:23,052
We procured for him.

1208
01:18:23,723 --> 01:18:28,128
She used to do it in the fashionable
places they went before last summer.

1209
01:18:28,362 --> 01:18:30,297
Sebastian was shy with people.
She wasn't.

1210
01:18:30,765 --> 01:18:32,198
Neither was I.

1211
01:18:33,034 --> 01:18:35,662
But we both did the same
thing for him.

1212
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:38,398
We both made contacts for him.

1213
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,269
I can't listen to this obscenity.
Stop her, doctor.

1214
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:47,106
Cut the truth out of my brain.
Is that what you want?

1215
01:18:47,349 --> 01:18:50,751
You can't. Not even God
can change the truth.

1216
01:18:50,986 --> 01:18:52,454
We were nothing but a pair of...

1217
01:18:52,688 --> 01:18:54,212
- Doctor!
- lt's the truth!

1218
01:18:54,457 --> 01:18:56,550
See how she destroys us
with her tongue?

1219
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:59,158
Cut this hideous story
out of her brain.

1220
01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:03,363
How much are you willing
to pay for that?

1221
01:19:03,632 --> 01:19:06,329
Get me away from her.
Out of here.

1222
01:19:06,603 --> 01:19:08,070
Out of this...

1223
01:19:11,908 --> 01:19:15,401
- Nurse, some spirits of ammonia.
- Yes, doctor.

1224
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,613
- What happened?
- She fainted.

1225
01:19:17,849 --> 01:19:20,512
No. No, she didn't.

1226
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:22,643
Just a little...

1227
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:25,619
...dizziness, that's all.

1228
01:19:25,857 --> 01:19:29,588
Dr. Hockstader, would you
help me to my car?

1229
01:19:29,827 --> 01:19:31,591
I don't think that's
a good idea right now.

1230
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:34,731
Whether it is or not,
I'm going home.

1231
01:19:54,254 --> 01:19:57,155
Tomorrow, I want that girl
operated on.

1232
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:02,294
That decision belongs to the doctor
in charge, who is also the surgeon.

1233
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:06,761
I don't want to hear from you until
the operation has been performed.

1234
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,775
No! No!

1235
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:30,813
Please, no!

1236
01:22:36,461 --> 01:22:39,794
- You trying to ruin this hospital?
- You know better than that.

1237
01:22:40,031 --> 01:22:43,194
Can you imagine what would happen
to us if she'd jumped?

1238
01:22:43,435 --> 01:22:44,732
She was frightened. She...

1239
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,632
Patients are here
because they can't think.

1240
01:22:48,607 --> 01:22:50,541
After 24 hours observation...

1241
01:22:50,776 --> 01:22:55,179
During which she tried to kill herself,
incited the men's day room to a riot...

1242
01:22:55,414 --> 01:22:58,178
- She opened that door by mistake.
- While trying to get away.

1243
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:02,946
There was a riot, and she caused it.
Don't invent excuses for her.

1244
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:05,317
And from that Paris clinic...

1245
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:08,894
...delusions that the world
was devouring her...

1246
01:23:09,129 --> 01:23:11,690
...that she was raped by a man
with dueling pistols.

1247
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:14,560
- The Dueling Oaks.
- Here's more of her erotomania.

1248
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:17,134
At St. Mary's, they couldn't
keep her. And why?

1249
01:23:17,371 --> 01:23:19,669
Because of her obscenity and violence.

1250
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:22,398
She sexually attacked
a 60-year-old gardener.

1251
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:24,544
It was the other way around.

1252
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:28,078
She tried to burn one of the sisters
with a cigarette.

1253
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:30,944
She was provoked.
I was there, I saw it.

1254
01:23:31,185 --> 01:23:34,279
Provoked? Who would provoke
a disturbed patient?

1255
01:23:34,522 --> 01:23:35,922
You'd be surprised.

1256
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:38,718
And, to top it, she attempts suicide.

1257
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:42,225
Cogent proof of sanity,
wouldn't you say?

1258
01:23:42,832 --> 01:23:44,492
I need time.

1259
01:23:45,435 --> 01:23:47,732
When will you want the operating room?

1260
01:23:48,771 --> 01:23:51,639
I said I need more time.

1261
01:23:52,175 --> 01:23:53,574
I heard you.

1262
01:23:58,482 --> 01:24:02,043
Get me Dr. Glen Kilmer
at the Seattle Clinic.

1263
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:06,349
You know I want that
building as much as you do.

1264
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:08,251
I'll hold on.

1265
01:24:09,226 --> 01:24:14,061
Give me one more day to see if I can
break through that block to the truth.

1266
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:16,096
This is a medical emergency.

1267
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:17,632
I want to try something.

1268
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:20,929
I want to try something tomorrow,
at Mrs. Venable's.

1269
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,873
Why Mrs. Venable's?

1270
01:24:23,108 --> 01:24:27,169
I don't know. I feel somehow
that in that garden...

1271
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:31,440
...maybe in that jungle,
we might find...

1272
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:34,811
Look, you don't want Mrs. Venable
giving her money...

1273
01:24:35,053 --> 01:24:37,283
...to the Seattle Clinic, do you?

1274
01:24:37,523 --> 01:24:41,823
And you don't want anybody to be able
to say that we acted hastily...

1275
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:44,326
...or unethically, do you?

1276
01:24:46,734 --> 01:24:47,792
Cancel the call.

1277
01:24:48,837 --> 01:24:51,464
But be sure you know where
I can find Dr. Kilmer.

1278
01:25:25,775 --> 01:25:27,834
Mrs. Venable will be right down.

1279
01:25:28,244 --> 01:25:32,204
- The others are here, as you asked.
- Show them into the sun room, please.

1280
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:34,241
Of course, doctor.

1281
01:25:36,052 --> 01:25:37,212
Cathy, honey...

1282
01:25:37,454 --> 01:25:38,977
Later, Mrs. Holly.

1283
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:41,622
Doctor, I have the things you wanted.

1284
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,419
- ln the dining room.
- Oh, thank you.

1285
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:52,864
What's going on here?

1286
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:55,699
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Dr. Cukrowicz.

1287
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:59,104
I had to get those papers you wanted.
I mislay everything.

1288
01:25:59,577 --> 01:26:02,206
My son always said,
"Mother, if you..."

1289
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:06,915
What are you two doing here?
And where is Dr. Cukrowicz?

1290
01:26:07,153 --> 01:26:09,087
Why, I thought you invited us.

1291
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:11,950
Dr. Cukrowicz asked me
to ask them to come.

1292
01:26:12,892 --> 01:26:14,189
Of course.

1293
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,951
Dr. Hockstader...

1294
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:19,124
...I want you to meet
my sister-in-law, Mrs. Ho...

1295
01:26:19,366 --> 01:26:20,525
Where is Catherine?

1296
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,133
In the sun room.

1297
01:26:22,669 --> 01:26:25,764
Could Mrs. Holly and her son
wait for us in the garden?

1298
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:27,837
Of course. Foxhill?

1299
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:31,210
I don't know why everybody
is being so mysterious.

1300
01:26:31,445 --> 01:26:34,505
I brought you some of Sebastian's
papers. Odds and ends.

1301
01:26:34,749 --> 01:26:36,443
And this, the thing you wanted.

1302
01:26:36,684 --> 01:26:38,050
Your son's death certificate?

1303
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:41,949
- This must be painful for you.
- lf you don't read Spanish, I have...

1304
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,714
I read Spanish.

1305
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:46,622
Well, I have a translation.

1306
01:26:46,862 --> 01:26:48,557
As you see, there was no mystery...

1307
01:26:48,797 --> 01:26:51,823
...no matter what the girl said
at the time or any other time.

1308
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:54,628
It says the body was somewhat...

1309
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:57,130
...damaged in falling.
Where did he fall?

1310
01:26:57,373 --> 01:27:01,002
On the ground. Where else do you fall
when you die in the hot sun...

1311
01:27:01,245 --> 01:27:03,269
...in the street of some
godforsaken village?

1312
01:27:03,747 --> 01:27:04,941
Did you see his body?

1313
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:07,843
It was a primitive country.
The coffin came to us sealed.

1314
01:27:08,084 --> 01:27:09,177
Sealed?

1315
01:27:09,553 --> 01:27:10,781
Were there any rumors?

1316
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:14,184
There were no rumors.
His heart stopped and he fell.

1317
01:27:14,725 --> 01:27:17,524
I'll wait in the garden now.
That is where you want me?

1318
01:27:17,762 --> 01:27:19,353
Yes, if you will.

1319
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:21,794
Dr. Hockstader...

1320
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:25,031
...let me show you my son's garden.

1321
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:29,570
It's very unusual.
Like the dawn of Creation.

1322
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:34,346
Sebastian's garden.

1323
01:27:36,515 --> 01:27:38,574
I can still cry.

1324
01:27:40,018 --> 01:27:41,783
Am I dreaming this?

1325
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:44,112
It doesn't seem real.

1326
01:27:46,593 --> 01:27:50,962
Would you take off your jacket?
It's time for another injection.

1327
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:54,063
What is it this time?

1328
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:56,300
Something different.

1329
01:27:56,536 --> 01:27:57,731
The truth serum?

1330
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,963
Yes, except there is no such thing.

1331
01:28:01,308 --> 01:28:02,571
As truth?

1332
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,037
Or the truth serum?

1333
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,242
There is truth, all right.

1334
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:07,606
Somewhere.

1335
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,379
Sit down.

1336
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,517
And now you want me to start
counting backwards from 100?

1337
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:21,462
- Do you enjoy counting backwards?
- Oh, I love it. Just love it.

1338
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,965
100...

1339
01:28:26,202 --> 01:28:28,169
...99, 98...

1340
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,564
...97...

1341
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:31,132
...96...

1342
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:32,807
...95...

1343
01:28:35,912 --> 01:28:37,937
I feel it already.

1344
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:39,112
How funny.

1345
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,249
Close your eyes for a minute.

1346
01:28:54,298 --> 01:28:56,528
I want you to give me something.

1347
01:28:56,767 --> 01:28:58,861
You name it, it's yours.

1348
01:28:59,638 --> 01:29:01,697
I want you to give me
all your resistance.

1349
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:04,141
Resistance? To what?

1350
01:29:04,609 --> 01:29:05,438
To the truth.

1351
01:29:06,778 --> 01:29:09,906
Truth is the one thing
I have never resisted.

1352
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:13,149
People think they don't resist it,
but they still do.

1353
01:29:13,552 --> 01:29:15,382
Sebastian said:

1354
01:29:16,088 --> 01:29:19,888
"Truth is at the bottom
of a bottomless well."

1355
01:29:21,395 --> 01:29:22,691
Why did...?

1356
01:29:25,731 --> 01:29:27,359
Open your eyes.

1357
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,499
Why did you try to kill yourself?

1358
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,767
Isn't that what everybody wants?

1359
01:29:36,009 --> 01:29:37,738
Me out of the way?

1360
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:40,843
Mother and George
would get their money.

1361
01:29:41,081 --> 01:29:43,073
You'd get your building.

1362
01:29:43,317 --> 01:29:44,578
Aunt Vi...

1363
01:29:45,353 --> 01:29:46,513
Go on.

1364
01:29:48,057 --> 01:29:50,456
You know what I think
you're trying to do?

1365
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,188
I think you're trying
to hypnotize me.

1366
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,697
You're looking at me so...

1367
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:58,228
...straight.

1368
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:03,164
You're doing something strange
to me with your eyes.

1369
01:30:03,404 --> 01:30:04,303
Your eyes.

1370
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,034
- ls that what you're doing?
- ls that what you feel I'm doing?

1371
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:09,702
I feel...

1372
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:11,345
...peculiar.

1373
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:16,783
It doesn't just have to do
with what you gave me.

1374
01:30:20,657 --> 01:30:22,489
I'm putting out my hands.

1375
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:27,164
I want you to put your hands into mine
and give me all your resistance.

1376
01:30:27,397 --> 01:30:31,198
Pass all the resistance
from your hands into mine.

1377
01:30:32,837 --> 01:30:34,600
Here are my hands...

1378
01:30:35,372 --> 01:30:37,169
...but there's no resistance in them.

1379
01:30:37,608 --> 01:30:38,906
You'll tell the true story?

1380
01:30:39,745 --> 01:30:41,576
Yes, I'll try.

1381
01:30:42,047 --> 01:30:44,880
Nothing not spoken.
Everything told exactly?

1382
01:30:45,317 --> 01:30:47,342
Everything exactly.

1383
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,449
Because I have to.

1384
01:30:56,495 --> 01:30:57,485
Can I...?

1385
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,021
Can I get up?

1386
01:30:59,264 --> 01:31:02,826
Yes, of course, but be careful.
You'll feel a little dizzy.

1387
01:31:04,504 --> 01:31:05,836
I can't.

1388
01:31:09,009 --> 01:31:10,533
Tell me to.

1389
01:31:11,245 --> 01:31:12,770
Then I think I could.

1390
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:14,377
Stand up.

1391
01:31:22,023 --> 01:31:23,490
Now I can.

1392
01:31:24,392 --> 01:31:27,827
- Oh, I'm dizzy. Help me.
- lt's all right. You're all right.

1393
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,300
Hold me.

1394
01:31:33,668 --> 01:31:35,795
I've been so lonely.

1395
01:31:40,309 --> 01:31:41,570
Let me.

1396
01:31:41,845 --> 01:31:42,970
Let me.

1397
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,420
I suggest you bring her outside,
if you don't mind, doctor.

1398
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:56,353
We'll be right out.

1399
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:05,225
Are you ready?

1400
01:32:20,419 --> 01:32:22,080
Hello, Catherine.

1401
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,588
Now, Catherine...

1402
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:27,384
...you're going to tell
the true story.

1403
01:32:27,726 --> 01:32:29,091
Where do I start?

1404
01:32:29,327 --> 01:32:31,387
Wherever you think it started.

1405
01:32:32,031 --> 01:32:33,759
I think it started...

1406
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,264
...the day Sebastian was born
in this house.

1407
01:32:36,501 --> 01:32:37,696
- Cathy.
- I don't mind.

1408
01:32:37,937 --> 01:32:42,568
Let's start later than that.
Why don't we begin with last summer?

1409
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:43,936
Last summer?

1410
01:32:44,178 --> 01:32:46,373
Last summer. How did it begin?

1411
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:48,247
It began...

1412
01:32:48,782 --> 01:32:50,181
...after the Dueling Oaks.

1413
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:54,581
- Don't tell about that, Cathy...
- Mrs. Holly, don't interrupt.

1414
01:32:55,456 --> 01:32:57,515
After that happened...

1415
01:32:57,825 --> 01:33:00,988
...the next morning,
I started writing my diary...

1416
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:03,390
...in the third person singular
such as:

1417
01:33:03,632 --> 01:33:06,829
"She is still living this morning."

1418
01:33:07,335 --> 01:33:09,462
Meaning that I was.

1419
01:33:09,704 --> 01:33:13,106
"What's next for her? God knows."

1420
01:33:13,643 --> 01:33:16,543
I couldn't go out anywhere.

1421
01:33:16,778 --> 01:33:19,043
That's true.
She wouldn't leave her room.

1422
01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:20,647
Shut up, Mama.

1423
01:33:20,883 --> 01:33:22,145
I would write:

1424
01:33:22,818 --> 01:33:24,547
"She woke up early this morning.

1425
01:33:25,187 --> 01:33:28,020
She had her coffee, dressed...

1426
01:33:28,257 --> 01:33:29,690
...went for a brief walk."

1427
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:32,254
- Who did?
- She did.

1428
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:35,193
I did.

1429
01:33:36,466 --> 01:33:38,935
From the Esplanade
to Canal Street...

1430
01:33:39,169 --> 01:33:42,434
...as though being pursued
by a pack of Siberian wolves.

1431
01:33:43,173 --> 01:33:47,303
Went through all the stop signs.
Couldn't wait for the green signals.

1432
01:33:47,911 --> 01:33:52,474
"Where did she think she was going,
back to the Dueling Oaks?"

1433
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,550
Everything...

1434
01:33:57,021 --> 01:33:59,012
...chilly and dim.

1435
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:01,725
But that hot...

1436
01:34:02,128 --> 01:34:03,253
...ravenous mouth.

1437
01:34:03,963 --> 01:34:06,090
He was a very ordinary married man.

1438
01:34:06,565 --> 01:34:07,533
And then?

1439
01:34:09,301 --> 01:34:13,033
One morning, cousin Sebastian
came in and said, "Get up."

1440
01:34:13,305 --> 01:34:15,866
Well, if you're still alive
after dying...

1441
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:18,202
...then you're obedient. I got up.

1442
01:34:18,678 --> 01:34:22,580
He took me downtown to a place
where they take passport photos.

1443
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:25,251
He said, "Mother can't go abroad
with me this summer.

1444
01:34:25,585 --> 01:34:28,487
You're going to go with me
this summer instead of Mother."

1445
01:34:28,723 --> 01:34:32,659
- Except that it was her idea, not his.
- Mrs. Venable.

1446
01:34:33,527 --> 01:34:34,722
And your cousin?

1447
01:34:35,463 --> 01:34:37,954
He helped bring me back to life...

1448
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:40,929
...in Paris, Barcelona, Rome.

1449
01:34:41,169 --> 01:34:45,003
All those lovely foreign cities
I'd never seen, we saw together.

1450
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,207
And those...

1451
01:34:46,441 --> 01:34:48,068
What did he call them?

1452
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,279
Those sunshine days...

1453
01:34:50,512 --> 01:34:54,141
...where it's always noon,
and we cast no shadows.

1454
01:34:54,383 --> 01:34:55,180
But then...

1455
01:34:55,585 --> 01:34:56,677
But then what?

1456
01:34:57,386 --> 01:34:58,717
At Amalfi...

1457
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:03,851
...high above the Mediterranean,
in a garden, I took his arm.

1458
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,457
You took his arm. Yes?

1459
01:35:06,696 --> 01:35:09,928
It seemed like such a natural thing
to do, but he pulled away.

1460
01:35:10,299 --> 01:35:13,531
How he must have loathed
being touched by her.

1461
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:18,203
I only did it to try and show
my appreciation for his kindness.

1462
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:19,967
I didn't want to...

1463
01:35:20,711 --> 01:35:22,703
There was nothing else.

1464
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:25,914
Anyway...

1465
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:28,884
...it was there in Amalfi...

1466
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:33,079
...suddenly, last summer, that
he began to be restless and...

1467
01:35:34,059 --> 01:35:35,287
Go on.

1468
01:35:37,596 --> 01:35:39,187
He couldn't go on.

1469
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,762
He couldn't write his summer poem.

1470
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:45,102
I have his notebook here. See?

1471
01:35:45,338 --> 01:35:49,398
Title, "Poem of Summer."
And the date of the summer. 1937.

1472
01:35:49,642 --> 01:35:53,670
And after that, blank pages,
blank pages. Nothing but nothing.

1473
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,109
A poet's vocation rests
on something...

1474
01:35:56,349 --> 01:35:58,442
...as fine and thin
as the web of a spider.

1475
01:35:58,985 --> 01:36:01,147
It's all that holds him
out of destruction.

1476
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,356
Very few are able to do it alone.

1477
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:06,081
Great help is needed.
I did give it. She didn't.

1478
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:08,726
She's right about that.
I failed him.

1479
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:11,022
I wasn't able to keep
the web from breaking.

1480
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,392
I saw it breaking,
but I couldn't save it.

1481
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:17,570
Now the truth's coming out. Maybe
she'll admit what really happened.

1482
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,872
What did happen?

1483
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:21,041
How she killed him.

1484
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:24,006
How she murdered him
at Cabeza de Lobo. Ask her.

1485
01:36:29,485 --> 01:36:31,351
What did really happen?

1486
01:36:31,888 --> 01:36:34,219
Suddenly, last summer...

1487
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,482
...he wasn't young anymore.

1488
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:38,489
We went to Cabeza de Lobo...

1489
01:36:38,995 --> 01:36:41,828
...and suddenly, he switched
from the evenings to the beach.

1490
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:43,498
From the evenings to the beach?

1491
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:48,302
I mean, from the evenings
to the afternoons.

1492
01:36:48,538 --> 01:36:52,669
Suddenly, cousin Sebastian changed
to the afternoons in the beach.

1493
01:36:53,077 --> 01:36:55,875
What kind of a beach was it?
Was it a public beach?

1494
01:36:56,113 --> 01:36:57,672
Yes, public.

1495
01:36:57,915 --> 01:37:00,509
It's little statements like that
that give her away.

1496
01:37:01,385 --> 01:37:05,254
After all I've told you about his
fastidiousness, can you accept that...

1497
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:09,221
...Sebastian would go to some dirty,
free public beach near a harbor?

1498
01:37:09,461 --> 01:37:12,590
Whatever she wants to say,
I want her to say it.

1499
01:37:13,266 --> 01:37:14,357
Go on.

1500
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:17,492
I don't want to go on.

1501
01:37:17,736 --> 01:37:22,366
Every afternoon, you and your cousin
would go to this free public beach?

1502
01:37:23,042 --> 01:37:27,240
It wasn't the free one.
The free one was right next to it.

1503
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,847
There was a fence
between the free beach...

1504
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:33,108
...and the beach that we went to
that charged admission.

1505
01:37:33,686 --> 01:37:35,745
Did anything happen there
that disturbed you?

1506
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,920
- Yes.
- What?

1507
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:42,560
He bought me a bathing suit
I didn't want to wear.

1508
01:37:42,796 --> 01:37:44,765
I laughed.
I said, "I can't wear that.

1509
01:37:44,998 --> 01:37:48,195
Why, it's a scandal
to the jaybirds."

1510
01:37:48,436 --> 01:37:50,700
What do you mean?
Was this suit immodest?

1511
01:37:50,939 --> 01:37:55,172
It was a one-piece bathing suit.
Made of white something.

1512
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,571
But the water made it transparent.

1513
01:37:57,813 --> 01:38:00,577
I told him I didn't want
to swim in it...

1514
01:38:00,816 --> 01:38:04,308
...but he just grabbed my hand
and dragged me into the water...

1515
01:38:04,552 --> 01:38:06,282
...all the way in...

1516
01:38:06,522 --> 01:38:09,423
...and I came out looking naked.

1517
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:13,219
Why did he do that?
Do you know why he did that?

1518
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:14,952
Yes.

1519
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:17,324
To attract attention.

1520
01:38:17,566 --> 01:38:19,626
Why? Because he thought
you were lonely?

1521
01:38:19,869 --> 01:38:22,770
Did he think he could shock you
out of your depression?

1522
01:38:23,707 --> 01:38:27,336
You know why I was doing it.
I told you.

1523
01:38:27,577 --> 01:38:30,103
I was procuring for him.

1524
01:38:31,515 --> 01:38:34,644
Sebastian was lonely, doctor.

1525
01:38:34,886 --> 01:38:39,288
That empty blue jay notebook
got bigger and bigger.

1526
01:38:39,523 --> 01:38:42,117
So big, it was big and empty...

1527
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,024
...like that big, empty, blue sea
and sky.

1528
01:38:48,434 --> 01:38:52,767
And before long, when the weather
was warmer and the beach so crowded...

1529
01:38:53,005 --> 01:38:55,667
...he didn't need me anymore
for that purpose.

1530
01:38:56,476 --> 01:39:01,071
The ones from the free beach climbed
over the fence or swam around it.

1531
01:39:01,948 --> 01:39:06,077
So now he let me wear
a decent dark suit.

1532
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:09,447
I'd go to a faraway end of
the beach and write post cards...

1533
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:13,181
...and letters and keep up
my third person journal...

1534
01:39:13,426 --> 01:39:17,523
...till it was time to meet him
outside the bathhouses on the street.

1535
01:39:18,299 --> 01:39:20,233
He would come out...

1536
01:39:20,468 --> 01:39:21,297
...followed.

1537
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:23,628
Who'd follow him?

1538
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:28,638
The hungry young people that climbed
over the fence from the free beach.

1539
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:32,539
He'd pass out tips among them,
as if they'd all...

1540
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:36,650
...shined his shoes
or called taxis for him.

1541
01:39:36,885 --> 01:39:39,479
Each day the crowd got bigger...

1542
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:42,714
...noisier, greedier.

1543
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:46,121
At last, we stopped going out there.

1544
01:39:46,362 --> 01:39:50,162
And after that? After you stopped
going to the public beach?

1545
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:51,628
Then one day...

1546
01:39:51,868 --> 01:39:56,395
...a few days after we'd stopped
going out to the beach...

1547
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:59,632
...it was a blazing white day.

1548
01:39:59,876 --> 01:40:04,370
Not a blazing hot, blue day,
but a blazing hot, white one.

1549
01:40:05,049 --> 01:40:09,314
We had a late lunch at a shabby,
lonely restaurant by the sea there.

1550
01:40:09,553 --> 01:40:11,919
Sebastian was white as the weather.

1551
01:40:12,156 --> 01:40:17,059
He had on a white silk suit,
a white tie, a white Panama.

1552
01:40:17,394 --> 01:40:21,422
And he kept touching his face
and his throat here and there...

1553
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:23,726
...with a white silk handkerchief...

1554
01:40:23,969 --> 01:40:26,904
...and popping little white pills
into his mouth all the time.

1555
01:40:27,139 --> 01:40:31,167
I knew he was having a bad time with
his heart and that it frightened him.

1556
01:40:31,411 --> 01:40:33,310
"Let's go north," he kept on saying.

1557
01:40:33,545 --> 01:40:37,675
"I think we've done Cabeza de Lobo.
I think we've done it, don't you?"

1558
01:40:37,917 --> 01:40:39,316
I thought we'd done it.

1559
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:42,716
Then there were those children
along the beach...

1560
01:40:42,956 --> 01:40:46,653
...which was fenced off with wire
from the restaurant.

1561
01:40:46,893 --> 01:40:51,057
Our table was less than a yard away
from the wire fence.

1562
01:40:51,297 --> 01:40:54,290
And those children...

1563
01:40:54,535 --> 01:40:56,002
There was a band of them.

1564
01:40:56,237 --> 01:40:58,432
They looked like a flock
of plucked birds...

1565
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:01,140
...and they came darting up
to the wire fence...

1566
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:03,401
...as if they'd been blown
there by the wind...

1567
01:41:03,645 --> 01:41:06,613
...by the hot, white wind
from the sea.

1568
01:41:06,848 --> 01:41:10,374
They were all calling out,
"Pan! Pan! Pan!"

1569
01:41:10,618 --> 01:41:12,211
They were calling for bread?

1570
01:41:12,454 --> 01:41:15,082
They made gobbling noises
with their mouths...

1571
01:41:15,323 --> 01:41:18,156
...stuffing their fists
into their mouths and making...

1572
01:41:18,393 --> 01:41:21,795
...gobbling noises
with frightful grins.

1573
01:41:22,898 --> 01:41:27,165
We were sorry we'd come to the place,
but it was too late to go.

1574
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:29,097
Why was it too late to go?

1575
01:41:29,338 --> 01:41:31,568
I told you. Cousin Sebastian
wasn't well.

1576
01:41:31,808 --> 01:41:34,538
His eyes looked dazed.

1577
01:41:34,778 --> 01:41:37,838
But he said, "Don't look
at those little monsters.

1578
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:40,380
Beggars are a social disease
in this country.

1579
01:41:40,617 --> 01:41:42,983
If you look at them, you'll
get sick of the country.

1580
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:45,985
It spoils the whole country for you."

1581
01:41:47,357 --> 01:41:48,518
Go on.

1582
01:41:51,462 --> 01:41:52,724
Go on.

1583
01:41:57,001 --> 01:41:58,161
Go on.

1584
01:41:59,205 --> 01:42:01,605
I am going on.

1585
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:05,333
The band of children began
to serenade us.

1586
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:08,046
- Began to what?
- Play for us on instruments...

1587
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:11,978
...make music, if you
could call it music.

1588
01:42:12,219 --> 01:42:16,552
Their instruments were the instruments
of percussion, do you know what I mean?

1589
01:42:16,789 --> 01:42:19,622
Yes, instruments of percussion,
like drums.

1590
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:24,660
As far as I could make out in
the white blaze of the sand beach...

1591
01:42:24,898 --> 01:42:28,699
...the instruments were tin cans
strung together...

1592
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:31,461
...and bits of metal,
other bits of metal...

1593
01:42:31,706 --> 01:42:34,834
...that had been flattened out
and made into...

1594
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:36,134
Into what?

1595
01:42:36,377 --> 01:42:37,366
Cymbals, you know?

1596
01:42:37,612 --> 01:42:39,171
Yes, brass plates hit together.

1597
01:42:39,414 --> 01:42:40,539
That's right.

1598
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:44,980
Tin cans flattened out
and clashed together. Cymbals.

1599
01:42:45,686 --> 01:42:49,646
The others had other things.
All sorts of things.

1600
01:42:49,892 --> 01:42:54,796
Things that they'd made or picked up
on the beach to make a sort of noise.

1601
01:42:55,898 --> 01:42:58,662
A music made out of noise.

1602
01:42:58,901 --> 01:42:59,732
Go on.

1603
01:42:59,968 --> 01:43:02,335
I am going on.
Nothing could stop me now.

1604
01:43:02,572 --> 01:43:06,508
Your cousin Sebastian, was he
entertained by this concert?

1605
01:43:06,743 --> 01:43:08,870
- Terrified of it.
- Terrified, why?

1606
01:43:09,112 --> 01:43:12,776
I think he recognized some
of the musicians.

1607
01:43:13,017 --> 01:43:14,313
Some of the boys.

1608
01:43:15,151 --> 01:43:17,415
Between childhood and older.

1609
01:43:17,655 --> 01:43:20,385
What did he do?
Did he complain to the manager?

1610
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:22,421
What manager? God?

1611
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:24,252
You don't understand my cousin.

1612
01:43:24,762 --> 01:43:25,729
How do you mean?

1613
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,295
He accepted all as how things are...

1614
01:43:31,536 --> 01:43:36,439
...and thought nobody had any right
to complain or interfere whatsoever.

1615
01:43:36,676 --> 01:43:40,305
Even though he knew what
was awful was awful...

1616
01:43:40,546 --> 01:43:42,570
...what was wrong was wrong.

1617
01:43:42,814 --> 01:43:47,480
He thought it unfitting to ever take
any action about anything whatsoever...

1618
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:51,315
...except to go on doing
as something in him directed.

1619
01:43:51,557 --> 01:43:54,526
What did this something in him
direct him to do?

1620
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,959
He suddenly pushed himself
away from the table and said:

1621
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:02,191
"They've got to stop that.
Make them stop. I'm not a well man.

1622
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:05,564
I have a heart condition.
It's making me sick."

1623
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:09,207
That was the first time that cousin
Sebastian had ever attempted...

1624
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:12,072
...to correct a human situation.

1625
01:44:12,313 --> 01:44:17,047
I think that
that was his fatal error.

1626
01:44:17,285 --> 01:44:21,779
He stalked out of the restaurant after
throwing paper money on the table.

1627
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:24,185
He fled from the place.

1628
01:44:24,426 --> 01:44:25,392
I followed.

1629
01:44:25,627 --> 01:44:30,065
It was all white outside.

1630
01:44:30,299 --> 01:44:32,631
White hot. A blazing white hot, it...

1631
01:44:32,869 --> 01:44:36,929
You followed Sebastian out of the
restaurant onto that hot, white street?

1632
01:44:37,172 --> 01:44:38,470
Running along the beach...

1633
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:41,643
- You ran along the beach?
- No, no. We didn't.

1634
01:44:41,878 --> 01:44:43,437
We didn't move either way.

1635
01:44:45,883 --> 01:44:50,319
I rarely made any suggestion,
but this time I did.

1636
01:44:50,554 --> 01:44:52,145
What did you suggest?

1637
01:44:52,389 --> 01:44:56,224
Cousin Sebastian seemed to be paralyzed
near the entrance at the café.

1638
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:59,486
So I said, "Let's go."
I remember I said:

1639
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:03,722
"Down that way is the harbor, and we're
more likely to find a taxi near there.

1640
01:45:03,969 --> 01:45:07,132
Or why don't we go back in
and have them call us a taxi?

1641
01:45:07,372 --> 01:45:09,897
Oh, let's do! Let's do that.
That's better."

1642
01:45:10,142 --> 01:45:14,339
And he said, "Are you mad?
Go back in that filthy place? Never!

1643
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:18,345
That gang of kids shouted vile
things about me to the waiters."

1644
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:21,347
I said, "Well, let's go down
towards the harbor.

1645
01:45:21,586 --> 01:45:26,286
Let's not try to climb that hill
in this dreadful heat."

1646
01:45:26,525 --> 01:45:29,222
And cousin Sebastian shouted,
"Please shut up!

1647
01:45:29,462 --> 01:45:33,524
Let me handle this situation, will
you? I want to handle this thing."

1648
01:45:34,934 --> 01:45:39,372
And he started up the steep street
with a hand stuck in his jacket...

1649
01:45:39,606 --> 01:45:43,668
...where I knew he was having
a pain from his palpitations.

1650
01:45:43,912 --> 01:45:48,678
But he walked faster
and faster in panic.

1651
01:45:48,917 --> 01:45:50,509
The faster he walked...

1652
01:45:50,752 --> 01:45:53,778
...the louder and the closer it got.

1653
01:45:54,022 --> 01:45:55,148
Closer what got?

1654
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,823
The music!

1655
01:45:57,058 --> 01:45:57,990
The music again?

1656
01:45:58,226 --> 01:45:59,592
The music!

1657
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:02,263
The noise of the following band.

1658
01:46:02,498 --> 01:46:05,797
They were following.
They were following...

1659
01:46:06,035 --> 01:46:08,697
...up the blazing white street.

1660
01:46:08,938 --> 01:46:13,341
Up. Straight up. That was the only
way open, so he went that way.

1661
01:46:13,677 --> 01:46:16,441
He tried to escape from those streets?

1662
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,912
He tried to escape
from those streets...

1663
01:46:21,151 --> 01:46:22,448
But he couldn't find a way out?

1664
01:46:22,686 --> 01:46:26,087
He couldn't find a way out.

1665
01:46:26,324 --> 01:46:28,348
Did the band of children...?

1666
01:46:28,593 --> 01:46:31,619
When he tried to escape...

1667
01:46:32,028 --> 01:46:33,757
...from those streets...

1668
01:46:34,499 --> 01:46:38,868
...down those little side streets,
between the buildings...

1669
01:46:39,103 --> 01:46:41,593
...they came from everywhere.

1670
01:46:41,839 --> 01:46:44,239
So the only way was up.

1671
01:46:44,476 --> 01:46:46,466
The only way was straight up...

1672
01:46:46,711 --> 01:46:48,645
...up those steep, white streets...

1673
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:53,477
...in the sun, that was like a great
white bone of a giant beast...

1674
01:46:53,719 --> 01:46:55,551
...that had caught on fire in the sky.

1675
01:46:55,789 --> 01:46:58,189
And Sebastian kept running straight up.

1676
01:46:58,424 --> 01:47:00,756
I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran...

1677
01:47:00,994 --> 01:47:03,462
...but he ran and he ran and he ran...

1678
01:47:03,696 --> 01:47:06,165
...where it was whiter and emptier.

1679
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:07,764
What was emptier?

1680
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:11,402
The light... The sky and the light.

1681
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:16,542
Those steep, white streets and the sun,
and everything blazed white and empty.

1682
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:19,570
Where did those streets lead to?

1683
01:47:19,814 --> 01:47:20,838
Nowhere!

1684
01:47:21,081 --> 01:47:21,979
He never reached...?

1685
01:47:22,216 --> 01:47:26,881
He never reached the end.
They stopped nowhere! Never!

1686
01:47:27,122 --> 01:47:29,590
Except, except...

1687
01:47:29,825 --> 01:47:31,621
Except?

1688
01:47:32,027 --> 01:47:34,426
At the very top of the hill.

1689
01:47:34,663 --> 01:47:39,157
Something. A place, a ruin.

1690
01:47:39,401 --> 01:47:41,335
Broken stones. Like...

1691
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:42,663
Like what?

1692
01:47:42,905 --> 01:47:46,432
Like the entrance...

1693
01:47:46,676 --> 01:47:50,441
...to a ruined temple...

1694
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,343
...some ancient ruined temple...

1695
01:47:54,584 --> 01:47:57,348
...which he entered.

1696
01:48:02,025 --> 01:48:03,857
And they overtook him.

1697
01:48:06,362 --> 01:48:08,763
There in that...

1698
01:48:08,999 --> 01:48:11,935
And you, Catherine,
what did you do then?

1699
01:48:13,238 --> 01:48:15,536
I heard Sebastian scream.

1700
01:48:19,543 --> 01:48:21,876
He screamed just once.

1701
01:48:23,348 --> 01:48:24,542
Then I...

1702
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:32,648
Help!

1703
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:37,891
Help!

1704
01:48:39,098 --> 01:48:40,498
And then? Then?

1705
01:48:40,733 --> 01:48:42,997
I ran. They let me run.

1706
01:48:43,236 --> 01:48:44,533
They didn't even see me.

1707
01:48:44,771 --> 01:48:45,566
Run where?

1708
01:48:45,805 --> 01:48:46,773
Down.

1709
01:48:47,007 --> 01:48:49,976
The waiters, police, people...

1710
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:53,304
...ran out of buildings,
back up to where...

1711
01:48:53,546 --> 01:48:57,313
...to where cousin Sebastian...

1712
01:48:59,387 --> 01:49:03,721
He was lying naked...

1713
01:49:03,957 --> 01:49:06,654
...on the broken stones.

1714
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:11,526
And this you won't believe.

1715
01:49:11,766 --> 01:49:16,636
Nobody, nobody could believe it.

1716
01:49:19,976 --> 01:49:22,603
It looked as if...

1717
01:49:22,844 --> 01:49:26,179
...as if they had devoured him!

1718
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:30,080
As if they had torn or cut...

1719
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,779
...parts of him away
with their hands...

1720
01:49:34,424 --> 01:49:38,122
...or with knives or
those jagged tin cans...

1721
01:49:38,362 --> 01:49:40,090
...they made music with...

1722
01:49:41,397 --> 01:49:45,028
...as if they'd torn bits of him away...

1723
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:50,037
...and stuffed them
in their own gobbling mouths!

1724
01:49:53,278 --> 01:49:58,079
There wasn't a sound anymore.

1725
01:49:58,316 --> 01:50:01,480
There was nothing...

1726
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:05,253
...but Sebastian...

1727
01:50:07,993 --> 01:50:12,522
...lying on those stones...

1728
01:50:12,765 --> 01:50:17,135
...torn and crushed.

1729
01:50:27,881 --> 01:50:29,576
Oh, Cathy.

1730
01:50:34,856 --> 01:50:36,482
Mrs. Venable.

1731
01:50:42,195 --> 01:50:44,187
There you are.

1732
01:50:44,432 --> 01:50:46,230
I thought you were still on deck.

1733
01:50:46,467 --> 01:50:50,962
And where's your hat?
Oh, dear, you'll get fever.

1734
01:50:51,206 --> 01:50:54,403
A whole day up there in the rigging
in the hot sun.

1735
01:50:54,643 --> 01:50:58,101
Watching those awful, hungry birds.

1736
01:50:58,347 --> 01:51:01,408
I don't know what you see
in such terrible sights.

1737
01:51:01,651 --> 01:51:05,087
It's too much for both of us,
my darling.

1738
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,551
That horrible sun.

1739
01:51:36,822 --> 01:51:38,585
Of course God is cruel.

1740
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:42,954
We didn't need to come to the
Encantadas to find that out, did we?

1741
01:51:43,195 --> 01:51:44,857
No, we've always known about Him.

1742
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:47,293
The savage face He shows to people...

1743
01:51:47,532 --> 01:51:49,728
...and the fierce things He shouts.

1744
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:54,872
It's all we ever see or hear
of Him now. Nobody seems to know why.

1745
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:56,502
The difference is...

1746
01:51:56,743 --> 01:51:59,473
...we know about Him, the others don't.
That's where we're lucky.

1747
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,680
Go rest, my darling.

1748
01:52:01,915 --> 01:52:03,882
Look out for that fever.

1749
01:52:04,118 --> 01:52:08,452
I'm going to see the captain and tell
him to change our course for home.

1750
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:11,249
Oh, Sebastian.

1751
01:52:11,492 --> 01:52:15,223
What a lovely summer it's been.
Just the two of us.

1752
01:52:15,464 --> 01:52:17,191
Sebastian and Violet.

1753
01:52:17,431 --> 01:52:19,263
Violet and Sebastian.

1754
01:52:19,501 --> 01:52:22,095
Just the way it's always going to be.

1755
01:52:22,337 --> 01:52:24,965
Oh, we are lucky, my darling...

1756
01:52:25,206 --> 01:52:28,107
...to have one another
and need no one else, ever.

1757
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:45,651
There's every possibility
that the girl's story is true.

1758
01:52:52,034 --> 01:52:55,199
George, tell her she's got to
come home with us.

1759
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:57,839
- Catherine'll be all right.
- Can't she come home?

1760
01:52:58,075 --> 01:52:59,473
Don't worry, she will.

1761
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:02,576
- Why don't you take your mother.
- Sure. Come on, Ma.

1762
01:53:14,259 --> 01:53:15,157
Miss Catherine?

1763
01:53:16,329 --> 01:53:18,227
She's here, doctor.

1764
01:53:20,098 --> 01:53:22,157
Miss Catherine's here.
