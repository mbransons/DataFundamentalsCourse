1
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,080
Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have
a little bash your last night in town?

2
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
Moose has been
lookin' for you all day.

3
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,400
He got worried. Thought you were
tryin' to avoid him.

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,120
What do you got?

5
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,600
- Oh, great.
- That's $2,000, man. $2,000!

6
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,000
Mr.Jennings gave it to me
to give to you. He's sorry it's late.

7
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,400
It's the first scholarship
the Moose Lodge has given out.

8
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,800
He says they're all very proud of you
back at the lodge.

9
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,040
- Why don't you hold it for me?
- I don't want it. Take it. It's yours.

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,320
I'll take it.

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
Listen, your sister calls.
I'll talk to you later.

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,000
- Wait a second. She can wait.
- Make it short and sweet, huh?

13
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Listen, I don't think
I'm gonna be going tomorrow.

14
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,080
Come on.
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,840
I was thinkin' I could wait a year,
go to City for a while.

16
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,800
You chicken fink.

17
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,760
After all we went through
to get accepted?

18
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
We're gettin' out of
this turkey town...

19
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
and now you wanna crawl
back into your cell?

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,520
You wanna end up like John?
You just can't stay 17 forever.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,400
- Get that through your head!
- I just need some time.

22
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,520
I gotta go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

23
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,720
We're leaving in the morning,
all right?

24
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
We're leaving
in the morning!

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,400
We gonna rock and roll ourselves
to death, baby!

26
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,800
You got the Wolfman Jack Show!

27
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
Don't with the thing!

28
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,680
Will you stop it
with the Big Bopper stuff?

29
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,880
- Hi,John!
- Not too good, huh?

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,600
Why is it every girl around here
is ugly or has a boyfriend?

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Where is the dazzling beauty
I've been searching for all my life?

32
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
I know what you mean.
The pickings are really gettin' slim.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,880
The whole strip is shrinkin'.

34
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,120
You know, I remember
about five years ago...

35
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,960
it would take a couple of hours
and a tank full of gas...

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
just to make one circuit.

37
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,600
It was really somethin'.

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,480
Hey,John.
Someone new in town.

39
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Are you gonna go after him?

40
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Hey, listen, professor.

41
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,960
If he can't find me, then he ain't
even worth racin', right?

42
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,200
Big shot.

43
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Well?

44
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,800
Where was I?

45
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,760
How you thought
high school romances were goofy...

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
and we started dating only because
you thought I was cute and funny...

47
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
but then you suddenly realized...

48
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,520
you were in love with me,
it was serious

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,280
You were leadin' up
to somethin' kinda big.

50
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,520
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,640
Well, seriously...

52
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,760
what I meant was that...

53
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,520
since we do care for each other
so much...

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,760
and since we should really consider
ourselves as adults now

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,200
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Where was I?

57
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
- Consider ourselves adults.
- Right, right.

58
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,480
I thought,
maybe before I leave...

59
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
we could agree that...

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,520
seeing other people while I'm away
can't possibly hurt, you know?

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,880
- You mean dating other people?
- It would strengthen our relationship.

62
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,040
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

63
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Not that there's any doubt.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,840
I think you're right.

65
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I mean, we're not kids anymore...

66
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,480
and it's silly to think
that when we're 3,000 miles apart...

67
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,000
we shouldn't be able
to see other people and go out.

68
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,240
Laurie, listen.
I didn't ask for that back.

69
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,200
I know. I just sort of think
it's juvenile now.

70
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
- You don't wanna wear it?
- I didn't say that.

72
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,320
I can't expect you to be a monk
while you're away.

74
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,280
I got a really neat
record collection.

75
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,960
I even got "Pledging My Love"
by Johnny Ace.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,520
How can you love Nelson when
he's going out with Marilyn Gator?

77
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,520
- Since he dumped on you--
- He didn't dump on me, you little dip!

78
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
Oh, hi, Steve.

79
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Hey, sis.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

81
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
- What is it?
- Nothing!

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,600
I've decided to let you take care
of my car while I'm away.

83
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
At least until Christmas.

84
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm comin' back for a couple
of weeks at Christmas.

85
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,400
I've got some very simple instructions
for you. Here's the keys.

86
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,960
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol-R.

87
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,400
I've written the tire pressure
and stuff on a pad in the glove

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,720
- Are you listening?
- Hey, what's wrong?

89
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,160
- Are you crying?
- I can't believe it!

90
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
I don't know what to say!

91
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll love and protect this car
until death do us part.

92
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,920
This is a super fine machine.

93
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
This might even be better than
Darryl Starbird's superfeck moon

94
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,720
It is! It's better than
Darryl Starbird's superfeck moonbird.

95
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Budda?

96
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,520
How'd you like to go
to the drive-in movies with me?

97
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,280
- You gotta be kidding.
- Would I kid about a thing like that?

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,200
I have a new car.

99
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,280
Did she do that to you?

100
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Curt, you wanna bomb around?
I wanna try out my new wheels.

101
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Well, I'd like to, Toad...

102
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie to the hop.

103
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,160
- Besides, I'd spoil your luck.
- Yeah, right.

104
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,320
Tonight, things are gonna be
different.

105
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,240
Wait a minute.
You're goin' to the freshman hop?

106
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Come on, man!
That place is for kids.

107
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,360
You two just got your ass outta there.
Don't go back there.

108
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,920
You ain't got no emotions?

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,800
We are going to remember
all of the good times.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
- Yeah, well, go.
- Why don'tyou come with us?

111
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,840
- Bullshit, man!
- Come on. For old times' sake.

112
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,240
Listen, you go.
Go ahead, Curtsie baby.

113
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,240
You go on over there and remember
the good times you won't be havin'.

114
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,560
I ain't goin' off to some
god damn fancy college.

115
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm stayin' right here--
havin' fun as usual!

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
Jesus, Milner, you're really
in a great mood tonight!

117
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,680
What's the matter,John?

118
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,360
Did I do somethin' wrong?
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,520
Man, it's nothin'.

120
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,680
- We'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

121
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,840
We'll all do somethin' together
before Steve leaves.

122
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,520
Wait a minute.
Now you're not goin'?

123
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't know.

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,600
- Hey, Milner!
- What happened to your fat head?

125
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,960
- What happened to your fat head?
- Your mother!

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,920
Your mother!
Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you.

127
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
There's a very wicked
'55 Chevy lookin' for you.

128
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
- Yeah, I know.
- Watch out for the cop at Jerry's.

129
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,560
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

130
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
Hey, Toad!

131
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,960
Is that you
in that beautiful car?

132
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery!

133
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
Hey, kid!

134
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,480
All right, baby.
Here we go with another call.

135
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,680
-Answer the phone, dummy.
- Pinkie's Pizza.

136
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
You got anymore of those
secret agent spy scoops?

137
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,080
Hit parade
on astethoscope?

138
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,960
No, secret agent spyscope, man...

139
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
that pulls in the moon,
stars, the planets...

140
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,920
and the satellites
and little bitty spacemen.

141
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
You have the wrong number,
partner.

142
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Wait!
What did you say?

143
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.

144
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,120
- What? Why?
- Steven, cut over to "G" Street.

145
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,480
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.

146
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,880
- I didn't see anything.
- Come on, Curt.

148
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
We can't be spendin' half the night
chasing girls down for you.

149
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,080
Laurie, this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature I've ever seen!

150
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
- She's gone. Forget it.
- She spoke to me.

151
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,320
She spoke to me through the window!
I think she said, "I love you".

152
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,720
That means nothing
to you people?

153
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,360
You have no romance,
no soul?

154
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,480
Someone wants me. Someone
roaming the streets wants me.

155
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,440
Will you turn the corner?

156
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
- Later.
- Alligator.

157
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
You're new around here.
Where you from?

158
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,280
- Turlock.
- You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?

159
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,560
No. Does he go to Turlock High?

160
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,080
Well, he used to.
He goes to J.C. now.

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,320
- Do you go to J.C.?
- Yeah, sure.

162
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,080
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.

164
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
He's so boss!

165
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,640
How'd you like to ride around
with me for a while?

166
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm going steady.

167
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,200
- Come on!
- I just can't.

168
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,080
You're just ridin' around
with a bunch of girls.

169
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Anybody else in there
wanna go for a ride?

170
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,840
You got nothin' to fear.
I'm as harmless as a baby kitten.

171
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,040
- I'll go! I'll go!
-Judy's sister'll go with you, okay?

172
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,560
Yeah, sure.
Judy, her sister, her mother...

173
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,520
Anybody.
I'll take 'em all.

174
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.

175
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,400
It'll turn red by the time we get there.
All right?

176
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,760
If you ever get tired of going steady
with somebody that ain't around...

177
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm up for grabs.

178
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,000
So, you're Judy's little--
Shit! How old are you?

179
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm old enough.
How old are you?

180
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,760
- I'm too old for you.
- You can't be that old.

181
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,720
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.

182
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,400
Where are they anyway? Are they
comin' back? This is a joke, right?

183
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,000
This better be a joke,
'cause I'm not drivin' you around!

184
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,400
You asked me. What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?

185
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Judy doesn't want me with her,
and now you don't want me with you.

186
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,160
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother and father hate me.

187
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,120
- Everybody hates me.
- They don't hate ya.

188
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,800
- You throw me out, I'll scream.
- No, no. Stay cool.

189
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,720
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.

190
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,560
- Can't be too hard to find.
-John, you gonna be there tonight?

191
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,200
Shit! Hey, get down.

192
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,480
- Is this called "copping a feel"?
- What? No! Get up. Jesus.

193
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,000
- What's your name?
- My name?

194
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,280
Mud, if anybody sees you.

195
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,640
- What do you got in there, kid?
- More than you can handle.

196
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,400
Excuse me.
I think we've had an accident.

197
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,200
Damn it, I won't report you this time,
but next time,just watch it!

198
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,760
- Good evening. How are ya?
- Yeah, hi.

199
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,520
This is really a beautiful car,
you know? Of course you know it.

200
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
You know what I'd like to give you
for this car?

201
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
I'd like to give you $1,000!

202
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,120
I can't give you that, but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.

203
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you. Come over here.

204
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
How would you like, for $525,
to own this practically new 'Vette?

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

206
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm gonna knock ten percent
right off the top. How about that?

207
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,720
- That's $98 down.
- No, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,600
$98 a month.
You ask me how can I do this?

209
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,040
I'll tell you
how I can do it.

210
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,800
My boss wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.

211
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,760
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

212
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,360
I don't think it's a good idea.

213
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,800
- I'm busy.
- I want you to listen.

214
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
I've gotta go!

215
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,760
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

216
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,240
One, two, three, four

217
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,080
At the hop

218
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
You can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stomp, even stroll it at the hop

219
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,680
When there cords start spinnin,you
can mix it with the chicken at the hop

220
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,640
Do the dance sensation
that's sweepin' the nation at the hop

221
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,120
Let's go to the hop

222
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
You can swing, you can groove it, you
can really start to move it at the hop

223
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop

224
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,560
All the guys and chicks
can get their kicks at the hop

225
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Let's go!

226
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
Why are you so depressed?

227
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
You'll forget him in a week.

228
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,800
After you're elected Senior Queen,
you'll have so many boys after your bod.

229
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,920
Peggy, the point is, I do not want
to go out with any other guys.

230
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
Laurie, I know
it's a drag, but you can't just--

231
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,360
Remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?

232
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,560
When Mike went into the Marines,
she had a nervous breakdown...

233
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,520
and was acting so wacky
she got run over by a bus.

234
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,160
I just wish I could
go with him.

235
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,720
Laurie,jeez! Come on.

236
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, everybody--

237
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,800
Just cool it, Steve?

238
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
Let me see
some of that stuff.

239
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
You leavin' tomorrow?

240
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,640
- You and Laurie engaged yet?
- No, but we got it all worked out.

241
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,120
We're still gonna be goin' together,
but we can date other people.

242
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
And screw around.
I know.

243
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,800
Hey, I hear college girls
really put out.

244
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,120
When I saw her
standing there

245
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,040
I had to pick her up
I couldn't fail

246
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,760
'Cause I knew
I had to make her mine

247
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,920
She's so cool
She's so fine

248
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,320
I was tryin' to think
of words to say

249
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,560
So I went up to her
and changed my fate

250
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,120
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

251
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,480
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

252
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,640
- Laurie, I said I wanna dance.
- Who's stopping you?

253
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,880
I thought you might wanna dance with me
our last night together.

254
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,480
How sentimental of you.
You'll be back at Christmas.

255
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,680
- I want to dance now, not at Christmas.
- Get your cooties off me!

256
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,480
- Don't make a scene.
- Go ahead. Slug me. Scar my face!

257
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy in this gym.

258
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
- This is getting good.
- Come on, Eddie, I'll dance with you.

259
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
You don't mind, do you, Peggy?

260
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,800
Joe College strikes out.

261
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,760
Feel so good

262
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
Take me by my hand

263
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
And let's go strollin'

264
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
In Wonderland

265
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,680
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will ya? I'm surrounded.

266
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
- Come here.
- You won't dance? Come on.

267
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
No, really, I'd like to,
but I can't.

268
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,680
I fold Mr. Simpson saw me dancing
with one of you sexy little--

269
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,200
excuse me --one ofyou young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.

270
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,400
Come on, gentlemen, back inside.
Put it out. Let's go.

271
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,640
Kids! Want a cigarette?

272
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
All right.

273
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,840
- I thought you'd left.
- No, not yet. I have no matches.

274
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
That's all right.

275
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,560
Brother! How do I get stuck
with dance supervision?

276
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
You goin' back east?

277
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,320
I remember the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell the night before.

278
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,080
- Blotto.
- Blotto. Exactly.

279
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,200
- Barfed on the train all the next day.
- Cute. Very cute.

280
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,200
Where'd you go again?

281
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
Middlebury. Vermont.

282
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,000
- Got a scholarship.
- Only stayed a semester.

283
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,480
One semester, after all that.
Came back here.

284
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,440
Why'd you come back?

285
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,640
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.

286
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,560
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

287
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,880
Well, I think I may find
that I'm not...

288
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,160
the competitive type myself.

289
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,440
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really sure that I'm going.

290
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,600
Now, don't be stupid. Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis--

291
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,480
Bill?

292
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,280
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak with you a minute?

293
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,320
- Hi, Curt.
-Jane.

294
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,960
Good luck, Curtis.

295
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
Yeah. I'll see ya.

296
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Thanks a lot.

297
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,240
A Wolfman Jack exclusive!

298
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,720
The Beach Boys, baby.
A brand-new group.

299
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,120
I predict they gonna go
a long way.

300
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,280
This is called
"Surfin'Safari".

301
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how

302
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
Come on and safari with me

303
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,520
Early in the mornin'
we'll be startin' out

304
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,440
Some honeys
will be comin' along

305
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,040
The next night
we went out with ammunition--

306
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
Don't you have some homework
or somethin' to do?

307
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,480
No sweat.
My mother does it.

308
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,080
Anyway,
he thought he was had.

309
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,200
He started the car and couldn't see
through the windshield...

310
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,600
and zoomed straight
into the canal.

311
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,760
- I still got some-- don't try anything.
- Watch it, will ya?

312
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,800
Jesus Christ!
Thanks a lot.

313
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,480
Hey, drivin' is
a serious business.

314
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,840
I ain't havin' no accidents
just because of you.

315
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,640
Come on. Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning ya.

316
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,560
Spare me, killer.

317
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,200
Oh, shit!

318
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,480
- Why did you do that?
- I don't like that surfin' shit.

319
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
Rock and roll's been goin' down hill
ever since Buddy Holly died.

320
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?

321
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,080
- You would, you grungy little twerp.
- Grungy!

322
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,920
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend, he'd pound you.

323
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah, sure. Shit!

324
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,520
- Holstein!
- Good. A cop.

325
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.

326
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm gonna tell him how old I am,
my parents don't know I'm out...

327
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,680
and you tried to rape me.

328
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,240
- Yeah, with shaving cream.
- Boy, are you up a creek.

329
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,120
Come on. Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

330
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,800
If you say:
"I was a dirty bird.

331
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,880
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitchin'"...

332
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,920
Say it. I'll tell him.

333
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,400
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy. She's bitchin'.

334
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,160
I'll think about it.

335
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,640
- Where you goin', Milner?
- I'm goin' home, sir.

336
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,240
- Where've you been?
- We were-- At the movies, sir.

337
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,840
You didn't happen to be around 12th
and "G" about 8:30 tonight, did you?

338
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,200
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies, like I said.

339
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,120
I stopped you because the light
on your license plate's out.

340
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm gonna have
to cite you for that.

341
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,960
And the front end
of this thing you're drivin'...

342
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,880
looks a little low.

343
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,880
No, sir.
It's 12 1/2 inches, regulation size.

344
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,040
It's been checked several times.
You can check it if you like, sir.

345
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,480
Look, Milner. Listen.
You can't fool with the law.

346
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,520
We know that was you tonight.

347
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,440
We have an excellent
description of this car.

348
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,800
I could run you in right now,
and I could make it stick.

349
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,640
But I'm not gonna do that.
You know why?

350
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,640
I want to catch you in the act...

351
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,800
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you but good.

352
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,200
Happy birthday, Milner.

353
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Thank you, asshole.

354
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,920
You're a regular J.D.

355
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,520
File that under C.S.
over there.

356
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,640
C.S.?
What's that stand for?

357
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,680
Chicken shit.
That's what it is.

358
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
Ain't he neat?

359
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,800
You know a guy around here
with a piss-yellow deuce coupe?

360
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,000
- Supposed to be hot stuff?
- You mean John Milner?

361
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,720
Ain't nobody can beat him, man.
He's got the fastest--

362
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,400
- I ain't nobody, dork. Right?
- Right.

363
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,920
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh?

364
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,320
Tell him I aim to blow his ass
right off the road.

365
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,280
Ain't he neat?

366
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,200
What a babe!
What a bitchin' babe!

367
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,480
Hello.

368
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,240
You sure you don't
need a lift somewhere?

369
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,240
You know John Milner?
John Milner's a good friend of mine.

370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Did anybody ever tell you that you look
just like Connie Stevens?

371
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,000
- You do. I really mean it.
- For real?

372
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.

373
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,000
-Yeah? You really think I look like her?
-Yeah, no shit.

374
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,760
I'm sorry. I mean-- I mean that
I'm not just feeding you a line.

375
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,120
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.

376
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,680
- What's your name?
- Debbie.

377
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,000
I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.

378
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,240
- Well, you look a lot like her too.
- Is this your car?

379
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,160
Yeah. I'm Terry, the--

380
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,160
- They usually call me Terry the Tiger.
- It's really tough-lookin'.

381
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,120
- What school you go to?
- Dewey. Can it lay rubber?

382
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,840
Yeah, I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.

383
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,120
That's bitchin' tuck-and-roll.
I really love the feel of tuck-and-roll.

384
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,080
You do?

385
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,880
Well, come in. I'll let you feel it.
I mean you can touch it if you want.

386
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,840
I'll let you feel the upholstery.

387
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,640
Okay.

388
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,720
- Peel out.
- What?

389
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,320
Peel out.
I just love it when guys peel out.

390
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,880
And they came all the way
from Stockton. Let's hear it.

391
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
I don't care
if you leave this second.

392
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,120
And we wanna thank Darby Langdon,
who did all these neat decorations.

393
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,000
Now the next dance
is gonna be a snowball...

394
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,840
and leading it off is lastyear's
class president, Steve Bolander...

395
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,160
and this year's head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.

396
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,280
- Come on.
- ""Come on"" what?

397
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,800
Steven, please.
Smile or something.

398
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
Quit pinching!

399
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,840
You think I care if you go off?
You think I'm gonna crack up?

400
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,320
- Boy, are you conceited!
- I don't know why I ever asked you out.

401
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,040
- You didn't. I asked you out.
- What do you mean, you asked me out?

402
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,000
Backwards Day.
Remember?

403
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,200
If I had waited for you to ask me--
Oh, brother!

404
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,880
Even after that, you didn't call me
for two weeks.

405
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,240
- I was busy.
- You were scared. Dave Ogler told me.

406
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,520
When you did ask me out,
you didn't kiss me for three dates.

407
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,960
- Well, I was--
- Scared. Jim Kiler told me.

408
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,120
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.

409
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,160
- Your father. Great.
- You know what he said?

410
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
He said he thought
you were bright enough...

411
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,640
and that you'd probably
get around to it after a while.

412
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,080
You didn't, of course.
I had to.

413
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Remember the picnic?

414
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,960
Out at the canyon?

415
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,000
Boy! You don't remember
anything, do you?

416
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,880
The first one,
up at the lake.

417
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,000
That was the first time
you kissed me.

418
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,560
I had to practically
throw myself at you.

419
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,800
I remember.

420
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,440
What's wrong?

421
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,080
Go to hell.

422
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,200
What are you doin',
stealin' hubcaps?

423
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
- Well, hey, Wendy.
- How've you been?

424
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,800
Fine.

425
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,920
- Great. How you been?
- Wait a sec.

426
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,880
Wait a minute!

427
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,520
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.

428
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,480
- Heard you're going away to school.
- Maybe, maybe.

429
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,160
- What?
- Same old Curt.

430
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,160
All the time we were going together,
you never knew what you were doing.

431
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,040
- I gotta go.
- Where ya goin'?

432
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,000
- Nowhere.
- You mind if I come along?

433
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,640
Louie, Louie

435
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
Me gotta go

436
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,280
A fine little girl
She's waitin' for me

437
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,040
Catch a ship
across the sea

438
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,960
Sail the ship all alone

439
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,400
Never think
I'll make it home

440
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,720
All right, Bolander, break that up.
You know the rules.

441
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,080
You and your girlfriend wanna do that,
go someplace else, huh?

442
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,120
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you go kiss a duck?

443
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,640
- What did you say?
- I said go kiss a duck, marble-head.

444
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,000
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended.

445
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,080
Don't you even come in Monday.
You're out!

446
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,240
I graduated last semester.
Remember?

447
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Why don't we go out
to the canal?

448
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
What for?

449
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,920
Listen, I can get tough
with you too, you know.

450
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
Hard guy.

451
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,160
A double Chubby Chuck, a chili-barb,
two orders of French fries and--

452
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,760
- Cherry Coke.
- And two Cherry Cokes.

453
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,120
What?

454
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,480
Right. Cool.

455
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,600
Hey, Deb.
How's my soft baby?

456
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,520
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.

457
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Come on, honey.
So I never called you back.

458
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,840
I been, you know, busy.

459
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Yeah, three weeks?

460
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Besides, it only took me one night
to realize...

461
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.

462
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Look who's talking. Who's the wimp
you're hangin' out with now? Einstein?

463
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
Tiger happens to be
very intelligent, unlike you.

464
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,960
I know everything your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.

465
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,880
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously doesn't want--

466
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?

467
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,920
No, thanks. I'm waitin'
for a double Chubby Chuck.

468
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,560
Then keep your smart-ass
mouth shut.

469
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
I'll call you sometime, Deb.

470
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,000
- Some night when I'm hard up.
- I won't be home.

471
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,160
Get out of here.

472
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.

473
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,200
That creep's not a friend of mine.
He's just horny.

474
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
That's why I like you.
You're different.

475
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,360
I-- I am? I mean,
you really think I'm intelligent?

476
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeah. And I bet you're smart enough
to get us some brew.

477
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,160
Brew? Oh, liquor.

478
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,280
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.

479
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,520
What about your hamburgers
and Cokes, sir?

480
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,320
Will you speed up?
You're gonna lose her.

481
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,160
Cut around him.
Just hang a right at the corner.

482
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Lost her again.

483
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,280
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

484
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,160
But I'm gonna find out.

485
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
I know who she is.

486
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, come on, Bob.

487
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,240
Come on! Who is she?

488
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,280
Come on!

489
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,040
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers?

490
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
That's his wife.

491
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,880
Get outta here.

492
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,680
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.

493
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,640
- And married.
- And she was cruising Tenth Street.

494
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,200
You gotta be thinkin'
of someone else.

495
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,480
Did you know that my ex is going
to become a presidential aide?

496
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
It's a secret, so don't tell anybody,
but his greatest ambition...

497
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,600
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.

498
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,880
How do you suppose you're gonna
do that, wishy-washy, at J.C.?

499
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,600
Maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

500
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,520
- Doubt it.
- Maybe you don't think you can do it.

501
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,200
- Maybe you oughta shut up.
- Maybe I ought to, but I won't.

502
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,200
Maybe you oughta
come into the aft chamber...

503
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,600
where we can
discuss this in private.

504
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,200
Thanks a lot.

505
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Come on, Wendy.

506
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,240
Move over.
I'm not sitting on your lap.

507
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,360
- To the opera, James.
- Drop dead.

508
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,600
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.

509
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,800
You wish!

510
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,480
I could pick up some margarine.
We could roll around in it for a while.

511
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,920
- I've been silly.
- Yeah?

512
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

513
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,520
We might even have
a class together.

514
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,360
- Maybe.
- Look.

515
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,120
- Maybe.
- Look.

516
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,920
There's Kip Pullman.
He's so neat.

517
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,760
Say somethin' to him
when we go by.

518
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,920
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. I just wanna meet him.

519
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,840
Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

520
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,840
Hey, Henderson, long time no see.
What you been doin'?

521
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,240
Nothin'.

522
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,280
I just wanted to tell you
Bobbie here is madly in love with you...

523
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,200
and trembles at the sight
of your rippling biceps.

524
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,800
- Out of my car, you--
- Wait a second!

525
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,120
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

526
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,800
Temper, temper!

527
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,120
Here it is:
one ten-cent Coke with ice.

528
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,560
And don't take all day
drinkin' it. Please.

529
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,480
Rats! I thought
some of my friends might be here.

530
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,360
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bed time.

531
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,480
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

532
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh, shit. Dee Dee.

533
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,320
Hiya,John.

534
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,440
- What do you say, Al?
- Not much.

535
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,400
You think if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday...

536
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,760
you could spot-weld
the bumper bracket?

537
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,200
Sure, anything.Just come by
before noon, all right?

538
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,720
- You met Linda?
- No, no. Hi, Linda.

539
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,560
This is my cousin, Carol.

540
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,560
I'm baby-sittin'.

541
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
- Baby-sitting!
-Jesus! Watch it, will ya?

542
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,600
Been hittin' me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

543
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,200
Goddamn it! Why don't you
grow up, for Christ's sake?

544
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,320
We don't get along too well,
you know?

545
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,840
- Been like this all--
- You spastic creep.

546
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,040
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?

547
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,360
Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista.

548
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,360
Wolfmans weat shirts
is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfeld.

549
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,200
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, son?

550
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,600
I was wondering--

551
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,800
- Could you give me the time?
- Sure.

552
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,000
It's quarter to 12:00.

553
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,480
Quarter to 12:00.
Good. Thanks a lot.

554
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,680
Excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.

555
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,520
See, I lost my I.D. in a food...

556
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,400
and I was wondering,
since you're going in there anyway...

557
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,000
could you pick me up
some Old Harper's-- hard stuff?

558
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,800
- Would you buy me a bottle?
- Why, certainly.

559
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,720
I lost my wife too.

560
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,600
Her name wasn't Idy though...

561
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,120
and it wasn't in a food,
but I know what you--

562
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,040
Yeah, good. Here's some money.
Old Harper.

563
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,920
- Quarter to 12:00.
- Right-o.

564
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,920
- Night.
- Night.

565
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,200
No, not wine!

566
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,200
- Was there an old man in here just now?
- Yeah. Just went out the back.

567
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,080
Want something?

568
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,280
Yeah.

569
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,000
Let me have
a Three Musketeers...

570
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,680
and a ballpoint pen,
one of those combs there...

571
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,560
a pint of Old Harper...

572
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,640
a couple off ashlight batteries
and some beefjerky.

573
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,400
You got an ID for the liquor?

574
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,120
Yeah.

575
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,480
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

576
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,680
Sorry. You'll have to get it before.

577
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,680
I also--
I forgot the car.

578
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Did you get it?

579
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,240
You got it!

580
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,360
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

581
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,720
I needed some things and
I thought as long as I was in there--

582
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,520
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

583
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,480
Are you for real? Come on.

584
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,400
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

585
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,320
See, I've only got a 50,
and he doesn't have change.

586
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,120
I can't believe this.
I really cannot believe this.

587
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,640
Here.

588
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,560
- Excuse me. Could you--
- Buy you a bottle of booze?

589
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,640
Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D.
What kind doyou want?

590
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,080
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper?

591
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
That one over there--
that's Freddy Benson's 'Vette.

592
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,000
He had a head-on collision
with a drunk. Boom!

593
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,080
Didn't have a chance.

594
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,720
He was a good driver too.

595
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,520
It's pretty grim when a guy gets it
and it's not even his own fault.

596
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,440
Needs a paintjob,
that's for sure.

597
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,360
See that over there? That '41 ?

598
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,640
That used to be-- believe it or not--
the fastest car in the valley.

599
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,080
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

600
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,840
He got his 1955 in about
the hairiest crash we ever had here.

601
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,720
Jesus, you should've seen it.

602
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,520
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

603
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,080
Board of Education was real impressed,
so they filmed the whole thing.

604
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,880
Now they show it
in driver's education classes.

605
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,600
Probably see it
if you get lucky.

606
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,200
Course, pretty tough
when they take somebody with them.

607
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,040
You've never had an accident though.
You told me.

608
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,440
Well, I come mighty close.

609
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,960
Almost rolled it
a couple of times.

610
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,880
But I've been just quick enough
to stay out of this graveyard.

611
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,320
Bet you're the fastest.

612
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,600
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

613
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,120
Seems to me there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

614
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,120
Sneakin'around
with the Wolfman, baby.

615
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,000
This is gonna strike arawnerve. Mama.
Here's The Platters.

616
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,840
Oh, yes

617
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,040
I'm the great pretender

618
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,360
Pretending
that I'm doing well

619
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,320
My need is such

620
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,520
I pretend too much

621
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,680
I'm lonely
but no one can tell

622
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,800
What are you doin', creep?

623
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,200
Who, me?

624
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,160
No, I'm talkin'
to the other 50 creeps here.

625
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,000
You know Gil Gonzales?

626
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,840
No, I don't.

627
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,440
Don't know Gil.
Well, you oughta.

628
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,040
He's a friend of ours. That's his car
you got your butt parked on.

629
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,560
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere.

630
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,400
You must be goin' some place.
You left here, didn'tya?

631
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,560
Bring him over here.
I want to show him somethin'.

632
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,720
Bend down here.
Look across here. See?

633
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,480
Right across there.
You see?

634
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,400
- I guess so.
- You scratched it, man.

635
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,920
Where do you get off
sittin' on Gil's car, man?

636
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,880
Sorry.

637
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,080
It's really not much of a scratch.
I don't think you'd see it.

638
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,040
It ain't the size that's in question
here. It's the principle!

639
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,880
Jeez, this is gonna be tough.

640
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
What should we do with you?

641
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,280
Tie him to the car
and drag him.

642
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,560
You know Toby Juarez?

643
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,320
He's a Pharaoh, isn't he?

644
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,920
Sure, we know Toby.

645
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,360
We killed him last night.

646
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,280
Tied him to the car
and dragged him.

647
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,200
This is gonna take
some thinkin'.

648
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,160
You better come with us and maybe
take a ride with the Pharaohs, huh?

649
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,000
No, listen, I'd really like to,
but I've gotta--

650
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,680
I'd rather--

651
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,960
I know just howyou feel.

652
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,520
- Shotgun.
- No, I called it.

653
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,040
- When?
- Before we picked you up.

654
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,280
You can't call it for the whole night.
I got it now.

655
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,560
Get in the back, punk.

656
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,160
Will you get in there?
Jesus!

657
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,640
Rock 'n'roll will stand, man!

658
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,120
Whois this
on the Wolfman telephone?

659
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,520
- Hello, it's collect.
- Your name is Collette?

660
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,720
- Yeah, collect call for Wolfman--
- Your name is Collette Call?

661
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,200
- Sir, this is the operator.
- Are you French, operator?

662
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,440
This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack.

663
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,480
- I love you, operator.
- Is this Wolfman Jack?

664
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,960
- Is Floyd there?
- It's for Wolfman Jack.

665
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,120
I just love listenin' to Wolfman.
My mom won't let me at home.

666
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,040
Because he's a Negro.
I think he's terrific.

667
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,000
Do you know that he broadcasts
from a plane...

668
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,400
that fies around in circles
all the time?

669
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,920
Do you believe that?

670
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,520
Floyd, I love you, Floyd.

671
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,920
Floyd, is this you, Floyd?

672
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,120
Floyd, I cannot look on thee.

673
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,840
Love took my hand
and smiling did reply...

674
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,080
""Who made the eyes but I?""

675
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,320
Floyd, reach out.
Touch my soul, Floyd!

676
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,480
- Your party's ready, sir.
- Hello, Floyd!

677
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,640
You tell her, Wolfman!
He's my man.

678
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,800
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

679
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,040
- He broadcasts out of Mexico someplace.
- No, he don't.

680
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,120
I've seen the station
outside of town.

681
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,840
That's just a clearing station.
So he can fool the cops.

682
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,040
He blasts that thing around the world.
It's against the law, man.

683
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,560
- They'll never catch the Wolfman.
- No way.

684
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,960
Man, who cut the cheese?

685
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,560
"" He who smelt it, dealt it.""

686
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,920
There's that bad-ass Chevy again.

687
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,240
Look at that snatch
he's got with him.

688
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,440
- He looks like a wimp.
- Probably is.

689
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,960
Wimps get all the snatch.

690
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,360
Milner ain't gonna beat that.
His time has come.

691
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,960
He's gettin' old.
He ain't as fast as he used to be.

692
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,760
You got two seconds
to get your ass over in your corner.

693
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,040
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

694
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,320
- You got a bitchin' car.
- Yeah, I know.

695
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:11,280
In fact, your car's so neat,
we're gonna give you our special prize.

696
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,200
You want me to give it to ya?

697
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,120
Sweetheart, if the prize is you,
I'm a ready Teddy.

698
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,360
Well, get bent, turkey!

699
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,560
Very funny!

700
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,240
What a chop! Ha-ha!
Quit laughing!

701
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,960
-Jump out and fatten their tires.
- Wait a minute.

702
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,680
-Just do what I say!
- All right, boss.

703
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,840
It's a really beautiful
night tonight.

704
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,440
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

705
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,600
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

706
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,480
- Yeah? I had a couple of horses myself.
- Really?

707
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,360
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting.

708
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,840
Deer mostly.
Got a couple of bear lastyear.

709
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,400
Those were good ponies. Had to
train 'em myself. Took a lot of time.

710
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,400
Do you still have 'em?
We can go for a ride.

711
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,520
No, no. I had to sell 'em
to get these wheels. And a Jeep.

712
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,440
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

713
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,680
It's got a gun rack.
I use that for hunting mostly.

714
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,880
Why do you kill little animals?
I think that's terrible.

715
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,800
Well, yeah.

716
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,680
I figure with bears, though,
it's me or them.

717
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,600
- I think you're really neat.
- Wait a second.

718
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,720
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

719
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,480
I guess maybe it's the booze
or somethin'.

720
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,280
- Oh! You pinched me.
- I'm sorry.

721
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,600
Let me get my head
over here.

722
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,840
You get up. Okay.

723
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,800
My leg, my leg! Watch it.

724
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,880
I just love
tuck-and-roll upholstery.

725
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,480
Jesus, it's like
Grand Central Station around here.

726
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,440
- Why don't we go someplace else?
- Come on. They won't come back.

727
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,720
Wait a minute.

728
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,720
I got a blanket in the back.
Why don't we go over into the field?

729
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,720
All right. Okay.

730
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,040
- How old are you?
- I'm 13. How old are you?

731
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,720
- I'm only 14.
- I love you, Wolfman.

732
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,240
We're gonna do the weather
for the valleys and mountain tops.

733
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,680
It's gonn abe hot.
About 200 degrees in Merced.

734
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
Four hundred degrees
out in Fresno.

735
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,160
And about 500 degrees
up around the valley somewhere.

736
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,160
You got
the Wolfman Jack Show!

737
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,840
This is terrific.
I love miniature golf.

738
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Is that right?

739
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,800
I hate it.

740
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,960
I don't play it too often.
What are we doing here?

741
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,920
We're outta gas, man.

742
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,320
They don't sell gas here.

743
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,240
I know.
But we're outta money too.

744
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,920
What are you punks doin'?

745
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,960
What's goin' on here?

746
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,040
Hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

747
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,960
Henderson?
Curt Henderson?

748
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,920
Are you with these punks?

749
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,720
These are just
some friends of mine.

750
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,280
We're just-- You know.

751
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,520
You had me nervous there
for a second, huh?

752
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,560
You didn't leave yet, huh?

753
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,280
No, I'm not--

754
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,400
I'm not scheduled to leave
until tomorrow morning.

755
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,960
Tomorrow?

756
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,520
Hank Anderson's inside.
Come in and say good-bye.

757
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,800
He brought your name up
at the Moose Hall. You got the check?

758
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,080
Hank, look who's here.

759
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,400
How are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

760
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,640
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you. All of us.

761
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,240
The Moose scholarship went
to the right boy--you.

762
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,440
And we're all proud of you.

763
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,400
We're all done out here.

764
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,080
All done?
What's he mean?

765
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,320
He means we're all done
having loads of fun out here.

766
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,720
You can have all the fun you want.
This place is for fun.

767
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,480
Yes, it is.
Thank you. Thank you both.

768
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,720
Good luck, son.

769
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,840
Before I say good-bye, I hope
you'll be taking along with you...

770
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,960
a little piece of this place.

771
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,880
I think I have.

772
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,880
Good. Don't forget us.

773
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,480
No, I won't forget you,
and you won't forget me.

774
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,840
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye and good luck.

775
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,400
- It was nice to meet ya.
- What he said goes for me too.

776
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,640
You just might make it
as a Pharaoh yet, boy.

777
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,680
Someday he'll make
a fine Moose.

778
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,040
What's the matter?

779
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,520
The radio's gone.

780
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,000
That means the car is gone!
Come on.

781
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,960
Oh, God! Not the car!

782
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,640
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

783
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,720
You know,
it doesn't make sense...

784
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,760
to leave home
to look for home.

785
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,480
To give up a life
to find a new life.

786
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,720
To say good-bye to friends you love
just to find new friends.

787
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,920
- Wait, could you say that again?
- Something Curt said.

788
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,960
Figures.

789
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,320
You must've talked his ear off
tryin' to get him to stay.

790
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,880
No, Steven. That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

791
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,360
Curt just said at dinner tonight...

792
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,360
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

793
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,360
He thought that he ought to stay
and go to J.C. for a while...

794
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,800
and try and figure out
what he wanted to do with his life.

795
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,440
- That sounds logical.
- Do you think so?

796
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,520
Sure. I think Curt's
probably right, for Curt.

797
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,880
Not for me, though.

798
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,880
Laurie, look at me.

799
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,800
You know what I want out of life.

800
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,280
And it's just not in this town.

801
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,480
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

802
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,680
- No, Steven, don't.
- Come on.

803
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,400
It's our last night together
for three months.

804
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,280
I know. But we've been
through this before.

805
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,280
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I need something to remember you by.

806
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,640
You don't want me
to forget you, do you?

807
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,120
No.

808
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,320
What's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

809
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,800
- You want to. Go ahead.
- Not like that.

810
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,160
If you're not gonna remember me
for anything else,just go ahead.

811
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,480
Come on.
You want it and you know it.

812
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,440
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me...

813
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,400
after all that stuff you told me
about watching your brother.

814
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,320
You're disgusting!
Get out of my car!

815
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,520
I told you never
to mention that!

816
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,960
So, anyhows, the goat killer--

817
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,880
- Can't we talk about something else?
- No.

818
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,240
Whenever he strikes, he leaves
a bloody goat's head next to the victim.

819
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,240
Isn't that creepy?

820
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,240
They thought he went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago...

821
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,080
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson and Don White...

822
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,320
right here at this canal
all hacked to pieces.

823
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,080
Who do you think'll take
the regionals this year?

824
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,680
Not only were there bloody
goats' heads all around...

825
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,160
but he had switched parts
of their bodies.

826
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,680
She had on his arms
and he had on her legs and--

827
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,440
Wait a second!

828
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,160
Did you hear that?

829
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,200
- Doyou think it's the goat killer?
- No!

830
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,560
Listen, I'll go for help
and you stay here.

831
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,240
No, let's get in this field.

832
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,680
Come on, come on!

833
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,600
Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get
somebody and we'll see the whole thing.

834
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,480
I don't want to see
the whole thing!

835
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,200
I can't see what he's doing.

836
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,840
Darn it,
I wish I could see.

837
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,960
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna see anything.

838
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,320
Just keep him away from me.
That's all I want.

839
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,280
How do I get into these things?

840
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,800
We're all right up--

841
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,320
Debbie?

842
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,200
- Oh, no! Please! Please!
- Terry.

843
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,520
- Steve!
- What are you doin' up here?

844
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,320
Oh, God, Steve.

845
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,320
Is it safe to come out?

846
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,520
- Where did you go, anyway?
- Over there.

847
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,160
- Let's get outta here.
- Where's my 'rod?

848
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,080
- Your 'rod?
- Yeah.

849
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,920
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.

850
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,800
Well?

851
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,200
It's in the garage.

852
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,320
I put it in the garage
for safe keeping.

853
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,880
I don't want to take any chances
with it.

854
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,160
It's a good thing too,
because somebody stole our car.

855
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,280
- That's terrible. What kind was it?
- Where's Laurie anyway?

856
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,480
- I guess we broke up.
- You broke up? Bull.

857
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,080
Doesn't look like a gearshift knob.
What is it?

858
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,480
- Come on, give it back to me.
- What's wrong? You're a tough guy.

859
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,720
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm. See if I care.

860
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,840
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.

861
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,720
You're an ogre, like my father.

862
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:10,080
He won't let me stay out late,
or play records, or anything.

863
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,000
Your fatherwon't let you
stay out late?

864
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,920
No, he's terrible.

865
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,480
Once I was out late at a party.
He called the cops.

866
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,360
Can you imagine?
He had the whole police force there.

867
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,080
By the way,
where is it that you live, Carol?

868
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,600
Over on Ramona. Why?

869
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,360
Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you
where I live?

870
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,440
Not me. Not old Carol.
The night is young.

871
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,000
And I'm not hittin' the rack
till I get a little action.

872
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,440
What do you keep lookin' at?

873
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,560
Who's that? You know him?

874
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,080
- He's followin' awful close.
- Grab on to something.

875
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,040
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared ya.

876
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,640
You'd have to do a hell of a lot
more than that to scare me.

877
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,840
I been lookin' all over for ya.
Didn't nobody tell you?

878
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,520
I can't keep track of all you punks
runnin' around here backwards.

879
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,760
You're supposed to be
the fastest thing in the valley.

880
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,640
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.

881
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,440
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.

882
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,240
I'm not surprised,
drivin' a field car.

883
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,200
Field car?
What's a field car?

884
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,280
A field car runs through the fields,
drops cow shit all over the place.

885
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,080
That's pretty good.

886
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,080
I like the color of your car, man.
What's that supposed to be?

887
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,600
A cross between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?

888
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,000
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.

889
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,040
I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps
just to get a little air in your tires.

890
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,560
At least I don't have to pull over
to the side just to let a funeral go by.

891
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,920
Funny. You know what?

892
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,360
Your car's uglier than I am!

893
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,400
That didn't come out right.

894
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,520
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.

895
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,800
Why don't you go out and try
to win yourself a few races?

896
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,480
Then you come on back
and I'll show you a few things.

897
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,840
Race him. You can beat him.

898
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,360
That's a tough-lookin' girl
you got with you, man.

899
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,640
Tryin' to pick up
a few extra bucks baby-sittin'?

900
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,600
Doll, come and ride with me--
in about ten years!

901
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,800
Leave her out of this.
This is between you and me.

902
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,960
He's really fast, isn't he?

903
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,920
Yeah, but he's stupid.

904
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,080
Any of you guys know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?

905
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,000
I know her.
What about it?

906
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,800
I'm tryin' to find out who she is.

907
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,480
She's out of your price range, man.

908
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,040
- My brother's been out with her.
- Price range?

909
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,160
Are you trying to tell me
she's a prost--

910
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,960
That's right, she's a $30 Sheri.
Can you imagine that?

911
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,080
- Thirty bucks for that broad.
- We're thinkin' about different broads.

912
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,680
Watch it. Fuzz ahead.

913
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,200
- Where?
- AtJerry's Cherry.

914
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,480
You can barely see the fender.

915
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,720
Yeah. We oughta do somethin'.

916
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,320
I got an idea.

917
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,240
I got a good idea.

918
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,320
I think I'm gonna
go over to Burger City.

919
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,800
Yeah, Laurie's probably over there.

920
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,600
You think she's got me
worried about where she is, don't you?

921
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,960
I couldn't care less.

922
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,880
- Want to come along?
- Yeah, I do.

923
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,000
- No.
- Make up your minds.

924
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,280
No, thanks.
We got to report the car missing.

925
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,720
All right. I'll see ya.

926
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,000
Shut up! They'll hear us.

927
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,080
- Listen, Carl--
- Curt.

928
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,360
Despite you scratchin' Gil's car,
I like you.

929
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,960
And I know what you'd like
more than anything right now.

930
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,560
Like every guy in this town, you got
the same secret dream, right?

931
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,080
You wanna be a Pharaoh.
Go ahead. You can admit it.

932
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,640
But you didn't think
it was possible, did you?

933
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,320
Well, tonight...

934
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,240
I'm gonna give you your chance.

935
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,840
Get down.

936
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,800
Okay. Now, you got it?

937
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,800
- I'm stayin' here. You're on your own.
- Wait a minute, Joe.

938
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,080
- What if he hears me?
- Listen, listen!

939
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,600
Look at it this way.
You got three choices.

940
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,600
One, you chicken out.

941
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,400
In that case, I let Ants tie you
to the car and drag you around a bit.

942
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,320
- You don't want that, right?
- No.

943
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,320
Two, you foul up
and Holstein hears you, and, well--

944
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,000
- You don't want that, right?
- No, I don't.

945
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:13,680
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs...

946
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,360
with a car coat and
a blood initiation and all that.

947
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,280
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?

948
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,720
Why don't we go get your Jeep?

949
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,600
- What are you talking about?
- Your Jeep.

950
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,080
The one you sold the hunting ponies for.
The one with the four-wheel drive.

951
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,240
You sure you got
enough slack?

952
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,320
Yeah, no sweat.
Let's get outta here.

953
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,920
Come on, Terry.

954
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,160
Stand by for justice!

955
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,680
I can't believe it.

956
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,600
Feeling so good
'cause you're 16.

957
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,040
Ooh, you come on
like a dream

958
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,840
Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine

959
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,640
You're 16

960
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,200
You're beautiful
and you're mine

961
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,880
Why are we stopping here?

962
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,480
- Carol.
- What?

963
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,520
I don't think that I can
control myself any longer.

964
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,200
- You can't?
- I've got to have you.

965
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,200
Me?

966
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,560
All night you've been sitting there
and you've been so sexy...

967
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,320
and it's been so hot out here...

968
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,360
and I can't wait any longer.

969
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,160
A lot of that
was an act, you know.

970
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,040
Like my crying.
That was just an act.

971
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,920
It's been building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.

972
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,400
If you told me where you lived,
then I could take you home...

973
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,520
but you won't tell me where you live,
so here we are.

974
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,040
I mean, I've got to have you.
It's too late.

975
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,600
It's not too late.
It's never too late!

976
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,000
231 Ramona. Two-three-one.

977
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,560
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.

978
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?

979
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,320
No. Have a seat.

980
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,480
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you all alone...

981
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,640
for once.

982
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,640
- Where's Laurie?
- I don't know.

983
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,400
I thought you guys'd be together,
this being your last night.

984
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,800
- We broke up.
- What?

985
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,520
- It's no big deal.
- What happened?

986
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,600
Budda, you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.

987
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,400
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!

988
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,440
Listen.

989
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,360
I'm off in an hour, and I thought
you'd maybe like to come over.

990
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,440
- I don't know.
- Well, why not?

991
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,800
This time it'd just be for fun.

992
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,680
Okay?

993
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,960
Okay.
I'll see you later, then.

994
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,760
Budda, wait.

995
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,240
Listen, I--

996
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,360
I gotta get up early in the morning
and I don't think it'd work out.

997
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,800
I tell you somethin'.

998
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
That thing jumped about
five feet in the air--

999
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,760
Listen, I still gotta find
that blonde.

1000
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,880
Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow.

1001
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,560
I guess so. I don't know.

1002
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,520
What do you mean,
you guess so?

1003
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,320
We don't admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.

1004
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,280
We got to steal your car coat,
things like that.

1005
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,200
You gotta
make up your mind.

1006
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,920
Rome wasn't burned
in a night.

1007
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,080
- Let's go!
- I'll see you, boys.

1008
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,120
You only got about five minutes
if you want to talk to the Wolfman.

1009
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,760
Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby. Hello!

1010
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,600
Would you dedicate a record
to keep me and my girlfriend together?

1011
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,640
-Are you separated?
- We're havin' a little problem.

1012
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,360
I'll bring you right together.
Hold on a minute, man.

1013
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,360
Everything's gonna be
allright now, man, understand?

1014
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,600
I chased the evil spirits away.
Now let me play the record for ya.

1015
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Hey, baby.
What do you say?

1016
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,080
Don't say anything
and we'll get along just fine.

1017
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,640
This is the first time
you've been quiet all night.

1018
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,240
I had fun. Good-bye.

1019
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,680
Bye.

1020
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,320
- Do you like me?
- Yeah, I like you. You're all right.

1021
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,080
But I mean do you like me?

1022
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,080
I like you.

1023
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,440
Okay?

1024
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,200
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?

1025
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,160
- Bye, kid.
- Gee, thanks!

1026
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,720
It's just like a ring or something.
It's like we were going steady.

1027
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,000
Wait'll I tell Marcia
and everybody!

1028
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,280
- Don't go overboard with this thing.
- I'll see you around.

1029
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,120
I haven't cried so much.
Tears and everything, man.

1030
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,640
I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!

1031
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,560
I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!

1032
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,840
- Hold that up.
- You're right about that.

1033
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,600
But why should I leave home
to find a home?

1034
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,680
Why should I leave friends that I love
to find new friends?

1035
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,880
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I've heard this already.

1036
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,400
Aren't you the one that told me
for eight weeks...

1037
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,640
that you have to leave
the nest sometime?

1038
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,560
I realize that.

1039
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,120
No "realizing".
You've been telling me all summer...

1040
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,480
that it's time to stick your head
out of the sand...

1041
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,080
and take a look at the big,
beautiful world out there somewhere.

1042
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,120
Gimme this thing.
I feel like a midwife.

1043
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,120
I may have been wrong,
Curt.

1044
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,520
Wrong, nothing!
You've been telling me for eight weeks.

1045
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,760
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, I know.

1046
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.

1047
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,640
Just relax and we'll talk about it
at the airport.

1048
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,080
Where're you going?

1049
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,560
It's awfully early in the morning.

1050
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,080
- I have a dental appointment.
- Come on, Curt.

1051
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,600
Just relax, will ya?
I'll see you at the airport.

1052
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:02,040
Some enchanted evening

1053
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,000
You will see a stranger

1054
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,280
You will see a stranger

1055
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,680
Across a crowded room

1056
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,880
And suddenly you'll know

1057
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,280
That she is the one

1058
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:33,280
- He mustn't have been used to drinking.
- No. He likes to drink. He told me so.

1059
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,520
I knew a man once
who got that sick.

1060
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,640
Billy Weber.
That was ten years ago.

1061
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,600
On his hands and knees like that
he looks like a dog, like old Ginger.

1062
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,800
Sicker'n a dog,
that's for sure.

1063
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,760
- Are you all right?
- Oh, rats.

1064
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,000
I feel terrible.

1065
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,560
The car!
Debbie, look!

1066
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,160
Debbie, that's the car!

1067
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,320
Look. It's sitting right here.

1068
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,360
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, sure. This is it.

1069
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,040
They must've taken
the keys with 'em.

1070
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,800
- Maybe we better go call the police.
- No. Wait a minute.

1071
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,160
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it back, all right?

1072
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,960
You get some wire-- about a foot.
We can hot-wire it.

1073
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,920
Took the header plugs off?
Expectin' some action?

1074
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,880
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk lookin' for me.

1075
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,480
Why the hell do they bother?
You've always been number one.

1076
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,920
Been a long time, ain't it?
I'll see you. Thanks.

1077
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,840
Hi, this is my car.

1078
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,280
What I mean is,
somebody stole--

1079
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,480
No, I mean, I lost my car, see?

1080
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,600
And I want to thank
you two guys for retur--

1081
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,800
I mean, now listen.
Now, listen, guys.

1082
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,280
I've been sick, and this kind of
activity can really be hard on a guy.

1083
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,440
Easy. Easy.

1084
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,680
Stop it! Stop it!

1085
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,120
Help! Police! Help!

1086
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,880
Stop it, you creeps!

1087
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,520
- Go, John!
- Get him!

1088
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,480
Come on, get up!
Come on!

1089
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,200
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?

1090
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,120
Man, are you all right?

1091
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,800
Yeah, I'll die soon
and it'll all be over,John.

1092
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,240
Wow, you're just
like the Lone Ranger!

1093
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,520
Listen--
Are you with him?

1094
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,960
You're talking
to the woman I love.

1095
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,840
What happened, man?

1096
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,440
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi,Judy. Hi, Karen.

1097
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,360
Where's Laurie?

1098
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,560
We know where she is.

1099
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,520
So what?

1100
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,880
So nothing.

1101
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,480
It's just that she was
with a really cute guy...

1102
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,600
in a really boss car.

1103
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,400
And we thought you just
might know who it was.

1104
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,520
- I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know.
- We know.

1105
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,480
His name's Bob Falfa.

1106
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,800
Bring two cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

1107
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,480
No, never mind.
Just bring the ice. Pronto.

1108
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,200
Out! Out!
Get out of the car.

1109
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,320
Steve, what are you doin'?

1110
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,760
Just get out and shut up.
You too. Get out. Get out!

1111
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,760
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

1112
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,440
I can't believe it.

1113
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,720
You practically get killed
trying to get your car back...

1114
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,600
then you let him have it.

1115
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,000
It's not my car.

1116
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,240
What?

1117
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,120
It is not my car.

1118
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,320
Well, then,
where is your car?

1119
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,000
I don't have a car.

1120
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,120
What about your Jeep?

1121
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,080
How am I gonna get home?

1122
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,920
Where's your car?
I have to hang 'em on a car.

1123
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,640
I need a ride.

1124
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,360
Toad, what happened to you?
Did you lose your car again?

1125
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,600
No, Steve took it.

1126
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,880
I want to go to sleep.

1127
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,560
You got to take it easy
when you drive that car of yours.

1128
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,000
You've got to cruise easy,
baby.

1129
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:52,640
Don't be doin' any accidents
or anything on me now.

1130
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,800
You know, Terry?

1131
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,800
I had a pretty good time tonight.

1132
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,800
- Come on. You're just--
- No, no. Really, really.

1133
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,000
I really had a good time.

1134
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,280
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff...

1135
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,480
saw a hold up
and then we went to the canal.

1136
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,760
You got your car stolen.

1137
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,480
And then I got to watch you
get sick.

1138
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,720
Then you got
in this really bitchin' fight.

1139
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:20,120
I really had a good time.

1140
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,680
Well, I guess I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

1141
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,120
If I'm not doing
anything tomorrow...

1142
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,080
why don't you give me
a call, okay?

1143
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah, all right.

1144
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,920
I got a little Vespa I play around with.
Maybe, you know--

1145
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,520
Really?
Well, that's almost a motorcycle...

1146
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,360
and I just love motorcycles.

1147
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,760
You do?
Why didn't you say something earlier?

1148
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,640
We wouldn't have had
to go through all the fun.

1149
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,480
I gotta go.

1150
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,080
- Good night.
- See ya.

1151
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,480
Hey, what do you want?

1152
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,280
Push the red switch down.

1153
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,040
I'm looking for this girl.

1154
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,440
Yeah. Aren't we all?

1155
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,360
She's not here.

1156
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,560
Come on in the back.

1157
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,800
You just go around the back.
This way.

1158
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,320
Have a popsicle. The ice box just
broke down and they're melting.

1159
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,280
- You want one?
- No, no, thanks.

1160
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,200
- Listen--
- Have a popsicle.

1161
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,040
Are you the Wolfman?

1162
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,240
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1163
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,040
Wait a minute.

1164
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,840
Who is this
on the Wolfman's telephone?

1165
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,520
That's the Wolfman.

1166
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,960
He's on tape.

1167
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,360
The man is on tape.

1168
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,280
Where is he now?
I mean, where does he work?

1169
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,440
The Wolfman is everywhere.

1170
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,120
I gotta give him this note.
Shit!

1171
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,520
Here, let me see the note.

1172
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,480
Hell, that's just a dedication, man.
What I can do is relay it.

1173
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,680
- It'll be on tomorrow or Tuesday.
- No, no, this is very important.

1174
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,720
I may be leaving town
tomorrow and it's very important...

1175
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,720
that I reach this girl right now.

1176
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,840
You don't know whether
you're going to leave town or not?

1177
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:47,440
I'm supposed to go to college
back east tomorrow.

1178
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,960
And I don't know
if I'm going to go. I don't know.

1179
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,800
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.

1180
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,920
- No, thanks.
- Sit down a minute.

1181
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,120
- It's early in the morning.
- Damn.

1182
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,200
I can't talk
for the Wolfman...

1183
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,520
but I can tell you one thing.

1184
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,160
If the Wolfman was here,
he'd say, "Get your ass in gear".

1185
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
The Wolfman comes in here
occasionally...

1186
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,160
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me and what not.

1187
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,760
And the places he talks about
that he's been...

1188
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,680
the things he's seen.

1189
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,840
It's a great big beautiful world
out there.

1190
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,600
And here I sit...

1191
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,760
sucking on popsicles.

1192
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,480
Why don't you leave?

1193
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,320
I'm not a young man anymore.

1194
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,000
The Wolfman gave me my start
in the business, and I like it.

1195
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,440
I tell you what.

1196
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,880
If I can possibly do it tonight...

1197
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,560
I'll try to relay
this dedication in...

1198
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,880
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1199
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1200
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,800
Just a minute.

1201
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,720
- It's been a pleasure, really.
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

1202
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,360
Sticky little mothers, ain't they?

1203
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,280
Six or seven of them, right?

1204
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,080
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

1205
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,400
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- See you later.

1206
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,720
Rock on, baby.
We gonna do it right here.

1207
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,800
Rock 'n' roll
yourself to death.

1208
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,920
Oh, mercy!

1209
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,520
Give me some more!
My, my.

1210
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,120
John, let me go with you.
Come on.

1211
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,080
Nah, man, I can't take you
when I'm racin' somebody.

1212
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,480
Just let me go. I just want to watch.
Or I'll fag you, okay?

1213
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,200
All right. Go ahead.

1214
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,600
Paradise Road.

1215
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,480
Where's this Paradise Road?

1216
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,840
Just follow this street
straight out of town.

1217
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:14,160
If you're going to race John Milner,
let me out when we get there.

1218
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:18,320
Why don't you shut up, baby?
You ain't said one word all night long.

1219
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,080
You're a weird broad.

1220
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,960
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.

1221
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,520
You'll be hanging on for mercy
when I get this sucker rollin'.

1222
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,600
Headin' out to Paradise Road?

1223
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,560
Paradise Road?

1224
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,240
Some guy named Falfa's
goin' up against Milner.

1225
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,520
- He's racing Falfa?
- Yeah.

1226
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,840
Figured something's up. Saw 'em head
out of town real cautious-like and--

1227
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:00,200
I got a dedication here
for a friend of the old Wolfman.

1228
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,400
He wants me to play
the next song...

1229
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,320
for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird.

1230
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,800
A white T-Bird,
you understand.

1231
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,200
My friend's name is Curt
and he wants to talk to you, baby.

1232
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,600
So yo umeet him at Burger City...

1233
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,640
or you can phone
Diamond-3132.

1234
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,560
He's a friend of mine, you hear?

1235
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,640
Little girl, you better call him
or the Wolfman gonna get ya.

1236
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,240
Laurie, what in the hell
are you doing in there?

1237
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,440
- Is she gonna ride with you?
- Mind your own business,John.

1238
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:59,280
Yeah, she's going with me.
You take care of yourself, man.

1239
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,440
You guys ready?

1240
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,880
You son of a bitch!

1241
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,040
Come on, she's gonna blow.

1242
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,960
I don't know.
Please, don't come near me.

1243
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,840
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, Steven.

1244
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,600
Oh, Steven!
Please don't leave me.

1245
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,640
- Don't leave me, please.
- I won't.

1246
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,760
I couldn't bear it.
Please.

1247
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,680
I'm not gonna leave you.

1248
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Promise me.

1249
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,520
- I promise.
- Do you?

1250
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,400
I'm not gonna leave you.

1251
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,560
That was beautiful, John.
Just beautiful.

1252
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,560
- I was losin', man.
- What?

1253
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,640
He was pulling away from me
just before he crashed.

1254
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:02,800
You're crazy! You creamed him
from right off the line.

1255
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,680
Shit, Toad! The man had me.
He was beatin' me.

1256
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,080
John, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1257
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,480
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1258
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,520
He might as well get a wheel chair
and roll himself home.

1259
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,920
Man, you got the bitchinest car
in the valley.

1260
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,760
You'll always be number one.
You're the greatest.

1261
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,400
Look at your glasses, man.

1262
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,640
Okay, Toad.

1263
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,000
We'll take 'em all.

1264
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,760
- All right.
- We'll take 'em.

1265
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,880
Let's get out of here.

1266
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,800
Jesus, what a night!

1267
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,240
- Curt?
- Yes! Yes. This is Curt.

1268
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:24,080
- Who are you?
- Who were you expecting?

1269
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,120
- Do you drive a white T-Bird?
-A white '56.

1270
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,040
I saw you on Third Street.

1271
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,560
Who are you?
Do you know me?

1272
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,360
Of course!

1273
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:37,720
- How do you know me?
- It's not important.

1274
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,440
It's important!
It's important to me.

1275
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,600
You're the most beautiful, exciting
thing I've ever seen in my life...

1276
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,800
and I don't know anything
about you.

1277
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,800
Listen, listen--

1278
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,080
- Could we meet some place?
- I cruise Third Street.

1279
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,480
Maybe I'll see you tonight.

1280
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
No, I don't think so.

1281
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,640
Tell me your name!
At least tell me your name!

1282
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:02,040
- Good-bye, Curt.
- Wait a minute!

1283
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,440
Little kiss on your ear.
Goodnight, sweet heart.

1284
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,560
I'll see you later.

1285
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,080
Oh, The Spaniels.

1286
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,560
Good-bye, son.
Call us when you get there.

1287
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,840
I'll miss you.

1288
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,760
Good luck.

1289
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,040
Same to you.

1290
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,680
- Am I gonna see you there next year?
- I'll be there.

1291
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,240
Bye-bye, Curt.

1292
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,480
Stay cool, man.

1293
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,440
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1294
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,880
I'll see you, buddy.

1295
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:09,320
You probably think you're a big shot
going off like this.

1296
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,560
But you're still a punk.

1297
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,760
Okay, John.

1298
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:18,320
- So long.
- So long!

1299
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,720
Have a good trip.
