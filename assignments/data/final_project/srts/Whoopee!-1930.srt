Sally Morgan and Sheriff Bob Wells
get married!

Whoopee! Whoopee!

00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,902

7
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,287

Hey, Sheriff Bob,

33
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,876
how do you like these
outfits we rented for your wedding?

34
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,467
You look like a bunch of
scared coyotes.

35
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,236
Why, that sick cuss
Henry Williams

36
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,936
told us this is
the right way to dress.

37
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,739
Henry Williams did, eh? Yeah!

38
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,541
Well, he was kidding you,
you dumb critters!

39
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,891
Well, if he was, we're
gonna do a little kidding ourselves

40
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,944
when we catch hold of him!

41
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,762
Come on, fellas. Let's go on.

42
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,964
Let's go get him.

43
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,564
Here's that stuff from the drugstore,
Miss Custer!

44
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:34,208
Thank you, Bud.

45
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:35,909
Costs 15 bucks.

46
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:37,811
Why, that's cheap.

47
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,043
Here's your change.

48
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:40,878
Thank you.

49
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,649
Say, is that guy Henry Williams

50
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,051
really as sick as
he thinks he is?

51
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,253
He's so full of pills,
they can't operate on him.

52
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,455
He keeps rolling off the table!

53
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,610
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, little girl.

54
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:58,745
Come on, darling!
There you are! Come on in!

55
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,782
There you go! There you are!

56
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,085
Henry Williams, what's that?

57
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,820
Condensed milk.

58
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:08,989
What are you going
to do with the calf?

59
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:15,093
Miss Custer, remember, I'm lonesome,
and I need a companion.

60
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:16,223
Well, if you want a companion,

61
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:18,230
why don't you get a nice girl?

62
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,764
Well, that's a good idea, too.

63
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,735
But I don't know,
I feel so safe with a calf.

64
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,570
Give me that.
Well, I don't mean that.

65
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:27,972
Miss Custer, leave my baby go!
Oh, please leave her go.

66
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,741
Go on, you troublemaker!

67
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:33,578
Miss Custer,

68
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,978
I don't think I'll be troubling
you much longer!

69
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,747
Don't talk like that, Henry.

70
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,483
Why, when you came west a year ago,
you may have been sick then,

71
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:41,796
but now you're as
healthy as I am!

72
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,919
Is that good?

73
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,565
There's really nothing
the matter with you.

74
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,923
Nothing the...

75
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,301
What about the pain
around my heart?

76
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,424
That'll go away.

77
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:51,027
Yeah, and I'll go with it.

78
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,230
And then how about my stomach?

79
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,764
Just a little indigestion.

80
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,617
A little indigestion!

81
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,185
My stomach is so bad

82
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:02,104
when my grandfather died,
he left me $20,000,

83
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,673
and in six weeks,
I'd spent it all on milk of magnesia.

84
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,442
Would you believe that?

85
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,377
And what about my lungs?

86
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,862
The doctor says your lungs are
practically brand new.

87
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,531
They should be.
I've never used them.

88
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,035
For nine years,
I've been breathing with my liver.

89
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:21,337
Henry, you are just
a hypochondriac!

90
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,138
Yes, am I?

91
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,518
How would you like
to see my operation?

92
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,325
No, no, sit down.

93
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:31,013
Poor Henry, let me
hold your hand.

94
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,716
It's not heavy. I can manage.
Hold your own hand.

95
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:37,186
Oh, Henry, when I
do hold your hand, like this,

96
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,754
and put my arm around you

97
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,323
and kind of snuggle
up to you like that,

98
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,758
doesn't it suggest
anything to you?

99
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,393
Yes, it does,
but with my health,

100
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,396
I'd better not think about it.

101
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,397
Sit down.

102
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,532
Henry,

103
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,101
I've been your nurse
for three years now, haven't I?

104
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:57,521
Nurse for three years.

105
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,824
Do you know why I
studied nursing?

106
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:00,925
No, why?

107
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,526
Because I'm romantic.

108
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:03,926
No.

109
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,161
Most girls like big,
strong, healthy men.

110
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,262
Husky, husky.

111
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:08,631
Yeah, but not me. No?

112
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,598
I like weak men. Oh.

113
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,953
I have a positive
passion for a weak man.

114
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,439
I suppose if I was paralyzed,
you'd be cuckoo about me, huh?

115
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,441
Silly.

116
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
Henry.

117
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:23,162
I'll bet you don't
know what today is.

118
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,880
What is today?

119
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,481
Today is Sally's wedding day.

120
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,000
Can't you feel it, Henry?
It's in the air!

121
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,403
It's all around us. Romance!

122
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,620
Look in my eyes, Henry!

123
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,755
I'm looking.

124
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,274
You know I love you.
Oh, Miss Custer!

125
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,426
And you know that
I'm sure that you love me!

126
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,860
Oh, please, Miss Custer!

127
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,946
Oh, Henry, don't you
know how I feel?

128
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,547
Henry, marry me! Put me down!

129
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,143
Put me down! Put me down.
Listen, darling!

130
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,283
Get away with your passion.

131
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,433
You give me goose pimples.

132
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,936
Will you go away? Go away.

133
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:51,419
Oh, Henry, please.

134
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,857
Please, marry me.
Why, I'd take such good care of you.

135
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,459
I'd keep you comfy and warm!

136
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,539
But it would be much cheaper
for me to get a hot water bottle.

137
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,329
Go ahead, will you, Miss Custer?

138
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:02,909
Oh, how can you hurt a person's feeling?
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,099
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

140
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,602
But you work me up to
such a pitch with your lovemaking.

141
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,304
Why do you do it?

142
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,006
You know I'm not well.

143
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:12,640
Why do you make overtures to me

144
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,274
when I need intermissions
so badly?

145
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:21,197
Besides, Miss Custer, I couldn't marry you.
I'm too delicate.

146
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:23,499
But I love you that way.

147
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:28,070
Yes, but it wouldn't be fair to our
children to be born without vitamins.

148
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,157
Oh, Miss Custer.

149
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:36,411
Oh, Henry, you must love me.

150
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,396
You're breathing so heavily.

151
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:41,032
That's not love, you fool.
That's my asthma.

152
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
Now, wait a minute.
What are you doing that for?

153
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,869
Aren't you supposed
to be my nurse?

154
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,175
What do you say, boys?

155
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,494
How are you, Wanenis?

156
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,546
Hello, Dick.
I'm glad to see you!

157
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,198
We ain't seen much
of you around here

158
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,966
since you graduated
from college.

159
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,762
Where you been?
Why, I've been down in Montana,

160
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:03,953
laying out copper mines!

161
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,355
Oh, that's right.

162
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,723
You're a regular mining engineer
now, ain't you?

163
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,092
I'm working at it.

164
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,960
How come you're here today?

165
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,895
Oh, got kind of lonesome for the
old stamping grounds

166
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,331
and all the friends I left here.

167
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,367
Sure tough that Wanenis
came back here today.

168
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,769
Why?

169
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,114
Well, the poor galoot's
been in love

170
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:24,305
with Sally ever since
they were kids.

171
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:25,873
He's part Indian,

172
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,008
and her old man wouldn't let them
get hitched.

173
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:31,528
That's why he went away!

174
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,662
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,331
Who invited you?

176
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,033
Invited me?

177
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:41,171
Why, I didn't know I
needed an invitation, Mr. Morgan.

178
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,007
I've always been
welcome here before.

179
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,308
Sally is marrying
Bob Wells today.

180
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:50,262
I shouldn't think that you would
want to be at her wedding.

181
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,964
If I were you, I'd go.

182
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,650
Your father will tell
you that I'm right.

183
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:02,339
Him right.

184
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:05,309
Maybe you come now, huh?

185
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,543
Best for you.

186
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,711
Black Eagle know.

187
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,951
Black Eagle, I must see Sally.

188
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,519
No.

189
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,904
I'm going to her. No.

190
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,195
Oh, hello, fellas.
How are you? Hello.

191
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:30,447
How's every...
How have you... Hello.

192
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,517
Hello.

193
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,958
You know, when I was a kid...

194
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,025
Nobody cares about
when you was a kid.

195
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:45,329
Say, listen, you dressed us up
like this, didn't you?

196
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,795
Well, I hope you appreciate it.

197
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,065
Yes, and to show you how much we
appreciate it,

198
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,382
we're gonna dress you up!

199
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:53,001
But I don't want
to be dressed up...

200
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,105
Wanenis.

201
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,339
Sally.

202
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:18,526
Please come down.
I must speak to you.

203
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:32,938
Wanenis.

204
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:35,374
Then you're going
to marry Bob Wells?

205
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,947
I knew this would
happen, but it hurts.

206
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,349
Father wants me to marry Bob.

207
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:48,487
And since we can't have one another,
I just don't care.

208
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,222
It's your father
who convinced me

209
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,091
that our marriage
was impossible,

210
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,192
'cause I'm an Indian.

211
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,627
Wanenis, don't.

212
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,996
I'm sorry, Sally.

213
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:02,698
I know it's wrong of me to make
you sad on your wedding day.

214
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,868
Please forgive me.

215
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:08,620
I wish you every happiness.

216
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,407
I know I can't have you.

217
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:17,178
But I can't bear the thought
of anyone else having you.

234

Sally. Sally!

235
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,976
Sally, please come back.

236
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,645
Sally.

237
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,959
Why, Wanenis,
I didn't know that was you.

238
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,745
I thought it was some
skunk prowling around.

239
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:11,483
You know, you can't be too
careful at a time like this.

240
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:26,097
I suppose you came back
to see me marry Sally?

241
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:29,499
If you'd like to take
another shot at me,

242
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,684
give me a gun,

243
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,487
and we'll shoot it out together.

244
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,823
I don't fight with Indians.

245
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,192
I don't want you hanging
around here anymore,

246
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,662
and neither does Sally.

247
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,564
Savvy? Listen, fellas.

248
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:51,470
If you see him or anyone else
trying to go up that ladder again,

249
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:55,489
next time...

250
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,769
Better you come now, huh?

251
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,555
Come, Wanenis. Come.

252
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:20,246
Miss Custer! Oh, Miss Custer!
Miss Custer! Miss Custer!

253
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,966
Where is that woman?
Where is that nurse? Miss...

254
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,249
Wanenis!

255
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,317
Hello, Henry. How are you?

256
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:27,518
Hello, Black Eagle.

257
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,919
I'm glad to see you.

258
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:30,782
Yeah, me too.
I haven't seen you in a long time.

259
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:31,973
That's right.

260
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,008
How's your health?

261
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,276
I'm sorry you asked.

262
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:37,911
Last week, I looked so terrible,

263
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:41,916
two undertakers left
a deposit on me.

264
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,884
And say, what's happened to you?
What's the matter?

265
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:48,955
It's nothing, Henry.
Just a scratch.

266
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,389
I'm in a little trouble.

267
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,176
Yeah, you're in
a little trouble.

268
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,611
All you've got is a
scratch. Look at me.

269
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,613
I've got five
dangerous ailments,

270
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,548
with hardly
a chance of recovering.

271
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:01,983
And, oh, look where
cactus is growing.

272
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,005
Henry, I'm in love.

273
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,357
That's hard luck, too.

274
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,944
Last week, I bought a suit
with two pairs of pants

275
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,579
and burned a hole in the coat.

276
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,898
But I've lost the
girl that I love,

277
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,635
and my heart is
very heavy today.

278
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,285
Your heart is heavy?

279
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:27,057
My heart is five times
the normal size.

280
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,791
But you don't understand.

281
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,560
This girl and I
grew up together.

282
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:32,796
I am an Indian!

283
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:38,634
He suffers from gas, too.
Isn't it terrible?

284
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,602
Why, Henry, a way back,
my people were chiefs.

285
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,739
Why don't you try
bicarbonate of soda?

286
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,707
You'll be a new Indian, really.

287
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,143
But I'm only a
small part Indian.

288
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,343
How small?

289
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,679
Well,
my great-grandfather married a white girl.

290
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:54,315
So did mine. What is that?

291
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,850
Did you know that
I'm a half-breed?

292
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,051
Are you a half-breed?

293
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,621
Sure. I breathe through
one side of my nose.

294
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,623
Sinus.

295
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:06,826
For this girl that I love,
I've studied the ways of your race.

296
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,459
Why, I've gone to your schools.

297
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:12,597
An Indian in a Hebrew school!
How... Oh, for heaven...

298
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:18,269
How did you get along?

299
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,838
About since I was that high,

300
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,906
I've striven to be something
among your people.

301
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,874
I know. We all have
our disappointments.

302
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,244
From the time I was this high...

303
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:27,345
That's even lower than
yours. See that?

304
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,531
I figured out someday I
might be a great aviator

305
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:32,299
like Lindbergh or Byrd.

306
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,934
But I can never be an aviator.

307
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,338
Can't eat sandwiches.

308
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:45,977
Why don't you be like me?
I've been delicate all my life,

309
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,930
but I wouldn't let any woman boss
me around, tell me what to do.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,266
Henry!

311
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,234
I'll see you boys
later, all right.

312
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:52,701
Henry Williams!

313
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,235
What are you doing
with my bloomers?

314
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:56,370
Whose bloomers?
I'm not doing anything.

315
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:58,139
Now, you keep away
from my trunk!

316
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:04,078
This is the happiest
day of my life!

317
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:07,264
You go to the mission, Bob,
and I'll fetch Sally right over.

318
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,032
She ought to be
all ready by now!

319
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,550
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

320
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,286
Wait a minute,

Sally Morgan,
why aren't you in your wedding dress?

382
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,842
Well, you see,
I'm not going to be married.

383
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,010
What?

384
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,012
Not married in the
mission, I mean.

385
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,249
Sheriff Bob doesn't want these
cowboys to get rough and boisterous.

386
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,652
So he and I are going to sneak to town,
get married there,

387
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,603
and take a train east
for our honeymoon.

388
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:36,739
Honeymoon.
That reminds me, you know,

389
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,625
my sister's husband wanted to take
her to Florida on their honeymoon,

390
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:43,578
but she's been to Florida,
so she sent a girlfriend.

391
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:46,982
Now, listen! What?

392
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,651
Sheriff Bob wants you to
drive me to the junction.

393
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,235
He'll meet us there.
I'll go in and get my bags.

394
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:54,304
Wait a minute, Sally,
I'll help you.

395
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:55,516
Don't do anything
until you hear...

396
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,875
Oh, for heaven's...
Who did that?

397
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:00,911
Who did...

398
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,034
Just a little mistake, partner.

399
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:11,371
Just a little mistake,
that's all!

400
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,409
Just a little mistake!

401
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:21,712
I suppose to you the World War
was just a typographical error!

402
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:25,466
Just a little mistake!

403
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:27,200
Henry! What?

404
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:28,681
Get my bags quickly.
All right, hurry up. I've got it, Sally.

405
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:29,970
Here, got it? Take that!

I'll be waiting for you.
Isn't she sweet?

411
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,929
Just take care of yourself.
I'll be all right.

What do you want?

414

I'll kill him!

Yes.

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,196
Well, this one just
stole my woman.

471
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,665
Get into your saddles,
because we're gonna ride him down, boys,

472
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:01,135
and then we're
gonna hang him up.

473
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:05,538
Don't let a white man get by you!

I've been asleep.
Why don't you start the car?

478

That's a good idea.

479
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:50,529
That's what I've been trying to
do for the last half an hour.

480
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,097
Have you got gas?

481

Have I got... The way I suffer?

482
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,869
Have I got gas?

483
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,119
No, no.

484
00:29:58,188 --> 00:29:59,755
I mean, have you got gasoline?

485
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:02,790
Of course I have gasoline.

486
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,392
How do you think we came here,
with ketchup?

487
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:09,529
This shows that I
have gasoline, here.

488
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,066
Oh, for the... Not a drop.

489
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,334
I'm not well.

490
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,841
I thought you'd be
the man to help me.

491
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,945
I thought you'd be
the man to save me.

492
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:27,745
And you didn't even know
enough to fill your gas tank!

493
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,848
Oh, for the love of...
What's the matter?

494
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,217
I haven't any more
circulation than a herring.

495
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:36,821
Here you are, bawling me out,
and my temperature drops to normal!

496
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,759
If you keep me out in
these mountains all night,

497
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:43,861
you won't have to worry
about your health,

498
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,563
because Bob Wells will kill you!

499
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:49,699
What do you mean?
I do him a favor, and he'll kill me?

500
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,935
I take you to the sheriff
so he can marry you,

501
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,671
and he's gonna shoot me
because I run out of gasoline!

502
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,442
Henry, you might as
well know the truth.

503
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,976
You're not taking
me to the sheriff.

504
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:02,761
You're taking me away from him!

505
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,129
I'm...

506
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,799
Oh, I see. You just
left out the details.

507
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:11,002
And I left a note saying
that I had eloped with you.

508
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,270
You did what?

509
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,006
Sally Morgan,
I'm going to tear you limb from limb.

510
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,709
Henry,
I did it because I thought you'd help me.

511
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:20,211
I thought you were brave.

512
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:24,698
I'm not brave.
I can't even help myself.

513
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:28,652
Sally Morgan,
I came out here to die.

514
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,136
Then it's all right,

515
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,556
because if Bob Wells catches us,
you'll get your wish.

516
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,190
But I don't want to
die from Bob Wells!

517
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,402
I want to die
from my sicknesses.

518
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,559
That's what I want to die from.

519
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:39,428
I want to die in bed,

520
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,937
and I want to have
doctors and nurses

521
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,331
and flowers and a little fruit.

522
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,665
That's what I want.

523
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,201
Oh, for heaven's...

524
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,536
See, you've got me
nervous and jumpy.

525
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,150
What am I going to do
if the sheriff comes?

526
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,472
Take this! Put it away!

527
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:55,110
I can't stand the sight of a gun.
I hate guns! Put it away.

528
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,012
I don't like guns.

529
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,413
Even when somebody says "son of a gun,"
I almost faint.

530
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,515
Sally Morgan,

531
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,383
I'm going to take you
back to the sheriff.

532
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:07,588
Rather than go back
to him, I'll marry you.

533
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:09,422
Two proposals in one day.

534
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,224
It's that tonic.
It's that tonic!

535
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:12,958
Henry, I mean it.

536
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,093
Why don't you marry me
and take me east?

537
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,428
It's impossible.

538
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:17,731
You know,

539
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,300
we wouldn't really have
to be man and wife.

540
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,869
Secretly, we can be
just good friends!

541
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:26,304
Yeah, but I can't keep a secret.

542
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,560
And furthermore, you know,
people will talk.

543
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,628
And you've always
been a good girl.

544
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,230
Don't you think I am still?

545
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,298
Well, I do, but...

546
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:38,464
But what?

547
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:40,635
When is a good girl
not a good girl?

548
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,537
Nine times out of ten.

549
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:47,072
Henry, you're only fooling.

550
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:50,275
You've never really
been in love.

551
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,244
I haven't?

552
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,213

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,493
Henry, let's lie down
and go to sleep.

592
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:59,164
I wouldn't sleep.

593
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:02,068
Sally, you lie down
and go to sleep.

594
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:03,970
Let me stay here
and fix the car,

595
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,338
borrow some gasoline,
and maybe we'll be on our way.

596
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,407
See, Sally?

597
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:09,690
Go on.

598
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:13,927
Right to sleepy.

599
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,710
Good night, Sally.

600
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,344
Good night, Henry.

601
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,780
Do you want to go
right to sleep?

602
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,067
Yes.

603
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:49,993
And the mama skunk
was walking along

604
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:52,430
with the four little
baby skunks.

605
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,164
And one of the baby skunks
said to the mama skunk,

606
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:59,869
"Oh, Mama.
Look, here comes a great big bear."

607
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:04,342
And the mama skunk says, "Children,
let us pray. Let us pray."

608
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,387
What are you doing?

609
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,353
Hello! Say, look out
there! Let us pass!

610
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,843
Don't block the road, please!

611
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:45,396
What is it? What has happened?

612
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,264
Oh, look, it's a big Lincoln.

613
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,884
Say, can we have some gasoline?

614
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,853
Hey, you. Get out of the way.

615
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:57,188
I can't stand this.
I'm a very nervous man.

616
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:59,290
He's a nervous man.

617
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,126
All we need is two
gallons of gasoline.

618
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:03,861
We haven't any gas to give away!

619
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,229
If you had any sense,

620
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:06,993
you'd carry an extra can
in country like this!

621
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,734
Do you? Why, of course we do.

622
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,968
You do and you refuse to help.
Shame on you!

623
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,671
Never mind,
clear out of the way.

624
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:14,404
I say, my man,
that's a good old thing.

625
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:17,007
Chase that bug off the road.

626
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:20,811
The bug. Chase the bug...

627
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:30,803
How do you like that?
"Chase the bug off the road."

628
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:32,049
Of course, you can't
be expected to know

629
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:33,183
the nervous condition
that I am in.

630
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:35,606
Stop that. Stop that!

631
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:37,376
Hey, you going to
get out of our way,

632
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:38,655
or do I chase that
flivver up the mountain?

633
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,822
Didn't I tell you
I need gasoline?

634
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,581
Will you go and
get out of the way...

635
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:50,431
Would you stop it?
I'm telling you.

636
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:51,732
Stop.
Give me something, give me...

637
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,085
Here. What are you giving me?
What is it?

638
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:54,207
Don't shoot!

639
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:56,426
Get up, up, up, up.
Not you, you fool!

640
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,597
And no funny movements, either.

641
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,632
Say, you can't shoot
a man like me!

642
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,800
Shall I try?

643
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,936
No. No.
Get out of the car, everybody.

644
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,070
Line up front, come on.

645
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,450
We'll let you have
a couple of gallons.

646
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:10,873
Yes. You'll let me have
anything that I want.

647
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:12,574
Father, he doesn't
know who you are!

648
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,477
Who cares? What's that?

649
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,611
Driver! Yes, sir!

650
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,212
Get a can of gasoline. Yes, sir.

651
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:19,013
Follow me! Yes, sir.

652
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,521
Now, then, pour the
gasoline in my tank!

653
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,539
Yes, sir.

654
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:31,376
Don't forget, my partner up there
is looking at you with a gun.

655
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:33,153
If you do anything funny,
he'll fill you full of lead.

656
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:34,411
Yes, sir.

657
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,879
And, you, take this gun.

658
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:38,598
If this fellow bats an eye,
you shoot, and shoot to kill.

659
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,701
What's that, Morris?

660
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,602
I'll tell them.
Never mind, I'll tell them.

661
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,557
My partner up there
said that somebody here

662
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,069
wasn't holding up their
hands high enough.

663
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:51,426
What partner?

664
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:52,638
My partner, he's up there.
You want to hear him?

665
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:54,363
Yes. You up there, Morris?

666
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:55,362
"You bet I am."
Shall I get him?

667
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,471
"All right." See you later.

668
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:57,715
"All right." Goodbye. "Bye."

669
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:59,516
Good night. Oh, help!

670
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:01,030
Help! Help! What was that?
Who did it?

671
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:02,186
Help! Help!

672
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,654
Take care of yourself.

673
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,357
What's the matter?
Were you scared?

674
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,057
- Pick up that can.
- Yes, sir.

675
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,325
Get over here. Yes, sir.

676
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:09,827
Get over here with that!
Yes, sir.

677
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:11,528
You've got the better of us now,

678
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:14,432
but in an hour, I'll have the sheriff
of this county on your trail.

679
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,011
You'll have who?
The sheriff of this county!

680
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:17,874
What do I care?
He's under an obligation to me.

681
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,814
You think I'm afraid of a sheriff?
And you bet he'll get you.

682
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,771
He's a regular man-hunter,
that fellow Bob Wells.

683
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,922
Bob Wells!

684
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,861
Here. Here.

685
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,930
Give me the gun, all of you.

686
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
Thought I dropped
the gun, did you?

687
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:37,797
Each one of you four,
get around to the tires.

688
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:39,488
Yes, sir.
Unscrew the valves,

689
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,854
put in the small end
and leak the air out.

690
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,923
When I say, "One, two,"
take her out.

691
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,427
Now, get around
in front of my car!

692
00:40:47,496 --> 00:40:48,774
I'll be hanged if I do!
Turn around,

693
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:50,341
or I'll shoot you right
through the heart.

694
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,464
Go ahead. Get around there.
Get around there.

695
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,335
Now, old man. I've got
a surprise for you!

696
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:59,239
What is it? What?
Crank my flivver!

697
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:00,573
Me, crank a flivver?

698
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,908
Go on, you old crank.

699
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:02,975
I'm a sick man!

700
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,342
You're sick?

701
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,843
I'd love to show
you my operation!

702
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:07,394
Would you... Go ahead, crank it.

703
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:09,965
Go on. Get around there, crank it.
Crank it. Come on.

704
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,050
Boy, that's terrible.

705
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,053
Well, I told you.
I ain't no cook.

706
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,222
Say, why don't you try it?

707
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,824
Oh, there's nothing
female about me, Mort.

708
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:40,842
Now, listen. I'm in a fine fix.

709
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:44,580
The boss is expected here today,
and last night the cook lights out on me.

710
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:48,633
And if I don't find a new cook,
I'll have to find a new job.

711
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,443
Get out, get out, Sally.
Get out, Sally Morgan.

712
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,010
What's the matter?

713
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,414
I smell cooking.

714
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,616
I hope we can get
something to eat here.

715
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:08,751
I'm starved. You're starved.

716
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,786
I want to tell you something,
Sally Morgan.

717
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:13,622
I've had a piece of toast,
two pieces of asparagus,

718
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:16,459
and a bottle of Bromo-Seltzer
since Easter Sunday.

719
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:17,676
Would you believe that?

720
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:20,562
Henry,
you'd better take those glasses off!

721
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,397
Why, don't be silly.
I can't. Why not?

722
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:23,965
With my eyes?

723
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:25,312
Even when I
go to sleep at night,

724
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,568
I've got to keep my glasses on.

725
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:28,436
What for?
So I can recognize the people

726
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,088
I dream about. Silly.

727
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:32,690
Henry, please take
the glasses off!

728
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,459
Oh, all right.

729
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,828
And whatever you do,
don't use our right name!

730
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:38,361
Well, of course not.
Come in with me.

731
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,763
I'll get you something to eat.

732
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:41,031
Hello! Hello!

733
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,265
Hello. Hello.

734
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,785
Oh, look, it's the new zeppelin!

735
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,129
Say, I'm nervous,
and we're very hungry.

736
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:47,513
We'd like to have
something to eat.

737
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,456
Oh, you would? Yes, personally,

738
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,157
I'd like some hot
water and prunes,

739
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:52,526
bananas and cream, corn flakes,

740
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:54,159
and boiled eggs, two minutes.

741
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,640
If they're two and a half minutes,
I can't eat it,

742
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:57,462
because the acidity
presses against my heart,

743
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,098
and I've got to take six
Bell-Ans in hot water.

744
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,966
Say, who are you?
What's your name?

745
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:04,236
Henry. Henry what?

746
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:05,971
Ford. Well, Mr. Ford.

747
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,972
I've heard of you
some place before.

748
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,407
This is Mrs. Ford, of course!

749
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,153
Of course.
You see, we've just been married.

750
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:13,077
She's one of those new Fords.

751
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:16,947
Gosh. That's great! Hey!

752
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:19,281
I'll be all right.
Just let me take a nap.

753
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:20,949
I feel good.
I feel good. Go ahead.

754
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,884
I bet you're a great cook,
Mrs. Ford.

755
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,005
Why,
I've never cooked a thing in my life!

756
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:26,273
Can you cook? Can I cook?

757
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,040
That's swell.

758
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,820
You get the job.
We need a cook, and you're it.

759
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:32,109
But... Now, don't argue.
Get to work.

760
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,245
It's exactly 7:00.

761
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:34,979
7:00!

762
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:37,326
I'm glad you... I've gotta take two pills.
I've gotta take two pills.

763
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,653
And at 8:00,
I expect you to have breakfast ready.

764
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,686
Now, don't try to get away.

765
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,855
Your flivver will be
locked up in the garage,

766
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:48,125
and I'm still pretty
handy with a six-shooter.

767
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:50,761
Look, mister,
I can't stand anything heavy on my stomach.

768
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:51,949
Would you mind taking that...

769
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:53,408
Get it! Get it!
Hey! Get it! Here, here!

770
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,298
Here you are. Here you are.
There you are.

771
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,366
You'll have to cut out this fooling,
both of you.

772
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,669
And get to work.

773
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,880
Now, here's a cook's
hat and coat.

774
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,136
Yes, sir. Missus.

775
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,957
You set the table in
the patio, out yonder.

776
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,760
Say, what... What
are you gonna cook?

777
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:10,980
Well, I don't know.
For instance, tell me, what would you like?

778
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,681
Well, a waffle would
hit me all right.

779
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,195
All right, I'll hit
you with a waffle.

780
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,261
I don't mind what
I hit you with.

781
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:19,821
Oh, my nerves.
What a place! What a mess!

782
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,989
Yes, and the worst
part of it is,

783
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:23,759
we've committed highway robbery.

784
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:25,259
We could go to prison for that!

785
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,205
Prison. Have they got doctors in prison?
Why, yes.

786
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:28,963
I'll be all right.
I'll get along.

787
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,242
I'll be all right.
But they'll give you 20 years.

788
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,166
Twenty years...

789
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:33,235
What are you laughing at?

790
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:34,668
Why, the joke's on them. Why?

791
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:37,903
I can't live but six months.

792
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:41,172
Oh, golly.

793
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:44,243
You know, I never made
a waffle in my life.

794
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:45,895

Don't ask so many questions.

815
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:45,654
You remind me of
my nurse when you...

816
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:47,221
Oh, have you a nurse?

817
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,357
I did have, but I
got rid of the pest.

818
00:46:49,426 --> 00:46:50,592
She was a pest, huh?

819
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:51,804
She was. She was
worse than a pest.

820
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:53,245
She was a seven-minute
boiled egg.

821
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:54,945
She was a blonde weasel.

822
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,591
She was a phooey.
That's what she was, that woman.

823
00:46:56,615 --> 00:46:58,259
Hey, you're not fooling me.
I know you're Henry Williams.

824
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,895
Henry... Who the...
What the... How the...

825
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,169
I did not. I did not.

826
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,370
Now, where's Sally Morgan?

827
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:03,803
Why, how do I know what Sally...

828
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,638
Isn't she here?
Why, no, honestly. No!

829
00:47:05,707 --> 00:47:07,907
But you love her, don't you?

830
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:09,424
No, no, no.

831
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:11,277
I could kiss you for that.

832
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:13,108
Why do you want to kiss me?
What kind of a cowboy are you?

833
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:14,797
Henry, look, don't you know me?

834
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:15,998
Miss Custer.

835
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,499
So, I'm a blonde weasel, huh?

836
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,667
Say... A phooey.

837
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,135
I knew you all the time.
Oh, yeah.

838
00:47:20,203 --> 00:47:21,631
You didn't fool me.
You knew me, huh?

839
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:23,199
Pick up your hat, go ahead.
Go ahead, pick it up. Pick it up.

840
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:24,789
Listen, Henry. Listen to me.

841
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:27,593
Do you know that the cowboys and
the sheriff are on your trail?

842
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,893
Sure. They're all on my trail.

843
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:30,689
Will you do me a favor, Miss Custer?
Why, sure.

844
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,224
Go and tell them that
everything is all right.

845
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:33,793
Will you, please?
Will you go and tell them?

846
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,628
Oh, Henry,
did I ever refuse to do anything for you?

847
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,095
No, you haven't.
But this is the one time when

848
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,331
I need you more...
You know what I'm like, Henry.

849
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,997
If I didn't need you...
For three long years,

850
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:41,399
I've watched over you like a little baby.
When I say...

851
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:44,774
Henry, stop that
and listen to me.

852
00:47:44,843 --> 00:47:47,359
Don't you know anything at all?
Everybody's after you.

853
00:47:47,428 --> 00:47:48,562
Sure. Yes!

854
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:50,363
But listen, if Sally
isn't here with you,

855
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,030
I'll protect you with my life.

856
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:53,166
Yes, yes.

857
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:55,034
But if she is here,
heaven help you.

858
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:56,686
You're such a darling,
Miss Custer.

859
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:57,898
You're always trying to help me.

860
00:47:57,922 --> 00:47:58,922
I love you, Henry.

861
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,724
Well, I'll be.
Say, what is this?

862
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:04,324
Why, it's nothing.
I'm getting a treatment.

863
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,627
This is my nurse. Nurse?

864
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:07,505
Well, you'll need a real
nurse and a few doctors, too,

865
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:09,064
if I don't get something to eat.

866
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:10,598
Where's them waffles?
What waffles?

867
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,161
Why, I'll sock you...
Hey, just wait a minute.

868
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:13,817
Don't you dare touch him.

869
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:15,519
Why, he's sick. He's delicate.

870
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:17,153
Don't you lay a hand on him.

871
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:18,738
One blow might kill him.

872
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,856
Oh, Henry, dear.

873
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:23,592
Go, get somebody, quick.

874
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:25,095
He's fainted. Henry!

875
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,921
Get the baggage upstairs.
Chester, phone Sheriff Bob Wells

876
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,523
to get here at once. Right-o.

877
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:40,041
Oh, it's him!

878
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,579
What... Oh, my nerves,
my nerves.

879
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:46,713
It's him, all right.

880
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:48,214
You get back up there!

881
00:48:48,284 --> 00:48:51,384
Where? Where? Where am I?

882
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:54,337
Mr. Underwood,
welcome home to Bar M Ranch!

883
00:48:54,406 --> 00:48:56,473
Welcome? This is a fine welcome!

884
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:59,609
Held up, insulted,
I haven't had anything to eat.

885
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:01,044
My nerves are all shattered.

886
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:02,410
Get me some breakfast.

887
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,345
Yes, sir, there's the cook,
right there, sir.

888
00:49:04,414 --> 00:49:06,533
Would you care to have
some nice waffles?

889
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:08,167
No, no, no.

890
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,068
I'm a very nervous man,
and I need plenty of nourishment.

891
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:13,637
Get me some buckwheat cakes,
fried chicken, fried potatoes,

892
00:49:13,706 --> 00:49:16,574
beans, corn, pudding, salad,
and a nice cup of coffee.

893
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:20,179
What? No cereal?

894
00:49:20,246 --> 00:49:22,745
Say, where have I
seen you before?

895
00:49:22,816 --> 00:49:24,732
Why, in some hospital.

896
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:26,549
You've been in a hospital?
All of them.

897
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:27,696
What's the matter with you?
Oh, nothing.

898
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,919
Just let me take a
nap. I'm all right.

899
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:31,589
I feel good, now. I feel good.

900
00:49:31,658 --> 00:49:33,606
But I do have trouble
with my stomach.

901
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:36,809
Every night for 19 years,
I've had to take bicarbonate of soda.

902
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,277
That's nothing.

903
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,246
I've had stomach trouble all my life.
No?

904
00:49:40,315 --> 00:49:41,408
Look at the coat on my tongue.

905
00:49:41,432 --> 00:49:44,333
Yeah, look at the pants on mine.

906
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:46,768
Say, I've had pneumonia
four times.

907
00:49:46,837 --> 00:49:49,272
Ha! I'm even with you.
I've had double pneumonia twice.

908
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:51,339
Sit down. Pull up a chair.

909
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,827
My boy, did you ever
have the hives?

910
00:49:56,896 --> 00:49:58,496
The hives?

911
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:01,499
I've had the itch and a
broken arm at the same time.

912
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:07,737
For a sinus operation,
I was under ether one hour and 45 minutes!

913
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:09,406
An hour and 45 minutes? Yes.

914
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,274
And you think you were under ether?
Yes.

915
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,576
Mister, they gave you vanilla.

916
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:14,978
I'm going to tell you something.

917
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,547
I had an operation
of water on the knee.

918
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:20,282
Look at this bump I got from an
operation of water on the knee.

919
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,416
See this bump here?

920
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,696
From an operation
of water on the knee?

921
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,952
Yes, sir, they ran out of ether.

922
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:28,390
See the bump here? See it?

923
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,759
Are you going to have
any more operations?

924
00:50:30,826 --> 00:50:32,560
What do you think the doctor said?
What?

925
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,697
Doctor said if I have one more operation,
he's gonna put in a zipper.

926
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,464
A zipper, like that.

927
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:45,939
I got a scar, six inches long,
from appendicitis operation.

928
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:47,801
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm gonna show you a scar.

929
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:49,225
You think you've got a scar?

930
00:50:49,294 --> 00:50:51,845
I'm gonna show you something,
my dear man, that will amaze you.

931
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:54,963
Here is really a scar from an operation.
You see that?

932
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:56,165
Now, look down here, see that?

933
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:57,900
All the way down to the leg?

934
00:50:57,969 --> 00:50:59,668
You see it?
Let me take a look at yours.

935
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:01,737
Listen, I'm ready
to prove to you.

936
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:03,271
Here, does this show?

937
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,540
Wait a minute, see that?

938
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:05,868
Now, wait a minute,
I wanna show you.

939
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,126
See this? 51, is that good?

940
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,761
Yes, but, my boy,
look at this one.

941
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:10,928
Come down here.
Just let me show you an operation.

942
00:51:10,997 --> 00:51:13,999
You see that, can you see how
far down that operation goes?

943
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:15,600
Now, can you see it?

944
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:18,268
Say, now, let me see.
Let me see your operation.

945
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,887
For goodness...
Oh, for heaven's...

946
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:22,356
I don't even think
you had an operation!

947
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:26,159
Can you see it now?
See what I mean? There you are.

948
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:34,334
Yes, sir, my boy,
that is some operation.

949
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,236
I'll say so.

950
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,304
Tell me, what did
your operation cost?

951
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:40,639
$200.

952
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:41,907
$200?

953
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:45,795
That's nothing.
Mine cost $2,400.

954
00:51:45,862 --> 00:51:46,961
How much?

955
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,697
$2,400.

956
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:51,665
Do you mind if I take one more
little peek at it, like...

957
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,502
Oh, well, no wonder!

958
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:56,236
You've got hemstitching.

959
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:05,945
Sally,
the sheriff and his men are coming.

960
00:52:06,014 --> 00:52:07,814
I cut through the hills
to beat them here.

961
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:09,648
They're going to hang
Henry Williams. No!

962
00:52:09,718 --> 00:52:12,119
Now, if you love him,
go, and go quickly.

963
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:15,071
But I don't love him.

964
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,473
Why did you elope with him?

965
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:20,942
Because I couldn't
marry Bob Wells.

966
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,812
I don't love him.

967
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:27,314
If you don't love Henry Williams,
if you don't love Bob Wells,

968
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:28,899
who do you love?

969
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:31,102
Last night, when
we were together,

970
00:52:31,169 --> 00:52:33,070
I knew I could never
marry anyone else.

971
00:52:33,138 --> 00:52:34,238
Sally.

972
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:36,572
Take me away with you
into the mountains.

973
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:37,940
I'll live the way
of your people.

974
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:40,576
I can't do that, Sally.
You'd be an outcast!

975
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:42,279
Oh, I don't care
what they'd say.

976
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:45,915
But don't you realize that if I let
you make this sacrifice for me,

977
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:48,216
I wouldn't be
worthy of your love.

978
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,720
It can't be, Sally.
This is the end.

979
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:56,325
Wanenis.

980
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:09,136
The Epsom did it.

981
00:53:18,497 --> 00:53:20,796
♪ I'm making waffles ♪

982
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:26,603
Hey, Mr. Underwood,
the sheriff is coming.

983
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,137
Sheriff Bob Wells is here!

984
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,240
Who did you say?
Sheriff Bob Wells.

985
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,924
Bob Wells! Oh, for...

986
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:41,366
Listen, fellas,
we pack them here.

987
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,168
You know the fella I'm after.

988
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:44,534
Look over the ranch.

989
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:46,171
Watch the roads.

990
00:53:46,238 --> 00:53:49,740
And don't let a white man get by you.
You get me?

991
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,726
Don't let a white
man get by you.

992
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:02,935
Sally Morgan?

993
00:54:03,004 --> 00:54:04,987
How dare you speak to me?

994
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:06,988
What the... Don't you know me?

995
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:08,457
Henry?

996
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:09,858
Henry Williams?

997
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:12,760
Well, of course...
Well, who am I, Amos 'n Andy?

998
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:15,030
Why, your disguise is perfect.

999
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:16,176
How did you ever think of it?

1000
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,199
You mean the black?

1001
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:18,766
Yes. I didn't.

1002
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:21,302
I got in the stove,
and somebody else thought of it.

1003
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:25,773
Sally Morgan?

1004
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:28,275
You've been crying.
Now, what's the trouble?

1005
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:29,609
I wish I were dead.

1006
00:54:29,678 --> 00:54:30,776
Don't say that.

1007
00:54:30,845 --> 00:54:32,312
I wish I'd never been born.

1008
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:33,725
You could have said that first
and saved yourself a wish.

1009
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:35,749
You know that, don't you?

1010
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:40,369
Henry, if you loved a person,
and they were of Indian blood...

1011
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:42,572
I can't stand the
sight of any blood.

1012
00:54:42,641 --> 00:54:44,318
We've no time to fool around.
The sheriff is here.

1013
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:45,474
And he's come to hang you.

1014
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:46,608
Well, let's not
hang around here.

1015
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,693
Here. Who are you?

1016
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:49,846
The waitress.

1017
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:51,312
Who are you? The cook.

1018
00:54:51,381 --> 00:54:52,479
Where's my breakfast?

1019
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:54,249
Your breakfast, ha!

1020
00:54:54,316 --> 00:54:56,228
I didn't eat myself yet.
His breakfast... Come on, Sally.

1021
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:59,687
Andy, what kind of
a cook have you got?

1022
00:54:59,756 --> 00:55:02,457
Oh, Dad,
I found the bandit's flivver...

1023
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,911
What are you doing here?

1024
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:08,679
Whose flivver is this?

1025
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:11,447
I don't... No!

1026
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,151
What's the matter with you?

1027
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:16,401
Are you crazy?

1028
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:18,504
No!

1029
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:22,893
Just as a precaution,

1030
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,061
I think I'd better have the
sheriff arrest you, don't you?

1031
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,396
Yes!

1032
00:55:27,463 --> 00:55:29,014
Sally, get into the flivver.

1033
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:32,017
I'll be with you in a minute,
and don't move until I get back!

1034
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,754
There must have been
a dozen bandits,

1035
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:39,790
and every one looked
like a killer to me!

1036
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:44,011
Don't worry, Mr. Underwood,
Sheriff Bob Wells always gets his man!

1037
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:51,033
Hey, you. Come here!

1038
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:07,299
Where you from?

1039
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:08,600
We moved.

1040
00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:09,835
Yeah?

1041
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:11,769
What's your name?

1042
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:13,271
Rudy Vallee.

1043
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:15,740
Who is this fella?

1044
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,091
He works for me.

1045
00:56:17,093 --> 00:56:18,191
He's a cook.

1046
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,810
Yes, sir, but I
is a singing cook.

1047
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah. Well, I got an idea
maybe you ain't no cook at all.

1048
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,916
Maybe you don't sing, either.

1049
00:56:26,985 --> 00:56:29,770

1109
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:12,434
I didn't do anything.

1110
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:14,168
Don't tell me that.
I know different.

1111
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,336
Yeah, what about it?

1112
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,072
Search those guys.

1113
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:22,293
I'm ticklish!

1114
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:23,527
Let me do it to you, Sheriff!

1115
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:26,063
Why, I'll smash you one...

1116
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,165
Line up some chairs here.

1117
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,201
I want to question them.

1118
00:59:33,105 --> 00:59:35,604
And sit down.

1119
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:36,884
Now listen, you
guys, all of you...

1120
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,457
Pardon me, if you'll allow me,

1121
00:59:38,526 --> 00:59:41,294
I will quickly discover which of
these three men is the guilty one.

1122
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,361
How?

1123
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,729
By applying psychology,

1124
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:45,899
if you'll have them do
exactly as I tell them.

1125
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:47,482
They'll do as they're told.

1126
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:49,650
This is a little
psychological experiment.

1127
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,721
I studied the method
in my college laboratory.

1128
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,257
Hold these, please.

1129
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:57,359
I'm going to read your
most secret thoughts

1130
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,126
by what is known as the
association of ideas.

1131
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,808
If you can read my thoughts,
you oughta kick me in the face right away.

1132
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,564
Quiet.

1133
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:06,713
Well, I propose to know not
what you want to tell me,

1134
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,235
but what you're
trying to keep from me.

1135
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:12,438
Pardon me.
Did you ever tiptoe through the tulips?

1136
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:14,474
Oh, Esther. Sit down.

1137
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:16,409
Good boy, Chester.
I'm proud of you.

1138
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:18,010
Thank you, Father.

1139
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,278
Look,
he just met his father for the first time.

1140
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:25,017
Have you seen your mother yet?

1141
01:00:25,086 --> 01:00:26,986
I haven't any proper
mechanical apparatus,

1142
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:28,287
but I can use a substitute.

1143
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:29,421
Use your old man.

1144
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:30,522
What?

1145
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,856
Allow me.

1146
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:33,624
You will all hold
your clenched fists

1147
01:00:33,693 --> 01:00:35,594
directly out in
front of you, so.

1148
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:37,628
Upon these fists,
the sheriff will place

1149
01:00:37,697 --> 01:00:39,931
one of these china plates, thus.

1150
01:00:39,999 --> 01:00:41,932
Then, I'm going to ask
you a few questions.

1151
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:44,313
Then, you're going to hear the
cutest answers you ever heard.

1152
01:00:44,337 --> 01:00:45,935
Quiet.

1153
01:00:46,004 --> 01:00:48,872
When I speak the word associated
in your mind with your guilt,

1154
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,690
you will drop the
plates. You must.

1155
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:52,526
Pardon me.
Have you seen my operation?

1156
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:56,061
Sit down and hold out your fists,
all of you!

1157
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,331
Oh, we're gonna have waffles.

1158
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,800
Oh, shut up.

1159
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:13,411
The muscular reaction
of the normal person

1160
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,214
acts independent of
the subject's will.

1161
01:01:16,283 --> 01:01:17,831
Says which?

1162
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:20,599
I said,
the muscular reaction of the normal person

1163
01:01:20,669 --> 01:01:23,169
acts independent of
the subject's will.

1164
01:01:23,238 --> 01:01:25,039
Except February, which has 28.

1165
01:01:25,106 --> 01:01:26,189
Shut up!

1166
01:01:28,126 --> 01:01:30,058
Now, listen.
Which one of you men

1167
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,462
has ever been called a scholar?

1168
01:01:33,964 --> 01:01:35,197
A poet?

1169
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:36,598
A philosopher?

1170
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:39,834
Which one of you men has
ever been called a thief?

1171
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:48,577
Oh, the sheriff is a thief.

1172
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:50,412
Why, what's the meaning of this?

1173
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:52,579
Go on,
pull up a chair for the sheriff.

1174
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:54,764
Quiet! I'm not on trial here.

1175
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,400
We'll resume.

1176
01:01:57,469 --> 01:02:01,938
Dog, cat, cow, wolf,
lion, leopard...

1177
01:02:02,007 --> 01:02:04,274
He's a salesman
for animal crackers.

1178
01:02:04,343 --> 01:02:05,807
Shut up.

1179
01:02:05,877 --> 01:02:10,897
Automobile, Ford car,
Illinois state license, garage...

1180
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:12,615
That one's guilty.
Take him away!

1181
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:14,016
Lock him up!

1182
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,454
Good boy, Chester.

1183
01:02:20,523 --> 01:02:22,440
Isn't he wonderful?

1184
01:02:22,509 --> 01:02:24,760
Go on, Chester!

1185
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:30,680
May not even be his boy!

1186
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:39,055
Doctor, parson, sailor, thief...

1187
01:02:39,124 --> 01:02:41,575
Pardon me, are you
wearing a girdle?

1188
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:42,708
Quiet.

1189
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:46,863
Love is sweet.

1190
01:02:50,986 --> 01:02:52,618
The air is soft.

1191
01:02:53,388 --> 01:02:55,888
The wind blows.

1192
01:02:56,723 --> 01:02:58,457
The waves...

1193
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,102
Sit down there,
or I'll bust you in the nose.

1194
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:01,336
Who do you think you're kidding?

1195
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,071
Don't you know I'm the
sheriff of this outfit?

1196
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:05,664
Look down.
Look down, below is sin.

1197
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:08,267
Above is virtue,
look up. Look up.

1198
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:09,735
Let the thief be known.

1199
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:11,168
Let him be known.

1200
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:20,444
Hold him, too.

1201
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:23,829
Only one left.

1202
01:03:23,897 --> 01:03:25,897
Well, I guess I won
the spelling bee!

1203
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:27,033
Sit down!

1204
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:30,852
Do you dare answer the
questions I ask you?

1205
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:32,955
Yes, you smothered lamb chop.

1206
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:35,958
Now, I'll speak one word.

1207
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:37,992
You answer at once
with just one word

1208
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:39,927
suggested by the word I speak.

1209
01:03:40,663 --> 01:03:41,797
Ready?

1210
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:42,931
Shoot!

1211
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,931
Sun! Hot!

1212
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,064
Rain! Wet!

1213
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:46,167
Crime! Jail!

1214
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:47,401
Sheriff! Boob!

1215
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,102
What?

1216
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,671
Sit down. It came out of me.

1217
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,039
I can't help myself.

1218
01:03:52,107 --> 01:03:53,790
Sit down!

1219
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:55,579
Dad, this man is innocent.
If he was guilty,

1220
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:57,370
he could never hold those
plates under my questioning.

1221
01:03:57,394 --> 01:04:00,063
I thought you were gonna find
out who committed this holdup.

1222
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,965
My boy, you made a mistake.

1223
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:04,099
Henry Williams, I know you.

1224
01:04:04,168 --> 01:04:06,436
Oh, but please don't give me away,
Miss Custer.

1225
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,136
How did you ever keep
those plates from falling?

1226
01:04:09,205 --> 01:04:10,638
I knew what he was going to do,

1227
01:04:10,707 --> 01:04:12,674
so I put glue on my
fists. That's all.

1228
01:04:12,743 --> 01:04:15,243
There you are.

1229
01:04:15,312 --> 01:04:17,658
Tell that to me.
Henry Williams knows something about this,

1230
01:04:17,682 --> 01:04:19,447
more than he's telling you.

1231
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:21,093
They're gonna find
out about him pretty soon.

1232
01:04:21,117 --> 01:04:23,383
Say, boys, if you find Henry,
promise you won't hurt him,

1233
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:25,619
or I won't invite
you to our wedding.

1234
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:27,233
We didn't know you were
gonna marry Henry.

1235
01:04:27,257 --> 01:04:28,923
He doesn't know it.

1236
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:33,777
But, gee, Miss Custer,
we ain't got clothes for no wedding.

1237
01:04:33,846 --> 01:04:36,078

1257
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,452
Did you find Henry Williams?

1258
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,537
No, there's not
a trace of him here.

1259
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,639
Hello, Sheriff.

1260
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:52,834
Henry Williams!

1261
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:53,968
Henry Williams!

1262
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:54,952
Henry Williams!

1263
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:56,354
I'll kill him!

1264
01:09:56,423 --> 01:09:58,022
No. I'll kill him.

1265
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:59,990
After what he did to me,
I'll kill him.

1266
01:10:00,058 --> 01:10:01,976
Well, make up your mind.
Who's gonna do it?

1267
01:10:02,043 --> 01:10:04,143
Why, you...
Say, listen here, you...

1268
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:43,447
A fine bunch of
cowards you guys are,

1269
01:10:43,517 --> 01:10:46,616
running away from a
pill-chewing tenderfoot.

1270
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:47,700
Come on!

1271
01:10:49,888 --> 01:10:51,088
Sheriff, don't.

01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:54,473
Come out of there, you pop-eyed,
anemic, dying frog.

1273
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:59,579
If you ain't out by the time I count three,
I'll fill you full of lead.

01:10:59,646 --> 01:11:01,480

01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,277

You have tried the way of the white man,
and you know that it is bad.

1282
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:48,856
Forget white people.

01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:48,871
I read the <i>True Story</i> magazine.

1325
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:53,375
Pocahontas save John Smith.

1326
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:56,477
Yeah, why didn't she do
something for his brother Al?

1327
01:14:58,246 --> 01:14:59,580

01:15:19,566 --> 01:15:22,533
Pardon me,
is that a wind-blown bob you have?

1333
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:28,005
Say, look, since you
got your hair cut,

1334
01:15:28,074 --> 01:15:30,708
how do you keep your wig warm?

1335
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:33,461
See, you're still doing that.

1336
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,240
If you took that bicarbonate
of soda when I told you,

1337
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,431
you'd have been all right now.

1338
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,851
Oh,
I'm afraid I'll have to leave the room.

1339
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,143
No, stay!

1340
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,209
Oh, Chief, please.
Where's your wigwam? Quick!

1341
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,498
We're gonna have something to eat, huh?
Well, that's fine.

1342
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:57,732
Say, I'm satisfied.

1343
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,436
Henry, what are you doing here?

1344
01:15:59,503 --> 01:16:02,337
Wanenis,
I'd never know you without your shirt on.

1345
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:03,471
He's cute, isn't he?

1346
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:05,474
Heap much.

1347
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:13,248
And what's the idea
of the summer shutters?

1348
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:21,721
What a funny place
for fishing tackle.

1349
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:23,424
Wanenis, listen.

1350
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:25,625
You were the only one we
could come to for protection.

1351
01:16:25,693 --> 01:16:28,627
The sheriff wants to hang me because
I helped Sally run away from him.

1352
01:16:28,697 --> 01:16:30,295
Yes, but why did you
run away with her?

1353
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:32,548
Don't you know
that I love Sally?

1354
01:16:32,616 --> 01:16:36,651
Sure, you love Sally.
I know you love Sally.

1355
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,187
You know he love Sally.

01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:42,391
You boys know he love...

1357
01:16:45,396 --> 01:16:47,595
You want to give
me a rubdown now?

1358
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:50,830
Henry, where is she?

1359
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,400
I left her in the flivver
down on the trail.

1360
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:55,153
On the trail? Yes.

1361
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:56,654
I must go to her.

1362
01:16:56,722 --> 01:16:58,721
Oh, for heaven...

1365
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:03,577
I feel good. I feel good.

1367
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:12,201
Wholesale... I mean bigamy!

1368
01:17:12,269 --> 01:17:13,702
What mean "bigamy"?

1369
01:17:13,772 --> 01:17:17,072
Bigamy means that you cannot
marry two or three women.

1370
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:19,507
Black Eagle no can have two,
three women?

1371
01:17:19,577 --> 01:17:20,676
Who say you no can have?

1372
01:17:20,745 --> 01:17:22,878
I said you can't marry
two or three women.

1373
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:25,013
Oh, marry.

1374
01:17:29,486 --> 01:17:32,053
He's a dirty Indian.

1375
01:17:36,142 --> 01:17:37,975

Come, I make you
belong tribe. Come.

1377
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,797
What does he mean?
He's gonna make me for an Indian?

1378
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:51,104
Me. Big Chief Izzy Horowitz.
Well, I don't know...

1379
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:53,972
Come. Come.

1380
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:07,701
Today, my people are celebrating
my return to the tribe.

1381
01:18:07,769 --> 01:18:10,603
From now on,
I shall live as an Indian.

1382
01:18:10,673 --> 01:18:11,938
You can't do that.

1383
01:18:12,006 --> 01:18:14,474
I'm through with the
white man and his ways.

1384
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:18,077
My one drop of Indian blood
makes your people hate me.

1385
01:18:18,146 --> 01:18:21,714
I don't hate you. I love you.

1386
01:18:22,983 --> 01:18:24,983
I love you too, Sally.

01:23:19,955 --> 01:23:21,354
Oh, yeah?

1482
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:23,490
They've got the hottest-looking
squaws you ever saw.

1483
01:23:23,558 --> 01:23:25,490
You know, I tried
to get a room here,

1484
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,959
but they didn't have a room,
so I made a reservation.

1485
01:23:28,029 --> 01:23:29,172
Miss Custer... No! No! Miss...

1486
01:23:29,196 --> 01:23:30,745

01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:27,799
Black Eagle,

1499
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,236
What make sheriff think so?

1500
01:28:30,304 --> 01:28:34,338
I'm giving you fair warning.
It ain't me alone you're bucking this time,

1501
01:28:34,408 --> 01:28:36,074
but the government.

1502
01:28:36,142 --> 01:28:40,044
If you don't produce them,
I'll see that your whole tribe is punished.

1503
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,678
If you want to punish
anyone, punish me.

1504
01:28:42,748 --> 01:28:44,648
Sally! Sally!

1505
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:48,569
Why did you elope
with Henry Williams?

1506
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:51,204
Because I couldn't
marry you, Bob.

1507
01:28:53,275 --> 01:28:56,908
I love Wanenis,
and I'm going to marry him.

1508
01:28:56,979 --> 01:28:59,545
Why, Sally, you can't.

1509
01:28:59,613 --> 01:29:01,480
Father!

1510
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:06,051
Don't worry, Mr. Morgan,
as much as I love Sally,

1511
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,803
I know I can never marry her.

1512
01:29:07,871 --> 01:29:13,058
Black Eagle,
Wanenis love white girl.

1513
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:15,893
Tell them truth.

1514
01:29:18,632 --> 01:29:20,982
Wanenis white.

1515
01:29:22,317 --> 01:29:26,570
Long time, 25 years ago,

1516
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:31,574
Black Eagle find child in white
man's shack on mountain side.

1517
01:29:31,642 --> 01:29:35,878
White man leave white squaw,
white squaw die.

1518
01:29:36,681 --> 01:29:39,247
Black Eagle take child.

1519
01:29:39,316 --> 01:29:42,635
Black Eagle call child Wanenis.

1520
01:29:42,703 --> 01:29:45,471
You're lying, redskin.
I don't believe you.

1521
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:47,907
Red man never lie.

1522
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:52,477
If sheriff look in
county courthouse,

1523
01:29:52,545 --> 01:29:57,447
he will find record Black
Eagle make when Wanenis born.

1524
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,754
Is this really true,
Black Eagle?

1525
01:30:05,391 --> 01:30:09,459
I can't believe it.
Tell me! Tell me!

1526
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:10,995
Is it true?

1527
01:30:11,062 --> 01:30:12,129
True.

1528
01:30:14,015 --> 01:30:15,313
Wanenis!

1529
01:30:15,967 --> 01:30:17,883

1530
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:20,785
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1531
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:22,554
Listen!

1532
01:30:22,624 --> 01:30:23,856
Now, Miss Custer, listen.

1533
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,591
Why don't you bury the hatchet?

1534
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:27,025
That's what I'm trying to do.

1535
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:28,670
No, will you...
Now, look, will you wait a while?

1536
01:30:28,694 --> 01:30:30,529
Will you wait a while?

1537
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:32,195
Stop this nonsense.

1538
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:35,050
I want to be serious.

1539
01:30:35,951 --> 01:30:38,351
Miss Custer,

1540
01:30:38,421 --> 01:30:41,787
you know there comes a
time in every man's life

1541
01:30:41,857 --> 01:30:45,326
when he feels the
need of a companion.

1542
01:30:45,394 --> 01:30:49,329
Someone to whom he can
give his affection,

1543
01:30:49,398 --> 01:30:53,099
someone who'll understand him,
love him, comfort him.

1544
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:56,868
Miss Custer, Mary,

1545
01:30:56,938 --> 01:30:59,504
I'd like to ask
you one question.

1546
01:30:59,572 --> 01:31:01,173
Yes, Henry, dear?

1547
01:31:01,241 --> 01:31:03,374
Whatever became of that calf?

1548
01:31:04,578 --> 01:31:06,844
Now, will you wait a while?

1549
01:31:06,914 --> 01:31:09,548
Will you listen?
Will you wait a while?

1550
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,053
You know how I feel about you.
