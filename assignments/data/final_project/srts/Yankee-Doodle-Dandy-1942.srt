1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,333
I call it a hit.

3
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,377
- What'll your review say?
- Car, sir?

4
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,213
I like it too,
so I guess I'll pan it.

5
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,381
That's logical.

6
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,843
My publisher resents Cohan impersonating
the president of the United States.

7
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,637
Says our young readers dream
of being president.

8
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,681
"I'd rather be right
than be president."

9
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,601
Cohan may find out
he isn't either one.

10
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,481
I don't see how George does it
at his age.

11
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,775
I remember him
when he was a little boy.

12
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,737
Congratulations, George, old boy.
You did a great job.

13
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,822
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Congratulations.

14
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,242
- You had him down to a tee.
- We're still treading on dangerous ground.

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,162
Imitating the president,
a lot of people aren't gonna like it.

16
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,623
It's all good, clean fun.
Didn't they enjoy it in Boston?

17
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,958
- Never could do anything wrong in Boston.
- Ha-ha-ha!

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,586
Greatest man in the United States
played by the greatest actor.

19
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,131
Nothing wrong with that, especially
when the greatest actor is my husband.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,758
- This could be treason.
- Don't worry.

21
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,052
I know a dollar-a-year man
who'll take care of you.

22
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,429
- A lot would like to shoot actors.
- Save these telegrams.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,930
The government needs paper.

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,933
You've got a list like who's who here.
There's everybody but Hirohito.

25
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,144
- We'll bring him in on a shutter.
- Here's mine.

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,147
- Won't you read all that cleverness?
- What makes you think I didn't?

27
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,651
I didn't know there was that much love
left in the entire Western Union codebook.

28
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,819
- Hold that. Thank you.
- Uh-oh.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,031
- Don't bother me.
- It's from the White House.

30
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,741
- That bothers me.
- Here.

31
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,452
You read it, Sam. These aren't
my reading glasses. What's it say?

32
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,829
"George M. Cohan,
the Alvin Theater, New York.

33
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,332
The president of the U.S. requests
that you call upon him...

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,710
...at your earliest convenience
in regard to a personal matter.

35
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,005
Kindly reply for definite appointment
at White House.

36
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,841
Steven T. Early,
secretary to the president."

37
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,635
Hmm.

38
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,553
There you are, Sam.

39
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,347
There you are. What did I tell you?

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,141
Coming at a time like this,
with everything he has on his mind...

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,143
...this is not just a
casual invitation.

42
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,436
This is important.

43
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,313
- I think we're in trouble.
- Don't worry.

44
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,774
They don't telegraph you to come
and be shot at sunrise.

45
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,109
He doesn't get up that early.

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,364
Besides, I've got a run-of-the-play contract.
Fine time to make lame jokes. Hmm.

47
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,335
I'm worried, Sam. I'm really worried.

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,012
Halt!

49
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,516
- Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
- I've got an appointment.

50
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,144
- And the name, please?
- Cohan. George M. Cohan.

51
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,569
All right, sir, if you'll wait
just one moment, I'll call.

52
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,955
Sergeant Lewis
at the Pennsylvania Avenue gate.

53
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,742
- Good evening, Mr. Cohan.
- Good evening.

54
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,042
- We've been expecting you.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,209
Why, your coat's wet.
Didn't you come in the car?

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,044
No, I walked up from the station.

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,006
Washington's a great town to walk in.
I always get a kick out of it.

58
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,181
Yes, indeed.
Won't you come with me?

59
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,389
I was supposed to be off-duty
this evening, Mr. Cohan...

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,475
...but when I heard you was coming,
I thought...

61
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,435
...I would like to see
if you looked the same.

62
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,395
That depends just
on when you saw me last.

63
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,231
Well, it must have been
30-some years ago.

64
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,942
I was valet for Mr. Teddy Roosevelt.

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,278
He got me a seat up in the gallery.

66
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,447
The play was George Washington, Jr.

67
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,785
And you was just singing and dancing
all about the grand old flag.

68
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,996
Mr. Teddy used to sing
it in his bathtub.

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,332
- It was a good old song in its day.
- Yes, sir, it was...

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,212
...and it's just as good today
as it ever was.

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,092
Come in.

72
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,847
Well, hello there.

73
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,558
- How's my double?
- Your double isn't any too sure.

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,976
Give me time to work on that one.

75
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,146
Why, I was told you knew
all the answers.

76
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,024
There was a time when I thought so.
Right now, I wish I did.

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,569
Yes, so do I. Sit down, Mr. Cohan.

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,029
Thanks.

79
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,406
- You know, I'm a little bit nervous.
- Heh-heh-heh.

80
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,159
I'm sorry I missed the opening
of your show.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,536
Maybe just as well.

82
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,498
Don't worry about it.
We understand each other perfectly.

83
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,125
- I think so.
- The Herald Tribune says...

84
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,879
...that you make a better president
and I'd rather be right than I am.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,965
Don't forget,
that's a Republican newspaper.

86
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,846
I can remember you and your family
very well. The Four Cohans.

87
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,265
Do you, really, Mr. President?
That's a long time ago.

88
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,352
Yes. It was while I was
attending school near Boston.

89
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,937
I was a pretty cocky kid those days.

90
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,606
Pretty cocky kid.
A regular Yankee Doodle Dandy.

91
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,775
Always carrying a flag
in a parade or following one.

92
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,862
- I hope you haven't outgrown the habit.
- Not a chance.

93
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,283
That's one thing I always admired
about you Irish-Americans.

94
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,953
You carry your love of country
like a flag, right out in the open.

95
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,329
It's a great quality.

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,332
I inherited that,
got that from my father.

97
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,793
He ran away to the Civil War
when he was 13.

98
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,753
Proudest kid in the state
of Massachusetts.

99
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,465
So you've spent your life
telling the other 47 states...

100
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,259
...what a great country it is.

101
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,219
I never thought of it
just that way before...

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,054
...but I guess
that's about the size of it.

103
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,890
And I lost no time, either.

104
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,184
It started with a very funny incident,
about 60 years ago.

105
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,729
It was in Providence, Rhode Island,
on the Fourth of July.

106
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,398
There weren't so many stars then,
in the flag or on the stage...

107
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,650
...but folks knew that
more were coming.

108
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,862
They were optimistic,
happy and expectant.

109
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,406
The beginning of the
Horatio Alger Age.

110
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,256
My father was playing in a variety,
breaking in a single.

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,091
Nobody was more expectant
than he was...

112
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,760
...unless it was my mother.

113
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,887
She was busy right then
on a smaller production.

114
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,555
Larry O'Leary is me name

115
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,557
By trade I am a dancing master

116
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,684
There's no one can teach the same

117
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:20,189
Nor teach it any faster

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,025
It's easy, very easy

119
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,986
If you watch every twist, every turn

120
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,031
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

121
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,368
At the dancing you have yet to learn

122
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,465
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,926
At the dancing you have yet to learn

124
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,304
- Any messages come for me?
- Not yet.

125
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,431
- Better take a bow, Jerry.
- Can't. I gotta leave.

126
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,475
- Watch that water!
- Max, I gotta leave.

127
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,311
- I gotta find out what's happening.
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Jerry.

128
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,106
Take up Number 3.
You're on. Go ahead. Light's up.

129
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,399
- Bye, Sally.
- Good luck.

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,484
You can't run through the streets
in that outfit.

131
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,987
- They'll put you in jail.
- Have to catch me first.

132
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,114
Don't forget, Jerry,
you're on again at 4:15.

133
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,033
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- These things take hours sometimes.

134
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,536
My wife never held up
a show in her life.

135
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,928
Excuse me, can I get through here?

136
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,055
The Irish are at the
head of the parade.

137
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,651
- I'm not in the parade. I want to get through.
- Not a chance, brother.

138
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,487
You don't say so.
We'll get you there in a jiffy!

139
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,241
Here, this'll give
you courage. Charge!

140
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,714
Nellie.

141
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,890
Nellie.

142
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,892
- Is she all right?
- She's doing fine.

143
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:25,069
- What is it?
- Well, all signs point to its being a boy.

144
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,786
Wait. He just got here
and he's sleeping already.

145
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,791
All babies sleep 20
hours a day, Jerry.

146
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,663
That's why most of them
never amount to anything.

147
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,791
- What'll we call him?
- Oh, I don't know.

148
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,126
- What do you say?
- Well, seeing that he arrived...

149
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,302
...on the Fourth of July,
what about George Washington Cohan?

150
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,300
Well, it has a nice patriotic ring to it.
What do you think?

151
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,386
Oh, the George is fine,
but the Washington...

152
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,685
...may be too long for a billboard.

153
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,318
Well, how about a nice short Irish name?
Dennis or Michael?

154
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:07,481
George Michael Cohan. Heh.

155
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,405
Yes, I like that name.

156
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh, gosh. I forgot.

157
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,999
Hey! It's a boy!

158
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,164
Oh, Jerry.

159
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,216
Heavenly day, Nellie!
He's crying with a brogue.

160
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,428
The first thing I ever had my
fist on was the American flag.

161
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,224
I hitched my wagon to 38
stars and 13 stripes.

162
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,561
I was 6 or 7 years old before I realized
they weren't celebrating my birthday...

163
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,655
...on the Fourth of July.

164
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,398
Then my folks had a real break...

165
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,567
...when my little sister Josie
made her entrance.

166
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,026
She grew to love show business...

167
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,487
...just as she loved everybody
and everything.

168
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,489
We toured the kerosene circuit
in a tank show...

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,325
...called Daniel Boone on the Trail.

170
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,496
Everybody doubled in brass.
Dad walloped the bass drum.

171
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,832
For some reason,
they teamed me with a donkey.

172
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,542
I was a good Democrat
even in those days.

173
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,794
Mother and Josie threw out handbills.

174
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,630
Their smiles would've sold tickets
to wooden Indians.

175
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,510
They kept putting new
stars on the flag...

176
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,639
...and the Cohans kept rushing out
to meet them.

177
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:26,018
We had jokes to match every cornfield.
We sang at every milk station.

178
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,944
Larry O'Leary is me name

179
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,530
By trade, I am a dancing master

180
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,001
There's no one can teach the same

181
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,077
Or teach it

182
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,831
Any faster

183
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,793
It's easy, very easy

184
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,255
If you watch every twist, every turn

185
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,009
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

186
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,935
At the dancing you have yet to learn

187
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,982
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

188
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,113
At the dancing you have yet to learn

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,591
I was taken by surprise

190
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,760
By a pair of roguish eyes

191
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,640
While strolling through
the park one day

192
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,393
We trouped through depression and
inflation, the country's growing pains.

193
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,395
Froze in winter
and roasted in summer.

194
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,272
But it was a good life.

195
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,941
It's a lucky family
that dances together every day.

196
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,386
1891 found our fortunes
flat as a pancake.

197
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,888
Then came a bolt from the blue,
jobs for the whole family...

198
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,099
...in a show called Peck's Bad Boy.

199
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,102
We opened in Brooklyn. Heh-heh-heh.

200
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,698
The town was known for its spirited
audiences even before it had a ball team.

201
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,738
Who keeps hammering
on our opening night?

202
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,115
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the star, ain't I?

203
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,742
You have the leading part, yes.

204
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,244
That means I'm a star,
and there should be a star...

205
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,830
...on my dressing room door.
That's the law of the theater.

206
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,749
Yes, Jerry, give the devil his due.

207
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,627
I know, but I'm nervous. I'll go blank.
I won't be able to remember a line.

208
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,879
Don't worry, Dad.

209
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,631
If you stick, I'll throw you a line.
And you too, mother.

210
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,333
Oh! Thief! Thief! Out! Out!

211
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,726
Why do you do this to me?

212
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,395
It's to jail you're going, me boy!

213
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,231
There, there, there, now.
Henry's not really a bad boy.

214
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,108
He's just mischievous, that's all.

215
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,236
Mr. Schults, I think that should take care
of the damage. Don't you think?

216
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,905
Henry, I want you to promise
the cop and Mr. Schults...

217
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,908
...that from now on
you'll always be a good boy.

218
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,203
I'll promise,
but I can still lick any kid in town!

219
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,936
- Fine work, Georgie.
- I'm proud of you.

220
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,689
- Great, Georgie, great.
- Nice going, kid.

221
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,275
- Real piece of acting there, Georgie.
- You're going places.

222
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,527
- Boy, he sure rolled them in the aisles.
- Thanks.

223
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,446
But what are you all
so surprised about?

224
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,240
You could've told during rehearsals
that I'd be a sensation.

225
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,285
Listen, there's nothing
to this acting business.

226
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,455
I wonder what took me so long
to become a star.

227
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,331
Excuse me. Hey, Vance.

228
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,333
Call a rehearsal for
10:00 tomorrow morning.

229
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,752
Jerry, the time has come
for George's first spanking.

230
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,921
That's right.
I'll hold him while you hit him.

231
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,716
Not me. I don't hit hard enough
to make an impression.

232
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,927
I can't do it. He'd think I'm jealous
because he got more laughs than I did.

233
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,556
Don't think I'm not, either.

234
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,559
Uh, several gentlemen
to see you outside, Mr. Cohan.

235
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,644
Oh.

236
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,855
Gentlemen of the press, I presume?

237
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,701
It's started already.
Will you excuse me?

238
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,785
Let's see how tough he is!

239
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,955
Ow! Ow! Ow!

240
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,128
Ought to be arrested,
every one of those hoodlums.

241
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,215
It seems to me you're taking
all this very calmly, Jerry Cohan.

242
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,384
Your own son almost
murdered in cold blood.

243
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,137
Well, the way I figure, it's a
fine tribute to Georgie's acting.

244
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,848
The way he plays the part,
every kid will want to take a punch...

245
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,100
...at Peck's bad boy
just to see what happens.

246
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,853
What?! Have I got to go
through that every night?

247
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,483
Yes. And matinees Wednesdays
and Saturdays.

248
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,026
Georgie, those boys did
you a great favor...

249
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,445
...and they saved
me a lot of trouble.

250
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,241
You know, most actors give their whole lives
to their profession, not once scoring a hit.

251
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,701
You're lucky.
You're a hit at the age of 13.

252
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,538
I've been in this business a long time
and never met a performer...

253
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,333
...who, in the long run, wouldn't rather
be a great guy than a great actor.

254
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,711
That is, until I made
your acquaintance.

255
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,504
Can't I be both?

256
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,590
Chances are, the way you're going,
you won't be either.

257
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,260
If the hoodlums don't get you,
a committee of actors will.

258
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,013
Actors are considered a very bad
risk by insurance companies.

259
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,974
And any actor with a
conceit like yours...

260
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,935
...well, we just couldn't
afford the premium.

261
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,479
What your father really means
is you're too sensitive.

262
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,606
You're too anxious to make good.

263
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,358
You love the theater too much.

264
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,778
Oh, I know you can improve,
if you want to.

265
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,738
Sure, I can. Just watch me.

266
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,534
From now on I'm Peck's bad boy
only from 8:30 till 11 in the evening.

267
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,953
- That's a boy, Georgie.
- I promise, Mother.

268
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,540
And don't forget Wednesdays
and Saturdays, 2:30 till 5.

269
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,377
Yes, sir! And the other 21 and a half
hours, I pattern myself after dad.

270
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,796
Heh-heh. Well, you could find
a better example...

271
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,516
...but that's the general idea.

272
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,553
Jerry, what do you know.
Ed Albee's coming backstage to see you.

273
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,014
- Albee.
- That's B.F. Keys' partner!

274
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,057
He's big-time vaudeville.
We're in the big time.

275
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,560
He didn't send for us.
He's come here to see us.

276
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,687
Maybe it'd be better
if I spoke business to him.

277
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,440
Georgie, I thought you said
you were going to reform.

278
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,608
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,818
When he comes in here,
I want you to keep quiet.

280
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,361
Look at the condition of this room.

281
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,739
Josie, get the cheap
makeup off the table.

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,616
Hurry up!

283
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,409
Quick, Georgie!

284
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,459
Get the stuff off that shelf there.
That's right.

285
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,955
Hey, Albee'll be right in.

286
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,665
He just stopped at the water cooler.

287
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,834
Jerry, if he offers you a cigar,
don't take it.

288
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,545
I'll take it. That'll impress him
if he thinks I can smoke.

289
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,255
You get behind that curtain.
Hurry up!

290
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,592
I don't want to hear a word out of you.
I don't even want to hear you breathe.

291
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,471
Josie, fix the chairs. The other one.

292
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,183
Here, take this. Oh, Jerry.

293
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,770
- Sit down, Nellie. Sit down.
- All right.

294
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,985
Come in.

295
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,945
Mr. E.F. Albee.

296
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,656
- Hello, Cohan.
- Mr. Albee.

297
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,199
- Meet Mrs. Cohan.
- How do you do?

298
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,825
- How do you do?
- Sit down.

299
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,202
Thank you.

300
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,705
I saw your show tonight. Not bad.

301
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,457
Have a cigar?

302
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,792
Uh, no, thanks.

303
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,794
Your show is no good
for vaudeville...

304
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,046
...but I've seen a lot worse
right here in Brooklyn.

305
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,964
We're opening a new theater
in Philadelphia...

306
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,758
...the Bijou, on the Fourth of July.

307
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,928
If you can fix up a good vaudeville act,
we'll double your present salary...

308
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,806
...give you 10 weeks' guarantee,
and third or fourth billing.

309
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,975
- Double our salary?
- You'll be with the best in the country.

310
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,938
Vesta Victoria, Eddie Foy,
Warren Volk, Charlie Case...

311
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,486
Just a second.

312
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,858
I'm George M. Cohan.

313
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,319
You're opening a theater
in Philadelphia on July 4th?

314
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,197
- Yes, that's right.
- That's my birthday.

315
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,033
Heh. Well, that isn't why
we're opening the theater.

316
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,452
The salary's all right,
but how have you got the nerve...

317
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,672
...to offer us third or fourth billing
after my performance tonight?

318
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,333
Is this kid in your show?

319
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,876
Am I in the show?!

320
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,753
Who do you think was Peck's bad boy?

321
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,673
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I didn't quite recognize you.

322
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,968
You didn't? Then maybe you're not
the showman you're cracked up to be.

323
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,261
George!

324
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,388
Well, now, maybe I'm not.

325
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,143
Maybe you're not quite ready
for the big time yet.

326
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,354
Mrs. Cohan. Mr. Cohan. Good night.

327
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,528
- Good night.
- Uh, Mr. Albee.

328
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,026
- How do you do, Mr. Albee?
- Good evening.

329
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,695
- Call you a carriage?
- If you will.

330
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,119
Carriage for Mr. Albee!

331
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,743
See what happens because you wouldn't
lay a hand on him all these years?

332
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,704
A mother isn't supposed to punish.
She just gives her permission.

333
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,789
Have I your permission?

334
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,625
- You certainly have.
- Ahem.

335
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,627
Don't you ought to get
my permission too, Dad?

336
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,546
Not the hand! He plays the violin.

337
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,256
All right, not on the hand.

338
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,258
Not on the mouth! He has to sing.

339
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,603
All right, not on the mouth.
Come here.

340
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,306
Here's one place without any talent!

341
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,060
Ow! Ow! Ow!

342
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,733
- Who were Lewis and Clark, George?
- Acrobats?

343
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,943
Look at this swell write-up
we got in the clipper.

344
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,030
You'd find us wherever new
states sprouted on the prairie.

345
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,407
We played every town in America
that had a theater.

346
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,867
Any mail for Mr. Cohan?

347
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,619
No. Your father picked up his mail.

348
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,248
I mean, for Mr. George M. Cohan.

349
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,582
The next 10 years rushed
by like a circus train.

350
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,044
Dad seemed content with the sticks,
but I was straining at the leash.

351
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,420
Here's your mail, Mr. Cohan.

352
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,048
Oh, thanks.
A couple of tickets for the show.

353
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,424
We played stock in Buffalo.

354
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,803
Being versatile,
I was playing my mother's father.

355
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,721
Oh, Daddy, he has left me.

356
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,932
All is for the best, my daughter.

357
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,477
In life, we trip,
but right ourselves.

358
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,021
I was correct about man's love.

359
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,025
First, he considers his pleasure
or his honor or his purse.

360
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,737
And only secondly does he think
of the woman he says he loves.

361
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,573
Now I must go life's journey alone...

362
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,494
...and struggle on my weary way
to find peace.

363
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,664
Courage, Emily, courage.

364
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,542
Living has taught your
father many things.

365
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:19,796
Among them,
to take the bitter with the better.

366
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:26,135
The road to happiness is paved
with heartaches and stones.

367
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,202
- Good luck, Josie.
- Thanks, Mom.

368
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,704
They're all yours, sweetheart.

369
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,548
Good luck, honey.

370
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,198
Hey, George, there's a young lady,
would like to talk to you.

371
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,666
Show her in.

372
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,124
All right, Miss.

373
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,372
- Mr. Cohan will see you.
- Thank you.

374
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
He's all yours.

375
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,841
I'm 18. I sing and I dance,
and I'm going to New York.

376
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,685
Should I?

377
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,931
Oh, Mr. Cohan, you're so old
and so experienced in the theater.

378
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,685
So fatherly.

379
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,689
Do you think it's wise?

380
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,985
I mean, my being 18, singing and dancing,
and going to New York?

381
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:11,449
Well, ahem, that's very wise.
I mean, being 18 is very wise.

382
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,992
And as for New York...

383
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,954
...The Four Cohans open there
this fall with their new show...

384
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,873
...with a new cyclorama
and 2 carloads of scenery.

385
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,458
Really? When are you leaving here?

386
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,420
- Tomorrow night, right after the show.
- Oh. I can't leave till Wednesday.

387
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:29,175
- I graduate from high school Tuesday.
- Oh. That's too bad.

388
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,552
Oh, Georgie... Uh, excuse me.

389
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,429
You haven't forgotten
we have a date tonight?

390
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,431
Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.

391
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,933
We're going roller-skating.

392
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,310
Roller-skating on a night like this?

393
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,979
Why, there's a moon out.

394
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,653
I'll be ready in five minutes.

395
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,652
Pipperino, isn't she?

396
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,030
- Yes. Is she your daughter?
- Oh, I'm not married.

397
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,741
- Your niece, perhaps?
- No, she's just a kid with the show.

398
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,909
We've been dating.

399
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,663
Isn't she a little too young for you?

400
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,919
No. She's getting along
in years. She's 17.

401
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,295
Well, shall I sing for you?

402
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,382
I know I have talent,
even if I am from Buffalo.

403
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,342
Well, we haven't got any piano handy.

404
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,561
Well, I'll dance.

405
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,684
Mm-hm. Ahem.

406
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,936
Well, uh, that's rather old,
isn't it?

407
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,981
Everybody's done that. You don't want
to be just an imitator, do you?

408
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,156
Oh, no.
Here's a step I made up myself.

409
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,655
But on the other hand...

410
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,116
...you don't want to be too
original either, do you?

411
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,868
- No.
- Well, I tell you what you do.

412
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,455
You sit right here. You sit right here, and
I will give you an idea of what I mean.

413
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,750
It may not be much. I'm not the dancer
I used to be, but then who is?

414
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,174
Now, watch carefully now.

415
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,006
Oh, no, no!

416
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,181
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, but your heart!

417
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,770
My heart is every bit
as good as it ever was.

418
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,517
Oh, so fast!

419
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,687
Such excitement, at your age.

420
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,022
Sit down and rest.

421
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,107
Maybe I have overdone it a little.

422
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,532
Oh, look at the perspiration
on your brow.

423
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,530
Your wrinkles.
What happened to your wrinkles?

424
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,242
Well, I do have to make up older
than I actually am, you know.

425
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,244
- How old are you?
- Eh...

426
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,871
Not yet 70.

427
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,582
You seem different
from when I first came in.

428
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,084
Even your voice sounds younger.

429
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,710
Well, you see, it's a gift I have.

430
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,670
I'm always as young
as the people I'm with...

431
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,547
...and you've made
me feel very young.

432
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,802
- Very young. Heh-heh-heh.
- I'm glad.

433
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,887
Well, now, let's make plans.

434
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,889
Which manager
should I take you to see first?

435
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,891
Uh, Klaw and Erlanger?

436
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,853
Good old Abe's a very nice fellow,
but maybe a little bit too soon.

437
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,855
Uh, Tony Pastor?

438
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,398
Well, that's better.

439
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,359
Albee, Coster, Beale, and Proctor...

440
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,319
- Oh!
- Huh?

441
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,530
- Ooh!
- Oh!

442
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,781
Wait a minute, little girl.

443
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,450
You're not gonna let a beard
and eyebrows frighten you, are you?

444
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,452
In show business,
you'll see a lot of those.

445
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,122
I'm not sure I want to go
into show business now.

446
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,581
With your talent and ability?

447
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,334
There are very few around
who can sing and dance and act too.

448
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,003
How do you know I can do all those things?
You've never seen me.

449
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,798
I don't have to. I can tell a trouper
a mile away, right on sight.

450
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,883
I feel as though I've
known you for years.

451
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,510
- What's your name?
- Mary.

452
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:21,097
That's a very pretty name, a very
pretty name. Now, Mary, you calm down.

453
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,766
Let's have a bite to eat, huh?
I always eat after the last show.

454
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,226
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

455
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:29,105
I've been here since 2:00 this afternoon,
trying to get up courage to come backstage.

456
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,482
You must be hungry after seven shows.

457
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,610
We'll have a nice cold
bottle and a bird.

458
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,366
What's a cold bottle?

459
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,116
In show business we call that a
piece of pie and a glass of milk.

460
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,202
Aren't you going roller-skating
with that, tlick-tlick, Pipperino?

461
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,204
Nah, I'm tired of picking her up.

462
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,175
- What's the matter, Mary?
- Oh!

463
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,882
Got it.

464
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,470
I was born in Virginia

465
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,265
That's the state that will win ya

466
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,518
If you've got a soul in ya

467
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,521
Ain't no southern frown

468
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,608
In the city of Norfolk

469
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,569
Home of beauties and war talk

470
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,197
- Reckon you'll like it
- If you should strike it

471
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:23,123
That doggone town

472
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,894
Pretty good. There's a contract
in my desk already made out.

473
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,188
Go and get it. Say.

474
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,566
If any of the Cohans ask you how you like
their act, just tell them it was fair.

475
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,034
I get you.

476
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,269
Reckon you'll like it
If you should strike it

477
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,272
That doggone town

478
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,125
Ladies and gentlemen...

479
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,419
...my mother thanks you...

480
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,754
...my father thanks you...

481
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,098
...my sister thanks you...

482
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,426
...and I thank you.

483
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,266
Nice going.

484
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,810
That's tearing them
out of their chairs.

485
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,437
All set up for you, boys.
Go get them.

486
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,523
Oh, Dad, after the way we went tonight,
we're certainly ready for New York.

487
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,817
If we're a hit here,
it's a cinch in New York.

488
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,485
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.

489
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,488
Oh, uh, Mr. Cohan, just a minute.

490
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,158
- Pretty fair act you folks have got.
- They seemed to like it.

491
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,160
That's a soft audience.
Got any open time?

492
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,287
- Yes, from now on.
- I'd like to make you an offer.

493
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,914
- We'd be glad to talk about it.
- Fine. Fine. Heh.

494
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,339
You know, they're always a soft audience
here on Wednesday. Pushover.

495
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,923
- Oh. Mm-hm.
- Did you catch it?

496
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,425
Oh, you were wonderful, George.

497
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,719
- But I don't know. I miss that beard.
- Uh-huh.

498
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,472
- Did you get up on that number?
- Yes. It's a lovely song, George.

499
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,098
- I've learned it by heart.
- Good.

500
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,642
I did it with the orchestra leader,
and you do it this show.

501
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,145
He knows your key,
and you just follow him for tempo.

502
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,565
There's a notice on the call-board. You
can't change your act after the first show.

503
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,526
The manager expects me to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

504
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,904
Who were they applauding out there,
the manager or me?

505
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,532
- Now, go on out there and do it.
- Oh, George, I can't move.

506
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,202
I can't go out there,
not without rehearsal.

507
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,661
What are you worried about?

508
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,790
You're doing a George M. Cohan
lyric to a George M. Cohan melody.

509
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes, but it's my voice.

510
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,880
A George M. Cohan discovery.
Nobody ever had a better start.

511
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,631
There's your introduction. Go on.

512
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,679
Good luck, kid.

513
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,856
When they see it coming
All them babies take a chill

514
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,318
Diamonds glistening all around
And style enough to kill

515
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,947
Her steady fella broke a dice game
Down in Louisville

516
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,826
And buys her chicken every
day for lunch "Come seven"

517
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,496
Dreamy eyes that sparkle
And she rolls them mighty cute

518
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,707
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"

519
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,960
Go broke that she's a hot potato

520
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,878
She's a red-hot radiator

521
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,178
She's the warmest baby in the bunch

522
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,098
Ten consecutive weeks in New York.
That's the big time.

523
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,934
When you leave New York,
Philadelphia, Boston...

524
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,279
- Let me take a look at that.
- Excuse me.

525
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,940
What's going on here?
Take your makeup off.

526
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,192
I'll be back in just a minute.

527
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,279
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"

528
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,407
Go broke that she's a hot potato
She's a red-hot radiator

529
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,618
Hey, Bill. What is this?
What's she singing?

530
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,245
Who told her to switch that number?

531
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,789
She's supposed to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

532
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,292
- Now, who told her to switch that number?
- I don't know.

533
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,377
You don't know?

534
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,504
Bring down that curtain!

535
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,632
Pull out the houselights
as soon as she finishes the chorus.

536
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,718
Give her a chance.
See how that song goes.

537
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,970
The song is gone.
Pull out the lights.

538
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,930
- No, don't do it.
- Who does she think she is?

539
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,476
Who does she think is running this theater?
What does she mean by changing her number?

540
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,145
The only reason I put her on was
because the dog act got drunk.

541
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,064
- He'll be all right in the morning.
- Oh, she was your idea.

542
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,401
- And a very good idea too.
- Now I know who got the dog act drunk.

543
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,654
Who, me? Why, I've never
been in a saloon in my life.

544
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,490
And style enough to kill

545
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,660
Her steady fella broke a
dice game Down in Louisville

546
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,830
Now look at that. Could you ask
for anything more than that?

547
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,917
Hmm? Just wait. She's wonderful, I think.
Don't you think so?

548
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,294
- Don't do that!
- Ha-ha-ha!

549
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,881
Don't do that! Pull out the lights.
Pull down that curtain.

550
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,633
She...

551
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,384
Get your props together.
You're on next.

552
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,762
Hey, boys, start limbering up.
You follow the jugglers.

553
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,723
You get that curtain up. You can't
ring down on a George M. Cohan song.

554
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,143
A George M....? Oh, I see.

555
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,020
Oh, it's your song. You wrote it.

556
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,813
You can tell that by the applause.

557
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,857
Now, Mary,
go out there and do an encore.

558
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,485
- Do one more chorus, and really do it.
- Oh, no. No, you don't.

559
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,404
Young lady, if you're gonna be
trying out any junk like that...

560
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,950
...do it on a split-fee time, but you'll not
be singing songs like that in my theater.

561
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,285
Now you take a little tip from me:
you start packing.

562
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,705
If you've got any squawks, unload them
on me. I'm the one that started all this.

563
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,709
Listen, squirt, any more interference
on your part and you'll be blacklisted.

564
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,671
You won't even be able to get
into a stage door of any theater...

565
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,839
...and what's more,
as for those songs of yours...

566
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,841
...they won't even be played
on a hurdy-gurdy.

567
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,135
- Are you trying to threaten me?
- Oh!

568
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,013
Mary! Mary! Don't pay
any attention to him now.

569
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,682
Give me the key to
your dressing room.

570
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,351
Drunk or sober,
the dog act goes on in the next show.

571
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,354
And look here...

572
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,400
Bring down the curtain!

573
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,406
Cohan, you're fired.

574
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,449
You're canceled! You're washed up!

575
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,544
You and your whole family!

576
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,914
Oh, things were tough.

577
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,958
Well, at least I was in New York.

578
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,960
I had a trunkful of songs
and play scripts...

579
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,545
...and a heart full of confidence.

580
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,548
I'm glad I had it.

581
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,389
I'm sorry. I can't use this, Cohan.

582
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,845
Youth needs confidence.

583
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,348
I'd learned my job the hard way,
all over the United States.

584
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,767
Guys who had never been past
the corner cigar store...

585
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,811
...were saying my stuff was no good.

586
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,522
A kid had to believe in himself
to buck that.

587
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,211
Who is the man who will spend
Or will even lend?

588
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,506
- Harrigan
- That's me

589
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,760
Who is your friend when you find
That you need a friend?

590
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,055
- Harrigan
- That's me

591
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,808
I'm just as proud of me name, you see
As an emperor, czar, or a king could be

592
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,228
Who is the man helps a man
Every time he can?

593
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,607
- Harrigan
- That's me

594
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,359
- H
- A

595
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,110
Double R-I

596
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,489
G-A-N spells Harrigan

597
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,492
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me

598
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,120
And never a man can say
A word against me

599
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,830
- H
- A

600
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,582
Double R-I

601
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,585
G-A-N, you see
Tlick

602
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,255
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with

603
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,634
Harrigan
That's me

604
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,302
H-A

605
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,970
Double R-I

606
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,265
G-A-N spells Harrigan

607
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,645
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me

608
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,064
Never a man can say
A word against me

609
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,857
H-A

610
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,442
Double R-I

611
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,487
G-A-N, you see

612
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,032
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with

613
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,411
Harrigan
That's me

614
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,497
- Well, what do you think?
- I didn't like it. It didn't appeal to me.

615
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,333
What do you mean, you?
I'm the senior partner around here.

616
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,794
- I make the decisions.
- Well, what did you think?

617
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,467
It didn't appeal to me, either.

618
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,132
Which proves, gentlemen,
that you have no ear for music.

619
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,342
He's got no ear for music.
I'm the senior partner.

620
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,561
I have a wonderful ear for music.

621
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,472
But what about the libretto?
It's a grand story, isn't it?

622
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,558
- I laughed all the way through it.
- That's my cue.

623
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,811
If Harold laughs,
then I know it isn't funny.

624
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,896
Have Mr. Cohan sing the
rest of the score for you.

625
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,566
Maybe you didn't like Harrigan
because I haven't got a voice.

626
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,735
Oh, I think you have a lovely voice.

627
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,738
- Don't you think so, Mr. Dietz?
- Yes, you have a very nice voice.

628
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,823
In fact, if you'd like a job
answering our phone...

629
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,492
Are you or are you not going
to produce my play?

630
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,579
If you think I'd put any of my wife's
money into that trash, you're crazy.

631
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,085
That's it, Mary. That's enough.
They've had their chance.

632
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,627
- Have you an appointment?
- Yes. Sam Harris.

633
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,380
I want to see them
about this melodrama I have.

634
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,591
We have no time to
listen to that junk.

635
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,801
You don't know it, boys,
but your days are numbered.

636
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,470
You're making room
for the likes of me.

637
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:48,350
And someday, Mr. Senior Partner, you're
gonna come to me and admit you were wrong.

638
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,019
In 20 years of show business,
I never once admitted I was wrong.

639
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,270
That's his department.

640
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,064
- And as for your wife's money...
- Excuse me. I have an appointment.

641
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,025
- Who are you?
- My name's Sam Harris.

642
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,444
I have a melodrama
here called Wildflower.

643
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,572
Wildflower.

644
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,657
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

645
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,035
- Horses.
- Oh, and Indians. Uh-oh.

646
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,621
Don't let a couple of Gilberts
like that get under your skin.

647
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,623
There's no sense in crying now.

648
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,458
Buffalo is such a beautiful city.

649
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,168
Is that what you're crying about?

650
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,337
It's a beautiful city,
but I hate to go back to it.

651
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,631
Don't worry. You won't have to.
I'll show them yet.

652
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm gonna have my name
up and down Broadway...

653
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,428
until I'm as well known as Hood's Sarsaparilla.
We'll whip them to a standstill.

654
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,097
- Like Grant took Richmond.
- I never really thought of leaving.

655
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
We'll make this whole business
sit up and holler for help.

656
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,354
That's what we'll do. They'll all
hear from us, every one of them.

657
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,689
I'm the senior partner.
I'll do the throwing out.

658
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,983
You don't have to throw
me out. I know the way.

659
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,782
That's the last time
I'll ever bring you a play.

660
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,364
That's my department.

661
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,784
Now I will take it to Klaw and Erlanger.
They don't always think of box office.

662
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,494
Thanks.

663
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,996
- Too expensive.
- Didn't even read the second act.

664
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,249
Probably the biggest forest fire
ever put on the stage.

665
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,341
I think he's a little upset.

666
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,642
Five-thirty. We'd have done eight
shows by this time in Buffalo.

667
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,516
The juggler just paid
three weeks' back board.

668
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,018
Put him at the head
so he doesn't have to reach.

669
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,020
Where shall I put the magician?

670
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,731
Until he's paid, he sits at the foot
of the table with the Cohans.

671
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,275
Oh, starvation corner.

672
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,111
And put the goulash at the head of
the table and keep everything...

673
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,030
...but the noodles and the maple syrup
out of the reach of the Cohans.

674
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,741
Noodles and syrup are just enough
to keep them alive.

675
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,620
Anybody who owes me two months'
board bill, I just keep alive.

676
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,706
I don't have to wait on them.

677
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,462
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening, Madame.

678
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,007
Oh, no, no, no.

679
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,676
- From now on, this is your seat.
- Oh, thank you.

680
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,680
And you, master magician,
you sit over there with the Cohans.

681
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,474
Heh. Madame, someday I hope
you will give me the pleasure...

682
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,518
...of sawing you in half.

683
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,562
- Ha-ha-ha!
- I just heard today...

684
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,231
...that Hammerstein was bringing over
the Scotch actor...

685
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,525
...Harry Lauter,
at 2500 bucks a week.

686
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,404
Hammerstein's a great showman. A lot
of people have never seen a Scotchman.

687
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,699
- Take some goulash, Mrs. Cohan.
- Thank you.

688
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,577
Did you have that appointment
with that man about your booking?

689
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,246
Oh, yes, he's going to give work
to the act any day now.

690
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,206
What happened
to that Boston offer you got?

691
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,917
That was a mighty sweet proposition.

692
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:23,211
Four weeks guaranteed at $300 a week
and top billing.

693
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,923
Well, we didn't take it.
See, it just wasn't right.

694
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,009
Any act that lays off as long as
you have, any offer's all right.

695
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,928
Butter?

696
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,513
We just thought we'd
rest a few more weeks.

697
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,224
Yes, you see, my brother's writing
some new material for us...

698
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,727
...and, well, we're just
not ready to open.

699
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,480
You're not fooling anybody.

700
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:45,400
Everybody knows that you and Nellie and
Josie can get work anytime, anyplace. Heh.

701
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,777
But nobody wants Georgie.

702
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,113
Sure. He's made trouble in every
theater this side of San Francisco.

703
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,867
You can't lay off just because every
manager has blackballed Georgie.

704
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,119
His family hasn't blackballed him.

705
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,830
We may have to take hard knocks
and make a lot of sacrifices...

706
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,249
...but if they want our act,
they'll have to take him too.

707
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,252
We're not breaking up our act
or our family. And besides...

708
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,130
All right, all right, let the
blackballs fall where they may.

709
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,342
Madame Bartholdi,
champagne for everybody!

710
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,012
- If I had it, who would pay for it?
- Dietz and Goff.

711
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,224
- They're producing Little Johnny Jones.
- Oh, George, really?

712
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,478
When Dietz heard the music, he said to heck
with his wife's money, he's gonna use his own.

713
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,647
A second round of champagne on me,
if you had any.

714
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,566
Pass that goulash down
to this end of the table.

715
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,035
Oh, George.

716
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,071
Think of those billboards.

717
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:35,075
Book, music and lyrics,
all by George M. Cohan.

718
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,661
- Oh, Georgie, I...
- Oh, now, take it easy, Josie.

719
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,497
- There's enough water in the goulash now.
- Heh-heh-heh.

720
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,792
Oh, uh, Dad, I'm gonna be tied up
in rehearsal for the next few months.

721
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,129
Why don't you and mom and Josie take
whatever offers in the meantime to fill in.

722
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,132
Well, I hate to see the act split
up, George, but if you think so.

723
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,176
Oh, sure. You can play all that stuff
around Chicago for Sullivan.

724
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,970
The money's good,
and the jumps are short.

725
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,432
It's a good idea.
You get tired resting too long.

726
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,935
But it won't be the same going back
on the road without you, Georgie.

727
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,896
Why, we'll be like a carriage
with only three wheels.

728
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,525
But you will admit I was a bumpy wheel.
You'll roll along a whole lot easier without me.

729
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,152
- Oh, no, Georgie.
- Oh, but you will.

730
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,320
Is there a part in your play
for a bicycle rider?

731
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,531
I used to be known
as "Venus on wheels."

732
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,241
Mm-hm. I always knew
you weren't a cook.

733
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,754
- How's everything going, George?
- Not so good, kid. Not so good.

734
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,590
I've been pounding the pavement so long,
my socks have bunions.

735
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,468
- Say, Matt, would you put a head on that?
- You bet I will.

736
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,889
The villain says, "I'll tell the girl who you
are unless you help me hold up this train.

737
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,515
Think fast. It's due in 10 minutes."

738
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,809
You'll have the audience standing
with excitement.

739
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,313
I know, I know. The hero helps him,
gets shot in the leg...

740
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,648
...and the girl nurses
him back to health.

741
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,610
No, no, no. He gets shot in the arm,
Mr. Schwab, not the leg.

742
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,738
- You know what happens next?
- I won't be in the theater to find out.

743
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,324
I will be down the street
watching a musical comedy.

744
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,160
Before I put $10,000 into a show...

745
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:04,122
...it must have songs, dances,
and a lot of girls.

746
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,710
Mmm! Women, women.
Little rose petals.

747
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,130
Now, the big scene is where the hero saves
the girl from a burning forest fire.

748
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,467
It won't be terribly expensive, Mr. Schwab.
I know where I can get a cheap fire.

749
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,887
You don't need much of a fire, just
enough to burn that manuscript.

750
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,556
- Oh, here you are! I've been looking for you.
- What?

751
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,767
We gotta go to Dietz and Goff
and sign those papers.

752
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,103
- Papers? What papers?
- What...? What papers?

753
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,313
You don't want to talk about it
in front of Schwab.

754
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,357
You haven't discussed our musical
with Schwab?

755
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,275
- Music?
- We promised Dietz and Goff.

756
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,027
I haven't said a word
about a musical.

757
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,321
Good. Dietz said it's the
best musical he's ever read.

758
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,073
Even allowed Goff to agree with him.

759
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,284
When I told him about those 20 ponies
and 20 showgirls all coming downstage...

760
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,203
- Ponies and Showgirls?
- Just a minute.

761
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,455
- What are you talking about?
- Waiter, waiter!

762
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,666
- Check for this table.
- No, no, no. That's mine.

763
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,418
Oh, no, no...
Well, we won't argue about it.

764
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,420
- Glad to have met you, Mr. Schwab.
- That's mine.

765
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,340
- Come on, we can't keep Dietz waiting.
- You are a fine guy.

766
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,758
You have girls up your sleeve.

767
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,928
You have ponies and showgirls,
and you don't tell me about it?

768
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,889
- What...? What's it about?
- We gave our word to Dietz.

769
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,267
No time for details.
It's about Todd Sloan in London.

770
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,144
- The famous jockey.
- Yeah. Come on, partner.

771
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,189
Jockey? Jockey sounds swell.
Just my luck to miss out on it.

772
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,615
Mmm. Well, good luck, boys.

773
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,323
Oh, uh, you forgot your manuscript.

774
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,243
Before we sign with Dietz and Goff,
I made some change in the lyric...

775
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,203
- ..of "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?

776
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,914
- It was perfect the way it was.
- Oh, you're gonna like this.

777
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,251
- Gives the number added value. Watch...
- May I...? May I listen a little?

778
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,670
- Well, think we should?
- I don't know.

779
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,131
- If you promise to be quiet.
- I promise. I promise.

780
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,217
All right. Come on.
There's a piano in the private room.

781
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,468
"Yankee Doodle."

782
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,437
"Yankee Doodle."

783
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,264
Uh-huh. "Yankee Doodle Candy."

784
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,932
Dandy. "Yankee Doodle Dandy."

785
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,393
"Yankee Doodle Candy."

786
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

787
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,695
Yankee Doodle
Do or die

788
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,240
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam

789
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,993
Born on the Fourth of July

790
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:09,247
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

791
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,584
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

792
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:16,171
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

793
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:20,051
I am that Yankee Doodle boy

794
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,509
I have heard enough.

795
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,930
I will never forgive you for trying
to palm off a forest fire on me...

796
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,848
...when you had that
musical all the time.

797
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,516
Yes, but we gave our word to Dietz.

798
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,935
I can't understand it.

799
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,647
Why is Dietz's wife's money
better than my wife's money?

800
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,525
Why?

801
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,401
Must you give it to Dietz and Goff?

802
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,112
- Must you give it?
- Well, I don't know.

803
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,989
I like Dietz, but I'm not
too fond of Goff.

804
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,408
I'm crazy about Goff,
but I haven't got any use for Dietz.

805
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,745
Gentlemen,
you are in perfect agreement.

806
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,956
I will give you a check
to bind the deal.

807
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,879
Here.

808
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,128
Thank you.
What's your partner's name?

809
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,630
I don't know.

810
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,634
What's my partner's name? Ha-ha-ha!

811
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,844
Well, don't toy with the kid
at a time like this.

812
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,555
Tell him. George M. Cohan.

813
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:11,268
George M. Cohan. C-O-H-A-N.

814
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,353
And what is my junior partner's name?

815
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,855
Sam H. Harris. Shake.

816
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,359
- Hello. What should I write?
- Uh, Cohan and Harris.

817
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,902
Cohan.

818
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,577
- Mm-hm.
- And Harris.

819
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,266
I'm the kid that's all the candy
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

820
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,809
I'm glad I am

821
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,311
So's Uncle Sam

822
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,939
I'm a real-life Yankee Doodle
Made my name on fame and boodle

823
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,067
Just as Mr. Doodle did
By riding on a pony

824
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,988
I love to listen to the Dixie strain
I long to see the girl I left behind me

825
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,741
That ain't a josh
She's a Yankee, by gosh

826
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,036
O say can you see

827
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:14,789
Anything about a Yankee
That's awful neat

828
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,293
Little Johnny Jones
A jockey from the U.S.A.

829
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,838
Will ride the pony, Yankee Doodle
English derby day

830
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,091
Jones has broken records
Every track at every meet

831
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,636
So Yankee Doodle's gonna be
The boy they have to beat

832
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,890
Sergeant of the British Isles
Who followed his career

833
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,976
Have offered Johnny anything
To keep him over here

834
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,730
But all the money in the Bank of England
Couldn't pay

835
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,400
Enough to keep young Johnny Jones
Away from old Broadway

836
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,820
If you want to take a trip
The surest of sure things

837
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,115
Have your houses mortgaged
Hock your watches, pawn your rings

838
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,410
And put it all on Yankee Doodle
Johnny Jones is up

839
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,872
I'm gonna give America
The English derby cup

840
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,501
He's gonna give
America The English derby cup

841
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,837
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

842
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,007
Yankee Doodle
Do or die

843
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,677
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam

844
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,722
Born on the Fourth of July

845
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,434
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

846
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,896
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

847
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,691
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

848
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,903
I am that Yankee Doodle boy

849
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,073
He's a Yankee Doodle Dandy

850
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,410
A Yankee Doodle
Do or die

851
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:37,038
A real live nephew of his Uncle Sam

852
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,291
Born on the Fourth of July

853
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,878
He's got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

854
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,340
She's his Yankee Doodle joy

855
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,760
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

856
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,935
He is a Yankee Doodle boy

857
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,961
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

858
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,339
He is a Yankee Doodle boy

859
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,162
Good luck, Johnny
Success to you

860
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,749
All the best of the best to you

861
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,627
We'll make our bets
And leave the rest to you

862
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:09,339
Because you've got
What it takes to win

863
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,015
There they are, going to the post
All in good condition

864
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,976
That's Yankee Doodle on the end
A wonderful position

865
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,605
Look at him rear, he's broken line
He's simply wild to run

866
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,525
Now they're back in line again
There's the starting gun

867
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,735
They're off
Come on, Yankee Doodle

868
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,863
We have bet the whole caboodle on you
Run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

869
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,323
Yankee takes the lead

870
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,742
Break away there
Show them how to earn their hay there

871
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,662
How to run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Show a little speed

872
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:44,040
At the quarter, he's gaining
At the turn now, he's reining his horse

873
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,501
Go, go, go, don't hold him back
Let him go

874
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:49,671
At the half mark, he's cruising
But seems to be losing his lead

875
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,090
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
You simply have to win

876
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,884
He'll never win, he'll never win
The other nags are closing in

877
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,887
- He's gone to third from second place
- Looks like he's thrown the race

878
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,557
They've got him in a pocket
He can't get in the clear

879
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,393
They're in the stretch, here they come
He's falling to the rear

880
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,061
He's lost the race, but it's a frame

881
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,898
We'll find the blighter who's to blame
And clear the name of Little Johnny Jones

882
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,900
Aw!

883
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,695
Well, that's it, ladies and
gentlemen, it's all over.

884
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,155
Yankee Doodle let them down.

885
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,366
So they'll either pasture
him in clover...

886
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,411
...or have him hauling
rubbish in London Town.

887
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,663
Good-bye, Johnny

888
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,791
We're through with you

889
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:32,213
We'll have nothing to do with you

890
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,631
You've been dishonest.

891
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:38,763
And we find that you'll be
suspended for throwing the race.

892
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,390
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

893
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,863
Yankee Doodle, do or die.

894
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,443
Yankee Doodle came to London.

895
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,242
Just to ride the ponies.

896
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,083
I am that Yankee Doodle boy.

897
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,539
For he was that Yankee Doodle

898
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,715
Boy

899
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,840
Women, women. Little rose petals.

900
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,343
Wonderful. You've got them eating
right out of your hand.

901
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,927
- My congratulations.
- Thanks, Sam.

902
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,096
As long as those critics
don't eat off my leg.

903
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,016
Don't worry about the critics.
You got a smash hit. It's in the air.

904
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,893
You can't stop anything
that's in the air.

905
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,922
All aboard

906
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,216
We'll soon be sailing for

907
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,594
The city of old New York

908
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,806
Broadway nights
A million dancing lights

909
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,768
Thrilling sights everywhere you walk

910
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,230
London Town
We're bidding you adieu

911
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,358
Gee, we hate to say good-bye to you

912
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,943
All aboard

913
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,861
Good-bye to London Town

914
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:23,333
Hello to old Broadway

915
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,662
All right, on the boat.

916
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,164
Now, remember, Jones,
watch for the skyrocket.

917
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,793
If it goes off, you'll know that I've
obtained certain papers from Ansty's cabin...

918
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,504
...that'll prove you innocent
of throwing the English derby.

919
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,464
It'll mean complete vindication.

920
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,717
So stick here on the pier
and watch for the skyrocket.

921
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,220
Thanks, pal. I'll be watching.

922
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,357
Good-bye, Johnny. And don't worry,
we still believe in you.

923
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,067
Thanks, kid. That'll help a lot.

924
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,536
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

925
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,456
Give my regards

926
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,040
To Broadway

927
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,511
Remember me to Herald Square

928
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:21,799
Tell all the gang
At 42nd Street

929
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,520
That I will soon be there

930
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,307
Whisper of how I am yearning

931
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:33,853
To mingle with that old-time throng

932
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,230
Give my regards

933
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:40,902
To old Broadway
And say that I'll be there ere long

934
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:47,116
We'll give your regards to Broadway

935
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,454
Remember you to Herald Square

936
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:56,417
We'll tell all the gang
At 42nd Street

937
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:01,047
That you will soon be there

938
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:05,593
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

939
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:09,680
To mingle with the old-time throng

940
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,475
We'll give your regards

941
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,644
To old Broadway

942
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:20,026
And say that you'll be there ere long

943
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:42,463
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

944
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:46,634
To mingle with the old-time throng

945
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,886
We'll give your regards

946
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,805
To old Broadway

947
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:56,107
And say that you'll be there ere long

948
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,656
Ha-ha!

949
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,355
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

950
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,067
To mingle with the old-time throng

951
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,821
We'll give your regards
To old Broadway

952
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:53,998
And say that you'll be there ere long

953
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,806
That was your department.

954
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,010
Is it the robin that heralds
the first breath of spring?

955
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:15,181
How can you think of robins in the spring
when we're freezing to death in Illinois?

956
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,267
Hey, Jerry, did you see the way
they're billing you in Waukegan?

957
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,646
Come here. Look at that.
Funny, isn't it'?

958
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,522
"Jerry, Nellie, and Josie Cohan...

959
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,150
...the family of George M. Cohan,
the new Broadway sensation."

960
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,694
Hey, the kid's doing
all right, isn't he?

961
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,742
Look at that.

962
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,700
Well, that's true.
He is the biggest thing on Broadway.

963
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,620
Yeah, I know, but it ain't right.
We'll build our own reputation.

964
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,914
We'll be billed as we should be:
The Three Cohans.

965
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,333
All right, no need to get excited.

966
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,418
Don't think I'm jealous
of Georgie's success...

967
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,003
...even though I am a better actor.

968
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,714
Of course you're not jealous.
Everybody knows that.

969
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,591
Oh, there'll be no stopping George.

970
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,761
All he needs is a little more experience,
and he'll be a genius.

971
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,931
He mustn't know I'm better. It might
interfere with him becoming a genius.

972
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:00,643
Still, it does look a little funny:
George being the toast of Broadway...

973
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,104
...and you folks gathering
a few crumbs in the tank towns.

974
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,148
- Is either of you fellas Jerry Cohan?
- I am.

975
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,081
It's from George.

976
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,539
"Impossible to find three
clever actors named Cohan...

977
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,083
...for my new show
anywhere in New York.

978
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,427
Return immediately for rehearsals."

979
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,588
- What'd I tell you?
- The four of us back together again...

980
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,507
...and on Broadway!

981
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,348
Oh, you wonderful girl

982
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,768
What a wonderful girl you are

983
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,730
You made the world appear to me

984
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,774
Near to me, dear to me

985
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,819
Blue skies, gray skies

986
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,739
Main Street or Broadway skies

987
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,034
Under December or May skies

988
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,870
I'll be true to you

989
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,456
Everybody's going
to the barber's ball

990
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,666
There ain't a-gonna
be any sleep at all

991
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,252
Until the stars are gone
Until the break of dawn

992
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,632
We're going to dance
At the barber's ball

993
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,636
Even in the kitchen,
you sound like a tetrazzini.

994
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,473
Heh. In Buffalo, they say
I have a nice little voice.

995
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:24,695
Yeah. A lot they know in Buffalo.
In Buffalo they thought I was an old man.

996
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,897
Well, how do you like
your part so far?

997
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,107
Oh, I like it.
I like it because it's small.

998
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,984
I'd be afraid to try anything bigger.

999
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,945
You've got something on the leading lady.
You got the best song.

1000
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,573
Here it is. It's finished. Come on.

1001
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,700
- What about the lyrics?
- Gonna give it to you now.

1002
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,874
Sit down and give me a pickup.

1003
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:51,003
My mother's name was Mary.

1004
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,882
She was so good and true.

1005
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,385
Because her name was Mary...

1006
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,935
...she called me Mary too.

1007
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,351
She wasn't gay or airy...

1008
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,230
...but plain as she could be.

1009
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:12,650
I'd hate to meet a Mary...

1010
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:16,621
...who called herself Marie.

1011
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,329
For it is Mary...

1012
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,701
...Mary...

1013
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,376
...plain as any name can be.

1014
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,791
But with propriety...

1015
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,085
...society...

1016
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:35,756
...will say, "Hm-hm. Marie."

1017
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,259
But it was Mary...

1018
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,344
...Mary...

1019
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:44,224
...long before the fashions came.

1020
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,976
And there is something there...

1021
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,813
...that sounds so square...

1022
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:55,785
...it's a grand old name.

1023
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,613
For it is Mary

1024
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,657
Mary

1025
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,661
Plain as any name can be

1026
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,289
But with propriety

1027
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:14,211
Society will say, "Marie"

1028
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,298
But it was Mary

1029
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,175
Mary

1030
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,887
Long before the fashions came

1031
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:26,098
And there is something there

1032
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,685
That sounds so square

1033
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:36,192
It's a grand old name

1034
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,661
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1035
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,656
Gee, I never cared much for my
name before. It was kind of common.

1036
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,367
Gee, there are millions of
Marys around, but now...

1037
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,453
But I didn't write it
for the millions of Marys.

1038
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:50,497
I wrote it for one particular,
very special Mary.

1039
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,334
Gee, it's a wonderful feeling having
your name written to music.

1040
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,462
- And not bad music, either, huh?
- Nope, it isn't.

1041
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,672
But how will everybody know
that I'm the Mary?

1042
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,842
I want to make sure that everybody knows
it was written for me.

1043
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,469
They'll know, all right.

1044
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,306
When they look at you singing that song
and then look at me looking at you...

1045
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,725
- ...they'll know.
- Oh, George.

1046
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,393
Take that up an octave.

1047
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,862
- George.
- Better.

1048
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,191
Excuse me for butting in.
I've been looking all over town for you.

1049
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:19,360
Strange that I should find you here.
Hello, Mary.

1050
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,780
Mr. Harris, George has just written
a new song for me to sing in his show.

1051
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,574
- Think I can do it?
- Of course. You've got a nice little voice.

1052
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,910
That is not a little voice,
and you need an ear trumpet.

1053
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:31,038
Come on, we've gotta get off to the Lyceum.
We've got to see Fay Templeton.

1054
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,958
- What does she want to see us about?
- She doesn't. We want to see her.

1055
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,543
You need a leading lady.
You've got your ingenue.

1056
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,046
- George.
- Hmm, Fay Templeton. That's not bad.

1057
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,590
She can do four years for us.

1058
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,259
- Think she'll take it?
- I don't know.

1059
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,095
- At least you can get her autograph.
- Or for her to get mine.

1060
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,097
Bring her back to
supper after the show.

1061
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,566
I will if she's still speaking to us.

1062
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,782
Would you like to buy it? Thank you.

1063
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,285
There's one thing in our favor.
Erlanger's on our side.

1064
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,913
- He's got influence with Miss Templeton.
- You talk to him, and I'll tackle Templeton.

1065
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,915
You don't tackle a star
like Miss Templeton.

1066
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:19,671
- You approach her and very tactfully too.
- Well, if it's tact that does it, it's done.

1067
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:24,425
If you get me in to see Miss Templeton,
I'll get you two passes to my next show.

1068
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:27,136
Dan, look. Dietz.
Looks naked without Goff.

1069
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,346
Heh. Yeah. Where's Miss
Templeton's dressing room'?

1070
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,473
- Upstairs.
- I tell you what I'm going to do.

1071
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,143
I'm gonna see to it that Miss
Templeton gets your flowers.

1072
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,772
My respects to Mrs. Dietz.

1073
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,481
Now, that was a very sweet gesture.

1074
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,151
But you've got to remember, Fay,
we're having a tough time...

1075
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,736
...lining up a vehicle for you.

1076
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,113
Now, you should listen to this man.

1077
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,407
- He's just written a big hit.
- One hit.

1078
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,659
He may be a flash in the pan
for all we know.

1079
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,661
And I heard about
Little Johnny Jones.

1080
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,455
And I read the critics... Pfft.

1081
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,124
...Of all the loud,
vulgar flag-waving.

1082
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,627
Well, it was a wow.
I haven't laughed so much in years.

1083
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,212
The fellow's got the golden touch.

1084
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,798
Maybe so, but not
for me, Mr. Erlanger.

1085
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,509
What I want is a quiet,
dignified musical play.

1086
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,845
I want to perform in a theater,
not a boiler factory.

1087
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,639
Come in.

1088
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,267
- Hello, Harris. How are you, Cohan?
- Hello, Abe.

1089
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,311
Everything's all right. You'll see.

1090
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:21,607
Oh, uh, Fay,
uh, may I present Mr. Harris.

1091
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,526
- How do you do?
- And, uh, Fay, this is Mr. Cohan.

1092
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,945
- George M. Cohan.
- How do you do?

1093
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,449
We were just talking about you, George.
Miss Templeton's never seen your work.

1094
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,998
Hmm. Been sick or in Europe?

1095
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:39,291
No. I've been right here on
this stage for two years.

1096
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,584
Oh, buried.

1097
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,545
Oh, uh, don't misunderstand me,
Miss Templeton. I, uh...

1098
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,756
Well, I've never been
at a loss for words before...

1099
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:49,760
...but right now standing here
in your presence, why, I hardly...

1100
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,679
Well, I'd prefer to have
these flowers speak for me.

1101
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,058
- Why, Mr. Cohan, how sweet of you.
- Oh, it was nothing at all.

1102
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,685
Excuse me for breaking in on you
like this, Miss Templeton...

1103
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,897
...but I would like to present
my own flowers my own way.

1104
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,025
- But, Mr. Cohan, I thought... Is he?
- Drunk.

1105
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,987
May I have the honor of supping with
you at Rex's tonight after the show...

1106
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,989
...and drinking champagne
out of your...

1107
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,117
- Pardon me.... slipper?
- Excuse me, Mr. Dietz.

1108
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:16,412
Haven't you forgotten that your junior
partner, Goff, does all the drinking?

1109
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,373
Yes, but on special occasions,
I take over...

1110
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,291
May I put these in water for you?

1111
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,336
- Well, really, I...
- I never saw Dietz drunk before.

1112
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,880
Heh-heh. Well, uh, shall we
get down to business?

1113
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,173
If you like, Abe.

1114
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,300
Well, George,
how would you like to do a play...

1115
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,177
...with one of the biggest stars
in America?

1116
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,304
- What do you think I've been doing?
- Heh. Yes.

1117
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,391
You see what I mean, Fay?
Heh-heh. Isn't he a card?

1118
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,101
Positively a riot.

1119
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,438
Yes, well, George,
what's your new story like?

1120
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,607
That is, I mean,
can you write a play without a flag?

1121
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,652
Miss Templeton, I can write a play
without anything except a pencil.

1122
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:52,239
- Laugh. Now, look...
- There's really no use discussing anything.

1123
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,285
I would never please the sort of people
who revel in your antics and fireworks.

1124
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,203
Oh, you're just being modest,
Miss Templeton.

1125
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,623
If you'd let yourself go, you'd be just as
noisy and entertaining as the rest of us.

1126
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,250
You might even have fun yourself.

1127
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,711
Abe, isn't it about time
for the curtain to go up?

1128
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,630
Look, if you haven't got time now,
maybe a few minutes after the show.

1129
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,383
I'm sorry. After the show
I'm going home to New Rochelle.

1130
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,093
It's only 45 minutes from here...

1131
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:16,096
...but it's like a thousand miles
from all the noisy, neurotic people...

1132
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,223
...one has to associate with
in our profession.

1133
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,100
Now, Miss Templeton, you can't...

1134
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,937
- Fay, I warned you.
- That tact of yours. That wonderful tact.

1135
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,577
What are you thinking about?

1136
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,750
Well, have you thought it over, Fay?

1137
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,710
I'm not interested in Mr. Cohan
or his plays.

1138
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,587
Now you're making a
great mistake, Fay.

1139
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,798
He's the most original thing that
ever hit Broadway. You know why?

1140
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:55,177
Because he's the whole darn country
squeezed into one pair of pants.

1141
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,263
His writing, his song, why,
even his walk and his talk...

1142
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,933
...they all touch something
way down here in people.

1143
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,228
Now, don't ask me why it is, but it
happens every time the curtain goes up.

1144
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,687
It's pure magic.

1145
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,273
I'm bored by magic.
I know his formula.

1146
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,360
A fresh, young sprout gets rich
between 8:30 and 11 p.m.

1147
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,195
Yes, that's just it, Fay.

1148
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,739
George M. Cohan has invented
the success story.

1149
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,576
And every American loves it because
it happens to be his own private dream.

1150
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,162
He's found the mainspring
in the antique clock.

1151
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,331
Ambition, pride, patriotism.

1152
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,708
That's why they call him
the Yankee Doodle boy.

1153
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,795
Now, if you'll take a tip from me, Fay,
you'll do just what I'm doing.

1154
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,506
You'll hitch your wagon
to his star right now.

1155
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:35,635
Abe, I've got to change
for the second act.

1156
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,762
Now, Fay, don't make up
your mind too quickly.

1157
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,472
Take a little time. Think it over.

1158
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,807
Who's locked my door?

1159
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,894
- Who is it?
- What's going on here?

1160
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,063
He'll be through in a minute.

1161
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,441
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.
I didn't realize who you were. Come in.

1162
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,235
- May I?
- Why, of course.

1163
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,903
What does this mean?

1164
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,989
Would you mind telling me
why you're still here?

1165
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,907
Well, here it is,
ready and dedicated to you.

1166
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,118
- What?
- Well, uh, when you made that exit speech...

1167
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,953
...you said you lived
only 45 minutes away.

1168
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:05,789
That struck me as being a perfect
title for a show and for a song.

1169
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,333
During the first act,
you've written this new song?

1170
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,085
Strange surrounding.
It took me longer.

1171
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,379
He's worked so hard.
The least you could do is hear it.

1172
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,924
- Yeah, it'll only take a minute, won't it?
- Depends on the encores. Heh.

1173
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,304
Well, you certainly are persistent.
All right, go ahead.

1174
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,555
- Mind if I change?
- Oh, thank you.

1175
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,230
That's wonderful of you. Thank you very,
very much. Go ahead, George. Play it.

1176
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:33,108
Only 45 minutes from Broadway

1177
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,111
Think of the changes it brings

1178
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,489
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes

1179
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:43,035
In the ways of the people and things

1180
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,413
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens

1181
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:49,416
Oh, what a jay atmosphere

1182
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:52,669
They have whiskers like hay
And imagine Broadway

1183
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,719
Only 45 minutes from here

1184
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,300
Only 45 minutes

1185
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,511
That's good. It's rather different.

1186
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,263
- You liked it, Miss Templeton?
- Ah!

1187
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,766
Excuse me.
That's only a chorus number.

1188
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,185
He's got one number called "Mary"
that's perfect for you.

1189
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,145
- She doesn't sing that.
- She is gonna sing it.

1190
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,521
- No, no, no.
- Shut up.

1191
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,615
It's the best thing he's ever done.

1192
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,069
"Mary," hmm?

1193
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,654
This looks very interesting.

1194
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,697
It's only a so-so number.

1195
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,824
If it's as good as "45 Minutes
from Broadway"...

1196
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,161
- Well, it isn't, and besides, you...
- What do you want to do, spoil everything?

1197
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,872
- I can't let her have that.
- What difference does it make?

1198
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,166
- She's gonna sing it. She will.
- But she can't sing it.

1199
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,919
With Abe's money and your brains,
we'll be able to make a million.

1200
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,629
Shh!

1201
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,651
For it is Mary

1202
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,861
Mary

1203
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:11,456
Society will say

1204
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,167
"Marie"

1205
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:17,254
But it was Mary

1206
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,840
Mary

1207
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:24,437
Long before the fashions came

1208
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,649
Come in.

1209
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,601
Oh! A little early for
Christmas, isn't it?

1210
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:35,230
Well, I was just passing the flowers,
and they threw in the candy.

1211
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,357
George, I'm sure our
song will live forever.

1212
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:41,111
I've been playing it ever since you left,
and the neighbors haven't complained once.

1213
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,821
What happened with Fay Templeton?

1214
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,782
Oh, she's dying to play the part.
But I haven't made up my mind yet.

1215
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,325
Mmm. Ham or bacon?

1216
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,745
- Bacon.
- Good. Ham makes me self-conscious.

1217
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,205
You're hesitating about having
Fay Templeton in your show?

1218
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,542
You know how those big stars are.
Temperamental and hard to get along with.

1219
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,294
Asking impossible terms
and conditions.

1220
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,713
- I'll take my coffee black.
- You ought to give in to her.

1221
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:02,674
But, darling,
no matter what she asks?

1222
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,470
- No matter what she asks.
- Why are you so concerned for Templeton?

1223
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,556
Oh, I don't care for Templeton.
I'm looking out for you.

1224
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:13,477
Think what it means for you to have
a star like Templeton in your show.

1225
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,403
Mm-hm. Always worried about me,
aren't you? Ever think about yourself?

1226
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,609
Not much lately. Haven't had time.

1227
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,444
The minute I saw you
without your beard...

1228
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,946
...I knew here was a little boy
who needed looking after...

1229
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,949
- ...so I gave myself the job.
- Mm-hm.

1230
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,745
There are a lot of singers, you know,
but very few really good looker-afters.

1231
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,705
Mm-hm.

1232
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:37,876
Darling, how would you like
a lifetime job of looking after?

1233
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,961
Leading lady, run of the play...

1234
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,255
...maybe a few heartaches
after the curtain goes up...

1235
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,591
...but I can guarantee
you some laughs.

1236
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,765
How does it sound?

1237
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,471
I think I might like it, Mr. Cohan.

1238
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:52,224
Could I, uh, see some of the script?

1239
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,193
Mm-hm.

1240
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,438
Hmm.

1241
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,112
Not bad for a first reading.

1242
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,449
The coffee's boiling over.

1243
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,323
Darling, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

1244
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,952
- Yes, dear?
- Uh, I gave your song to Templeton tonight.

1245
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,420
Mm-hm.

1246
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,916
Darling, did you hear me? I, uh...

1247
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,293
I gave your song
to Fay Templeton tonight.

1248
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:25,595
Yes, I know. I knew you did, dear,
when you brought the candy and flowers.

1249
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:55,620
My mother's name was Mary

1250
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,583
She was so good and true

1251
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:03,503
Because her name was Mary

1252
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:08,508
She calls me Mary too

1253
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:12,512
She wasn't gay or airy

1254
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:17,350
But plain as she could be

1255
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:21,771
I'd hate to meet a Mary

1256
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:28,320
Who calls herself Marie

1257
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,907
For it was Mary

1258
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,242
Mary

1259
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,038
Plain as any name can be

1260
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,707
But with propriety

1261
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:47,088
Society will say, "Marie"

1262
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,091
For it was Mary

1263
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,302
Mary

1264
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:56,222
Long before the fashions came

1265
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,935
And there is something there

1266
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:03,730
That sounds so square

1267
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:07,692
It's a wonderful song, George, best
you've ever done. It'll live for years.

1268
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,321
Thanks, Sam. But I still think
Mary should have sung it.

1269
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:16,498
Oh, that's all right. Fay has
the song, but I have the author.

1270
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:22,666
And there is something there

1271
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:27,587
That sounds so square

1272
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,923
It's a grand

1273
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,300
Old

1274
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,595
Name

1275
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:42,143
Only 45 minutes from Broadway

1276
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,773
Think of the changes it brings

1277
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:51,319
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes

1278
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,323
In the ways of the people and things

1279
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,159
Oh, and things

1280
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,122
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens

1281
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,917
Oh, what a jay atmosphere

1282
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,961
They have whiskers like hay

1283
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:14,265
And imagine Broadway
Only 45 minutes from here

1284
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:35,030
It's awfully nice of all you boys
To see me to the train

1285
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,742
So long, Mary

1286
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:42,328
I didn't think you'd care
If you should never see me again

1287
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,749
You're wrong, Mary

1288
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,669
This reminds me of my family

1289
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,339
On the day I left Schenectady

1290
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,010
To the depot
Then they came with me

1291
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:03,141
I seem to hear them say

1292
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:09,397
"So long, Mary"

1293
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:13,359
Mary, we will miss you so

1294
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,155
"So long, Mary"

1295
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:20,575
How we hate to see you go

1296
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:24,704
"And we'll all be
longing for you, Mary

1297
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:28,291
While you roam"

1298
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:32,045
So long, Mary

1299
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,799
Don't forget to come back home

1300
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,302
So long, Mary

1301
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,351
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1302
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,729
How we hate to see you go

1303
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,740
So long, Mary

1304
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,035
Don't forget to come back home

1305
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,412
And we'll all be
longing for you, Mary

1306
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,084
While you're gone

1307
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:15,547
So long, Mary

1308
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,971
Don't forget

1309
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:21,928
To come back

1310
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:25,557
Home

1311
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,483
Look at Cohan. He's got them
lined up at the box office.

1312
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,695
I've never seen the guy. Got his
name all over the place. Look at that.

1313
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,573
"Cohan and Harris present
George Washington, Jr.

1314
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,951
Starring the author and composer,
George M. Cohan."

1315
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,537
I wonder what the M is for.
Oh, modesty.

1316
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,247
- Hello, Mr. Foy.
- How are you?

1317
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,999
- Enjoyed your show last night.
- Thank you.

1318
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,293
You always appear
in the kind of stuff I like.

1319
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,170
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

1320
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,380
"George M. Cohan
and his royal family.

1321
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:00,967
Books and lyrics, music, and direction
by George M. Cohan.

1322
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,802
Printed by Sam Divensky."

1323
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,929
That must be Cohan's alias.

1324
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,640
Certainly keeps himself in billing,
this George M. Cohan.

1325
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,101
Don't memorize that one.
There's plenty all over town.

1326
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:14,814
I'd like to forget it. Say, listen,
you connected with this turkey?

1327
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,858
Turkey? I hear it's pretty good.

1328
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,943
It's a malicious rumor
to gyp the public.

1329
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,654
Who is this guy Cohan? Where is he from?
What is he, an upstart?

1330
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,491
Oh, he's been through the mill. Small-time
and big-time vaudeville, rep shows.

1331
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:28,411
- Even followed dog acts.
- Must have looked like an encore.

1332
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:31,915
- Say, uh, is he as good as Foy?
- Who?

1333
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,791
Foy, Foy, Eddie Foy.

1334
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,585
Oh, pardon me.

1335
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,755
Pardon me, I didn't quite catch the name.
Would you mind spraying it again?

1336
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,673
Eddie Foy.

1337
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:43,593
The star that's got the big show
down the street with a chorus of 70.

1338
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:46,429
Why, I thought they looked
a little younger than that.

1339
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,140
I hear now that Cohan's in town,
Foy's gonna retire.

1340
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,934
Foy won't retire till he's 90.

1341
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,519
Is it gonna take him that long
to discover he has no talent?

1342
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,356
They tell me when he tries to sing,
the orchestra puts up umbrellas.

1343
01:18:56,357 --> 01:19:00,485
Tries to sing? Why, he's a genius.
He keeps his audience glued to the seats.

1344
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:03,947
That's one way of keeping them in the
theater. Cohan does it with talent. Look.

1345
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:07,492
Produces his own plays, writes his own
books, lyrics and music, plays the leads...

1346
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,286
- ...and is a great dancer.
- He dances, eh?

1347
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,829
When does he get time to practice?

1348
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,041
When you write your own plays,
you don't have to. Cohan's done all right.

1349
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:19,137
He's given the world "Yankee Doodle
Dandy." What's Foy done for his country?

1350
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,047
He gave them seven kids.

1351
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,715
- Does he dance?
- One of the best.

1352
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,310
When does he get time to practice?

1353
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,346
Say, listen, young fella,
my name's Eddie Foy.

1354
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,723
I know it. I'm George M. Cohan.

1355
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,434
Oh, so you're Cohan?

1356
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,770
Well, if I said anything accidental
to make you mad...

1357
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,522
...I want you to know
I'm darn glad I did.

1358
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:41,109
I don't blame you. I'd feel the same way
if I were up against Cohan.

1359
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,278
- What do like to drink?
- Oh, moxie.

1360
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,447
I can supply it. The attraction inside
is a whole lot bigger than I am.

1361
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,950
Come and see when your show closes.

1362
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:29,907
There's a feeling comes a-stealing
And it sets my brain a-reeling

1363
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:33,619
When I listen to the music
Of a military band

1364
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,290
Every tune like "Yankee Doodle"
Simply sets me off my noodle

1365
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:41,461
It's that patriotic something
That no one can understand

1366
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,421
Way down south in the land of cotton

1367
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,132
Melody untiring

1368
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,384
It's so inspiring

1369
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:52,138
Hurrah, hurrah
We joined the jubilee

1370
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:55,933
And that's going some
For the Yankees, by gum

1371
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,562
Red, white and blue I am for you

1372
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,857
Honest, you're a grand old flag

1373
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,652
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag

1374
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:10,198
And forever in peace may you wave

1375
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,492
You're the emblem of

1376
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,285
The land I love

1377
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,497
The home of the free and the brave

1378
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:21,292
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue

1379
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,837
Where there's never a boast or brag

1380
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:28,591
But should old acquaintance be forgot

1381
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,469
Keep your eye on that grand old flag

1382
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,146
Rally round the flag
Let us rally round the flag

1383
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,812
We took the red
from the flame of dawn...

1384
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,730
...the dawn of a new nation.

1385
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:46,984
And the white was the white
of the snow at Valley Forge.

1386
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:51,155
The blue was the blue
of the free, open sky...

1387
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:55,118
...and the stars were
the 13 sisters by the sea...

1388
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,038
...who built their home
and called it liberty.

1389
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,957
To symbolize the spirit

1390
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,125
Right!

1391
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,668
The spirit of freedom

1392
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,044
Right again!

1393
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,922
The spirit that gave
birth to American

1394
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,340
Democracy

1395
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,764
That's the spirit!

1396
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,271
You're a grand old flag

1397
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,776
What a grand old flag

1398
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:34,615
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1399
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:39,829
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1400
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:44,417
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1401
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:50,425
His truth goes marching on

1402
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,676
And that government...

1403
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,137
...of the people...

1404
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,431
...by the people...

1405
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,436
...for the people,
shall not perish...

1406
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,313
...from the earth.

1407
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,359
When Johnny comes marching home again

1408
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,403
Hurrah, hurrah

1409
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,363
We'll give him a hearty welcome then

1410
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,491
Hurrah, hurrah

1411
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,493
The men will cheer
The boys will shout

1412
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,453
The ladies, they will all turn out

1413
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:25,255
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home

1414
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,088
We're one for all and all for one

1415
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,299
Behind the man
Behind the gun

1416
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,343
And now that we're in it
We're going to win it

1417
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,512
We can't lose a minute
There's work to be done

1418
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,597
We're with them
We're with them

1419
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,724
United we stand
In peace and war

1420
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,851
We're with them
We're with them

1421
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,686
We'll fight as we did before

1422
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:50,775
My country 'tis of thee

1423
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:55,571
Sweet land of liberty

1424
01:23:55,572 --> 01:24:00,168
Of thee we sing

1425
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:32,149
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag

1426
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,945
And forever in peace may you wave

1427
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:40,074
You're the emblem of
The land I love

1428
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,578
The home of the free and the brave

1429
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,415
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue

1430
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:51,168
Where there's never a boast or brag

1431
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:55,172
But should old acquaintance be forgot

1432
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,718
Keep your eye on the grand old flag

1433
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,180
Should old acquaintance be forgot

1434
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:07,143
Keep your eye on the grand

1435
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,395
Old

1436
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:13,274
Flag

1437
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,836
Like the wandering minstrel

1438
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:38,049
I have slouched along the way

1439
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,552
Wandering day by day

1440
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,097
No selection of direction

1441
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:48,434
Till I heard a lovely voice

1442
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,188
Which seemed to softly say

1443
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:53,898
Come along with me

1444
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:58,199
Come along with me away

1445
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,783
May I have your autograph, Mr. Cohan?

1446
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:07,036
To what do you attribute
your continued success, Mr. Cohan?

1447
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:10,456
Oh, I'm an ordinary guy who knows
what ordinary guys like to see.

1448
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,465
Front row center, the greatest
show on earth, the people.

1449
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:21,843
To the people. God bless them.

1450
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,683
Here, chick, chick, chick.

1451
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,394
- Here, chick, chick, chick.
- Heh.

1452
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:34,563
Oh, it's such fun, Mother,
having cows and chickens.

1453
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:36,565
And everything's running so smoothly.

1454
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,651
Well, it's always been
a dream of ours, Mary.

1455
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:42,321
We kept hoping for 20 years
that it might come true someday.

1456
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:45,825
Imagine knowing how to feed chickens
or how much to feed them.

1457
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,785
And you're a farmer only three weeks.

1458
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:50,371
Jerry and I have seen
a lot of chickens in train windows...

1459
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,665
...and we always wanted
to raise some of our own.

1460
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,668
You know, watch them hatch
and feed them and eat them.

1461
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:59,093
If we only could. They're so pretty.

1462
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,675
- Georgie?
- Yeah?

1463
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:06,053
- What'd you get Dad for his birthday?
- Oh, nothing much. Just a smoking jacket.

1464
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,305
Is it bright? Lots of color?
I mean, will he like it?

1465
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,516
Well, it's silk and very red
and very yellow.

1466
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:13,861
That'll do it.
Look what I got him, Georgie.

1467
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:17,064
Well, now, there's a present.
That must have set you back a few.

1468
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:18,441
Dad needed a new watch.

1469
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:21,695
His old one's so loud, you can
hear it right through his coat.

1470
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,208
My future husband
helped me pick it out.

1471
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,461
Your future what?

1472
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:35,174
Husband. We're getting married
as soon as Fred's road tour is over.

1473
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,007
Well...

1474
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:41,093
Hm.

1475
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,353
Hm.

1476
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,279
Little Josie's gonna
get married, huh?

1477
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,606
Oh, it doesn't seem that long ago...

1478
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,575
Hmm.

1479
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,402
What happens to The Four Cohans?

1480
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,197
Oh, just a simple
case of subtraction.

1481
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:09,247
You know, one from four leaves three.

1482
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,869
- Three Cohans.
- Mm-mm.

1483
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,746
That's only arithmetic.

1484
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:17,000
One Cohan from four
Cohans leaves nothing.

1485
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,043
Mom and Pop know?

1486
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,046
Mm-hm.

1487
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:24,515
Mom's been working on the
wedding dress for weeks.

1488
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,521
What are you thinking about, Georgie?

1489
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:43,192
I'm gonna write you the most terrific
wedding march ever put on paper.

1490
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:45,787
It'll pack the pews.

1491
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:52,701
Say, Dad, will you tell Josie that
there's no reason to break up the act?

1492
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:55,120
The Four Cohans are as much
an institution as marriage is.

1493
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,790
Oh, Georgie, no one knows that
any better than I do...

1494
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,959
...but we want to settle down
and raise a family.

1495
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,962
What's the matter? Can't he raise a
family and be a stage manager too?

1496
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,755
- Hmm?
- George.

1497
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:08,806
George, I'm afraid your mother and I
are breaking up the act before Josie is.

1498
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:17,268
You hear that, Sam?
All three of them walking out on me.

1499
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:19,186
There's been a 40-year run, remember?

1500
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,564
We're giving you our two
weeks' notice, George. Heh.

1501
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:24,942
All we'd like to do now is spend
the rest of our days here on this farm.

1502
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:28,696
But you can't do that. You can't put an
actor out to grass. Fresh air kills him.

1503
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,948
We've gained nearly 10 pounds apiece.

1504
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,450
You can work it off. The show
is ready to go into rehearsal.

1505
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,870
There are grand parts
in it for both of you.

1506
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,580
No, George, I...

1507
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,623
We've had good times together.

1508
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:43,252
And, well, new shows need new faces
and new feet to go with you.

1509
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:46,427
From now on,
it's just you alone, son.

1510
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,342
Well, what's this?

1511
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:53,178
- A surprise, Dad.
- Happy birthday!

1512
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:56,181
- For me? Heh.
- You get your own birthday.

1513
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:58,601
- Look at the size of that one.
- Make a wish.

1514
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:00,060
- Make your wish.
- I have.

1515
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,904
A good one, Dad.

1516
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,773
Which one do you want to open first?

1517
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,401
How about opening this one?
Let me help you.

1518
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:11,155
- This one will match your suit, Dad.
- Somebody gave me that last year.

1519
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,656
Well, it looks fine.

1520
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:16,660
Had it made up on that old backdrop you
like so well, fireproofed and everything.

1521
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,038
Oh, darling, that's a
lovely watch. Heh.

1522
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,372
I'm so glad you like it, Dad.

1523
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,499
This is better
than being on next to closing.

1524
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,627
The only trouble is it's
three minutes fast.

1525
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:28,213
Heh-heh. Dad, press the little button
on the side and see what happens.

1526
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,386
It plays one on one
and segues into "Dixie."

1527
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,430
Here's some more ties
that you won't like, Jerry.

1528
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,434
I'll have to open up a store, huh?
Heh-heh.

1529
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,518
- Oh, uh...
- Here's a letter from George.

1530
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,480
- Don't open that now...
- You haven't written me a letter in 20 years.

1531
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,482
I'm gonna open it now,
and I'm gonna read it.

1532
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:49,485
George, this isn't your party.
Sit down and let him read his letter.

1533
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:02,331
"Dear Dad, this is your 62nd
birthday, and God bless you.

1534
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:06,502
Maybe I've never told you before,
but no son ever had a better dad...

1535
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,796
...or one to be prouder of.

1536
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:13,175
You and mother have always given me
more love and understanding...

1537
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,010
...than I ever deserved.

1538
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:19,848
And all the luck I've had is due
to the things you two have taught me.

1539
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:23,853
Nothing I can do could
ever repay the debt.

1540
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:30,109
But here's a little present
for you and mother.

1541
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:34,363
From this day on,
you and I are partners...

1542
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:39,618
...in every theater and
theatrical property I possess...

1543
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,291
...half and equal.

1544
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:46,792
The Cohan Theater,
the Astor, the Gaiety...

1545
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:49,261
...and the Grand Opera
House in Chicago...

1546
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:54,100
...and all my plays and songs
as long as they...

1547
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,515
...or you and I, live."

1548
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:03,526
These are not my reading glasses.

1549
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:07,363
Why didn't somebody give me
some reading glasses for my birthday?

1550
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,987
"Wish you all my love...

1551
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,119
...your son and partner, George."

1552
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,992
Well, George, on behalf
of your mother and myself, I...

1553
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,288
There she goes stealing
the scene again.

1554
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,712
One success followed another...

1555
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:33,756
...but there was one challenge
I hadn't met.

1556
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:36,925
Critics kept saying that musicals
and cheap comedies were all I could write.

1557
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:39,428
I could wave a flag, they said.
Nothing else.

1558
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:43,348
So I wrote a legitimate drama,
very deep and very significant.

1559
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:46,894
No music, no gags, no flag-waving.

1560
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,854
I called it Popularity.

1561
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,574
The title showed how
hard I was hoping.

1562
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:54,401
I couldn't attend the opening
because I was down the street...

1563
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,529
...in The Yankee Prince.

1564
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:01,450
- Open it up.
- Keep it closed, Buck.

1565
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,911
Cohan, you're surely not going
to your dressing room now.

1566
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,121
You're good for at least
another five curtain calls.

1567
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,539
That's enough for tonight.

1568
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,541
Mr. Cohan, are you sure
you're feeling well?

1569
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,044
I feel all right.
Any news from Popularity?

1570
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:14,213
No, but they should be
ringing down just about now.

1571
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,048
You'd think my family
would let me know.

1572
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:19,519
Well, it's a good sign. They probably
couldn't tear themselves away.

1573
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,346
- What time is it?
- Seven-thirty.

1574
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,889
- That clock right?
- Yes, sir.

1575
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,767
That's an early show.
They ought to be here by now.

1576
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:30,270
- Maybe something wrong with Mom and Dad.
- I've got reports on the minstrel show.

1577
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,898
- What'd we lose this week?
- Oh, 10,000, more or less.

1578
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,692
- What's the total loss so far?
- A few dollars under 200,000.

1579
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,320
Hmm. That include the
cost of the red ink?

1580
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:41,156
Popularity better be a hit.
Got a lot of dough sunk in that too.

1581
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,450
Eddie, call Wallachs and find out
what's keeping them.

1582
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,452
What did the papers say
about the minstrel show?

1583
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,830
Here they are. Rave notices again.

1584
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,748
Hmm, rave notices. That's bad.

1585
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,584
The better notices you get on minstrel
shows, the more it costs you.

1586
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,546
All except the last act.
Alecson suggests a new finish.

1587
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,257
Hmm, I see. A new finish. Hm.

1588
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:00,050
How about Saturday night?

1589
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,177
- Close it?
- Close it.

1590
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:04,096
- Saturday night.
- Mm-hm.

1591
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:06,431
- Give the company two weeks' salary.
- All right.

1592
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,934
- Oh, good evening, Mrs. Cohan.
- Good evening.

1593
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:12,146
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Mom. Hi, darling.

1594
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,439
Dad, I was worried about you.
I wondered what happened.

1595
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,151
Sit down. Right here. You sit down.

1596
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:20,362
That theater's awfully cold, George.
Better have some more heat put in there.

1597
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:23,198
- Take care of that right away.
- Remember that skating act in Camden?

1598
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,492
They were there.
I wonder where they got the money.

1599
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,536
Finnegan, Feeney, and Riley.
I remember them well.

1600
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,454
Well, come on, tell me, how'd it go?

1601
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:32,583
Well, the audience loved it,
every minute of it.

1602
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,293
The sets were beautiful, George.

1603
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,296
Uh...

1604
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:41,884
Why so quiet, Sam?

1605
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:43,468
The toughest house I've ever seen.

1606
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:46,346
The critics walked out at
the end of the second act.

1607
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,099
Hmm.

1608
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:51,393
Mm-hm.

1609
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,520
Come on, Dad. Come on, let's have it.

1610
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,982
Heh. Well, there's no use
beating around the bush.

1611
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,942
Pretty bad, George.

1612
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,236
Could've been a lot better.

1613
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:04,948
All right, you write a bad play.
The only thing to do is forget about it.

1614
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,201
Everybody's entitled to one failure.

1615
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:10,537
Let's go to Delmonico's, have the party,
just as though the show was a hit.

1616
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,832
You take the girls on over there,
and I'll see you in about a half-hour.

1617
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,756
I've got some things I want
to talk over with Sam.

1618
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:25,177
Those critics have been
after my blood for years.

1619
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:28,347
They'll gang up on me and do a good
job of it, but I'll beat them to it.

1620
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,016
I'll take an ad in every paper
right alongside their reviews...

1621
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:33,727
...telling the public we've got
the greatest show in town...

1622
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,271
...sold out for 10 weeks in advance,
we'll run a year.

1623
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,357
The public will believe me.

1624
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:40,317
- Listen, Georgie, you can't do that.
- Why not?

1625
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:42,736
Too big a reputation.
You can't disappoint the public.

1626
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,780
They'll never forgive you,
never trust you again.

1627
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:47,659
We stuck our necks out,
and we got clipped.

1628
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,828
Georgie.

1629
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,329
You can't do this.
You'll always regret it.

1630
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:55,249
- Sit down and take this.
- We'll be sorry.

1631
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,626
- To the theater-going public.
- George...

1632
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,920
To the theater-going public.

1633
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,714
I wrote a play called Popularity.

1634
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:05,384
Mr. Harris and I produced that play.

1635
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,684
In the opinion of people we respect,
it is a bad play.

1636
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,223
In this, we heartily concur.

1637
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:14,022
It is a very bad play.

1638
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:16,395
I do humbly apologize
and ask forgiveness...

1639
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:19,648
...for having presented anything of
which you couldn't possibly approve.

1640
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,817
There will be five more performances.

1641
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:23,610
Please miss them.

1642
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,579
Signed...

1643
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,790
Happy?

1644
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,243
It's a wonderful second-act curtain.

1645
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:33,662
Send copies of this to all the
papers for the next edition.

1646
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:37,884
Extra! Lusitania
torpedoed by German sub!

1647
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,227
This is it, George.

1648
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,980
And we were worried about
the success or failure of a show.

1649
01:36:59,981 --> 01:37:02,779
Now we've really got something
to worry about.

1650
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,952
It seems it always happens.

1651
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:17,289
Whenever we get too high-hat,
too sophisticated for flag-waving...

1652
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:21,084
...some thug nation decides we're a
pushover, all ready to be blackjacked.

1653
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,462
And it isn't long
before we're looking up anxiously...

1654
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:26,136
...to be sure the flag's
still waving over us.

1655
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:38,685
Left foot.

1656
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,187
Right foot.

1657
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,406
On your toes.

1658
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,524
I used to be a model.

1659
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,526
You'll look awful pretty
peeling potatoes.

1660
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:49,530
- On your way, wise guy.
- Next.

1661
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,907
Left foot. Right foot.

1662
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:55,577
All right. Take this paper and report to
Sergeant Cooper for your examination.

1663
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,205
Next. Name, please. Oh.

1664
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:00,499
"George M. Cohan.

1665
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,336
Occupation: actor, author,
composer, and producer.

1666
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:08,131
- Address: Devonshire Hotel."
- How do you know so much about me?

1667
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:12,135
Don't you recognize me, Mr. Cohan?
I used to be a clerk at the Friars Club.

1668
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:15,138
- Oh.
- Heh-heh. "Age: 39."

1669
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,934
- Doesn't even give me a chance to lie about it.
- Thirty-nine? I'm sorry, Mr. Cohan.

1670
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:23,063
- You're overage. Thirty-one's the limit now.
- What's eight or nine years, more or less?

1671
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:26,483
- The Germans won't ask for a birth certificate.
- I know how you feel, Mr. Cohan...

1672
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,735
...but you've got to be young
and tough for this army.

1673
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,737
It's no picnic, all those hardships.

1674
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:33,740
The mental strain, the trenches,
the fighting, the marching.

1675
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,742
- And the mademoiselles.
- I hope.

1676
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,454
- No, you'll never be able to stand it.
- Hardships and physical strain?

1677
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,623
Young man, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1678
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,501
This war's a coffee klatsch compared
to a season with a musical show.

1679
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,253
I'd like to see
these kids do what I do...

1680
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:48,547
...in a performance
and be on their feet at the finish.

1681
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,675
I'll give you an idea of what I mean.

1682
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,024
Well, thank you very much
for your entertainment, Mr. Cohan...

1683
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,861
...but I'm afraid we have more need
of you here than over there.

1684
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,863
Well, that'll make the war
last a year longer.

1685
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,700
- Good-bye, Mr. Cohan.
- Thank you, major. Thank you.

1686
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,953
- So long.
- Good-bye.

1687
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:25,602
Johnny, get your gun
Get your gun, get your gun

1688
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:29,189
Take it on the run
On the run, on the run

1689
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:32,859
Hear them calling you and me

1690
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,655
Every son of liberty

1691
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:40,242
Hurry, right away!
No delay. Go today.

1692
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:43,912
Make your daddy glad
To have had such a fad

1693
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:47,165
Tell your sweetheart not to pine

1694
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:50,961
To be proud her boy's in line

1695
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:54,506
Over there
Over there

1696
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:58,176
Send the word, send the word
Over there

1697
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:00,345
That the Yanks are coming

1698
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:02,138
The Yanks are coming

1699
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:05,559
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

1700
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,895
So prepare Say a prayer

1701
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:12,899
Send the word, send the word
To beware

1702
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,570
We'll be over
We're coming over

1703
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,407
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

1704
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:22,242
Over there
Over there

1705
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:27,372
Send the word, send the word
Over there

1706
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:30,208
Pick it up, soldier.
Keep singing, Nora.

1707
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:33,044
- Where are the lights?
- The generator's gone again.

1708
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,380
Hit your lights
so we can keep going, will ya?

1709
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,048
- All right.
- Fine, thanks.

1710
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:39,843
Hit your lights and keep them
on the singer until the others come.

1711
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:41,636
- Certainly.
- Fine. Thanks very much.

1712
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:44,389
That the Yanks are coming

1713
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,308
The Yanks are coming

1714
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:49,644
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

1715
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:53,273
So prepare
Say a prayer

1716
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:57,110
Send the word, send the word
To beware

1717
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,739
We'll be over
We're coming over

1718
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:04,868
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

1719
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:06,745
Everybody sing!

1720
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:10,832
Over there

1721
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:13,251
Over there

1722
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:17,255
Send the word, send the word
Over there

1723
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:19,841
That the Yanks are coming

1724
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:22,010
The Yanks are coming

1725
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:26,097
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

1726
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,224
So prepare

1727
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,393
Say a prayer

1728
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:34,481
Send the word, send the word
To beware

1729
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:36,816
We'll be over

1730
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,152
We're coming over

1731
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:43,657
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

1732
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:14,896
We'd won the World War.

1733
01:43:14,897 --> 01:43:17,357
Manhattan went wild
with postwar hysteria.

1734
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,401
But I spiked my shows
with prewar stuff...

1735
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:22,362
...the sentiment and humor an older
America had aged in the wood.

1736
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:25,156
In a kingdom all our own

1737
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:28,201
With little cupid on the throne

1738
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,830
With a prince
And princess on my knee

1739
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:34,833
You'll be as happy as can be

1740
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:38,044
In a love nest

1741
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:41,256
Cozy and warm

1742
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:44,426
Like a dove nest

1743
01:43:44,427 --> 01:43:47,595
Down on a farm

1744
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:51,266
And it's all daylong

1745
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:52,684
They bray

1746
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:55,729
Flowers all dripping with dew

1747
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:00,066
And they join in the chorus
Of Nellie Kelly

1748
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:04,195
I love you

1749
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:07,615
He is the man
Who owns Broadway

1750
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:10,785
That's what the daily papers say

1751
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:13,371
Oh, where could you find another?

1752
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:15,373
I'd like to be shown

1753
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:19,794
Another like Molly Malone

1754
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:24,507
But I love the name Billie

1755
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,885
My dad's was the same

1756
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:29,809
Billie

1757
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,152
Still, it was lonely
on the main stem.

1758
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:46,112
Mother and Josie were gone.

1759
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:49,032
Dad was by himself on the farm
and had grown very old.

1760
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:52,202
Every night I went to the theater,
I expected a phone call.

1761
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:55,047
Well, finally it came.

1762
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:06,466
You'd better give him two more ccs.

1763
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:09,052
We might as well try to make
him as comfortable as possible.

1764
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:11,429
Yes, Dr. Anderson.

1765
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:15,850
If you have to get back to town,
Dr. Llewellyn, I'll be here all night.

1766
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:19,145
It's all right. I'll wait till George M.
gets here from the theater.

1767
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:22,490
- Cigarette, doctor?
- Yes, I will.

1768
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:24,275
Thanks.

1769
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:27,028
I remember I was a kid
in medical college in Baltimore...

1770
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:29,702
...when I first saw The Four Cohans.

1771
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:31,950
They were a great act.

1772
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:33,953
Yes, they were.

1773
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:41,084
I always thought George M.'s sister
was the loveliest dancer I'd ever seen.

1774
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:45,171
Can't help thinking a theatrical era
is dying in there.

1775
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:48,591
His sister and his mother gone
and now the old man.

1776
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,803
In some ways, I think he was
the best performer of the lot.

1777
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:54,806
Well, I'd settle for his age.

1778
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:57,809
There never was anything dull
about his life, either.

1779
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:00,562
And he's lived to see his son
an American institution.

1780
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,188
Yeah.

1781
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,236
I'd settle for that too.

1782
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,447
Hello, Mr. Cohan.

1783
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,283
- How is he?
- Resting quietly.

1784
01:46:13,284 --> 01:46:15,786
Oh. I see.

1785
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,831
I think you'd better go in alone.

1786
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:27,297
We can't... We can't do that.

1787
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,507
Wait till George gets here.
Where's George?

1788
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,976
Here I am, Dad. Here I am.

1789
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,772
Oh, that's good. I'm glad you came.

1790
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:38,766
The booking office
has been calling up all day...

1791
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,853
...and they want us to play Des
Moines the last half of the week.

1792
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:45,064
Don't worry about that.
We're not going to. I've canceled it.

1793
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:47,693
We can pick it up on the way back.

1794
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:52,572
- How did it go tonight? Mmm.
- Oh, fine. Fine. Yeah.

1795
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:56,409
It's not every kid gets that gets
the chance to play Peck's bad boy.

1796
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,036
That's right.

1797
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:02,123
Were you...? Were you nervous?
Did you remember your lines?

1798
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:03,875
Oh, sure. Every one.

1799
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:07,004
- "I can lick any kid in town."
- Heh. Good.

1800
01:47:07,963 --> 01:47:12,133
Now, don't you upstage your mother,
or I'll whale the tar out of you.

1801
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,928
Don't worry, Dad. I'll never do that.

1802
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,221
I'll play the whole show
with one foot in the trough.

1803
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,350
No, no, no. We've been
billed as The Four Cohans.

1804
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,268
You're not gonna break up the act.

1805
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:23,937
Don't worry, Dad. They never will.

1806
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:26,907
We won't let them. Won't let them.

1807
01:47:27,524 --> 01:47:29,692
How many curtain calls
did you take tonight?

1808
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,736
Six. Six curtains.

1809
01:47:31,737 --> 01:47:34,956
- That's pretty good for a drama.
- Yeah.

1810
01:47:36,033 --> 01:47:40,629
- Did you make a speech?
- Mm-hm. I thanked them for us.

1811
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:43,623
I said, "My mother thanks you...

1812
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:46,167
...my father thanks you...

1813
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:48,796
...my sister thanks you...

1814
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:51,969
...and I thank you.

1815
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:00,037
Well...

1816
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:05,329
...it was a good combination, Sam,
worked well for a long time.

1817
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,124
Yeah, now that it's all over,
who was the senior partner...

1818
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:09,667
...and who was the junior partner?

1819
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:11,669
You mean, who was Dietz
and who was Goff?

1820
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:15,965
Well, I bet it's the first firm in the history
of show business had two senior partners.

1821
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:18,301
Well, uh, you know how I feel,
don't you, Sam?

1822
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:20,344
Sure. I understand.

1823
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:23,639
You know, when Dad died, with him went
the last link with The Four Cohans.

1824
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:27,602
All the backslapping and the applause,
well, it became unimportant.

1825
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:29,353
No more fun in it.

1826
01:49:29,354 --> 01:49:32,858
It didn't mean anything anymore
with Dad, Mom and Josie gone.

1827
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:36,444
So Mary and I are going away
and enjoy ourselves...

1828
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,571
...and visit places
we've always wanted to see...

1829
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,949
...old theaters where nobody
ever even heard of us.

1830
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,952
You'll have to go to Timbuktu.

1831
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:45,369
We've got it booked.

1832
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:48,664
George, you've always been
the one with the words.

1833
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:51,839
I never was much of a hand
at saying things.

1834
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:55,471
But we've done more
than make a lot of money...

1835
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:57,807
...and lose a little.

1836
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:02,020
Sometimes friends drift apart.
Let's not let that happen to us.

1837
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:05,306
No matter how legal the dissolution
of this partnership is, Sam...

1838
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:07,809
...50 percent of me will
always be here in this office.

1839
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,936
I'll remember that
when the rent comes due.

1840
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:11,604
You'll be more successful than ever.

1841
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:15,274
But if ever the rent does come due
and you can't meet it, well, you know...

1842
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,944
...and by the same token,
if I get stuck in Madagascar...

1843
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:19,992
Heh-heh. ...you'll hear from me.

1844
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:23,909
You'd better get out of here.

1845
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:28,505
That ship will sail without you.

1846
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:36,963
- Seasick pills.
- Mm-hm.

1847
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:38,965
I won't go to the boat with you.

1848
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,184
You know how red my nose gets.

1849
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:46,180
What's this? We thought you guys
weren't speaking to each other.

1850
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:48,975
Can we have a picture
of you tearing up your contract?

1851
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:52,150
That's impossible.
We never had a written contract.

1852
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,438
The only contract we've ever had.

1853
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,899
Hold that pose. We want to
show it to our legal department.

1854
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,572
Shoot it, boys.

1855
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:06,534
Life was less full, but it
was by no means empty.

1856
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:09,954
I still had Mary,
a playmate as well as a helpmate.

1857
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:12,674
We set out to rubberneck
at the world.

1858
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:21,048
Nelson monument. It's a good thing
I wasn't born an Englishman.

1859
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:24,098
With the history their flag has,
I'd have waved myself to death.

1860
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:29,891
Oh, George,
I didn't know you could yodel.

1861
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:33,737
Learned it on the farm.
Nothing but hog-calling with frost on it.

1862
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:44,864
It takes two men to impersonate
a horse on Broadway.

1863
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:47,914
And you always have trouble
casting the front end.

1864
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:56,167
But folks always come back
to where their heart is...

1865
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:57,835
...so we came back to the farm...

1866
01:51:57,836 --> 01:52:01,715
...the farm we Cohans had dreamed
of when farmers were envying us.

1867
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:17,360
Hey, mister, our radiator needs some H20.
Can we use your well?

1868
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,024
Sure, go ahead. Help yourselves.

1869
01:52:20,025 --> 01:52:22,568
Come on, Jack.
Let's make this hop-up solid.

1870
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:26,494
Okay, Jackson, come on.
This isn't any free jitney.

1871
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:27,823
Radiator busted?

1872
01:52:27,824 --> 01:52:30,076
Nah. It's only got
high blood pressure.

1873
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,203
What are you gonna do about tires
if those give out?

1874
01:52:32,204 --> 01:52:34,330
Oh, it'll run a lot
smoother on the rims.

1875
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,004
"Stix nix hix pix."

1876
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,377
Greek. I'll bet that's Greek talk.

1877
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:42,296
That ain't Greek. That's Swedish
or Russian. Stix nix hix pix.

1878
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:44,882
That's show business talk.
Here, I'll translate it for you.

1879
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:49,262
"Stix," small towns, "nix," refuse,
"hix," rube, "pix," pictures.

1880
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:52,056
"Small towns refuse rube pictures."
Stix nix hix pix.

1881
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:53,933
- Stix nix hix pix.
- Stix nix hix pix.

1882
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:56,644
A-stix a-nix hix a-pix

1883
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:58,437
A-stix a-nix hix pix

1884
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,856
- I thought that was new jive talk.
- New what talk?

1885
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:02,608
- Jive talk.
- Oh.

1886
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,610
- Are you an actor, sir?
- Used to be.

1887
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:06,779
- What were some of your pictures?
- Not in pictures.

1888
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,781
I was on Broadway
in the legitimate theater.

1889
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:11,033
Oh. What's your name, sir?

1890
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:12,576
- Cohan.
- Cohen?

1891
01:53:12,577 --> 01:53:14,537
Cohan. George M. Cohan.

1892
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:17,415
- You must have been before our time.
- Yes, guess I was.

1893
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,083
Were you ever in some big shows?

1894
01:53:19,084 --> 01:53:20,710
- Yeah, a few.
- Like what?

1895
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:23,546
Oh, uh, like, uh,
Little Nellie Kelly.

1896
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:25,673
- The Tavern. Ah, Wilderness!
- Uh-uh.

1897
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:27,925
Mmm. Raised in a vacuum bottle.

1898
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:31,012
Well, I guess your parents must have
seen me, uh, fathers and mothers.

1899
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:33,431
Maybe they have. I never
heard them talk about it.

1900
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:36,309
Have you ever heard a song called, uh,
"Give My Regards to Broadway"?

1901
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:39,279
- I don't think so.
- Mmm. No, sir. Who sang it?

1902
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:42,148
- Who sang it?
- Oh, was it a theme song or something?

1903
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:46,110
- Did that follow "Beat Me Daddy, 8 to the Bar"?
- Yes! Or "Jeepers Creepers."

1904
01:53:46,111 --> 01:53:48,487
Jeepers creepers

1905
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,656
Where'd you get those peepers?

1906
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,159
Jeepers creepers

1907
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,827
Where'd you get those eyes?

1908
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,412
Come on, kids. Time's a-wasting.

1909
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,497
Well, we gotta scram now.
Swinging session.

1910
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:00,791
Thank you very much, mister...
What was your name again?

1911
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:03,420
Cohan. George Cohan.

1912
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:05,296
Good-bye, Georgie.

1913
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:07,174
You're cute!

1914
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:09,967
Nice old guy. We gotta get
to that session, let's go.

1915
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:12,636
Come on, we got places
to go and things to do.

1916
01:54:14,222 --> 01:54:16,190
Bye!

1917
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:22,981
They did that.

1918
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:25,191
I'm not angry,
but it is very discouraging.

1919
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:28,694
Kid asked me my name, and I said Cohan.
He asked me again, and I said Cohan.

1920
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:32,031
Hm. Never even heard of me. Sixteen
years old, and I bet you he can't read.

1921
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:34,825
But you've been away from that
theater for years, George. Years.

1922
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:37,161
Nine or 10 generations
have grown up since then.

1923
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:40,289
Naturally, they don't remember you.
Nobody's got that good a memory.

1924
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,709
Why not? Many generations remembered
my father and mother in vaudeville.

1925
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:47,088
That's because they were real troupers.
They stayed with it.

1926
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,673
Your father could do a buck-and-wing
when he was 60 years old.

1927
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:52,635
- What makes you think I can't?
- I'd hate to see you try it.

1928
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:56,013
Your father never sat around an orchard
listening to his arteries hardening.

1929
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:58,557
- Nothing the matter with my arteries.
- No, not right now...

1930
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:01,560
...because those kids
got you all worked up.

1931
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:03,687
You're picking on me
for a reason, Mary.

1932
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:07,032
You're trying to get a rise out of me.
Come on, let's have it. What is it?

1933
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:09,702
All right. Here it is.

1934
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:12,905
I got a long-distance call from
Sam Harris this afternoon.

1935
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:14,365
What about?

1936
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:16,951
He's producing a new show
by Kaufman and Hart.

1937
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:19,921
They're good writers.
Nothing I could do to improve their stuff.

1938
01:55:20,122 --> 01:55:22,966
Sam thinks you could,
if you played the lead.

1939
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:26,377
Play the lead? Now, what is
the matter with that man?

1940
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,839
Hasn't he got any sense at all?
What's he trying to do, spoil our fun?

1941
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,049
But are you having fun, George?

1942
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:34,510
When we were in Europe,
you haunted every theater...

1943
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,887
...not knowing a word
that was said onstage.

1944
01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:38,806
Going back,
congratulating the actors...

1945
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:41,142
They didn't even know what
you were talking about.

1946
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:43,102
...Just to smell that
greasepaint again.

1947
01:55:43,103 --> 01:55:44,645
You think I'm stagestruck.

1948
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:47,773
The only reason I ever go near a
theater is to get out of the night air.

1949
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:50,067
Fun? I'm having a wonderful time.

1950
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,662
I have nothing to do with Broadway.

1951
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:56,449
Sam says it's a great part, no other
actor in the world but you could do it.

1952
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,492
That's just some more
of that Harris con.

1953
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:01,120
He needs me about as much
as he needs a hole in the head.

1954
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:03,747
He really does need you, George.
He's in trouble.

1955
01:56:03,748 --> 01:56:08,128
If positions were reversed, he'd help
you out. You know he would.

1956
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:11,385
Besides, he never said so,
but Sam's broke.

1957
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:14,509
Can you think of any more reasons?

1958
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:18,687
Yes. I want you to.

1959
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,807
Well, that settled it.

1960
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,809
I've never refused you
anything, have I?

1961
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:26,145
We do it. Come on, let's get packing.

1962
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:28,319
We're all packed.

1963
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:30,366
What?

1964
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:33,319
We're all packed, dear.

1965
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:35,988
Now you can start getting
mad all over again...

1966
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:39,158
...because I told Sam
I'd talk you into it.

1967
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:46,165
What are you laughing about?

1968
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:49,543
Just full of news, aren't you?
Telling me all kinds of things, huh?

1969
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:51,587
Well, I want you to know
I knew it all the time.

1970
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:55,466
I was listening in on the phone downstairs
while you were talking to Sam.

1971
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:58,469
Why, you devil.
You knew it all the time!

1972
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:01,555
And what's more, I phoned Sam
right back and told him I'd play it.

1973
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:03,516
Oh, I ought to pop you.

1974
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:06,143
- You... You...
- Heh-heh-heh. Oh!

1975
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:08,487
- Oh.
- Oh.

1976
01:57:26,665 --> 01:57:29,293
It's really a wonderful job

1977
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,920
For fellows like George,
Abe and me too

1978
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,839
It's great to shake hands with a mob

1979
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,051
And to hold every kid
on your knee too

1980
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,346
Every word that I speak
Goes into headlines

1981
01:57:42,347 --> 01:57:45,349
When I speak
All the papers hold their deadlines

1982
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,935
But I have found a way
Of dropping a hint

1983
01:57:47,936 --> 01:57:52,022
Or a glint of the truth
That the boys cannot print

1984
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,607
For instance

1985
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,655
For instance

1986
01:57:58,363 --> 01:58:00,072
When I was courting Eleanor

1987
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,950
I told her Uncle Teddy
I wouldn't run for president

1988
01:58:02,951 --> 01:58:04,702
Unless the job was steady

1989
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:07,626
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

1990
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:11,041
We entertained the royalty
But we were never flustered

1991
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:14,253
We gave them Yankee hot dogs
With Colman's English Mustard

1992
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:17,052
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

1993
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:20,384
It's pleasant at the White House
But I'll tell you how I feel

1994
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:23,554
The food is simply terrible
Just sauerkraut and veal

1995
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,724
If Mrs. R. would stay at home
I'd get a decent meal

1996
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:29,648
But that's off the record

1997
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,642
When I go up to Hyde Park

1998
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,310
It's not for just the ride there

1999
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:12,853
It's not that I like Hyde Park

2000
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,647
But I love to park and hide there

2001
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:16,900
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2002
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,778
I sit up in my study
Writing gags for Mr. Ickes

2003
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:22,404
And insults for the gentlemen

2004
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,073
Who'd love to slip him Mickeys

2005
01:59:24,074 --> 01:59:26,997
Don't print that
Off the record

2006
01:59:42,801 --> 01:59:46,095
I scrapped the Prohibition Act
When we required a bracer

2007
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:49,390
And finished up the Boulder Dam
To give the boys a chaser

2008
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,393
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2009
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:55,604
And for my friends in Washington
Who complain about the taxes

2010
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,857
Who cares as long as we can knock
The ax out of the Axis?

2011
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,902
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2012
02:00:01,903 --> 02:00:05,155
I can't forget how Lafayette
Helped give us our first chance

2013
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:08,242
To win our fight for liberty
And now they've taken France

2014
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:11,328
We'll take it back from Hitler
And put ants in his Ja-pants

2015
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:14,081
And that's for the record

2016
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:32,980
Good work, kids. I'll see
you at 11 in the morning.

2017
02:00:35,437 --> 02:00:38,690
And then came your wire,
and I was really worried.

2018
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:42,151
Well, here I am going on like Tennyson's
book, giving you the story of my life.

2019
02:00:42,152 --> 02:00:44,278
I'm sorry. You should've stopped me.

2020
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:46,947
Why, I wanted to hear
the story of your life.

2021
02:00:46,948 --> 02:00:50,534
It has a direct bearing
on my sending for you.

2022
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:53,003
Do you know what this is?

2023
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,706
The Congressional Medal of Honor.

2024
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:58,175
Let's see what the inscription says.

2025
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:13,348
I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.

2026
02:01:13,349 --> 02:01:17,811
I understand you're the first person
of your profession to receive this honor.

2027
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:20,063
You should be very proud.

2028
02:01:20,064 --> 02:01:21,774
Oh, I am proud.

2029
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,525
In fact, I'm flabbergasted.

2030
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,778
First time in my life,
I'm speechless.

2031
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:28,530
Uh... You're sure there
isn't some mistake?

2032
02:01:28,531 --> 02:01:30,749
Quite sure.

2033
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:35,370
This medal is for people who've given their
lives for their country or done something big.

2034
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:37,956
I'm just a song-and-dance man.
Everybody knows that.

2035
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:42,961
A man may give his life to his country
in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.

2036
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:47,382
And quite often, he isn't the best judge
of how much he has given.

2037
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:51,053
Your songs were a symbol
of the American spirit.

2038
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:55,098
"Over There" was just as powerful
a weapon as any cannon...

2039
02:01:55,099 --> 02:01:58,727
...as any battleship we had
in the first World War.

2040
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:02,356
Today, we're all soldiers.
We're all on the front.

2041
02:02:02,357 --> 02:02:05,484
We need more songs
to express America.

2042
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:09,363
I know you and your comrades
will give them to us.

2043
02:02:09,364 --> 02:02:13,450
Mr. President, I've just
begun to earn this medal.

2044
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,077
It's quite a thing.

2045
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:20,630
Well, it's the best material we
could find, what with priorities and all.

2046
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,844
Good-bye, sir.

2047
02:02:23,962 --> 02:02:27,631
And I want you to know
that I'm not the only one that's grateful.

2048
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:29,758
My mother thanks you,
my father thanks you...

2049
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:33,136
...my sister thanks you,
and I assure you, I thank you.

2050
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:36,849
And, uh, I wouldn't worry
about this country if I were you.

2051
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,684
We've got this thing licked.

2052
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:42,688
Where else could a plain guy like me come
in and talk things over with the head man?

2053
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:45,190
Well, that's about as good
a definition of America...

2054
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:47,067
...as any I've ever heard.

2055
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:49,528
Good-bye, Mr. Cohan, and good luck.

2056
02:02:49,529 --> 02:02:52,282
Good-bye, sir, and good luck to you.

2057
02:03:51,049 --> 02:03:52,966
Over there

2058
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:55,052
Over there

2059
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:59,056
Send the word, send the word
Over there

2060
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:01,391
That the Yanks are coming

2061
02:04:01,392 --> 02:04:03,268
The Yanks are coming

2062
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:06,897
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

2063
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:11,151
So prepare
Say a prayer

2064
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:15,113
Send the word, send the word
To beware

2065
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:16,907
We'll be over

2066
02:04:16,908 --> 02:04:19,076
We're coming over

2067
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:21,912
And we won't come back
Till it's over

2068
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:24,873
What's the matter, old-timer?
Don't you remember this song?

2069
02:04:24,874 --> 02:04:26,792
Seems to me I do.

2070
02:04:26,793 --> 02:04:28,627
Well, I don't hear anything.

2071
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:31,088
Send the word over there

2072
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:33,423
That the Yanks are coming

2073
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:35,092
The Yanks are coming

2074
02:04:35,093 --> 02:04:39,096
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

2075
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:43,141
So prepare
Say a prayer

2076
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:47,145
Send the word, send the word
To beware

2077
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:51,149
We'll be over
We're coming over

2078
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:55,871
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

2078
02:04:56,305 --> 02:05:56,576
