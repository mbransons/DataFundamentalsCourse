1
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:25,900
So stay with us,
because later this afternoon,

2
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,186
we're lucky enough to be
talking to Anna Scott,

3
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,986
Hollywood's biggest
star by far.

4
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:33,331
Miss Scott's latest film is
once again topping the charts...

5
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:30,708
Of course, I've seen her films and
always thought she was, well, fabulous.

6
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:34,212
But, you know, a million, million
miles from the world I live in.

7
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,565
Which is here, Notting Hill.

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,509
My favorite bit of London.

9
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,383
There's the market on weekdays

10
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:43,125
selling every fruit
and vegetable known to man.

11
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,907
Rock hard bananas,
five for a pound!

12
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,258
The tattoo parlor
with a guy outside

13
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,831
who got drunk and now can't
remember why he chose "I love Ken. "

14
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,967
The radical hairdressers, where
everyone comes out looking like

15
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:59,204
the Cookie Monster,
whether they want to or not.

16
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,204
And then, suddenly,
it's the weekend

17
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,209
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere

18
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:07,177
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.

19
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:10,982
And wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques,

20
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:14,930
some genuine,
and some not quite so genuine.

21
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,724
And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.

22
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,226
That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef

23
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,698
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.

24
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,468
And so, this is where
I spend my days and years,

25
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:32,168
in this small village
in the middle of the city,

26
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,338
in a house with a blue door that
my wife and I bought together

27
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:39,227
before she left me for a man who
looked exactly like Harrison Ford.

28
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:43,081
And where I now lead a strange
half-life with a lodger called...

29
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:44,082
Spike?

30
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,186
Hi.

31
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:53,458
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you?

32
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,377
Is this important
in comparison to, let's say,

33
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,227
whether they should cancel
Third World debt?

34
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:00,798
That's right. I'm at last going
out on a date with the great Janine

35
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,934
and I just wanna be sure
I've picked the right T-shirt.

36
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,414
What are the choices?
Well, wait for it.

37
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,223
First there's this one.
Cool, huh?

38
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,729
Yeah, it might make it hard to
strike a really romantic note.

39
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:23,086
Point taken. Don't despair.

40
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:26,727
If it's romance we're looking for
I believe I have just the thing.

41
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:35,266
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
think you had true love on your mind.

42
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:37,678
Right. Just one more.

43
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,746
True love here I come.

44
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:55,391
Well, yeah. Yeah,
that's, that's perfect.

45
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,031
Great. Thanks. Wish me luck.

46
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,062
Good luck.

47
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,866
And so it was just
another hopeless Wednesday

48
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:13,236
as I walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,

49
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,446
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,855
This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop.

51
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,379
Morning, Martin.

52
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:24,620
Morning, Monseigneur.

53
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,351
Which, well,
sells travel books

54
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:31,696
and to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,693
Classic.

56
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:42,109
Profit from major sales push,
minus Å»347.

57
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,438
Shall I go and get
you a cappuccino?

58
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,140
You know, ease the pain a bit.

59
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,540
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,112
Better make it a half.
All I can afford.

61
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,851
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.

62
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,279
Can I help you at all?

63
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,990
No, thanks,
I'll just look around.

64
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,118
Fine.

65
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:42,125
That book's really not great.

66
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,438
Just in case browsing turned to
buying, you'd be wasting your money.

67
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,170
But if it's Turkey you're interested in,
this one, on the other hand, is very good.

68
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:57,515
I think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.

69
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,619
There's also a very amusing
incident with a kebab

70
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:03,522
which is one of many
amusing incidents.

71
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,315
Thanks, I'll think about it.

72
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,092
Or, in the bigger
hard-back variety, there's...

73
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm sorry,
can you just give me a second?

74
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:16,629
Excuse me.

75
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,467
Yes?
Bad news.

76
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:21,597
What?

77
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,578
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

78
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:26,202
So?

79
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,876
So I saw you put that
book down your trousers.

80
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,275
What book?

81
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,754
The one down your trousers.

82
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,287
I don't have a book
down my trousers.

83
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:42,552
Right, I tell you what,
I'll call the police

84
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,090
and what can I say, if I'm wrong about
the whole book- down-the-trousers scenario,

85
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,590
I really apologize.

86
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:52,039
Okay. What if I did have
a book down my trousers?

87
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:55,198
Well, ideally,
when I went back to the desk

88
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:59,070
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers

89
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:02,881
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

90
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,679
I'll see you in a sec.

91
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,379
I'm sorry about that.

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,554
No, it's fine.

93
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:14,627
I was gonna steal one
but now I've changed my mind.

94
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,796
Signed by the author, I see.

95
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,324
Yeah, couldn't stop him.

96
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,897
If you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

97
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,764
Excuse me.
Yes?

98
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,539
Can I have your autograph?

99
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,345
Sure.
Here.

100
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,912
What's your name?
Rufus.

101
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,456
What does it say?

102
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:49,122
That's my signature, and above it, it
says "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail. "

103
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:50,688
Good one.

104
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you want my phone number?

105
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:58,171
Tempting, but no.

106
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:00,166
Thank you.

107
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,436
I will take this one.

108
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,303
Oh, right, right.

109
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:12,014
So, well, on second thoughts
maybe it's not that bad after all.

110
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,389
Actually it's a sort
of classic, really.

111
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:19,750
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

112
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,553
I tell you what, I'll throw
in one of those for free.

113
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:28,469
Useful for lighting fires,
wrapping fish, that sort of thing.

114
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,401
Thanks.
Pleasure.

115
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,668
Here we are.
Cappuccino, as ordered.

116
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,369
Thanks.

117
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:15,439
I don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.

118
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,816
Who? Was it someone famous?

119
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,677
No, no, no.

120
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:25,819
Would be exciting though, wouldn't it,
if someone famous came into the shop?

121
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:32,089
Do you know, this is pretty amazing
actually, but I once saw Ringo Starr.

122
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,426
Where was that?
Kensington High Street.

123
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,492
At least I think it was Ringo.

124
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:40,064
It might have been that man
from Fiddler On The Roof.

125
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,165
You know, Toppy.

126
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,302
Topol.

127
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,407
Yes, that's right. Topol.

128
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,576
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't
look at all like Topol.

129
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,283
Yeah, but he was quite
a long way away from me.

130
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,550
So actually it could've
been neither of them?

131
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,087
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

132
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,486
It's not a classic anecdote,
is it?

133
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,397
Not a classic, no. No.

134
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,164
Another one?

135
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:16,107
Yes. No! Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orange juice.

136
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:25,082
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
See you later.

137
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,302
Shit! Bugger!
Oh, my God!

138
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:37,288
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

139
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,754
Here let me...

140
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:39,989
Get your hands off!

141
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:43,210
I'm really sorry.
I live just over the street.

142
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,222
I have water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

143
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,200
No, thank you. I just
need to get my car back.

144
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,533
I also have a phone.

145
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,134
I'm confident
that in five minutes

146
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,839
we can have you spick and span
and back on the street again.

147
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:57,581
In the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

148
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:02,381
All right.

149
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,991
Well, what do you mean "just over
the street"? Give it to me in yards.

150
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:10,788
Eighteen yards. That's my house
there with the blue front door.

151
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,732
Come on in.
I'll just, I'll just...

152
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,310
Right. Right.

153
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:29,472
Come in. It's not quite as
tidy as it normally is, I fear.

154
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:34,956
But the bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just up here.

155
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,391
Here, let me...

156
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,830
Round the corner,
straight on, straight on up.

157
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,632
Bugger!

158
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,757
Would you like a cup
of tea before you go?

159
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,792
No.

160
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,505
Coffee?
No.

161
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:25,935
Orange juice?

162
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,504
Probably not.

163
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,034
Something else cold?

164
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:36,139
Coke? Water?

165
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,408
Some disgusting sugary drink

166
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,679
pretending to have something
to do with fruits of the forest?

167
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:42,680
No.

168
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,116
Would you like
something to eat?

169
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,955
Something to nibble?
Apricots soaked in honey?

170
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,321
Quite why, no one knows,

171
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:56,736
because it stops them tasting of
apricots and makes them taste like honey,

172
00:13:57,495 --> 00:14:01,465
and if you wanted honey you'd
just buy honey instead of apricots.

173
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,780
But nevertheless, there we go,
they're yours if you want them.

174
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,205
No.

175
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,418
Do you always say
"no" to everything?

176
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,148
No.

177
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,292
I'd better be going.
Thanks for your... help.

178
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:26,789
You're welcome.

179
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:31,500
And may I also say... heavenly.

180
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,965
I'll just take my
one chance to say it.

181
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,665
After you've read
that terrible book

182
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,737
you're certainly not gonna
be coming back to the shop.

183
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:41,641
Thank you.

184
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah, well, my pleasure.

185
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:01,694
So... it was nice to meet you.

186
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,798
Surreal but nice.

187
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:09,767
Sorry.

188
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,855
"Surreal but nice. "
What was I thinking?

189
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,028
Hi.
Hi.

190
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,695
I forgot my other bag.

191
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,230
Oh, right. Right.

192
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:50,374
Thanks.

193
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,582
I'm very sorry about the
"surreal but nice" comment.

194
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,411
Disaster.

195
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,510
That's okay.

196
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:32,754
I thought the apricot and honey
thing was the real low point.

197
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:40,567
Oh, my God. My flatmate. I'm
sorry. There's no excuse for him.

198
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,394
Hi.
Hi.

199
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm just going into the
kitchen to get some food.

200
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,565
Then I'm gonna tell you
a story that will

201
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,478
make your balls
shrink to the size of raisins.

202
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,179
Probably best not
to tell anyone about this.

203
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,554
Right. Right, no one.

204
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,986
I'll tell myself sometimes but,
don't worry, I won't believe it.

205
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,860
Goodbye.
Bye.

206
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,043
There's something
wrong with this yoghurt.

207
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:36,981
It's not yoghurt.
It's mayonnaise.

208
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,357
Oh, right. There we are then.

209
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,864
On for a videofest tonight?

210
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,034
I got some absolute classics.

211
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,640
Smile.
No.

212
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,101
Smile.

213
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,377
I've got nothing
to smile about.

214
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:17,359
Okay, in about seven seconds
I'm going to ask you to marry me.

215
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:31,045
Imagine... somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

216
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:40,047
She is... fairly fabulous.

217
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:51,288
Do you have any
books by Dickens?

218
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:52,454
No.

219
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:56,960
No, I'm afraid we're a travel
bookshop. We only sell travel books.

220
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,700
Oh, right. How about the
new John Grisham thriller?

221
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,714
Well, no, because that's
a novel too, isn't it?

222
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,141
Oh, right.

223
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,822
Have you got Winnie-the-Pooh?

224
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:20,651
Martin, your customer.

225
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:21,925
Can I help you?

226
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:35,702
Hey.

227
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,040
Hi.

228
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:46,983
Just, incidentally,
why are you wearing that?

229
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,623
Combination of factors really.

230
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,513
No clean clothes...

231
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:55,359
There never will be, you know, unless
you actually clean your clothes.

232
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,894
Vicious circle.
Yeah.

233
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:02,760
And I was, like, rooting round in your things
and I found this and I thought, "Cool. "

234
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,102
Kinda spacey.

235
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,803
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

236
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,180
No, they were prescription.

237
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,339
Groovy.

238
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:18,909
So I could see all
the fishes properly.

239
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:21,547
You should do
more of this stuff.

240
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,534
So, look, any messages today?

241
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,189
Yeah, I wrote a couple down.

242
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:29,327
So there were two, there
were two messages? Right?

243
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,759
You want me to write
down all your messages?

244
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:39,400
Okay. Who are the ones that
you didn't write down from?

245
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,098
No, gone completely.

246
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,366
Oh, no, there was
one from your mum.

247
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,437
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

248
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:49,712
No one else?
Absolutely no one else.

249
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:56,680
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing- down-all-the-message thing,

250
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,626
some American girl called
Anna called a few days ago.

251
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:06,955
What did she say?

252
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,524
Well, it was genuinely
bizarre.

253
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,804
She said, "Hi, it's Anna. " Then
she said, "Call me at The Ritz. "

254
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:18,043
And then gave herself
a completely different name.

255
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,601
Which was?

256
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,308
Absolutely no idea.

257
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,239
Remembering one name's
hard enough.

258
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:28,979
No, I know that. She said that.
I know she's using another name.

259
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:32,282
The problem is she left
the message with my flatmate

260
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,386
which was a very
serious mistake.

261
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,855
Imagine, if you will, the
stupidest person you've ever met.

262
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,622
Are you doing that?

263
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,759
Yes, sir,
I have him in my mind.

264
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:43,959
And now double it.

265
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:48,943
And that is the, what can I say,
the git that I am living with.

266
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,834
And he can't
remember this other...

267
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,404
Try Flintstone.

268
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,403
Sorry. What?

269
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,440
I think she said
her name was Flintstone.

270
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,981
I don't suppose Flintstone
rings any bells, does it?

271
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,549
I'll put you right through,
sir.

272
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:06,686
Oh, my God.

273
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,732
Hello. Hi.

274
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:15,994
Hi.

275
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:20,237
Hi. Sorry.
It's William Thacker.

276
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:24,075
Yes?
We... I work in a bookshop.

277
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:28,070
You played it pretty cool there,
waiting for three days to call.

278
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:31,661
Oh, no, I promise you I've never
played anything cool in my entire life.

279
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:35,218
My flatmate, who I'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.

280
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,321
Perhaps

281
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,429
I could drop round for
tea later or something?

282
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,989
Things are pretty busy here.
I might be free around 4:00.

283
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,264
Right. Right. Great.

284
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:51,194
Bye.

285
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:05,208
Classic.

286
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,024
Which floor?
Three, please.

287
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,512
Are you sure?

288
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:19,856
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

289
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:36,099
Hi. Hi. I'm Karen. I'm sorry,
things are running a little bit late.

290
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:38,670
Here's the thing.
Do you wanna come this way?

291
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,177
Through here.

292
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,128
So what did you
think of the film?

293
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:50,912
Yeah, I thought
it was fantastic.

294
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,951
I thought it was Close
Encounters meets Jean de Florette.

295
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,256
I agree.

296
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:03,126
I'm sorry, I didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

297
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:04,261
Time Out.

298
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,362
Great.

299
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,172
And you're from?

300
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,581
Horse & Hound.

301
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,947
The name's William Thacker.
Actually, she might be expecting me.

302
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,450
Oh, okay. Take a seat
and I'll go check.

303
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:34,024
I see you've... I see you've
brought her some flowers.

304
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:39,137
No. These are
for my grandmother.

305
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:42,931
She's in a hospital
down the road.

306
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:45,569
Thought I'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.

307
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,480
Sure, right. Absolutely, yeah.

308
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:51,310
Which hospital's that?

309
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,313
Do you mind me not saying? It's a
rather distressing thing, isn't it?

310
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:57,747
Name of the hospital
kind of gives it away.

311
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:59,487
Absolutely. Sure.
Cheers.

312
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:04,454
Right. Mr. Thacker,
if you come this way.

313
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:05,489
Right.

314
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,230
You've got five minutes.

315
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:20,408
Hi.
Hello.

316
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,251
I brought these,
but clearly...

317
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,749
No, they're great.
They're great.

318
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:32,115
I'm sorry about
not ringing back.

319
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,382
The whole "two names" concept

320
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:37,052
was totally too much for my
flatmate's pea-sized intellect.

321
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:40,924
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a cartoon character.

322
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,267
Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

323
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,098
Everything all right?

324
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,297
Yes, thank you.

325
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,368
And you're from Horse & Hound?

326
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,070
Good.

327
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,409
Is that so?

328
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,115
So,

329
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,591
I'll just fire away,
then, shall I?

330
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:16,928
Right.

331
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,564
The film's great,

332
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,274
and I just was
wondering whether

333
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:33,750
you ever thought of having
more... horses in it?

334
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,248
Well, we would have liked to,

335
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:45,323
but it was difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

336
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:50,137
Space, right, yeah. Yeah,
obviously very difficult.

337
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:53,695
I'm so sorry.

338
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,730
I arrived outside, they
thrust this thing into my hand.

339
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:59,035
No, it's my fault. I thought
this would all be over by now.

340
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,305
I just wanted to sort of
apologize for the kissing thing.

341
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,406
I seriously don't know
what came over me.

342
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,512
I just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

343
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
absolutely fine.

344
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:19,222
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project

345
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,861
which she is shooting
later in the summer.

346
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:25,797
Yes, excellent. Excellent.

347
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,539
Any horses in that one?

348
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:39,513
Or hounds for that matter? Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

349
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,623
It takes place on a submarine.

350
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,290
Well, bad luck.

351
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:53,456
But if there were horses in it

352
00:28:54,491 --> 00:29:00,703
would you be riding them or would you be
getting a stunt-horse-double-man-thing?

353
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:08,013
I'm a complete moron.
I apologize.

354
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,038
This is very weird.

355
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:13,543
It's the sort of thing that
happens in dreams, not in real life.

356
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:20,754
I mean, good dreams. It's a
dream, in fact, to see you again.

357
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,321
What happens next
in the dream?

358
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:34,030
I suppose that in the dream,
"dream scenario,"

359
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:37,666
I just change my personality

360
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,443
because you can
do that in dreams

361
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:48,685
and walk over
and kiss the girl. But...

362
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:02,167
Time's up, I'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted?

363
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,026
Nearly, nearly.

364
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,938
Well, maybe just
one last question.

365
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,365
Sure.

366
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,503
Right, right.

367
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:18,012
Are you busy tonight?

368
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:20,542
Yes.

369
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:22,351
Right. Right.

370
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,218
Come in.

371
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:29,152
Well, it was nice to meet you.

372
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:30,358
Yes, and you.

373
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:33,030
Surreal but nice.

374
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:35,594
Thank you.

375
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:39,096
You are Horse & Hound's
favorite actress.

376
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,839
You and Black Beauty tied.

377
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,681
Hang on, don't go.
How was she?

378
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,487
Fabulous.
Excellent.

379
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:58,658
Wait a minute, she took your
grandmother's flowers.

380
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:03,427
Yeah, yeah.
That's right. Bitch.

381
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:08,665
Mr. Thacker. If you'd like to come with
me we can just rush you through the others.

382
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,925
The others?

383
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,803
Mr. Thacker is
from Horse & Hound.

384
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:17,465
How's it going?

385
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,768
Very well. Thank you.

386
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:19,939
Have a seat.

387
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,450
Well, did you enjoy the film?

388
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:27,884
Yes. Enormously.

389
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,513
Well, fire away.
Right.

390
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,584
Did you enjoy making the film?

391
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:35,994
Yes, I did.

392
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,087
Good.

393
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,422
Any bit in particular?

394
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:44,192
You tell me what
"bit" you enjoyed the most

395
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:47,003
and I'll tell you if I
enjoyed making that "bit. "

396
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,981
I... liked the bit in space.

397
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:57,812
Very much.

398
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:02,353
Did you identify with
the character you're playing?

399
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:09,752
No.

400
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,388
Oh.

401
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,327
Why not?

402
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,303
Because he's playing a
psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

403
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
Classic.

404
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:33,443
So, is this your first film?

405
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,855
No, it's my 22nd.

406
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,488
Of course it is.

407
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,785
Any favorites among the 22?

408
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,686
Working with Leonardo.

409
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:44,857
Da Vinci?

410
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:48,463
DiCaprio.
Of course.

411
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,007
And is he your favorite
Italian director?

412
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,705
Mr. Thacker?
Oh, no.

413
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,650
Have you got a minute?
No.

414
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:16,653
Hi.

415
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:24,571
The thing I was doing tonight
I'm not doing anymore.

416
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:27,965
I told them I had to
spend the evening with

417
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,703
Britain's premiere
equestrian journalist.

418
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,877
Well, great. Fantastic.

419
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:42,412
Shittity brickity. It's
my sister's birthday. Shit.

420
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,846
We're meant to
be having dinner.

421
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:45,013
Okay, that's fine.

422
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:46,848
No, I'm sure
I can get out of it.

423
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:50,353
No, I mean, if it's fine
with you, I'll be your date.

424
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:57,128
You'll be my date to my little
sister's birthday party?

425
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,061
If it's all right.

426
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:01,575
Well, yeah,
I'm sure it's all right.

427
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:03,431
My friend Max is cooking

428
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:07,072
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world,

429
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:11,407
but you could hide the food
in your handbag or something.

430
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:14,284
Okay.

431
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:19,203
He's bringing a girl?

432
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:20,692
Miracles do happen.

433
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:23,338
Does the girl have a name?

434
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,858
Don't know, wouldn't say.

435
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:28,324
Oh Christ,
what is going on in there?

436
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,398
Oh, God!

437
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,536
Hi, come on in.
Vague food crisis.

438
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,405
Hiya.

439
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,444
Sorry, the guinea-fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

440
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:50,313
He's cooking guinea-fowl?

441
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:51,519
Don't even ask.

442
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:53,316
Hi.
Hi.

443
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:56,686
Good Lord, you're the
spitting image of...

444
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,563
Bella, this is Anna.

445
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,992
Right.
Okay, crisis over.

446
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:04,402
Max, this is Anna.

447
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,528
Hi.

448
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,872
Hello, Anna... Scott.

449
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,111
Have some wine.
Thank you.

450
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:16,008
I'll get it.

451
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,483
Red or white?

452
00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:23,480
Hi.
Hi.

453
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,549
Oh yes, happy birthday.

454
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:27,648
Thank you.

455
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:30,319
Look, your brother's
brought this girl...

456
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:31,695
Hi, guys.

457
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:33,600
Holy fuck!

458
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:38,134
Honey, this is Anna. Anna, this
is Honey. She's my baby sister.

459
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:41,062
Hi.
Oh, God.

460
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,599
This is one of those key moments
in life when it's possible

461
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:51,278
you can be really genuinely cool
and I'm going to fail just 100%.

462
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:57,590
I absolutely, totally
and utterly adore you.

463
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:02,785
And I just think you are the
most beautiful woman in the world.

464
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,520
And more importantly,
I genuinely believe,

465
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:10,697
and I've believed for some time
now, that we could be best friends.

466
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,632
So what do you think?

467
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,700
Lucky me.

468
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:22,470
Happy birthday.

469
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,040
Oh, you gave me a present.

470
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,442
We're best friends
already then.

471
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:30,753
Marry Will, he's a really nice
guy, then we can be sisters.

472
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:32,852
I'll think about it.

473
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:36,261
That'll be Bernie.

474
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:40,822
Hi.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

475
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:43,064
Bollocksed up at work again,
I fear.

476
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:45,394
Millions down the drain.

477
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:46,429
Well done.

478
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:47,995
Bernie, this is Anna.

479
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,165
Hello, Anna.
Delighted to meet you.

480
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,331
And you.

481
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:53,711
Honey bunny,
happy birthday to you.

482
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:55,809
Hi, Bella.
Hi.

483
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,816
It's a hat. You don't have
to wear it or anything.

484
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,288
Hi, Will.
Hi.

485
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,847
Hi.

486
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:07,750
Hi.
What?

487
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:10,427
Wine, Bernie?

488
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,121
You haven't slept with her,
have you?

489
00:37:13,156 --> 00:37:15,658
That is a cheap question and the
answer is, of course, no comment.

490
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,525
No comment means "yes. "
No, it doesn't.

491
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,495
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.

492
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,264
You see, it means "yes. "

493
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:26,571
So, tell me, Anna,
what do you do?

494
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:30,307
I'm an actress.
Oh, splendid.

495
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:32,673
What do you do?

496
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,310
I'm actually in the
stock market myself.

497
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,844
So...
not really similar fields.

498
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,053
Though I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

499
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,720
P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

500
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:46,422
"Careful there, vicar. "

501
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,726
Always imagined it's a pretty
tough job, though, acting.

502
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,129
I mean, the wages are
a scandal, aren't they?

503
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:54,695
They can be.

504
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,334
I see friends from university, clever
chaps, been in the business longer than you.

505
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,077
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

506
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,918
It's no life.

507
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,944
What sort of acting do you do?

508
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:09,923
Films mainly.

509
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:14,559
Splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

510
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:19,694
I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

511
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,262
$15 million.

512
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,927
Right.

513
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:29,118
So that's... well, fairly good.

514
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:32,175
Right, I think we're ready.

515
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,836
Bella, can you tell me
where I can find...

516
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,474
Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. It's
down the corridor on the right.

517
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:40,385
I'll show you. I'll show you.

518
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,781
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
Talk very quickly.

519
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:47,648
What are you doing
here with Anna Scott?

520
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:50,486
Anna Scott? What, the
film star? Yes. Shut up.

521
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:51,786
Shh.

522
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:53,800
Oh, God!
What?

523
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:55,875
Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.

524
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,458
What did you say to her?

525
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:00,896
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

526
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:03,499
I was still chatting when she
started unbuttoning her jeans.

527
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:04,900
She had to ask me to leave.

528
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,033
Oh, God.

529
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:07,935
So you knew who she was?

530
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,972
Of course I did,
but he didn't!

531
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,651
Well, not instantly,
but I got away with it though.

532
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:20,188
What do you think
of the guinea-fowl?

533
00:39:20,783 --> 00:39:22,251
I'm a vegetarian.

534
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:23,422
Oh, God.

535
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,161
So, how's the guinea-fowl?

536
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,964
Best guinea-fowl
I've ever tasted.

537
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,165
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what I've long suspected,

538
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,201
that we really are the most
desperate lot of under-achievers.

539
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:13,334
Shame.

540
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,036
I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

541
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:18,211
In fact, I think it's something
we should take pride in.

542
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:23,717
I'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize to the saddest act here.

543
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:26,649
Bern.

544
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,084
Well, obviously
it's me, isn't it?

545
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,556
I mean, I work in the city
in a job I don't understand

546
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:36,123
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

547
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:39,128
I haven't had a girlfriend
since, well, since puberty.

548
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,835
And nobody fancies me.

549
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,433
And if these cheeks get
any chubbier, they never will.

550
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:46,412
Nonsense. I fancy you.

551
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:49,079
Really?
Yeah.

552
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,407
Or I did before
you got so fat.

553
00:40:51,442 --> 00:40:52,506
You see.

554
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:56,712
And unless I'm much mistaken your job
still pays you rather a lot of money

555
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,913
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week

556
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:01,283
flogging her guts out in
London's worst record store.

557
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:02,583
Yes!

558
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:05,286
And I haven't got hair,
I've got feathers.

559
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:09,166
And I've got funny goggly eyes
and I'm attracted to cruel men.

560
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:14,897
Actually, no one will marry me because my
boosies have actually started shrinking.

561
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:16,630
You see,
it's incredibly sad.

562
00:41:16,665 --> 00:41:19,401
Yeah, but on the other hand
her best friend is Anna Scott.

563
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,138
That's true, I can't deny it.
She needs me. What can I say?

564
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:27,943
And most of her limbs work whereas
I'm stuck in this thing day and night,

565
00:41:27,978 --> 00:41:29,683
in a house full of ramps.

566
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,085
And to add insult
to serious injury

567
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:36,824
I've totally given up smoking,
my favorite thing.

568
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,834
Well, the truth is,
we can't have a baby.

569
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,837
Oh, Belle...

570
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,015
C'est la vie.

571
00:41:58,574 --> 00:42:01,145
Still, we're lucky
in lots of ways.

572
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:04,217
But, surely that's
worth a brownie.

573
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,150
Well, I don't know.

574
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:10,994
Look at William.

575
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,522
Very unsuccessful
professionally.

576
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:14,641
That's true.

577
00:42:14,676 --> 00:42:15,726
Divorced.

578
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:19,829
Used to be handsome, now kind
of squidgy round the edges.

579
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:23,901
And absolutely certain
never to hear from Anna again

580
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:26,539
once she's heard that his
nickname at school was Floppy.

581
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:29,411
You did. I can't believe it,
you did.

582
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:32,139
Thanks very much. Thank you.

583
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,809
Well at least I get
the last brownie, right?

584
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,075
I think so, yes.

585
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,850
Well, wait, what about me?

586
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,484
I'm sorry?

587
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,789
You think you deserve
the brownie?

588
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,039
Well, a shot at it at least,
huh?

589
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:48,622
Right, well,
you'll have to prove it.

590
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:52,434
I mean, this is a very, very good
brownie and I'm gonna fight for it.

591
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:56,474
I've been on a diet
every day since I was 19

592
00:42:56,966 --> 00:43:00,208
which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

593
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:06,008
I've had a series of not nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.

594
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,143
And every time
I get my heart broken,

595
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:14,024
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

596
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:22,300
And it's taken two rather painful
operations to get me looking like this.

597
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:24,768
Really?
Really.

598
00:43:28,464 --> 00:43:31,206
And one day, not long from now

599
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,475
my looks will go,
they will discover I can't act

600
00:43:36,272 --> 00:43:41,153
and I will become some sad,
middle-aged woman who

601
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,323
looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

602
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:56,926
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

603
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,101
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

604
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:04,633
Thank you for such
a terrific time.

605
00:44:04,668 --> 00:44:05,770
I'm delighted.

606
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,091
That's a great tie.

607
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:10,312
Now you're lying.

608
00:44:10,573 --> 00:44:12,841
Okay, it's true. I told you
I was bad at acting.

609
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,043
It was lovely to meet you.

610
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,309
Yeah. And you.

611
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:18,647
I'll wait until you've gone before
I tell him you're a vegetarian.

612
00:44:18,682 --> 00:44:19,648
No!

613
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:24,752
Goodnight.

614
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,627
I'm sorry about the loo thing.

615
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:28,467
I meant to leave but I just...

616
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:31,327
Look, ring me if you want
someone to go shopping with.

617
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:32,993
I know lots of nice,
cheap places.

618
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:35,440
I mean, not that
money is necessarily...

619
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:37,032
It was just so
nice to meet you.

620
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:38,300
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

621
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:39,938
You're my style guru.

622
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:41,837
Sorry, can I just...

623
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,772
Leave her.

624
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,115
Goodnight, everyone.

625
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:49,081
Max, Belle, we'll see
you in a couple of days.

626
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:52,952
Bye, guys.
Bye, Anna.

627
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:55,249
Love your work.

628
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:56,888
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

629
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,863
Sorry. They always do that
when I leave the house.

630
00:45:07,898 --> 00:45:11,208
It's a stupid thing.
I hate it.

631
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:23,477
Floppy, huh?

632
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,355
It's the hair.
It's to do with the hair.

633
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,160
Why is she in a wheelchair?

634
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,859
Because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

635
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,828
And the pregnancy thing, is
that to do with the accident?

636
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:40,861
You know, I'm not sure.

637
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:44,434
I don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

638
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:54,551
Do you want to...

639
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,024
My place is just...

640
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,757
Too complicated.

641
00:46:01,684 --> 00:46:02,890
That's fine.

642
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,434
Busy tomorrow?

643
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:14,663
I thought you were
leaving tomorrow.

644
00:46:14,698 --> 00:46:15,732
I was.

645
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:20,634
All these streets round here

646
00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:23,605
have these mysterious communal
gardens in the middle of them.

647
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,940
They're like little villages.

648
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,146
Let's go in.

649
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,709
No, that's the point.
They're private villages.

650
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,884
Only the people who live round
the edges are allowed in.

651
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:35,167
You abide by rules like that?

652
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:37,453
I don't, no, no,
but others do.

653
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:39,193
And I just do what I want.

654
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:43,492
Right.

655
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:47,863
Whoopsidaisies.

656
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:51,269
What did you say?

657
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,106
Nothing.
Yes, you did.

658
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,403
No, I didn't.

659
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,144
You said "whoopsidaisies. "

660
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:01,477
No one says "whoopsidaisies," do
they? I mean, unless they're...

661
00:47:01,512 --> 00:47:02,509
There is no "unless. "

662
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:04,978
Because no one has said
"whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

663
00:47:05,013 --> 00:47:09,451
And even then it was just little
girls with blonde ringlets.

664
00:47:09,486 --> 00:47:11,225
Exactly. Right.

665
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:14,089
So here we go again.

666
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,993
Whoopsidaisies.

667
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,362
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
It's a clinical thing.

668
00:47:22,397 --> 00:47:26,068
I'm taking pills and having injections.
And I'm told it won't last long so...

669
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:27,601
Okay, stand aside.

670
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,115
I don't think
that's a good idea.

671
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:32,714
Really, it's quite tricky.
Anna.

672
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,984
Anna, don't, it's harder than
it... No, it's not. It's easy.

673
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,198
Come on, Flopsy.

674
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:51,427
Right. Right!

675
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,871
Oh, bugger.

676
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,776
Oh, God. This could
be very unpleasant.

677
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:07,984
Bugger, bugger.

678
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:16,394
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile?

679
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,640
Nice garden.

680
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:11,449
"For June who loved this garden, from
Joseph who always sat beside her. "

681
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,987
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.

682
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:55,117
Come and sit with me.

683
00:50:08,497 --> 00:50:10,515
Bollocks. Bollocks. Bollocks!

684
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,534
Have you seen my glasses?

685
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,437
No, afraid not.

686
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,270
Big, big bollocks!

687
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:20,108
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.
Everywhere I look there's a pair of glasses.

688
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:22,311
But when I want to go to
the cinema they've vanished.

689
00:50:22,346 --> 00:50:24,311
It's one of life's
real cruelties.

690
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:28,760
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in
the Far East or testicular cancer, is it?

691
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:31,060
Oh, shit, is that the time?

692
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,090
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

693
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,426
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you find them?

694
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:39,405
Sort of.
Great.

695
00:51:09,725 --> 00:51:11,430
So who left who?

696
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:13,135
She left me.

697
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:14,663
Why?

698
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:17,637
She saw through me.

699
00:51:17,672 --> 00:51:19,510
That's not good.

700
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:23,075
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.

701
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,808
I didn't like her last film. Fell
asleep as soon as the lights went down.

702
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:29,295
I don't really care
what the film's like.

703
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,747
Any film with her in,
it's fine by me.

704
00:51:33,148 --> 00:51:35,817
She's not my type at
all. I prefer that other one.

705
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:38,160
You know, blonde,
sweet looking.

706
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,220
You know, what's her name?

707
00:51:40,255 --> 00:51:43,125
Has an orgasm every time you
take her out for a cup of coffee.

708
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,365
Meg Ryan.

709
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:46,393
No, she's too wholesome.

710
00:51:46,428 --> 00:51:50,398
You see, the point about Miss Scott
is she's got that twinkle in her eye.

711
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,403
Probably drug-induced. Spends
most of her life in bloody rehab.

712
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,937
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.

713
00:51:56,972 --> 00:52:00,510
I mean, you see, most girls,
they're all like, "Stay away, chum. "

714
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:04,214
She is absolutely
gagging for it.

715
00:52:05,714 --> 00:52:08,548
Do you know that
in over 50% of languages

716
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,787
the word for "actress" is the
same as the word for "prostitute"?

717
00:52:11,822 --> 00:52:14,222
Where did you
get that from?

718
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,166
And Anna is your
definitive actress,

719
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:23,666
someone really filthy you can
just flip over and start again.

720
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,900
Right, that's it. Sorry.

721
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,005
No, no.
There's really no point.

722
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,709
Sorry, sorry to disturb
you guys but...

723
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:36,543
Can I help?
Well, yeah.

724
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:39,713
I wish I hadn't overheard your
conversation, but I did.

725
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:45,087
And, I just think, you know the person
you're talking about is a real person

726
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:48,156
and I think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration

727
00:52:48,191 --> 00:52:51,760
rather than having jerks
like you drooling over her.

728
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:54,740
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad?

729
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:04,104
I'm sorry.
No, I love that you tried.

730
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,983
Time was I'd have done
the same thing. In fact...

731
00:53:13,215 --> 00:53:14,216
Hi.

732
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,760
Oh, my God!

733
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:20,555
I just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.

734
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:24,693
No, no, no, leave it. I'm
sure you didn't mean any harm.

735
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:27,127
I'm sure it was
just friendly banter.

736
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,464
I'm sure you guys have
dicks the size of peanuts.

737
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,967
Enjoy your dinner.
The tuna's really good.

738
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:39,007
I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

739
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:40,528
No, you were brilliant.

740
00:53:40,563 --> 00:53:42,015
I'm rash and I am stupid.

741
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:45,152
What am I doing with you?

742
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:47,620
I don't know, I'm afraid.

743
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,758
I don't either.

744
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,860
Here we are.

745
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:57,959
Yes.

746
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:02,801
Do you wanna come up?

747
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:10,338
Well, there seems to be lots of
reasons why I shouldn't, so...

748
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:12,181
There are lots of reasons.

749
00:54:16,745 --> 00:54:18,280
Do you wanna come up?

750
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,920
Give me five minutes?

751
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:43,874
Hi.
Hi.

752
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:50,245
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

753
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,349
You've got to go.
Why?

754
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:57,719
Because my boyfriend, who was in America,
is, in fact, now in the next room.

755
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,119
Boyfriend?
Yes.

756
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:00,755
Hey, baby, who is it?

757
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:01,824
It's...

758
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:07,768
Room service.

759
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,796
How are you doing?

760
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:12,709
I thought you guys always
wore those penguin coats?

761
00:55:13,702 --> 00:55:14,976
Usually we do.

762
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,709
But I was just
changed to go home.

763
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:22,077
And then I thought
I'd take this final call.

764
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,580
Oh, great. If you don't mind,
I would like something, too.

765
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:28,560
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water?

766
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:30,935
I'll see what I can do.

767
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,387
Still, not sparkling.

768
00:55:32,854 --> 00:55:34,621
Absolutely.
Ice-cold still water.

769
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:36,741
Unless, of course,
it's illegal in the UK

770
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:38,792
to serve beverages
below room temperature.

771
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:41,796
I wouldn't want you going to
jail just to satisfy my whim, now.

772
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:43,798
I'm sure it's fine.
Thank you.

773
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:47,300
Hey, one more thing,
if you don't mind,

774
00:55:47,335 --> 00:55:50,805
could you adiÂ¾s these dirty dishes
and take out that trash, too?

775
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:54,941
Right.

776
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,277
No. No. Don't do that.

777
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,846
I don't think it's
his job to clear.

778
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:03,157
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's your name, man?

779
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:07,153
Bernie.

780
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:11,534
Oh, listen, Bernie, thank you,
I really appreciate it.

781
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,495
Hey, you...

782
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,443
So, tell me, tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise?

783
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,072
Good surprise.

784
00:56:26,107 --> 00:56:28,343
Oh, you're such a liar.
She hates surprises.

785
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:30,288
Hey, what are you gonna order?

786
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,018
From him.
What are you gonna order?

787
00:56:34,049 --> 00:56:35,405
I haven't decided yet.

788
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,761
Well, don't overdo it.

789
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,418
I don't want people saying,

790
00:56:38,453 --> 00:56:41,729
"There goes that famous actor
with the big fat girlfriend. "

791
00:56:43,825 --> 00:56:45,133
I should leave.

792
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:55,278
This is a fairly strange
reality to be faced with.

793
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,179
I'm so sorry.

794
00:57:01,976 --> 00:57:04,922
I don't know what to say.

795
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:12,429
I think "goodbye"
is traditional.

796
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:20,186
Come on. Open up.

797
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,323
This is me.

798
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:26,054
Spikey.

799
00:59:27,288 --> 00:59:31,600
I'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.

800
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,706
Come on. Hit me with it.

801
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:42,245
There's this girl.

802
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:47,284
See, I'd been getting
a female vibe. Good.

803
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:49,680
Speak on, dear friend.

804
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:54,222
She's someone
who can't be mine,

805
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:02,492
and it's as if I've taken "love heroin"
and now I can't ever have it again.

806
01:00:03,858 --> 01:00:07,134
I've opened Pandora's Box and
there's this trouble inside.

807
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:12,200
Yeah.

808
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:17,410
Tricky.

809
01:00:20,642 --> 01:00:23,349
I knew a girl at school
called Pandora.

810
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,624
Never got to see
her box though.

811
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,589
Right.

812
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,824
Right, thanks,
that's very helpful.

813
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:39,595
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend?

814
01:00:40,895 --> 01:00:44,706
No. No. Why, did you?

815
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:48,640
Oh, bloody hell,
I don't believe it.

816
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,907
My whole life ruined because
I don't read Hello! Magazine.

817
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:57,480
Let's face facts. This was
always a no-win situation.

818
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,887
Anna's a goddess.

819
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,629
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

820
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:06,054
Buggered, is it?

821
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:07,487
Every time.

822
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:11,526
But don't despair, I think I have
the solution to your problems.

823
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:13,433
Really?

824
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:16,765
Her name is Tessa, and she works
in the contracts department.

825
01:01:16,898 --> 01:01:20,400
The hair, I admit,
is unfashionably frizzy.

826
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:24,906
But she's bright as a button, and
kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.

827
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:26,282
Apparently.

828
01:01:29,243 --> 01:01:30,744
Now, try.

829
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:38,453
I got completely lost.
It's real difficult, isn't it?

830
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:40,289
Everything's got the
word Kensington in it.

831
01:01:40,324 --> 01:01:42,090
Kensington Park Road.
Kensington Gardens.

832
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,556
Kensington bloody
Park Gardens.

833
01:01:43,591 --> 01:01:45,093
Look, Tessa,
this is Bella, my wife.

834
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:47,228
Hello. You're in a wheelchair.

835
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:49,030
Yeah, that's right.

836
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:51,001
And this is William.

837
01:01:51,036 --> 01:01:52,937
Hello, William.
Hi.

838
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:54,875
Max has told me
everything about you.

839
01:01:55,203 --> 01:01:56,302
Has he?

840
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,339
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

841
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:00,946
Wine?
Oh, yes, please.

842
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:03,344
Come on, Willie,
let's get sloshed.

843
01:02:03,379 --> 01:02:04,545
Red or white?

844
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,751
Red.

845
01:02:08,216 --> 01:02:09,524
Keziah...

846
01:02:11,486 --> 01:02:13,019
Some woodcock?

847
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:15,431
No, thank you,
I'm a fruitarian.

848
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:22,139
What is a fruitarian exactly?

849
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:27,712
Well, we believe that fruits and vegetables
have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel.

850
01:02:28,436 --> 01:02:32,540
We only eat things that have
actually fallen from the tree or bush.

851
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:34,883
That are, in fact,
dead already.

852
01:02:38,813 --> 01:02:40,189
Oh, right.

853
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,053
Right.

854
01:02:42,984 --> 01:02:45,019
So, these carrots...

855
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:47,055
Have been murdered, yes.

856
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:48,363
Murdered?

857
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:53,499
Gosh, poor old carrots.
That's beastly.

858
01:02:57,832 --> 01:02:59,470
Delicious coffee.

859
01:03:00,968 --> 01:03:02,970
I'm sorry about the lamb.

860
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:07,612
No, I thought it was really,
you know, interesting.

861
01:03:08,342 --> 01:03:10,651
"Interesting" means
"inedible. "

862
01:03:11,512 --> 01:03:14,015
Really inedible,
yes, you're right.

863
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:20,826
Well, maybe we'll meet again.

864
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:25,970
Yeah. Yeah. That'll be great.

865
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:36,072
Bye.

866
01:03:56,023 --> 01:03:57,160
Well?

867
01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:01,330
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

868
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,035
And?

869
01:04:07,902 --> 01:04:12,373
You see, I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

870
01:04:14,008 --> 01:04:16,420
To find someone
you actually love,

871
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:20,651
who'll love you, I mean, the
chances are always minuscule.

872
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:26,152
Look at me.
Apart from the American,

873
01:04:26,187 --> 01:04:28,690
I've only loved two girls,
both total disasters.

874
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,356
That's not fair.
No, really.

875
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:34,695
One of them marries me then leaves me
faster than you can say "Indiana Jones. "

876
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:38,166
And the other, who seriously
ought to have known better,

877
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:40,368
casually marries
my best friend.

878
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:41,667
She still loves you though.

879
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:44,239
Yeah, in a depressingly
asexual way.

880
01:04:46,474 --> 01:04:49,076
I never fancied
you much, actually.

881
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,418
Oh, God.

882
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,829
I loved you, you were terribly
funny, but all that kissing my ears...

883
01:04:58,386 --> 01:05:00,853
I don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

884
01:05:00,888 --> 01:05:05,029
I shall find myself 30 years from
now still sitting on this sofa.

885
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:07,445
Do you wanna stay?

886
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,262
Yeah, why not.

887
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:12,767
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

888
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:17,247
Here we go.

889
01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:19,925
Goodnight.

890
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,077
Night.

891
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:40,432
See you, Will.

892
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:41,738
Right. Right.

893
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,340
Guilty. Very, very guilty.

894
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:54,012
So it seems.

895
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,124
Hi.

896
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,395
Can I come in?

897
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,035
Come in.

898
01:06:57,405 --> 01:07:00,608
They were taken years ago.

899
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:02,246
I know it was...

900
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:07,286
But I was poor
and it happens a lot.

901
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:10,592
That's not an excuse.
I just...

902
01:07:13,354 --> 01:07:18,633
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though

903
01:07:20,027 --> 01:07:23,963
someone was filming
me as well.

904
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:29,812
So what was a stupid photo
shoot now looks like a porn film.

905
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:37,120
And the pictures have been sold,
and they're just everywhere.

906
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,051
I didn't know where to go.

907
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:47,698
The hotel's surrounded.

908
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:54,067
I know it's been months but...

909
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:56,935
This is the place.

910
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,343
Thank you.

911
01:08:05,673 --> 01:08:11,054
I'm just in London for two
days, but what with your papers,

912
01:08:11,178 --> 01:08:13,282
it's the worst place to be.

913
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:17,985
I mean, these pictures are just
so horrible and they're so grainy.

914
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,892
And it makes me look like...

915
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:21,765
Listen, don't think about it.

916
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,897
We'll sort it out.

917
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,432
Now what would you like?

918
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:34,606
Tea? Bath?

919
01:08:36,037 --> 01:08:37,140
Yeah.

920
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,952
A bath would be great.

921
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:47,051
Oh, Christ alive!

922
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:54,466
Brilliant. Fantastic.

923
01:08:57,224 --> 01:08:58,930
Magnificent.

924
01:09:07,168 --> 01:09:08,840
You must be Spike.

925
01:09:22,483 --> 01:09:23,484
Hi.

926
01:09:23,884 --> 01:09:26,091
Just checking.

927
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,061
Thank you, God.

928
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:40,444
I'm really sorry
about last time.

929
01:09:41,602 --> 01:09:44,344
I mean, he just flew in.
I had no idea.

930
01:09:45,406 --> 01:09:48,978
In fact, I had no idea if he
was ever gonna fly in again.

931
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,730
Listen, it's not often
one has the opportunity to

932
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:55,483
adiÂ¾s the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.

933
01:09:55,518 --> 01:09:58,225
It was thrilling for me.

934
01:10:02,123 --> 01:10:03,624
So how is he?

935
01:10:06,093 --> 01:10:07,537
I don't know.

936
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:13,067
It just got to the point
where I couldn't remember

937
01:10:13,102 --> 01:10:15,809
any of the reasons
why we were together.

938
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:19,310
And you and love?

939
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:26,916
Oh, well, there's a question
without an interesting answer.

940
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:34,822
I have thought about you.

941
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:42,863
It's just that any time
I've tried to keep

942
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:47,301
anything normal
with a person that was normal,

943
01:10:47,336 --> 01:10:49,235
it's just been a disaster.

944
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:52,376
Yeah, no, listen,
I appreciate that, absolutely.

945
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:56,379
So what is that,
a film you're doing?

946
01:10:57,278 --> 01:10:59,382
I start in LA on Tuesday.

947
01:11:00,581 --> 01:11:03,717
Would you like me to
take you through your lines?

948
01:11:03,752 --> 01:11:06,854
Would you? Because it's
all talk, talk, talk.

949
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:11,069
Come on, hand it over. Right.

950
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:13,902
Basic plot?

951
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:18,599
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
officer, who in about 20 minutes

952
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:21,602
is gonna save the world
from nuclear disaster.

953
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,103
Okay, well done, you.

954
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:26,440
"Message from Command, would you
like them to send in the HK's?"

955
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:28,307
No. Turn over four TRS's

956
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:32,213
and tell them we need radar feedback
before the KFT's return at 19:00.

957
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:34,248
Then inform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover

958
01:11:34,283 --> 01:11:35,817
from 10:00 through 12: 15.

959
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,316
And if you say one word about

960
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,687
how many mistakes I made in that
speech, I'll pelt you with olives.

961
01:11:39,722 --> 01:11:41,589
"Very well, Captain, I'll
pass that on, straight away. "

962
01:11:41,624 --> 01:11:43,791
Thank you.
How many mistakes did I make?

963
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:44,792
Eleven.

964
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:46,927
Dammit. And, Wainwright...

965
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:48,661
Cartwright.

966
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:51,230
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is...

967
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,299
I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

968
01:11:53,334 --> 01:11:55,769
so could you get a message to
him that I may be a little late?

969
01:11:55,804 --> 01:11:58,339
"Certainly. "
And little Johnny?

970
01:11:58,374 --> 01:12:00,839
My son's name is Johnny?
Yeah.

971
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:02,541
Well, then get
a message to him, too.

972
01:12:02,576 --> 01:12:05,412
"I'll do what I can, Captain,
but I can't promise anything. "

973
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,391
And, Cartwright goes.

974
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:11,050
What do you think?

975
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:14,058
Gripping. You know,
it's not Jane Austen.

976
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:17,031
It's not Henry James.
But it's gripping.

977
01:12:17,691 --> 01:12:19,225
Think I should do
Henry James instead?

978
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,028
Well, I think you would be
brilliant in Henry James

979
01:12:21,063 --> 01:12:24,531
but, you know,
this writer... Writers...

980
01:12:24,566 --> 01:12:26,398
They're pretty damn good, too.

981
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:29,069
Well, you never get anyone
in Wings of the Dove saying,

982
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:31,974
"Inform the Pentagon,
we need Black Star cover. "

983
01:12:32,009 --> 01:12:34,845
Well, and for me,
the book is the poorer for it.

984
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,785
I can't believe you
have that picture.

985
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,922
You like Chagall?

986
01:12:45,853 --> 01:12:46,990
I do.

987
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,724
It feels like how
love should be.

988
01:12:50,759 --> 01:12:52,860
Floating through
a dark blue sky.

989
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:56,764
With a goat, playing a violin.

990
01:12:56,799 --> 01:12:58,097
Well, yes.

991
01:12:58,132 --> 01:13:01,670
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

992
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,628
You have big feet.

993
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:30,638
Yes. Yes, always have had.

994
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:36,039
You know what they say
about men with big feet?

995
01:13:37,905 --> 01:13:40,146
No, I don't know. What's that?

996
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:46,146
Big feet, large shoes.

997
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,653
The thing that's so
irritating is that now

998
01:13:54,688 --> 01:13:57,607
I'm so totally fierce when
it comes to nudity clauses.

999
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,527
You actually have clauses
in your contract about nudity?

1000
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:02,061
Definitely.

1001
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:06,868
You may show the dent of the top of
the artist's buttocks but neither cheek.

1002
01:14:06,903 --> 01:14:11,640
Or, if there's a stunt bottom being
used, artist must have full consultation.

1003
01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:13,972
You have a stunt bottom?

1004
01:14:14,007 --> 01:14:17,113
Well, I could have
a stunt bottom, yes.

1005
01:14:18,312 --> 01:14:21,782
And are people tempted to go for
better bottoms than their own.

1006
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:25,050
Yeah. I mean, I would.
This is important stuff.

1007
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:29,156
Well, it's one hell of a job, isn't it?
I mean, what do you put on your passport?

1008
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,499
Profession.
Mel Gibson's bottom.

1009
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:33,894
Actually, Mel does
his own ass work.

1010
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:34,927
Right.

1011
01:14:34,962 --> 01:14:36,397
Why wouldn't he?

1012
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:37,534
Absolutely.

1013
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:39,935
It's delicious.

1014
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,570
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

1015
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,271
Both. Equally.

1016
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:49,076
But you wouldn't
necessarily lick both?

1017
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:50,816
Well, this is tart.

1018
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,915
And fuzz free.

1019
01:14:59,987 --> 01:15:04,299
And... The bedroom,
I've put clean sheets on.

1020
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:17,014
Today's been a good day.

1021
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:21,711
Which in the circumstances
is unexpected.

1022
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,752
Thank you.

1023
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:33,286
Anyway, time for bed.

1024
01:15:35,889 --> 01:15:37,732
Or, sofa bed.

1025
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,635
Goodnight.

1026
01:16:33,647 --> 01:16:35,057
Oh, my God.

1027
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:45,162
Hello?

1028
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,433
Hello.

1029
01:16:49,496 --> 01:16:50,662
Spike?

1030
01:16:50,697 --> 01:16:53,939
I wonder if I could
have a little word?

1031
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:55,133
Right.

1032
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:56,535
I don't want to
interfere or nothing,

1033
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,207
but she's just split up from her
boyfriend. That's right, innit?

1034
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:01,378
Maybe.

1035
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,687
And she's in your house.

1036
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:05,981
Yes?

1037
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,483
And you get on very well.

1038
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,084
Yes.

1039
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:15,163
Well, isn't this perhaps
a nice opportunity to

1040
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,792
slip her one?

1041
01:17:20,827 --> 01:17:21,962
Spike, for God's sake.
She's in trouble.

1042
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:23,061
Just get a grip.

1043
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:26,406
Right, you think it's the
wrong moment, fair enough.

1044
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,039
Do you mind if I have a go?

1045
01:17:32,074 --> 01:17:33,916
Spike!
Right, okay.

1046
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,012
I'll talk to you
in the morning.

1047
01:17:37,047 --> 01:17:39,416
Okay. Might be too late,
but okay.

1048
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,410
Please, sod off.

1049
01:17:53,445 --> 01:17:55,160
Okay, sorry.
No.

1050
01:17:55,195 --> 01:18:00,007
No, no, no, wait, I thought
you were someone else.

1051
01:18:01,568 --> 01:18:05,072
I thought you were Spike.
I'm thrilled that you're not.

1052
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,137
Wow.

1053
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,307
What?

1054
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,180
Nothing.

1055
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:56,450
It does strike me as, well, surreal
that I'm allowed to see you naked.

1056
01:19:56,485 --> 01:19:58,585
You and every person
in this country.

1057
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,394
God, yeah, I'm sorry.

1058
01:20:01,221 --> 01:20:05,965
What is it about men and
nudity? Particularly breasts.

1059
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,896
And how can you be
so interested in them?

1060
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,962
Well...

1061
01:20:10,997 --> 01:20:13,374
No, but seriously.
They're just breasts.

1062
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,234
Every second person
in the world has them.

1063
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:18,038
Well, more than that, actually,
when you think about it.

1064
01:20:18,073 --> 01:20:20,814
You know, Meatloaf
has a very nice pair.

1065
01:20:21,408 --> 01:20:25,077
But they're odd looking.
They're for milk.

1066
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,915
Your mother has them. You've
seen a thousand of them.

1067
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,985
What's all the funs about?

1068
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:35,657
Actually, I can't think what it is,
really. Let me just have a quick look.

1069
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:42,465
No, no, beats me.

1070
01:20:46,867 --> 01:20:49,040
Rita Hayworth used to say,

1071
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:53,783
"They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me. "

1072
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:56,376
Who was Gilda?

1073
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,385
Her most famous part.

1074
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,414
Men went to bed
with the dream,

1075
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:05,725
and they didn't like it when
they woke up with reality.

1076
01:21:07,587 --> 01:21:09,396
Do you feel that way?

1077
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:15,762
You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

1078
01:21:19,766 --> 01:21:21,506
I'll be right back.

1079
01:21:35,115 --> 01:21:36,753
Breakfast in bed.

1080
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:40,860
Or it's brunch, or lunch,
or something.

1081
01:21:41,288 --> 01:21:42,528
My God.

1082
01:21:44,457 --> 01:21:46,436
Can I stay a bit longer?

1083
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:50,730
Stay forever.

1084
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,601
Okay.

1085
01:21:55,068 --> 01:21:56,706
I forgot the jam.

1086
01:22:00,407 --> 01:22:02,910
I'll get the jam,
you get the door.

1087
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:19,859
Jesus Christ.

1088
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:24,366
What?

1089
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,342
What is it?

1090
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,301
Nothing, really.

1091
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:31,204
You're up to something.

1092
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,546
Anna, no, please.

1093
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:37,986
Oh, my God.

1094
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:41,753
And they got a picture
of you dressed like that.

1095
01:22:41,882 --> 01:22:43,019
Yes.

1096
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,155
Undressed like this, yeah.

1097
01:22:48,955 --> 01:22:50,355
Morning, darling ones.

1098
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:54,429
It's me. The press are here.
No, there are hundreds of them.

1099
01:22:54,895 --> 01:23:00,504
My brilliant plan was not so brilliant. I
know. I know. I know. Just get over here.

1100
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:01,906
Dammit.

1101
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:09,876
I wouldn't go outside.

1102
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:10,945
Why not?

1103
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,816
Just take my word for it.

1104
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:43,141
How did I look?
Not bad. Not at all bad.

1105
01:23:43,176 --> 01:23:47,283
Well-chosen briefs, I'd say.
Chicks love gray.

1106
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:50,553
Nice, firm buttocks.

1107
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:56,688
How are you doing?

1108
01:23:56,723 --> 01:23:58,862
How do you think I'm doing?

1109
01:24:01,094 --> 01:24:02,162
I don't know what happened.

1110
01:24:02,197 --> 01:24:03,261
Oh, I do.

1111
01:24:03,296 --> 01:24:08,245
Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck
or two, telling the papers where I was.

1112
01:24:08,435 --> 01:24:09,834
That's not true.
Really?

1113
01:24:09,869 --> 01:24:12,238
The entire British press got
up this morning and thought,

1114
01:24:12,273 --> 01:24:13,571
"I know where Anna Scott is.

1115
01:24:13,606 --> 01:24:16,609
"She's in that house with the
blue door in Notting Hill. "

1116
01:24:16,644 --> 01:24:19,429
And then you go out
in your goddamn underwear.

1117
01:24:19,464 --> 01:24:22,215
I went out in my goddamn
underwear, too. Get out.

1118
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,800
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1119
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:25,351
I'm so sorry.

1120
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,486
This is such an
unbelievable mess.

1121
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,491
I come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

1122
01:24:31,526 --> 01:24:33,944
and now I've just landed
in it all over again.

1123
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:36,363
I mean, for God's sake,
I've got a boyfriend.

1124
01:24:36,398 --> 01:24:37,529
You have?

1125
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:40,200
Well, as far as they're
concerned I do. Yes.

1126
01:24:40,235 --> 01:24:41,833
And now, tomorrow,
there'll be pictures

1127
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,974
of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu.

1128
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,707
I know that.
But let's stay calm.

1129
01:24:47,742 --> 01:24:49,674
No, you can stay calm!
Right.

1130
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:52,045
All right, this is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?

1131
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,312
Minimum input,
maximum publicity.

1132
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:58,785
Everywhere you go people will say, "Oh,
well done. You slept with that actress.

1133
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,662
"We saw the pictures. "

1134
01:25:01,187 --> 01:25:03,394
That is spectacularly unfair.

1135
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:05,790
Who knows, maybe it'll
even help business.

1136
01:25:05,825 --> 01:25:08,495
"Buy a boring book about Egypt from
the guy that screwed Anna Scott. "

1137
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:13,341
Now, stop. Stop.
Stop, I beg you. Calm down.

1138
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:14,632
Have a cup of tea.

1139
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:17,010
I don't want a
goddamn cup of tea.

1140
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,639
I just wanna go home.

1141
01:25:20,807 --> 01:25:24,878
Spike, see who that is. And put
some clothes on, for God's sake.

1142
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:26,811
Looks like a chauffeur to me.

1143
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:28,980
Spike owes you an expensive
dinner. Or holiday.

1144
01:25:29,015 --> 01:25:32,018
Depending if he's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

1145
01:25:32,053 --> 01:25:36,261
That is not true. Wait a
minute. This is crazy behavior.

1146
01:25:36,956 --> 01:25:40,025
Can't we just laugh
about all this?

1147
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,663
Seriously, in the huge sweep of
things, this stuff doesn't matter.

1148
01:25:43,698 --> 01:25:47,484
What he's gonna say next is there's
people starving in the Sudan.

1149
01:25:47,519 --> 01:25:51,271
Well, there are. And we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.

1150
01:25:51,306 --> 01:25:52,504
My best friend slipped.

1151
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:54,205
She slipped down stairs,
cracked her back,

1152
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,775
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

1153
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:00,723
You know, all I'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.

1154
01:26:01,247 --> 01:26:03,782
You're right.
Of course, you're right.

1155
01:26:03,817 --> 01:26:06,684
It's just that I've dealt
with this garbage for 10 years.

1156
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,861
You've had it for 10 minutes. Our
perspectives are very different.

1157
01:26:12,025 --> 01:26:15,695
I mean, today's newspapers will be
lining tomorrow's wastepaper bins.

1158
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:17,262
Excuse me?

1159
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,743
Well, you know,
it's just one day.

1160
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:23,636
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

1161
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:28,410
You really don't get it.
This story will be filed.

1162
01:26:28,675 --> 01:26:31,845
Every time anyone writes
anything about me,

1163
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,654
they'll dig up these photos.

1164
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:37,693
Newspapers last forever.
I'll regret this forever.

1165
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:46,929
Right.

1166
01:26:48,128 --> 01:26:51,965
I will feel the opposite,
if that's okay by you.

1167
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,915
And always be glad
that you came to stay.

1168
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:01,479
But...

1169
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,955
You're probably right.
You'd better go.

1170
01:27:45,919 --> 01:27:47,329
Was it you?

1171
01:27:50,657 --> 01:27:54,297
I may have told a few
people down the pub.

1172
01:27:56,996 --> 01:27:58,167
Right.

1173
01:29:49,142 --> 01:29:50,708
Have I got something for you.

1174
01:29:50,743 --> 01:29:52,310
Something which will
make you love me so much,

1175
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,792
you will want to hug me every
day for the rest of my life.

1176
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:57,655
Blimey, what is it?

1177
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:03,364
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London and her agent in New York.

1178
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:11,831
Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.

1179
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:14,641
Yeah. Brilliant, thanks.

1180
01:30:14,767 --> 01:30:18,305
I'll see you tonight.
Hi, Marty. Sexy cardi.

1181
01:30:45,698 --> 01:30:48,433
Hello. I have a little
speech to make.

1182
01:30:48,468 --> 01:30:51,504
I won't stand up because
I can't be bothered.

1183
01:30:53,473 --> 01:30:55,573
Exactly a year ago today,

1184
01:30:55,608 --> 01:30:58,611
this man here started the
finest restaurant in London.

1185
01:30:58,646 --> 01:31:00,011
Hear, hear.
Thank you very much.

1186
01:31:00,046 --> 01:31:02,749
Unfortunately, no one
ever came to eat here.

1187
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,558
It's a tiny hiccough.

1188
01:31:05,718 --> 01:31:07,385
And so, we have to
face the fact that

1189
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,026
from next week, we must
find somewhere new to eat.

1190
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:15,637
I just want to say to Tony,
don't take it personally.

1191
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:20,666
The more I think about things, the
more I see no rhyme or reason in life.

1192
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:24,604
No one knows why some things
work out and some things don't.

1193
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,142
Why some of us get lucky,
and some of us...

1194
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:30,283
Get fired.
What?

1195
01:31:30,843 --> 01:31:33,913
Yeah, well, it seems they're
shifting the whole outfit

1196
01:31:33,948 --> 01:31:36,620
much more towards
the emerging markets.

1197
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:40,485
And of course, well,
I was total crap, so...

1198
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,523
A toast to Bernie, the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.

1199
01:31:43,558 --> 01:31:46,292
I thank you. And Tony,
the worst restaurateur.

1200
01:31:46,327 --> 01:31:48,144
Tony and Bernie.
Both crap.

1201
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:49,927
The terrible two.

1202
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:51,998
In their own special ways.

1203
01:31:54,434 --> 01:31:58,973
Since it's an evening of
announcements, I've also got one.

1204
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,841
I've decided to get engaged.

1205
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:07,846
I've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke.

1206
01:32:09,215 --> 01:32:12,924
Who I know is gonna make me
happy for the rest of my life.

1207
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,788
Well, wait a sec. I mean...

1208
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:19,942
I'm your brother. I don't
know anything about this.

1209
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:23,062
Is he... I don't know,
is he financially viable?

1210
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:27,108
He's an artist with
brilliant prospects.

1211
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,471
This is a secret you've
been keeping from me?

1212
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:33,204
No. No. I swear.

1213
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:35,048
By the way, it's you.

1214
01:32:38,377 --> 01:32:39,446
Me?

1215
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,186
What do you think?

1216
01:32:42,982 --> 01:32:44,392
Well, yeah.

1217
01:32:47,453 --> 01:32:48,693
Groovy.

1218
01:32:50,656 --> 01:32:54,994
Excuse me, are there
any more announcements?

1219
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:57,094
Well, actually, yes.

1220
01:32:57,129 --> 01:33:01,907
I feel I should apologize to everyone
for my behavior over the last six months.

1221
01:33:02,401 --> 01:33:05,803
I have, as you know, been
somewhat down in the mouth.

1222
01:33:05,838 --> 01:33:08,409
Well, there's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1223
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:13,446
But I just wish to make it
clear that I've turned a corner,

1224
01:33:13,481 --> 01:33:17,394
and henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.

1225
01:33:38,704 --> 01:33:42,379
Oh, God, I'm horribly drunk.

1226
01:33:43,509 --> 01:33:44,783
Me, too.

1227
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:46,553
Come here.

1228
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,752
So you've laid the ghost?

1229
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,593
I believe I have.

1230
01:33:56,822 --> 01:33:59,564
Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?

1231
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:03,630
No. No, I don't think I do.

1232
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:08,234
Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London,

1233
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:09,700
grasping her Oscar,

1234
01:34:09,735 --> 01:34:13,774
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1235
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,175
Oh, God, no.

1236
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,455
So, not over her, in fact.

1237
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:08,228
Can I help you?
Yeah.

1238
01:35:09,295 --> 01:35:10,579
I'm looking for Anna Scott.

1239
01:35:10,614 --> 01:35:11,864
Does she know you're coming?

1240
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:13,164
No.

1241
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,433
No, she doesn't.

1242
01:35:15,468 --> 01:35:17,435
I'm afraid I can't
let you through, sir.

1243
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:21,941
Right. I mean, I am actually
a friend. I'm not a lunatic.

1244
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,429
But no, you basically...

1245
01:35:25,464 --> 01:35:27,016
Can't let you through, sir.

1246
01:36:08,587 --> 01:36:10,221
Well, this is...

1247
01:36:10,256 --> 01:36:13,100
I only found out
you were here yesterday.

1248
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:16,062
Well, I was going to call,
but I...

1249
01:36:16,097 --> 01:36:17,298
Anna.

1250
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,499
Yes.

1251
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:22,101
Things aren't going very well
and it's our last day.

1252
01:36:22,136 --> 01:36:26,060
Absolutely, yeah,
you're clearly very busy.

1253
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:29,984
But if you could wait,
there are things to say.

1254
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:36,084
Okay.

1255
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:41,090
Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.

1256
01:36:48,494 --> 01:36:50,303
Come and have a look.

1257
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:56,473
Are you a fan of Henry James?

1258
01:36:57,136 --> 01:36:58,637
This is a Henry James film?

1259
01:36:58,672 --> 01:36:59,877
Yeah.

1260
01:37:08,481 --> 01:37:09,613
This is Harry.

1261
01:37:09,648 --> 01:37:13,052
He'll give you a pair of headphones,
so you can hear the dialogue.

1262
01:37:13,087 --> 01:37:14,720
Thank you very much.
No problem.

1263
01:37:14,755 --> 01:37:15,820
Hi.

1264
01:37:15,855 --> 01:37:18,699
Hi, here we go.
Volume's on the side.

1265
01:37:18,824 --> 01:37:20,025
There. Have a seat.

1266
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,128
Thank you.

1267
01:37:29,735 --> 01:37:32,371
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.

1268
01:37:32,406 --> 01:37:35,007
Well, we've got to. I have
to be in New York on Thursday.

1269
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:36,679
Stop showing off.

1270
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,812
God, that's an enormous arse.

1271
01:37:39,847 --> 01:37:41,518
I'm not listening.

1272
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,647
No, but seriously,
it's not fair.

1273
01:37:43,682 --> 01:37:46,684
So many tragic young
teenagers with anorexia,

1274
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,888
and that girl has an arse she
could perfectly well share around

1275
01:37:48,923 --> 01:37:52,426
with at least 10 other women,
and still be big bottomed.

1276
01:37:52,892 --> 01:37:54,959
I would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1277
01:37:54,994 --> 01:38:00,967
you and your bony little excuse for an
arse would be well advised to keep quiet.

1278
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:04,368
Now, down to business,
the end of the scene.

1279
01:38:04,403 --> 01:38:07,748
I ask you when you're telling
everyone, and you say...

1280
01:38:08,908 --> 01:38:11,217
"Tomorrow will be
soon enough. "

1281
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:14,013
And then I... Right, okay.

1282
01:38:14,613 --> 01:38:18,184
So who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1283
01:38:18,219 --> 01:38:19,390
No one.

1284
01:38:21,487 --> 01:38:23,626
Just some guy from the past.

1285
01:38:24,256 --> 01:38:28,932
It's a bit of an awkward situation
really. I don't know what he's doing here.

1286
01:38:45,244 --> 01:38:46,586
Of course.

1287
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:55,855
Thanks, I've got to...

1288
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:57,265
Any time.

1289
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,203
Ladies and gentlemen, can we have
you all on your first marks, please.

1290
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,977
On your first marks.

1291
01:39:26,151 --> 01:39:28,858
I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1292
01:39:28,988 --> 01:39:31,331
but there's
a delivery for you.

1293
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,892
Martin, really,
can't you just do it yourself?

1294
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:38,397
But you see, this is not for
the shop. This is for you.

1295
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:42,066
Right, okay.

1296
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:47,050
Now tell me, if I employed a wet rag,
would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1297
01:39:50,743 --> 01:39:51,744
Hi.

1298
01:39:53,812 --> 01:39:54,983
Hello.

1299
01:39:55,881 --> 01:39:57,915
You disappeared.

1300
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:01,069
Yeah. Yeah, I had to leave.

1301
01:40:01,104 --> 01:40:04,189
I didn't want to disturb.

1302
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,258
How have you been?

1303
01:40:06,293 --> 01:40:07,558
Fine. Fine.

1304
01:40:07,593 --> 01:40:09,093
I don't know, everything
much the same, you know.

1305
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:12,939
When they change the law, Spike
and I will marry immediately.

1306
01:40:13,532 --> 01:40:17,275
Whereas you, I've watched
in wonder. Awards, glory.

1307
01:40:17,569 --> 01:40:21,278
Oh, no, it's all nonsense,
believe me.

1308
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:26,447
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but nonsense it all is.

1309
01:40:29,782 --> 01:40:33,889
Well, yesterday was
our last day of filming,

1310
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:36,561
so I'm leaving.

1311
01:40:38,424 --> 01:40:39,630
But...

1312
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:47,299
I brought this for you from home.
So I thought I'd give it to you.

1313
01:40:50,035 --> 01:40:51,377
Thank you.

1314
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,808
Shall I...
Oh, no, don't open it now,

1315
01:40:55,843 --> 01:40:57,582
I'll be embarrassed.

1316
01:40:59,745 --> 01:41:03,649
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1317
01:41:03,684 --> 01:41:07,528
I actually had it in my
apartment. I thought you...

1318
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,222
But when it came to it,

1319
01:41:12,257 --> 01:41:15,727
I didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.

1320
01:41:16,462 --> 01:41:17,668
Twice.

1321
01:41:19,765 --> 01:41:22,802
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1322
01:41:24,269 --> 01:41:27,875
Then you came,
and I figured...

1323
01:41:32,244 --> 01:41:36,817
The thing is...

1324
01:41:39,685 --> 01:41:41,664
What? What is the thing?

1325
01:41:43,589 --> 01:41:47,126
Don't even think about it.
Go away, immediately. Go away.

1326
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:49,128
Right. Sorry.

1327
01:41:53,532 --> 01:41:55,170
You were saying?

1328
01:41:57,536 --> 01:41:58,605
Yes.

1329
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,652
I have to go away today,
but I wondered if I didn't,

1330
01:42:07,613 --> 01:42:10,616
whether you might
let me see you a little,

1331
01:42:11,817 --> 01:42:14,559
or a lot, maybe.

1332
01:42:18,223 --> 01:42:20,566
See if you could
like me again.

1333
01:42:21,827 --> 01:42:23,929
But yesterday that actor
asked you who I was

1334
01:42:23,964 --> 01:42:26,602
and you just dismissed
me out of hand.

1335
01:42:27,733 --> 01:42:28,973
I heard.

1336
01:42:30,903 --> 01:42:33,937
You had a microphone,
I had headphones.

1337
01:42:33,972 --> 01:42:36,508
What, you expect me to tell
the truth about my life

1338
01:42:36,543 --> 01:42:39,147
to the most indiscreet
man in England?

1339
01:42:41,513 --> 01:42:44,459
Excuse me. It's your
mother on the phone.

1340
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:50,454
Will you tell her I'll
ring her back, please?

1341
01:42:50,489 --> 01:42:53,459
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

1342
01:42:53,494 --> 01:42:55,359
and it's now been
about 24 hours

1343
01:42:55,394 --> 01:42:58,897
and the foot that was purple is
now sort of blackish in color and...

1344
01:42:58,932 --> 01:43:02,367
Right, right, yeah.
Perfect timing as ever.

1345
01:43:04,736 --> 01:43:07,079
Martin,
hold the fort a second.

1346
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:10,411
Yes, all right.

1347
01:43:16,915 --> 01:43:22,126
Could I just say, I thought
Ghost was the most wonderful film.

1348
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:25,524
Is that right?

1349
01:43:25,559 --> 01:43:26,764
Oh, yes.

1350
01:43:31,597 --> 01:43:36,842
I've always wondered what Patrick
Swayze's like in real life.

1351
01:43:38,137 --> 01:43:40,756
I can't say that I know
Patrick all that well.

1352
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:43,340
What, he wasn't that
friendly during filming?

1353
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:48,688
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

1354
01:43:52,918 --> 01:43:54,556
Oh, right. Sorry.

1355
01:43:55,454 --> 01:43:58,491
Right. Always been
a bit of an ass.

1356
01:44:02,094 --> 01:44:05,837
Anyway, well,
it was lovely to meet you.

1357
01:44:05,964 --> 01:44:11,038
I'm a huge fan of yours.
And Demi's of course.

1358
01:44:14,173 --> 01:44:15,845
Sorry about that.

1359
01:44:17,009 --> 01:44:18,142
That's fine.

1360
01:44:18,177 --> 01:44:22,591
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1361
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:26,029
Anna, look...

1362
01:44:27,653 --> 01:44:30,030
I'm a fairly
level-headed bloke.

1363
01:44:31,456 --> 01:44:36,462
Not often in and
out of love. But...

1364
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:47,648
Can I just say "no" to your kind
request, and leave it at that?

1365
01:44:52,277 --> 01:44:53,346
Yes.

1366
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:57,917
Fine. Of course, I...

1367
01:44:59,284 --> 01:45:00,660
Of course.

1368
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:06,725
Well, I'll just be going then.
It was nice to see you.

1369
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:11,970
The thing is,
with you I'm in real danger.

1370
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:18,172
It seems like a perfect situation,
apart from that foul temper of yours.

1371
01:45:18,437 --> 01:45:22,374
But my relatively
inexperienced heart

1372
01:45:22,409 --> 01:45:24,945
would, I fear, not recover

1373
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:31,292
if I was once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

1374
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:35,588
There are just too many
pictures of you, too many films.

1375
01:45:36,421 --> 01:45:41,393
You know, you'd go, and I'd
be well-buggered, basically.

1376
01:45:44,062 --> 01:45:47,202
That really is a real
"no," isn't it?

1377
01:45:47,366 --> 01:45:50,779
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in Beverly Hills.

1378
01:45:51,903 --> 01:45:54,292
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

1379
01:45:54,327 --> 01:45:56,682
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1380
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,314
Fine.

1381
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,354
Fine. Good decision.

1382
01:46:04,683 --> 01:46:06,184
Good decision.

1383
01:46:09,554 --> 01:46:12,899
The fame thing isn't
really real, you know.

1384
01:46:16,895 --> 01:46:19,136
And don't forget,

1385
01:46:20,532 --> 01:46:25,879
I'm also just a girl
standing in front of a boy,

1386
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,551
asking him to love her.

1387
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,590
Bye.

1388
01:47:06,945 --> 01:47:09,414
So, what do you think?
Good move?

1389
01:47:09,449 --> 01:47:11,615
Yeah, good move.

1390
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:14,753
I mean, when all's said and
done, she's nothing special.

1391
01:47:14,788 --> 01:47:16,153
I saw her taking
her trousers down

1392
01:47:16,188 --> 01:47:19,533
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1393
01:47:20,292 --> 01:47:24,463
Good decision, yeah. All
actresses are as mad as snakes.

1394
01:47:24,498 --> 01:47:26,048
Tones, what do you reckon?

1395
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:27,599
Never met her, never want to.

1396
01:47:27,634 --> 01:47:29,366
Brilliant. Max?

1397
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:31,403
Absolutely.
Never trust a vegetarian.

1398
01:47:31,438 --> 01:47:34,008
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1399
01:47:36,942 --> 01:47:38,912
I was called and I came.
What's up?

1400
01:47:38,947 --> 01:47:40,883
William's just turned
down Anna Scott.

1401
01:47:42,114 --> 01:47:45,015
You daft prick.

1402
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:48,087
No, no. No, no,
it's actually quite sensible.

1403
01:47:51,623 --> 01:47:54,729
That painting
isn't the original, is it?

1404
01:47:56,661 --> 01:47:59,232
You know, I think it might be,
yeah.

1405
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:03,644
But she said she wanted
to go out with you?

1406
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:07,404
Yeah.

1407
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:09,077
Well, that's nice.

1408
01:48:10,642 --> 01:48:11,779
What?

1409
01:48:13,378 --> 01:48:15,612
Well, you know,

1410
01:48:15,647 --> 01:48:19,822
anyone saying they wanna go out
with you is pretty great, isn't it?

1411
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:30,366
It was sort of sweet,
actually.

1412
01:48:32,164 --> 01:48:36,902
I mean, I know she's an actress and
all that, so she can deliver a line,

1413
01:48:36,937 --> 01:48:42,374
but she said she might be
as famous as she can be

1414
01:48:42,409 --> 01:48:46,344
but also that
she was just a girl,

1415
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:51,260
standing in front of a boy,

1416
01:48:53,018 --> 01:48:55,555
asking him to love her.

1417
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:14,139
Oh, sod a dog. I've made the
wrong decision, haven't I?

1418
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,149
Max, how fast is your car?

1419
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:25,749
Good luck.

1420
01:49:25,784 --> 01:49:28,453
If anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

1421
01:49:28,488 --> 01:49:30,856
Where to? The Ritz. All
I can think is The Ritz.

1422
01:49:30,891 --> 01:49:33,091
Where's Bella?
She's not coming.

1423
01:49:33,126 --> 01:49:35,027
Oh, sod that.
What?

1424
01:49:35,062 --> 01:49:36,928
Bernie, sit in the back.

1425
01:49:38,463 --> 01:49:40,203
Max, I'm okay.

1426
01:49:43,001 --> 01:49:44,536
Come on, baby.

1427
01:49:47,172 --> 01:49:48,707
Mind your back.

1428
01:49:52,978 --> 01:49:54,644
Which way
are you going?

1429
01:49:54,679 --> 01:49:55,912
Down Kensington
Church Street,

1430
01:49:55,947 --> 01:49:57,082
then Knightsbridge,
then Hyde Park Corner.

1431
01:49:57,117 --> 01:49:58,181
No, no, crazy. Crazy.

1432
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:00,016
Go along Bayswater.
That's right. Then Park Lane.

1433
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:02,087
No. No. Straight down to the
Cromwell Road, then left.

1434
01:50:02,122 --> 01:50:03,531
No!

1435
01:50:05,457 --> 01:50:08,767
Stop right there! I will
decide the route. All right?

1436
01:50:09,294 --> 01:50:10,670
Sorry, Max.

1437
01:50:12,464 --> 01:50:14,699
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

1438
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:24,809
Turn right. Turn right!
I can't, it's one way.

1439
01:50:24,844 --> 01:50:26,013
Well, do a U-turn.

1440
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,182
Oh, sod it.

1441
01:50:27,312 --> 01:50:28,380
Hold on!

1442
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,928
Brilliant!

1443
01:50:44,329 --> 01:50:46,331
Bloody hell, this is fun.

1444
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:50,345
Hi. Is Miss Scott
staying here?

1445
01:50:50,468 --> 01:50:51,535
No, sir.

1446
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,413
How about Miss Flintstone?

1447
01:50:54,072 --> 01:50:55,323
No, sir.

1448
01:50:55,358 --> 01:50:56,667
Bambi?

1449
01:50:56,702 --> 01:50:57,941
No, sir.

1450
01:50:57,976 --> 01:51:03,721
Or, I don't know,
Beavis or Butt-head?

1451
01:51:04,249 --> 01:51:05,523
No, sir.

1452
01:51:06,985 --> 01:51:09,362
Thanks. Thanks.

1453
01:51:10,722 --> 01:51:15,102
There was a Miss Pocahontas, but
she checked out about an hour ago.

1454
01:51:15,226 --> 01:51:20,198
I believe she's holding a press conference
at the Savoy, before flying to America.

1455
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:27,542
We have lift off.

1456
01:51:36,381 --> 01:51:38,622
You have message for Takiama?

1457
01:51:39,451 --> 01:51:41,260
I'll just check, sir.

1458
01:52:03,742 --> 01:52:06,279
Bugger this for
a bunch of bananas.

1459
01:52:10,582 --> 01:52:13,451
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1460
01:52:13,486 --> 01:52:14,986
Go. Go.

1461
01:52:16,988 --> 01:52:22,563
Hang on. Come on. Wait there!
Come on, come on! Wait!

1462
01:52:24,095 --> 01:52:26,131
Go on, go, go, go!

1463
01:52:27,565 --> 01:52:29,100
You're my hero!

1464
01:52:31,636 --> 01:52:33,012
Down, boy.

1465
01:52:43,982 --> 01:52:44,983
Go!

1466
01:52:53,291 --> 01:52:54,924
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?

1467
01:52:54,959 --> 01:52:56,292
Where's the press conference,
please?

1468
01:52:56,327 --> 01:52:58,196
Are you an accredited
member of the press?

1469
01:52:58,231 --> 01:52:59,299
Yeah.

1470
01:53:01,466 --> 01:53:02,799
There you go.

1471
01:53:02,834 --> 01:53:05,954
Yes, that's a Blockbuster
Video membership card, sir.

1472
01:53:05,989 --> 01:53:09,074
That's right. I work for
their in-house magazine.

1473
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:10,575
Movies Are Our Business.

1474
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:11,860
I'm sorry, sir.

1475
01:53:11,895 --> 01:53:13,170
He's with me.

1476
01:53:13,205 --> 01:53:14,411
And you are?

1477
01:53:14,446 --> 01:53:18,621
Writing an article on how London
hotels treat people in wheelchairs.

1478
01:53:19,551 --> 01:53:20,750
Yes, of course, madam.

1479
01:53:20,785 --> 01:53:24,892
It's in the Lancaster Room, though
I'm afraid you're rather late.

1480
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:26,259
Run!

1481
01:53:42,307 --> 01:53:46,411
Does this mean that Miss Scott will
not be publicizing her next film?

1482
01:53:46,446 --> 01:53:48,411
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.

1483
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:51,549
She'll be abiding by all
her present commitments.

1484
01:53:51,584 --> 01:53:54,652
She just won't be making
any more for the next year.

1485
01:53:54,687 --> 01:53:56,927
When will the
film be released?

1486
01:53:57,055 --> 01:54:00,859
At the moment, the plan is to release
in America towards the end of the autumn,

1487
01:54:00,894 --> 01:54:04,602
and over here, around Christmas,
or early in the New Year.

1488
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:07,139
Right! Dominic.

1489
01:54:07,365 --> 01:54:10,502
Anna, how much longer are
you staying in the UK then?

1490
01:54:10,537 --> 01:54:12,235
No time at all.
I leave tonight.

1491
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:16,718
Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.

1492
01:54:17,375 --> 01:54:19,013
Yes, lady there.

1493
01:54:19,711 --> 01:54:23,815
Is your decision to take a year off
anything to do with the rumors about Jeff

1494
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:25,517
and his present leading lady?

1495
01:54:25,552 --> 01:54:27,050
Absolutely not.

1496
01:54:27,085 --> 01:54:28,785
Do you believe the rumors?

1497
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:32,055
Well, it's really
not my business anymore.

1498
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:37,938
Though, I will say, from my experience,
rumors about Jeff do tend to be true.

1499
01:54:40,498 --> 01:54:41,631
Yeah.

1500
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,803
The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs

1501
01:54:44,838 --> 01:54:48,375
taken of you with
a young English guy.

1502
01:54:49,073 --> 01:54:51,280
So, what happened there?

1503
01:54:51,643 --> 01:54:54,919
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, I think.

1504
01:54:56,714 --> 01:55:00,992
Right. Yes, gentleman
in the pink shirt.

1505
01:55:06,524 --> 01:55:07,593
Yes.

1506
01:55:08,993 --> 01:55:13,900
Miss Scott, are there any
circumstances in which

1507
01:55:13,935 --> 01:55:18,807
the two of you might be
more than just good friends?

1508
01:55:21,506 --> 01:55:26,512
I hoped there would be, but
no, I'm assured there aren't.

1509
01:55:26,644 --> 01:55:27,844
But what would you say if...

1510
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,714
I'm sorry,
just the one question, please.

1511
01:55:29,749 --> 01:55:32,251
No, it's all right.
You were saying?

1512
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:40,030
I was just wondering if it
turned out that this person...

1513
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:43,595
Thacker. His name's Thacker.

1514
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:45,165
Thanks. Thanks.

1515
01:55:45,496 --> 01:55:49,667
I just wondered whether
if Mr. Thacker realized

1516
01:55:49,702 --> 01:55:52,170
he'd been a daft prick

1517
01:55:54,372 --> 01:55:58,276
And got down on his knees
and begged you to reconsider,

1518
01:55:58,311 --> 01:56:03,350
whether you would,
in fact, then reconsider?

1519
01:56:13,591 --> 01:56:15,502
Yes, I believe I would.

1520
01:56:18,830 --> 01:56:20,707
That's very good news.

1521
01:56:23,635 --> 01:56:27,472
The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.

1522
01:56:33,811 --> 01:56:37,515
Right, Dominic, if you'd like
to ask your question again?

1523
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:38,516
Yeah.

1524
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:42,522
Anna, how long are you intending
to stay here in Britain?

1525
01:56:50,295 --> 01:56:51,796
Indefinitely.

1526
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,706
What happened?

1527
01:57:17,741 --> 01:57:19,193
It was good.

1528
01:57:40,745 --> 01:57:42,781
Are you gonna get married?
