1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,439
<i>Happy Easter</i>

3
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,701
- <i>Happy Easter</i>
- <i>Happy Easter</i>

4
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,512
<i>Happy Easter</i>

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,307
- <i>Happy Easter</i>
- <i>Happy Easter</i>

6
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:45,011
<i>Me, oh, my, there's a lot to buy</i>
<i>There is shopping I must do</i>

7
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,956
<i>Happy Easter to you</i>

8
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:56,998
<i>Here's a hat that you must take home</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

9
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,964
<i>Happy Easter</i>

10
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:03,094
<i>Here's a lid for milady's dome</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

11
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,002
<i>Happy Easter</i>

12
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:11,011
<i>This was made for the hat parade</i>
<i>On the well-known avenue</i>

13
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,741
<i>This one's nice</i>
<i>And it's worth the price</i>

14
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,545
<i>Happy Easter to you</i>

15
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:21,312
<i>Here's a hat for a pretty face</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

16
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,288
<i>Happy Easter</i>

17
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,361
<i>Here is one that is trimmed with lace</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

18
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,963
<i>Happy Easter</i>

19
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:35,167
<i>Here's a touch of the quaint old Dutch</i>
<i>It's an old that's always new</i>

20
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:40,469
<i>This in white is exactly right</i>
<i>Happy Easter to you</i>

21
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:46,075
<i>I think that is a lovely hat</i>
<i>Maybe you think so too?</i>

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,238
I do.

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,912
<i>Wrap it up for the chap</i>
<i>With a very happy Easter to you</i>

24
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:02,654
<i>Never saw such a lovely day</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

25
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:08,967
<i>Everything seems to come your way</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

26
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:16,209
<i>My, oh, me, what a kick to be</i>
<i>On the well-known avenue</i>

27
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,976
<i>Me, oh, my, you're a lucky guy</i>
<i>Happy Easter to you</i>

28
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,120
<i>Happy Easter</i>
<i>Happy Easter</i>

29
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:30,351
<i>Happy Easter to you</i>

30
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,179
<i>A bunny for my honey</i>

31
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,609
<i>A dolly with a curl</i>

32
00:03:57,086 --> 00:04:01,489
<i>An aeroplane, an electric train</i>
<i>And a teddy bear for my girl</i>

33
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,249
<i>A kitty for my pretty</i>

34
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,686
<i>A castle for my love</i>

35
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,929
<i>Gee!</i>
<i>What do I see?</i>

36
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,558
<i>Brother, if that's a drum</i>

37
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,494
<i>That's for me</i>

38
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,331
<i>I'm drum crazy</i>

39
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,807
<i>Yes, I'm drum crazy</i>

40
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,505
<i>Yes, I'm plum crazy for drums</i>

41
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:31,019
<i>I've got drumsticks full of hot licks</i>
<i>And a roll</i>

42
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,717
<i>Loaded with soul</i>

43
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,652
<i>Under control</i>

44
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:39,584
<i>First, soft violins</i>

45
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,560
<i>Then sweet saxophones</i>

46
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,825
<i>Then blue clarinets croon</i>

47
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:50,873
<i>When it's my turn</i>
<i>I turn into a loon</i>

48
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:56,244
<i>When the drum takes the melody</i>
<i>When the drum carries a tune</i>

49
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,874
Come on. Alley-oop. Now we go.

50
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,356
- Happy Easter, Essie.
- Oh, Mr. Hewes.

51
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:56,753
Darling, where are you?

52
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:01,124
- Don, I've been trying to call you.
- Essie, will you help me, please?

53
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,993
Thank you. Well, I got all tied up
with an Easter rabbit.

54
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,931
Hello, sweetheart.

55
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,065
Here.

56
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,138
Oh, I wish you hadn't.

57
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:15,634
Haven't they come for your trunks?
I told them to pick them up this morning.

58
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:18,507
- They weren't ready.
- We'll send them by pigeon.

59
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:19,841
Here, try on your hat.

60
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:23,076
We have time to walk in the parade
before our train leaves.

61
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,049
I don't wanna take that train.

62
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,816
It's the last one that'll get us
to Chicago in time for our opening.

63
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,558
Look at that.

64
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,094
This hat will wear
the prettiest girl there.

65
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,062
Don, I have to talk to you.

66
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,599
Essie!

67
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,962
- Take Michelle.
- Come on, short hemline.

68
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,471
I've had an offer for a show.

69
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,166
Well, sure you have. I've had some myself.

70
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,244
Yes, I know.

71
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,048
Listen, baby, we're a team.

72
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,184
We're playing the big time.
See that?

73
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,081
Nadine & Hewes?
That's written in stardust.

74
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,313
They've offered me
a wonderful contract.

75
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,286
They say they'll star me.

76
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,824
And you can dance with anyone.

77
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,095
Well, wait a minute.

78
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:09,825
I suppose I could.

79
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,830
I've danced with lots of girls.

80
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,765
It's always been just a business.

81
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,335
That was before I met you.

82
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,141
This isn't just dancing. It's...

83
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,641
It's different.

84
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,579
This is...

85
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,410
...us.

86
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:36,692
<i>It only happens</i>
<i>When I dance with you</i>

87
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:44,598
<i>That trip to heaven</i>
<i>Till the dance is through</i>

88
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:51,601
<i>With no one else do the heavens</i>
<i>Seem quite so near</i>

89
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,341
<i>Why does it happen, dear</i>

90
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,544
<i>Only with you?</i>

91
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,749
<i>Two cheeks together</i>
<i>Can be so divine</i>

92
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:15,660
<i>But only when those cheeks</i>
<i>Are yours and mine</i>

93
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:23,462
<i>I've danced with dozens of others</i>
<i>The whole night through</i>

94
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:27,237
<i>But the thrill that comes with spring</i>

95
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,176
<i>When anything could happen</i>

96
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:36,951
<i>That only happens with you</i>

97
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,437
<i>But the thrill that comes with spring</i>

98
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,070
<i>When anything could happen</i>

99
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:51,816
<i>It only happens</i>

100
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:02,830
I hope I'm intruding.

101
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,502
Why, Professor, when did you get in?

102
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,642
Just now. I had to make up an exam.

103
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,710
- I've got the whole holiday before me.
- Good.

104
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,904
- Need any help celebrating?
- Nadine.

105
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:14,413
- Johnny.
- I brought you something.

106
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,781
Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny, what a darling.

107
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,945
I know just the dress
to wear him with.

108
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,988
Essie. Essie!

109
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,458
- Take your coat off.
- Look what Mr. Harrow brought us.

110
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,756
- Another one?
- For my new beige suit.

111
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,626
Who pushed you in the face?

112
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,428
I want to give you a farewell tonight.
Where will it be? Delmonico's?

113
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,035
- Please sit down.
- Sherry's?

114
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:36,933
You decide, you're the party boy.

115
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,097
Gosh, I wish you two weren't leaving.

116
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,104
I'm not leaving.

117
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,037
Oh, but, darling.

118
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,770
I signed that contract, Don.

119
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,312
- You what?
- I signed it this afternoon.

120
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,610
I'm going into a show, Johnny.

121
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:52,547
Why, you're kidding.

122
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,212
We've signed contracts
for the next six months.

123
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,518
You did. I didn't.

124
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,820
There's no way they can hold me.

125
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,024
I know it must sound
terribly selfish of me, Don...

126
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,168
...but I've got to think of myself.

127
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,930
After all, there's no future in my just being
a ballroom dancer.

128
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,640
You do understand, don't you?

129
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,339
No. I'm sorry.

130
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,240
I don't understand.

131
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,618
- Don...
- Johnny, you understand.

132
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,014
Frankly, no.

133
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,678
You can't be serious.
It doesn't make sense.

134
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:31,452
- I always thought you and Don were...
- Did you?

135
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,720
He's done everything in the world for you.
Why walk out on him now?

136
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,126
Johnny...

137
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,494
...don't you know?

138
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,397
I think I'd better go and look for Don.

139
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,632
We have a dinner date.

140
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,878
- We'll be back.
- But...

141
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,713
- Can you drown a brunette in this?
- How tall is she?

142
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,718
Five-foot-six.

143
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,458
- Try that.
- Two bourbons, Mike.

144
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
She's not going to Chicago.

145
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,502
He travels fastest who travels alone,
I always say.

146
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,936
Right. I bet you know
a lot about women.

147
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,167
I should. I've been single all my life.

148
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,470
- You're a smart fella...
- Mike.

149
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,706
Work behind a bar,
you get to know what makes people tick.

150
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:30,340
This place is like a clinic.
People come in with their troubles.

151
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,214
Well, if you listen, you learn.

152
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:36,222
Been here 15 years, and I can boil down
trouble into two classifications.

153
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:39,520
- Yeah? What are they?
- Women and their mothers.

154
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,193
- Hello, Don.
- Hi.

155
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,626
Oh, hello, Professor.

156
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,393
- What'll it be? Blond or brunette?
- The same.

157
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,935
Brunettes. They're the ones
you got to watch.

158
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,571
How did you find me?

159
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:54,197
I didn't have my crystal ball,
so I just followed you here.

160
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,608
Meet my friend Mike.
He's a disciple of Aristophanes.

161
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,907
- How do you do?
- Pleased to know you.

162
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,982
Don, I'm taking you back to Nadine.

163
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,485
Did she send you for me?

164
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,053
- No, but...
- That's the trouble with college.

165
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:10,749
You've been reading.
There's more sense in this than in a library.

166
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:13,622
- Right, Mike?
- Education's all right.

167
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,388
It's the people who spoil it.

168
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,429
Nadine didn't mean what she said.

169
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,862
You two belong together.

170
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:23,027
If she'd just fallen in love with some guy,
I could do something about it.

171
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:27,141
You know she can't get along without you,
or you without her.

172
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,641
Who says I can't get along without her?

173
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:33,077
See those girls. Any one of them
has as much talent as she.

174
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,546
You're crazy. There's no one like Nadine.

175
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:39,017
- Dances like an angel, knows how to dress...
- I taught her.

176
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,622
- I could take any of those girls...
- Show's on.

177
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,156
I could take any one of them
and do the same.

178
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,351
She still wouldn't be like Nadine.

179
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,792
I promised I'd get right back. You coming?

180
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,192
She knows where I am.

181
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,130
She'll come around when contracts
are out of season.

182
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,563
You sure?

183
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,364
No, thanks. You run along.

184
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,865
All right. Take care of him, Mike.

185
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,872
Okay.

186
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,437
Any one of them.

187
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,171
Do I need her?

188
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,977
Well, no man is an island.

189
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,246
- Thanks, Mike.
- Every man is a piece of the continent...

190
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,047
...a part of the main.

191
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,163
Sorry.

192
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,232
Yeah, I think you'll do.

193
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:37,276
- I'll do what?
- I'm looking for someone to dance with.

194
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,676
- Wrong number.
- I need a new dancing partner.

195
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,315
I'll give you $ 100 a week.

196
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,713
A hundred doll... That would never do.

197
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,911
- All right, $ 150.
- A hundred and fifty.

198
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,453
Thank you. Now may I go?

199
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,648
Sure. Just a minute. Here's my card.

200
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,090
I'll get a rehearsal hall at Michael's.
Know where it is?

201
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,490
Yeah.

202
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:57,962
All right, tomorrow morning, 10:00.

203
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,097
You'll wait for me.

204
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,504
- Hi, Hannah.
- Hi. Will you help me into this?

205
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,903
- Sure.
- Thank you.

206
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,380
There's a nice guy.
He's unhappy and a little lonely...

207
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,016
I'll bet he's lonely.
Got away from his keeper.

208
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:19,951
You know what he wanted me to do?
Give up a good, steady, $ 15-a-week job.

209
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,056
- Thanks.
- I didn't catch his name.

210
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,220
Don Hewes.

211
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,189
Don Hewes?!

212
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,500
<i>I was born in Michigan</i>

213
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,439
<i>And I wish and wish again</i>

214
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,477
<i>That I was back</i>

215
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:51,847
<i>In the town where I was born</i>

216
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,586
<i>There's a farm in Michigan</i>

217
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,725
<i>And I'd like to fish again</i>

218
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,761
<i>In the river that flows</i>

219
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,230
<i>Beside the field of waving corn</i>

220
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:11,269
<i>A lonesome soul am I</i>

221
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:15,703
<i>Here's the reason why</i>

222
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:19,541
<i>I want to go back</i>
<i>I want to go back</i>

223
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,947
<i>I want to go back to the farm</i>

224
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,746
<i>Far away from harm</i>

225
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:30,323
<i>With a milk pail on my arm</i>

226
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:34,053
<i>I miss the rooster</i>
<i>The one that used to</i>

227
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:38,461
<i>Wake me up at 4 a.m.</i>

228
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:43,832
<i>I think your great big city's</i>
<i>Very pretty</i>

229
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,303
<i>Nevertheless, I want to be there</i>
<i>I want to see there</i>

230
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:52,436
<i>A certain someone full of charm</i>

231
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,514
<i>That's why I wish again</i>
<i>That I was in Michigan</i>

232
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:00,051
<i>Down on the farm</i>

233
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,224
<i>I wanna go back</i>
<i>I wanna go back</i>

234
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,230
<i>I wanna go back</i>
<i>To that old farm</i>

235
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,627
<i>Far away from harm</i>

236
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:19,137
<i>With a milk pail on my arm</i>

237
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,671
<i>I miss the rooster</i>

238
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:27,646
<i>The rooster that used to</i>
<i>Wake me up at 4 a.m.</i>

239
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:33,784
<i>I think your great big city's</i>
<i>Very pretty</i>

240
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:38,891
<i>Nevertheless, I want to be there</i>
<i>I want to see there</i>

241
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:43,395
<i>A certain someone full of charm</i>

242
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:47,100
<i>That's why I wish again</i>

243
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:52,735
<i>That I was in Michigan</i>

244
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,609
<i>Down on</i>

245
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,236
<i>The farm</i>

246
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,455
She's not coming.
Come on, let's go.

247
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,115
You said 10:00.
She's only a minute late.

248
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,853
She won't be here.
At least I hope she won't.

249
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,159
To tell the truth,
I got emotional last night.

250
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:21,860
I can't remember what happened,
but I seem to have been carried away.

251
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:24,232
Well, there goes five bucks.

252
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,638
Here. It's worth ten to get out of it
this easily. I'll see you later.

253
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,301
Am I late? I'm sorry, Mr. Hewes.

254
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,814
I couldn't catch a bus.
It is Easter Sunday, you know.

255
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,578
I walked.

256
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:42,713
You should have seen Mr. Pastini's face
when I quit my job last night.

257
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,984
He was furious.

258
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,453
Good morning.

259
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,461
Say that again.

260
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,766
- Good morning.
- I mean about quitting your job.

261
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,035
You... You told me to quit my job.
You said...

262
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,640
I know what I said. This is Marty.

263
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,836
- How do you...?
- Your name is?

264
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,036
Hannah Brown.

265
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,204
Oh, we can fix that. Sure, we can.

266
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,111
Now, there's nothing to this.

267
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,775
I lead for four counts,
starting with your left.

268
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:14,787
Half-turn to the right,
drop to a curtsy as I bow.

269
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:18,484
On five, rise slowly. Twist to the right,
then to the left.

270
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,096
Right arm fully extended
in preparation for the first lift.

271
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,263
I beg your pardon?

272
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:28,068
You understand, don't you?

273
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,634
No.

274
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:35,269
Miss Brown, what idiot ever
told you you were a dancer?

275
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,406
You did.

276
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,672
If I did, you're a dancer.

277
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,715
Now, let's start this thing
right from the beginning.

278
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,848
Now, left foot forward, please.

279
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:49,447
Left foot forward.

280
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,557
You're gonna hate me.

281
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,956
- I am?
- Yes.

282
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,927
You know your left foot
from your right, don't you?

283
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,964
- I'm never sure.
- Oh, no.

284
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:02,194
This isn't my fault.
When I was little, I was left-handed.

285
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:06,330
But the doctor told my mother
I might grow up to be a dangerous criminal.

286
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:11,275
So they made me do things with my
right hand, and now I'm not sure anymore.

287
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:14,940
How did you dance in the show?

288
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:18,314
When I danced in the show,
I had a garter on my left leg...

289
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,888
...but I haven't got a garter today.

290
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:32,132
That is your left leg.

291
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,427
That is your right leg. See?

292
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,127
Yes.

293
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,828
Here.

294
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,531
- Here's a rubber band. Put that on.
- Thank you.

295
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,544
Did I say I got carried away?

296
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,115
- Ready.
- All right. Over here.

297
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:58,758
Let's have some music.

298
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:01,589
This is what you do. And...

299
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:06,097
...left, right, left, right.

300
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:12,696
Turn right. Curtsy.
And twist right.

301
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:16,571
Twist left. Arm out.

302
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:20,875
Lift, two, three, four.

303
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,679
One, two, right, left, right.

304
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:30,518
Good. One, two, three, four.

305
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,856
Turn, two, three, four.

306
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,966
Turn, two, three. Change.

307
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,932
That's it. Now softer.

308
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:43,537
Very quiet.

309
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:46,105
Don't take your eyes from mine.

310
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,736
You just look as if you're in pain.

311
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,878
I am. The rubber band's too tight.

312
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,981
- Well, then take it off.
- It won't take me a minute.

313
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:58,950
- I didn't know. It stopped the circulation.
- Pick it up about here. Right there.

314
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:05,750
- I know it's gonna be better now.
- And, one, two, three, four.

315
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,919
Now, look at me intimately, caressingly.

316
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:13,431
Make every man in the audience
wish that he were in my shoes.

317
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:15,593
That's the idea.

318
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,170
Closer. Closer.

319
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,173
More. More.

320
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:26,906
Lunch. Marty, about an hour
I think will do, don't you?

321
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,778
- Leave the music?
- I've got the place all afternoon.

322
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,852
- It won't make any difference.
- Okay.

323
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,120
Was I too terrible?

324
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,160
No, no.

325
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,227
You know, I've never really danced before.

326
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,766
You're going to be fine.

327
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:51,631
Mr. Hewes, you know,
you don't have to go on with this.

328
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,034
- Now, look...
- I mean it.

329
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,336
You're a wonderful dancer.
You could get anybody to dance.

330
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,876
You could get the best.

331
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,843
I don't want the best. I want you.

332
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:04,042
I mean, look. You didn't ask me for the job.
I picked you.

333
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:07,416
You're gonna make good.
Not just for your sake, but for mine.

334
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,580
It means a great deal to me.

335
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:14,389
- It does?
- Come on.

336
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:26,636
Oh, look. The Easter Parade.
Isn't it beautiful?

337
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,572
It's all right, if you like Easter Parades.

338
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,449
I can't believe I'm really here.

339
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,644
I used to read about the Easter Parade
in New York...

340
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:41,755
- Excuse me.
- In New York.

341
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:46,326
And then I'd look at the pictures
of the women in their lovely clothes...

342
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:50,726
...dream that maybe someday l...
Here I am.

343
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:52,491
Oh, look.

344
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,369
May I take your picture, Miss Hale?

345
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,306
Hold it, Miss Hale.

346
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,206
Just one more, Miss Hale.

347
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,779
- Good. Thank you.
- Miss Hale.

348
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,442
Thank you.

349
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,893
Isn't she wonderful-looking!

350
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:24,725
Even with that silly hat.

351
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,834
- What's the matter with it?
- She must be very important.

352
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,062
Look at her clothes, the way she walks.

353
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:31,762
See her nose?

354
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,374
One year from now,
you're gonna put it out of joint.

355
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,942
- I am?
- Next Easter, when we walk down here...

356
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,047
...you'll cause more excitement
than an earthquake.

357
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:43,810
Every photographer will break his neck
to take your picture.

358
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:47,648
One year from today, no one
is gonna notice her when they look at you.

359
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:55,954
- This is lovely.
- That one.

360
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,065
Yes, Mr. Hewes.

361
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:05,504
May I see that, please?

362
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:10,208
- Isn't this beautiful?
- Wrap this up. Just send all the things.

363
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,437
Yes, Mr. Hewes.

364
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,344
- You ready?
- Yes, Mr. Hewes.

365
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,026
Mr. Hewes, I...

366
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:29,356
These dresses are beautiful, but...

367
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:33,865
- But what?
- Do they look like me, like Hannah Brown?

368
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:37,971
There is no more Hannah Brown.
From now on, you're Juanita.

369
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,034
If you wanted a Juanita,
why did you pick me?

370
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,973
Now, don't get mad. This is business.

371
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,806
A girl dancer has to be exotic.

372
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,470
She has to be...

373
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,014
...a peach.

374
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,280
I suppose I'm a lemon.

375
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:52,818
No. Here's what I mean.

376
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,718
Now, when you walk down the street alone
do men try to catch your eye?

377
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,323
Of course they do.

378
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:01,257
Do they turn around and look at you?

379
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,460
L... I don't know.

380
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:06,793
I never turn around to look at them.

381
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:10,165
Here, give me those.
You go ahead. I wanna try something.

382
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,102
Just walk on ahead. I wanna see.

383
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,925
Right! You've got it.

384
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,900
Thank you.

385
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,390
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.

386
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,165
Left.

387
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:32,045
- I'm afraid...
- Don't worry.

388
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,408
- It was just the first performance.
- I was so nervous.

389
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,415
One thing you mustn't do:
Get a stranglehold on me.

390
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,143
It pulls me off balance.

391
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,379
- I know.
- Relax, you'll be all right.

392
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,787
I hope so. Did you send these?

393
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,950
- Yes.
- They're very beautiful.

394
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,325
- You go change, we'll have dinner.
- May I bring my roses?

395
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:52,022
Sure.

396
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,931
- Keep sending flowers. It's good business.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,731
How did the act go, Mr. Hewes?

398
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,498
One bow.

399
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,733
Too bad.

400
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,073
Eddie. Eddie.

401
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:07,976
Eddie, get down there. Sit. Sit.

402
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:11,243
All right, everybody sit down. Sit down.

403
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,853
Tomorrow we'd better get some dogs
in the act.

404
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,621
- Here's the young lady.
- Nadine.

405
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:24,558
Darling, I was so excited
when I got your message.

406
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:27,496
- When did you get in town?
- I got in this morning.

407
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,435
I can recommend fillet of sole meuniere.

408
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,370
- Monsieur had that last night.
- Last night?

409
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,102
- We'll order later.
- Very well. I'll remove this.

410
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:38,939
We're expecting someone else.

411
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,741
- Luncheon for three?
- Who's joining us?

412
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,407
Someone who's very important
to both of us.

413
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:48,113
Johnny, I'm going to meet your father.

414
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:52,055
Look, Nadine, our future is so far away.

415
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,319
I have years of school ahead of me...

416
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,191
I thought you were almost finished
with law school.

417
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:02,735
I am, I am. But I've decided
to become a doctor.

418
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:04,829
I'll wait.

419
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:12,769
Well, it's liable to be a tough struggle.

420
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:16,212
I won't inherit any of my father's money
until I'm at least...

421
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,548
...fifty-five.
- Fifty-five? That's an odd arrangement.

422
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:26,517
Well, Father was very eccentric.
He hated children.

423
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,821
Oh, I love children.

424
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,327
Maybe you could adopt one.

425
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,023
- There he is.
- Hello, Johnny.

426
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,534
Donald. If you'll forgive me,
I have an oral psychology exam.

427
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,504
You what? You'll flunk it.

428
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,671
Hello, Nadine.

429
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,712
I'm glad you're here, Don.
Sit down, won't you?

430
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,509
- Thanks.
- I've been wanting to talk to you.

431
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,049
You have?

432
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,278
You look tired.

433
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:56,582
Breaking in new routines.
You remember it.

434
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:58,248
It seems years ago.

435
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:01,054
I can tell you how many minutes it's been.

436
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,555
Is the gentleman coming back?

437
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,222
Yes, but not for lunch.

438
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,767
Luncheon for two?

439
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:12,167
We have some very fine
broiled lamb chops today.

440
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,205
We'll order later. Thank you.

441
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,603
Very good, monsieur.

442
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,873
It's...

443
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,572
...very nice to see you.

444
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,808
I've been hearing about your new act.

445
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,078
It's not really broken in yet.

446
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,746
It seems so strange dancing
with somebody else.

447
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,860
Remember our opening night in Boston?
Three encores, eight bows.

448
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,689
We stopped the show cold.

449
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,626
I still have those reviews.

450
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,667
- Listen, baby, I was thinking...
- I start rehearsal soon for my new show.

451
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,066
Are you going through
with that crazy idea?

452
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:48,265
Crazy? Because I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life being a common hoofer?

453
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,537
It was good enough
when I took you out of that chorus.

454
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:55,007
You think if it hadn't been
for you, I'd still be there?

455
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,952
That's possible. The fellow who ran
that place wasn't Ziegfeld.

456
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,919
Let me tell you something.
If you can get along without me...

457
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:06,527
...tell that seamstress dancing with you
to stop imitating me.

458
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,924
Imitating you? She's never even seen you.

459
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,655
No, but you have.

460
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:13,323
All my friends are laughing.

461
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,564
- That's it.
- You bet that's it.

462
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:22,767
- And you tell that Miss...
- Brown. Hannah Brown.

463
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,913
- I have something to do.
- Don't you dare leave me alone.

464
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,548
You forget, honey.
You're on your own now.

465
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:34,078
The gentleman is coming back?

466
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,280
You're wrong twice.

467
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,290
Luncheon for one?

468
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:43,158
May I suggest the sirloin tips
to mademoiselle?

469
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,561
Thank you. I'm not hungry.

470
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,166
Certainly, mademoiselle.

471
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,565
Come in again soon.

472
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,363
Bring your friends.

473
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,904
How much is that, please?

474
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:58,978
Let's see. Roast beef, pie, milk.

475
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,342
That'll be 15 cents.

476
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:05,885
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

477
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:07,645
Goodbye.

478
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,071
You can't trust those weathermen.
They said rain today.

479
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,368
If they'd said sunshine,
I would've worn my raincoat.

480
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,847
Oh, I'm terribly...

481
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:35,243
...sorry.

482
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:38,280
That's all right. I think we can
straighten up now.

483
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:42,145
Raining, huh?

484
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,052
Yes.

485
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,124
I wish it'd stop. I've got an appointment.

486
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:52,095
Nobody would expect you
to be on time in this weather.

487
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:53,597
He will.

488
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,601
- Lf I were you, I'd divorce him.
- He's not my husband.

489
00:35:56,771 --> 00:36:00,002
- Oh, then I wouldn't marry him.
- No, no, this is business.

490
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:05,105
- Well, I think it's letting up...
- Oh, no, no. It's still raining very hard.

491
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:08,407
You know, I bet you like to walk
in the rain.

492
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,913
- Yes, I do, but...
- But home, in the country.

493
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,021
- Yes.
- In the woods, in the spring?

494
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,818
- But you wouldn't be wearing that hat.
- I really must go.

495
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,985
Oh, no, no. You can't go out in that.

496
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,425
- It's an epidemic.
- What?

497
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,724
- Pneumonia.
- What?

498
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,992
- I'll get you a cab.
- Don't get me one.

499
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:30,501
- I've only got two blocks to go. You can't...
- No.

500
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,434
Don't move.

501
00:36:57,164 --> 00:37:01,191
In two minutes, you've managed to find out
that I'm not married or engaged.

502
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,338
That I'm from the country,
and meeting a man on business.

503
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:06,063
It wasn't bad, was it?

504
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,073
Yeah, but you haven't told me
a thing about yourself.

505
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:15,077
<i>I'm just a fella</i>
<i>A fella with an umbrella</i>

506
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:21,755
<i>Looking for a girl</i>
<i>Who saved her love for a rainy day</i>

507
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:27,525
<i>I'm just a fella</i>
<i>A fella with an umbrella</i>

508
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:34,390
<i>Glad to see the skies of blue</i>
<i>Have turned into skies of gray</i>

509
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:40,431
<i>Raindrops have brought us together</i>
<i>And that's what I long to see</i>

510
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:46,603
<i>Maybe the break in the weather</i>
<i>Will prove to be</i>

511
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:49,875
<i>A break for me</i>

512
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:56,718
<i>So I'll be the fella</i>
<i>The fella with an umbrella</i>

513
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:01,517
<i>If you'll be the girl</i>
<i>Who saved her love</i>

514
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,258
<i>For a rainy day</i>

515
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:17,235
<i>For every fella</i>
<i>Each fella with an umbrella</i>

516
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:23,574
<i>There's a girl</i>
<i>A girl who saved her love for a rainy day</i>

517
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:29,790
<i>For every fella</i>
<i>Each fella with an umbrella</i>

518
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:36,052
<i>There's a time when skies of blue</i>
<i>Must turn into skies of gray</i>

519
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:42,335
<i>Raindrops have brought us together</i>
<i>That's what they were meant to do</i>

520
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:48,298
<i>Maybe the break in the weather</i>
<i>Will turn into</i>

521
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:51,775
<i>A break for you</i>

522
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:57,551
<i>And I'll help the fella</i>

523
00:38:57,952 --> 00:39:01,979
<i>The fella with an umbrella</i>

524
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:07,521
<i>Help him find the girl</i>
<i>Who saved her love</i>

525
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:12,961
<i>For a rainy day</i>

526
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,138
One of the first rules of
this business is to be punctual.

527
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:30,215
- You're a half-hour late.
- I'm sorry.

528
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,976
- All right.
- I got caught in the...

529
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,347
I said, all right.

530
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,981
I have something important to talk about.
I found out what's wrong with our act.

531
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,387
- You did?
- Yes.

532
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,551
You've been trying
to be somebody else.

533
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,328
I've been trying to what?

534
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,194
- Look at you.
- What's the matter?

535
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:49,097
- That dress.
- I've tried to explain...

536
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,862
- That hat.
- I knew I wouldn't look good.

537
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:54,269
- The way you move in the numbers.
- You told me to move like that.

538
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,376
All right. I've changed my mind.

539
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:59,604
- From now on, you're gonna be yourself.
- I am?

540
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,272
You'll start from the beginning.
There'll be no more fancy dresses.

541
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,214
There is no more Juanita.

542
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:08,947
From now on, you're just plain
Hannah Brown.

543
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,514
Whatever you say.

544
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:14,058
- Do you know this song?
- Yes.

545
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:17,026
- I'd like to hear you sing it, please.
- All right.

546
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,668
Get over there where
I can see you, please.

547
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:27,464
<i>I love the piano</i>
<i>I love the piano</i>

548
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,576
<i>I love to hear somebody play</i>

549
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:33,679
<i>Upon a piano</i>
<i>A grand piano</i>

550
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:37,544
<i>It simply carries me away</i>

551
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,881
<i>I know a fine way</i>

552
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:44,115
<i>To treat a Steinway</i>

553
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:49,820
<i>I love to run my fingers o'er the keys</i>
<i>The ivories</i>

554
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:52,932
<i>And with the pedal</i>
<i>I love to meddle</i>

555
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,160
<i>When Paderewski comes this way</i>

556
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:59,397
<i>I'm so delighted</i>
<i>If I'm invited</i>

557
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,508
<i>To hear the longhaired genius play</i>

558
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,770
<i>So you can keep your fiddle</i>
<i>And your bow</i>

559
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:09,109
<i>Give me a P-l-A-N-O</i>
<i>Oh, oh!</i>

560
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:12,309
<i>I love to stop right</i>
<i>Beside an upright</i>

561
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,215
<i>Or a high-toned baby grand</i>

562
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,719
Oh, that's wonderful!

563
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,222
- Is it?
- Wonderful. Great.

564
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,327
- Do you know this?
- Yes, I know it.

565
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,486
Good girl!

566
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,255
Cross.

567
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:28,059
That's fine.

568
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,703
Now around.

569
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,165
Oh, yes!

570
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,302
<i>I love to stop right</i>
<i>Beside an upright</i>

571
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:12,309
<i>Or a high-toned baby grand</i>

572
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:24,180
<i>All night long he calls her</i>
<i>"snookey ookums"</i>

573
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:26,223
<i>Snookey ookums</i>

574
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:32,964
<i>All they do is talk like babies</i>

575
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,927
<i>She's his "jelly-elly roll"</i>

576
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,334
<i>He's her "sugey-ugar bowl"</i>

577
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,541
<i>Here's the way they bill and coo</i>

578
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:47,737
<i>"Poogywoo," poogywoo</i>
<i>Poogywoo</i>

579
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:53,479
<i>All night long he calls her</i>
<i>"snookey ookums"</i>

580
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,417
<i>Snookey ookums</i>

581
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:59,150
<i>All night long the neighbors shout</i>

582
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,056
<i>"Cut it out," "Cut it out"</i>
<i>"Cut it out!"</i>

583
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,761
<i>They cry, "For goodness sake</i>

584
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,335
<i>Don't keep us all awake</i>

585
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:13,403
<i>With your snookey-ookey-ookey</i>

586
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,469
<i>Baby talk"</i>

587
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,979
<i>Fiddle up, fiddle up</i>
<i>On your violin</i>

588
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:26,346
<i>Lay right on it</i>
<i>Rest your chin upon it</i>

589
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,123
<i>Doggone, you better begin</i>
<i>And play an overture upon your violin</i>

590
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,522
<i>Hurry up, hurry up</i>
<i>With your violin</i>

591
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,924
<i>Make it sooner</i>
<i>Don't you stop to tune her</i>

592
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,132
<i>Fid, fid, fid, fiddle the middle</i>
<i>Of your ragtime violin</i>

593
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:18,037
<i>When the midnight choo-choo</i>
<i>Leaves for Alabam'</i>

594
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:19,229
<i>Alabam', Alabam'</i>

595
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,738
- <i>I'll be right there</i>
- <i>Where'll you be?</i>

596
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,139
- <i>I've got my fare</i>
- <i>Show it to me</i>

597
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:27,439
<i>When I see that rusty-haired</i>
<i>Conductor man</i>

598
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:28,808
<i>What'll you do?</i>

599
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:31,815
<i>I'll grab him by the collar</i>
<i>And I'll holler</i>

600
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:33,316
<i>"Alabam'! Alabam'!"</i>

601
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,014
<i>That's where you stop your train</i>
<i>That brings me back again</i>

602
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:40,455
<i>Down home where I'll remain</i>

603
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:43,755
<i>Where my honey lamb</i>
<i>Am</i>

604
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:48,129
<i>I will be right there with bells</i>
<i>When that old conductor yells</i>

605
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:54,332
<i>"All aboard, all aboard</i>
<i>All aboard for Alabam'!"</i>

606
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:39,980
<i>I will be right there with bells</i>
<i>When that old conductor yells</i>

607
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,054
<i>"All aboard</i>

608
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,852
<i>All aboard</i>

609
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:51,792
<i>All aboard for Alabam'!"</i>

610
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,498
Stop it! Stop it!

611
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,904
They'll be asking Mr. Ziegfeld
for more money. Good news, Don.

612
00:46:03,076 --> 00:46:05,806
He liked the act and he wants
to see you right away.

613
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:08,277
- Thanks, Al.
- That was charming.

614
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:14,083
Don, isn't that the girl we saw
in the Easter Parade?

615
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:16,654
You know, the one with that hat?

616
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:20,521
- There's no need to introduce you two.
- Hello, Don.

617
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,254
- Hello, Nadine.
- How nice to have you in my show.

618
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,057
- Your show?
- This is Miss Brown.

619
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:27,200
- Nadine Hale, star of our show.
- How do you do?

620
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,235
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Don and I have talked about you.

621
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:34,101
- Don and you...?
- Harry, we'll do Miss Hale's number.

622
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:35,969
Excuse me.

623
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,346
Harry, I think I'll need four extra bars
on my intro in order to get...

624
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:43,074
Is that the Nadine
you used to dance with?

625
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,683
Yeah.

626
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:47,013
Why didn't you tell me?

627
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,983
- Well, I never thought about it.
- Were you in love?

628
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:52,250
- What?
- Were you in love with her?

629
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:55,452
- Well, we...
- Never mind.

630
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:58,860
- Hannah, look...
- Don, Mr. Ziegfeld's waiting upstairs.

631
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,293
I'll meet you at the hotel.

632
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:06,333
Taxi.

633
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,065
Taxi.

634
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:13,844
Hello, there!

635
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,613
- Oh, hello.
- Where have you been?

636
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:21,515
I've been living in that drugstore
waiting for you.

637
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:23,451
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

638
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,114
Fine.

639
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,226
- Gosh, it's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

640
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:31,887
This brilliant conversation's
costing you money.

641
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:33,555
Yes. I must go anyway.

642
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:37,968
- What are you doing here?
- We just auditioned for the show.

643
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:40,265
Have you ever heard of Hannah & Hewes?

644
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,034
Hannah & Hewes?
Don't tell me you're Hannah Brown.

645
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,271
- Don't tell me you've ever heard of me.
- Of course I have, from Don.

646
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,851
- Do you know Don?
- Do I know him? We're like brothers.

647
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,681
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

648
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,082
Well, I have to...

649
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,987
Wait a minute, now.
I'm not gonna lose you again.

650
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,560
- Have dinner with me tonight?
- I don't think...

651
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:03,991
It ain't worth it, lady.

652
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:07,463
- I'm almost one of the family.
- All right.

653
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,363
- I'll fix it with Don.
- Fine.

654
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:11,834
- Where are you staying?
- Regency Park Hotel.

655
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:15,099
- Regency Park Hotel.
- I'll pick you up at 7:30.

656
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,906
- Bye.
- Bye.

657
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,876
Officer, I thank you.

658
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,648
- Hello.
- Hello.

659
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,223
Well...

660
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:39,331
...what did he say? When do we start?

661
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,491
We don't. We turned it down.

662
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,300
Turned it down?

663
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:47,134
But, Don, l...

664
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:51,073
I don't understand.
This is everything we've worked for.

665
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:54,236
It's everything you've dreamed of.

666
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,271
Come here.

667
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,213
Sit down.

668
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:02,014
Now, look, there are all kinds of dreams.

669
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,647
Some people dream about
a little farm to settle down on...

670
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:07,851
...a spot all their own.

671
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,461
That's what we want...

672
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,723
...only our spot's on a marquee.

673
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:14,594
"Hannah & Hewes" in blazing lights.

674
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:17,862
It's got to be all ours.
We're not sharing it.

675
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:23,203
Besides, Nadine doesn't belong in the same
show with you! She can't compare to you!

676
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,436
She can't?

677
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:29,846
No.

678
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,753
Professor! How did you know
I was here?

679
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:44,953
- Well...
- This is wonderful. Come on in.

680
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,429
Hannah, this is the greatest guy.
Johnny Harrow, Hannah Brown.

681
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,534
- Hello.
- Hello.

682
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:52,466
- Won't you sit down.
- Thank you.

683
00:49:52,638 --> 00:49:55,163
- What are you doing tonight?
- Well, I had plans...

684
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,865
Cancel. Dine with us.
I'll make a reservation.

685
00:49:58,043 --> 00:50:00,739
We won't take no for an answer,
will we, Hannah?

686
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:03,939
- Wanna get yourself a date?
- Well, I have a date, I think.

687
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:06,482
- Fine. Bring her along.
- Thanks. I will.

688
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:08,711
- Those are lovely.
- Oh, they're for you.

689
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:12,983
Thank you, Johnny. It won't take me
a minute. I'll get dressed.

690
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:17,256
Don, you're welcome to join us...

691
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:18,919
...if you'd like to.

692
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,294
There's no point in your wasting
those flowers on me.

693
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:29,035
Look, tell Hannah I'll see her tomorrow.

694
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:33,205
- So long, Johnny.
- Goodbye, Don.

695
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:39,977
- Don said he'd see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

696
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:44,281
Johnny, could we go someplace
where we can talk?

697
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:46,185
Yes, I know just the place.

698
00:50:50,863 --> 00:50:54,094
- Thank you.
- You don't want to order.

699
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:55,927
Yes, we do.

700
00:50:56,101 --> 00:50:58,695
The specialty tonight is beef stroganoff.

701
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:01,362
- But you wouldn't like it.
- It sounds wonderful.

702
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,405
- Make it two.
- Two beef stroganoffs.

703
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:07,272
- Yes. What about a salad?
- Salad? There is only one salad.

704
00:51:07,446 --> 00:51:09,004
Salad François.

705
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:11,581
- Your salad?
- Let's try it.

706
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,548
- Try it?
- What's in it?

707
00:51:16,955 --> 00:51:18,752
I'll show you.

708
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,585
This salad has been handed down...

709
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:28,529
...from my great-grandfather
to my grandfather...

710
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,932
...to my father, and from my father to me.

711
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:34,333
Spice...

712
00:51:34,506 --> 00:51:36,371
...from India.

713
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:40,678
Herb from Africa.

714
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:43,746
Garlic...

715
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:45,508
...perfume for a gourmet.

716
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:48,778
I gently rub the inside of the bowl.

717
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:52,753
Petits pois from France.

718
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:03,599
Apartment 24B.

719
00:52:06,738 --> 00:52:08,069
Egg...

720
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,037
...from a chicken.

721
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:13,705
Lemon.

722
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,980
You must be ruthless.

723
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:21,979
Cheese, Parmesan from Italy.

724
00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:34,922
I put them in anyway.

725
00:52:40,005 --> 00:52:43,998
Onion from Bermuda.
You slice the onion very thin.

726
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:47,243
This gives the salad flavor.

727
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:50,347
It makes it bright, refreshing...

728
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:52,346
...and gay.

729
00:52:57,122 --> 00:53:00,489
Mix, mix, toss, toss.
Mix, mix, toss, toss.

730
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:03,651
Toss, toss, mix, mix.
Toss, toss, mix, mix.

731
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:07,265
Mix, toss, toss, mix.
Mix, mix, toss, toss.

732
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,508
I don't think so.

733
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,073
It's very nice here.

734
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,144
I like it.

735
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:35,056
Now, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

736
00:53:37,863 --> 00:53:40,331
You and Don are very good friends,
aren't you?

737
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:41,727
Yes.

738
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,765
- Was he ever married?
- No.

739
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:45,665
Engaged?

740
00:53:45,837 --> 00:53:48,397
I only ask because I'm curious.

741
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:50,598
He never talks about himself.

742
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:52,710
Just about dancing.

743
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:56,807
- Everything is strictly business.
- That's a good idea.

744
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,573
Sometimes...

745
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:03,016
...if we make a mistake in the show,
he'll ask if I'll stay...

746
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:04,815
...and rehearse with him.

747
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,959
We go out and have a late supper...

748
00:54:08,126 --> 00:54:09,718
...and we dance...

749
00:54:09,895 --> 00:54:12,295
...just the two of us.

750
00:54:13,732 --> 00:54:16,326
Sometimes I make mistakes on purpose.

751
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:20,865
You know, I think that François was right,
there are three of us here.

752
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:23,005
Look...

753
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:26,736
...supposing Don were interested
in someone else?

754
00:54:28,914 --> 00:54:30,541
Do you mean Nadine?

755
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:33,207
Well, they used to work together.

756
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:39,950
- He was in love with her, wasn't he?
- I don't know. I guess so.

757
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,184
Well, he isn't anymore.

758
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:44,261
He turned down the Ziegfeld show.

759
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:45,657
Why?

760
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:49,631
Because he said that she didn't belong
in the same show with me.

761
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:51,564
I agree with him.

762
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:55,070
Now, is there anything more
that I can tell you about Don?

763
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,306
No.

764
00:54:57,676 --> 00:54:59,871
Good. Now let's talk about us.

765
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:05,142
Did you know that scientists say that people
fall in love quickest during a rainstorm?

766
00:55:06,852 --> 00:55:08,877
I can prove that.

767
00:55:10,555 --> 00:55:13,456
Because that's when I fell
in love with you.

768
00:55:16,595 --> 00:55:18,119
You're not angry?

769
00:55:18,296 --> 00:55:21,060
Angry? No, I'm not angry.

770
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:23,531
I'm very proud.

771
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:26,827
Do you think that...

772
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:29,298
...you could love me?

773
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:34,312
Oh, Johnny, I'd be such a fool if I didn't.

774
00:55:34,479 --> 00:55:36,276
But...

775
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:39,208
...l'm in love with Don.

776
00:55:40,919 --> 00:55:42,716
Are you sure?

777
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:48,188
And it's...

778
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,623
It's nothing like I thought
it was going to be.

779
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:56,190
It never is.

780
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:01,028
You know, l...

781
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:04,273
I used to dream that...

782
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:07,207
...when I'd fall in love with a man...

783
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:09,438
...he'd send me flowers...

784
00:56:09,614 --> 00:56:13,914
...sweep me off my feet,
take me in his arms.

785
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:18,985
It's nothing like that with Don.

786
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:22,790
He doesn't even know I'm alive,
half the time.

787
00:56:23,495 --> 00:56:25,929
When he sweeps me off my feet...

788
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:28,123
...it's during a dance number.

789
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,268
When he sends me flowers...

790
00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:33,063
...it's because it's good for business.

791
00:56:33,872 --> 00:56:36,306
Oh, he's taken me in his arms...

792
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:41,174
...but there've never been less
than 700 people watching.

793
00:56:42,914 --> 00:56:45,007
Oh, it's not his fault.

794
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:47,014
It's mine.

795
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:51,383
When they were passing out the wishes...

796
00:56:54,092 --> 00:56:56,390
...I wished for him.

797
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:01,291
Our dinner should be ready soon.

798
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:03,958
I'm not very hungry.

799
00:57:04,136 --> 00:57:05,660
Neither am I. Should we go?

800
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:07,464
Yeah.

801
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:17,872
We're not staying.

802
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:20,176
- You're not?
- No.

803
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:22,877
Your hat and coat, Mr. Harrow.

804
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:13,968
<i>There's an old superstition</i>
<i>Way down South</i>

805
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:20,369
<i>Everybody believes</i>
<i>That trouble won't stay</i>

806
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:25,475
<i>If you shake it away</i>

807
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:31,787
<i>When they hold a revival</i>
<i>Way down South</i>

808
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:38,652
<i>Everybody with care</i>
<i>And trouble that day</i>

809
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:45,228
<i>Tries to shake it away</i>

810
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:50,407
<i>Shakin' the blues away</i>
<i>Unhappy news away</i>

811
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:55,908
<i>If you are blue, it's easy to</i>
<i>Shake off your cares and troubles</i>

812
00:58:56,081 --> 00:59:01,109
<i>Tellin' the blues to go</i>
<i>They may refuse to go</i>

813
00:59:01,386 --> 00:59:05,618
<i>But as a rule, they'll go if you'll</i>
<i>Shake 'em away</i>

814
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:09,157
<i>Do like the voodoos do</i>
<i>Listenin' to</i>

815
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:10,919
<i>A voodoo melody</i>

816
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:14,930
<i>They shake their bodies so</i>
<i>To and fro</i>

817
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,398
<i>With every shake</i>
<i>A lucky break</i>

818
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:22,529
<i>Provin' that there's a way</i>
<i>To chase your cares away</i>

819

00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:30,740

01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:51,921

<i>Shake off your cares</i>

825
01:01:00,538 --> 01:01:05,635
<i>Show them that there's a way</i>

826
01:01:05,877 --> 01:01:10,371
<i>If you would lose your weary blues</i>
<i>Shake 'em away</i>

827
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:13,782
<i>Shake 'em away</i>

828
01:01:13,952 --> 01:01:16,682
<i>Away</i>

829
01:01:21,526 --> 01:01:23,858
<i>Away</i>

830
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:45,143
Hello?

831
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:48,308
Hannah. Now, don't tell me
you're gonna break our date.

832
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:51,182
Johnny, have you heard from Don?

833
01:01:51,356 --> 01:01:54,985
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
I've been calling everyplace.

834
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:57,787
No. I wouldn't worry.
Nothing could've happened.

835
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:00,988
You don't know how depressed he's been
the past few weeks.

836
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:04,727
Then today, with the papers saying
what a big hit the <i>Follies</i> is.

837
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:06,894
You know, he turned it down, and...

838
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,299
I don't know.

839
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:10,441
I'm so worried about him.

840
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:12,340
Oh, wait a minute, Johnny.

841
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,308
Will you hold the line?
There's somebody at the door.

842
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,574
- Hello, baby!
- Don!

843
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:24,751
- Where've you been? You read the reviews?
- Sure. Very good.

844
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:27,187
- But wait till you read ours, baby.
- Ours?!

845
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:29,758
- Dillingham wants us for a show.
- Dillingham?!

846
01:02:29,928 --> 01:02:33,056
Yeah! He called me this morning.
I've been with him all day.

847
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:35,995
- He wants to build a show around us.
- Oh, Don!

848
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:39,762
- Where's a calendar? A calendar!
- A calendar? A calendar! Here! Here!

849
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:42,168
- Here's one.
- Yeah. Move over.

850
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,365
Now, everything's all set.

851
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:47,238
We start a week from Monday.
Four weeks' rehearsal.

852
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:51,178
Four on the road, Philadelphia, Boston.
Opening in New York April 6th.

853
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:53,408
Oh, Don, look!

854
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:54,984
April 7th. What about it?

855
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:58,520
Easter. We'll be here
for the Easter Parade.

856
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,625
- That's right. We have a date, haven't we?
- Yes.

857
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:04,523
- Say, how about celebrating tonight?
- Wonderful.

858
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:06,664
- Go out and do the town.
- I'd love it!

859
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:09,425
I better meet with the writers.
Pick me up, huh?

860
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,364
- Right.
- Good.

861
01:03:12,837 --> 01:03:14,065
Eight o'clock.

862
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:15,866
- Sharp.
- Sharp.

863
01:03:16,975 --> 01:03:18,772
Bye.

864
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:29,209
Johnny, are you still there?

865
01:03:29,387 --> 01:03:30,877
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

866
01:03:31,055 --> 01:03:33,455
Yes, I'm still here.

867
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:35,581
Congratulations.

868
01:03:36,995 --> 01:03:39,395
Did you hear? Isn't it wonderful?

869
01:03:39,797 --> 01:03:41,492
Yes, it's great.

870
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:44,726
I hope you don't mind
if I break our date for tonight.

871
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:48,430
Oh, Johnny.

872
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:52,167
<i>That's all right.</i>
<i>We'll celebrate tomorrow night.</i>

873
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,510
Thank you, Johnny.

874
01:03:56,681 --> 01:03:58,410
Bye.

875
01:04:03,855 --> 01:04:08,087
Operator. Plaza 3-1549.

876
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,052
Hello, Nadine?

877
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:14,756
Nadine, I'll be able to make it
for dinner tonight after all.

878
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:16,798
Right.

879
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,720
- Hello.
- I hope I'm not late.

880
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:41,518
- You're right on time.
- Aren't we going out?

881
01:04:41,693 --> 01:04:44,389
I thought if you didn't mind,
we'd have dinner here.

882
01:04:44,562 --> 01:04:47,030
- I'd love it.
- Good.

883
01:04:47,198 --> 01:04:48,597
Champagne?

884
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:50,563
Yeah.

885
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:55,334
There won't be anybody to disturb us,
just the two of us.

886
01:04:59,877 --> 01:05:02,903
I thought we'd go over some new
ideas I have for the show.

887
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:05,777
- There's one in particular I know...
- What?!

888
01:05:06,484 --> 01:05:08,714
What's the matter? What have I done?

889
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,487
Nothing, that's what you've done.
Nothing.

890
01:05:11,656 --> 01:05:14,181
I thought we had a date tonight,
not a rehearsal.

891
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:17,055
I should know better than to expect
you to be human.

892
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:19,389
- You're just a pair of dance shoes.
- What?

893
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:21,191
I'm tired of being a prop here!

894
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:23,493
- I don't even feel like a girl!
- Listen...

895
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:26,728
- You're just a pair of dancing shoes!
- You said that.

896
01:05:26,904 --> 01:05:28,132
I don't care!

897
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:30,968
Besides, I bought a new dress!

898
01:05:31,476 --> 01:05:33,569
- It's pretty.
- You haven't even looked.

899
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:35,713
- That's not true.
- Oh, isn't it?

900
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,906
All right, then tell me:
What color are my eyes?

901
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:43,713
You won't be able to answer that because
you have never paid enough attention to it.

902
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:50,222
They're brown.

903
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:53,591
That's right.

904
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:56,459
- I'll get my hat and coat...
- Oh, no, please.

905
01:05:56,634 --> 01:05:58,067
Can't we stay here?

906
01:05:58,236 --> 01:06:00,204
- But you said...
- I know, but...

907
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,271
...that was before.

908
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,772
I don't mind now.

909
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:07,040
All right.

910
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:15,142
Fire is so pretty.

911
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:23,350
"It Only Happens When I Dance With You."

912
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:26,326
That's one of the old songs.

913
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:28,489
She's very beautiful.

914
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:32,158
Yes, but she doesn't mean anything
to me anymore.

915
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:35,830
I told her I could teach any girl
to dance as well as she.

916
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:37,474
And you have.

917
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:40,338
No. We have.

918
01:06:40,912 --> 01:06:42,470
The idea was just this.

919
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:47,949
I started out to prove something, and now
it isn't important anymore. That's all.

920
01:06:53,658 --> 01:07:00,962
<i>It only happens</i>
<i>When I dance with you</i>

921
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:10,635
<i>That trip to heaven</i>
<i>Till the dance is through</i>

922
01:07:12,477 --> 01:07:20,213
<i>With no one else</i>
<i>Do the heavens seem quite so near</i>

923
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:25,653
<i>Why does it happen, dear</i>

924
01:07:26,357 --> 01:07:31,260
<i>Only with you?</i>

925
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:42,165
<i>Two cheeks together</i>
<i>Can be so divine</i>

926
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:46,603
<i>But only when those cheeks</i>

927
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:51,681
<i>Are yours and mine</i>

928
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,844
<i>I've danced with dozens of others</i>

929
01:07:57,021 --> 01:08:04,325
<i>The whole night through</i>

930
01:08:05,196 --> 01:08:09,098
<i>But the thrill that comes with spring</i>

931
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:15,499
<i>When anything could happen</i>

932
01:08:16,774 --> 01:08:22,337
<i>That only happens</i>

933
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:28,752
<i>With you</i>

934
01:08:38,896 --> 01:08:41,660
Why didn't you tell me
I was in love with you?

935
01:08:55,513 --> 01:08:57,276
Come in.

936
01:08:57,648 --> 01:09:00,048
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you? Thanks for the flowers.

937
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:01,742
- Nervous?
- No. Don't do that!

938
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,251
Don't put your hat on the bed.
It's bad luck.

939
01:09:04,422 --> 01:09:06,151
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

940
01:09:06,324 --> 01:09:08,383
- Come in.
- Fifteen minutes, Miss Brown.

941
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:10,857
Oh, I feel like I'm going to my execution.

942
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:12,825
Don't worry. They love you.

943
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:14,259
That's unanimous.

944
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:15,990
Come in.

945
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:17,395
- Hello, Don.
- Hi, John.

946
01:09:17,568 --> 01:09:20,002
I'll go start leading the applause.
Good luck.

947
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:23,334
- Thanks, John.
- Don, can you die from fright?

948
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:27,671
You'll be all right once you get on-stage.
I better go get dressed. Good luck.

949
01:09:27,845 --> 01:09:30,279
- Thank you.
- Don't forget to watch my number...

950
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,348
...with all those beautiful girls.

951
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:38,120
This is my left leg. This is my right.

952
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:41,725
This is my... Anna? Anna, my garter.

953
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:45,226
- Garter?
- The garter for me. Where is it? The garter.

954
01:10:02,313 --> 01:10:05,180
<i>Here he comes</i>
<i>Looking for his baby</i>

955
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:09,752
<i>It's for sure</i>
<i>Sure and not for maybe</i>

956
01:10:10,988 --> 01:10:13,923
<i>Don't ask when will the lucky day be</i>

957
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:18,257
<i>Here he comes</i>
<i>And let him tell you himself</i>

958
01:10:29,473 --> 01:10:34,001
<i>If I seem to scintillate</i>
<i>It's because I've got a date</i>

959
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:39,175
<i>A date with a package of</i>
<i>The good things that come with love</i>

960
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:43,952
<i>You don't have to ask me</i>
<i>I won't waste your time</i>

961
01:10:44,722 --> 01:10:48,624
<i>But if you should ask me</i>
<i>Why I feel sublime</i>

962
01:10:48,793 --> 01:10:54,163
<i>I'm steppin' out with my baby</i>
<i>Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right</i>

963
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:59,126
<i>It's for sure, not for maybe</i>
<i>That I'm all dressed up tonight</i>

964
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:04,265
<i>Steppin' out with my honey</i>
<i>Can't be bad to feel so good</i>

965
01:11:04,675 --> 01:11:09,078
<i>Never felt quite so sunny</i>
<i>And I keep on knockin' wood</i>

966
01:11:09,246 --> 01:11:13,683
<i>There'll be smooth sailin'</i>
<i>'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails</i>

967
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:18,620
<i>With a bright shine on my shoes</i>
<i>And on my nails</i>

968
01:11:19,724 --> 01:11:24,423
<i>Steppin' out with my baby</i>
<i>Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right</i>

969
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:29,562
<i>Ask me when will the day be</i>
<i>The big day may be tonight</i>

970
01:11:32,403 --> 01:11:37,067
<i>Steppin' out with my baby</i>
<i>Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right</i>

971
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:42,071
<i>It's for sure, not for maybe</i>
<i>That I'm all dressed up tonight</i>

972
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,113
<i>Steppin' out with my honey</i>
<i>Can't be bad to feel so good</i>

973
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:51,785
<i>Never felt quite so sunny</i>
<i>And I keep on knockin' wood</i>

974
01:11:51,956 --> 01:11:56,552
<i>There'll be smooth sailin'</i>
<i>'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails</i>

975
01:11:56,961 --> 01:12:01,796
<i>With a bright shine on my shoes</i>
<i>And on my nails</i>

976
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:07,166
<i>Steppin' out with my baby</i>
<i>Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right</i>

977
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:13,808
<i>Ask me when will the day be</i>
<i>The big day may be tonight</i>

978
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:56,030
This is Essie, Miss Hale. Mr. Hewes just
did a number with a lot of girls.

979
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,829
<i>I tell you, Miss Hale, any one of those girls</i>
<i>is better than she is.</i>

980
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:01,232
How was Mr. Hewes?

981
01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:05,068
<i>He was all right, but not like</i>
<i>he used to be when he danced with you.</i>

982
01:16:05,242 --> 01:16:08,006
That's fine. Come on back now.
I can't find a thing.

983
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:11,909
I'd better stay for the next number.
I'll be right back after that.

984
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:47,008
<i>We're a couple of swells</i>
<i>We stop at the best hotels</i>

985
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:52,655
<i>But we prefer the country</i>
<i>Far away from the city smells</i>

986
01:16:57,561 --> 01:17:02,396
<i>We're a couple of sports</i>
<i>The pride of the tennis courts</i>

987
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:08,000
<i>In June, July and August</i>
<i>We look cute when we're dressed in shorts</i>

988
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:17,347
<i>The Vanderbilts have asked us</i>
<i>Up for tea</i>

989
01:17:18,248 --> 01:17:22,275
<i>We don't know how to get there</i>
<i>No, sirree</i>

990
01:17:22,486 --> 01:17:25,512
<i>No, sirree</i>

991
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:32,724
<i>We would drive up the avenue</i>
<i>But we haven't got the price</i>

992
01:17:33,063 --> 01:17:38,660
<i>We would skate up the avenue</i>
<i>But there isn't any ice</i>

993
01:17:38,969 --> 01:17:44,464
<i>We would ride on a bicycle</i>
<i>But we haven't got a bike</i>

994
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:50,441
<i>So we'll walk up the avenue</i>
<i>Yes, we'll walk up the avenue</i>

995
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:55,608
<i>And to walk up the avenue's</i>
<i>What we like</i>

996
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:16,266
<i>Wall Street bankers are we</i>
<i>With plenty of currency</i>

997
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:22,378
<i>We'd open up the safe</i>
<i>But we forgot where we put the key</i>

998
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:31,816
<i>We're the favorite lads</i>
<i>Of girls in the picture ads</i>

999
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:35,558
<i>We'd like to tell you</i>
<i>Who we kissed last night</i>

1000
01:18:35,726 --> 01:18:37,626
<i>But we can't be cads</i>

1001
01:18:42,266 --> 01:18:47,260
<i>The Vanderbilts are waiting</i>
<i>At the club</i>

1002
01:18:47,938 --> 01:18:51,965
<i>But how are we to get there?</i>
<i>That's the rub</i>

1003
01:18:52,276 --> 01:18:55,370
<i>That's the rub</i>

1004
01:18:55,846 --> 01:19:02,649
<i>We would sail up the avenue</i>
<i>But we haven't got a yacht</i>

1005
01:19:02,853 --> 01:19:08,655
<i>We would drive up the avenue</i>
<i>But the horse we had was shot</i>

1006
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:14,458
<i>We would ride on a trolley car</i>
<i>But we haven't got the fare</i>

1007
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:20,431
<i>So we'll walk up the avenue</i>
<i>Yes, we'll walk up the avenue</i>

1008
01:19:20,604 --> 01:19:25,906
<i>Yes, we'll walk up the avenue</i>
<i>Till we're there</i>

1009
01:20:08,685 --> 01:20:13,850
<i>We would swim up the avenue</i>
<i>But we haven't any lake</i>

1010
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:19,652
<i>So we'll walk up the avenue</i>
<i>Yes, we'll walk up the avenue</i>

1011
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:25,166
<i>Yes, a walk up the avenue's</i>
<i>What we'll take</i>

1012
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:57,261
- Mind if I say I told you so?
- Johnny, I'm so happy.

1013
01:20:57,434 --> 01:20:59,834
- Miss Brown, you were magnificent.
- Thank you.

1014
01:21:00,003 --> 01:21:02,130
- You were wonderful.
- Thank you.

1015
01:21:02,306 --> 01:21:04,740
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- All right.

1016
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:06,398
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello.

1017
01:21:06,977 --> 01:21:08,740
- Hello.
- Great show, Johnny.

1018
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:10,277
- Don.
- Yeah?

1019
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:12,210
- Just wonderful, really.
- Thanks.

1020
01:21:12,382 --> 01:21:14,350
I'm taking Hannah to celebrate. Come.

1021
01:21:14,518 --> 01:21:16,509
I'm going to the roof to see Nadine.

1022
01:21:16,687 --> 01:21:18,882
- Oh, fine.
- Come in.

1023
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:24,493
Come in.

1024
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:27,528
- Don, you know where I'd like to go?
- Where?

1025
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:29,222
To Pastini's, where we met.

1026
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,995
Sure, but some other night.
I made reservations for the <i>Ziegfeld Follies</i>.

1027
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:37,106
- We gotta celebrate.
- All right.

1028
01:21:37,274 --> 01:21:38,901
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.

1029
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:40,338
Good night.

1030
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:44,678
And there she was, all dirtied up,
and with a man's clothes on.

1031
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:49,012
When they danced together,
they laughed at her. It was just awful.

1032
01:21:49,186 --> 01:21:51,086
Come in.

1033
01:21:52,322 --> 01:21:54,813
- Good evening, Nadine.
- Oh, hello.

1034
01:21:54,992 --> 01:21:57,859
Well, Essie, I see you got here before me.

1035
01:21:58,028 --> 01:22:03,762
I suppose you won't believe me, Johnny,
but I'm sorry for her. Really sorry.

1036
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:05,162
What?

1037
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:08,133
Essie was telling me
about their show tonight.

1038
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:09,704
Oh, you were?

1039
01:22:09,873 --> 01:22:12,137
- On-stage, Miss Hale.
- Oh, coming.

1040
01:22:12,309 --> 01:22:14,641
Essie, don't forget my slippers.

1041
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:20,577
I'm flattered you came tonight, Johnny.
I wasn't sure you could tear yourself away.

1042
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:39,331
Oh, dear, I wish they'd stop.

1043
01:22:39,503 --> 01:22:42,438
They won't until we take a bow. Come on.

1044
01:22:45,075 --> 01:22:47,305
- Who's getting the hand?
- Hannah & Hewes.

1045
01:22:47,477 --> 01:22:50,537
- What?!
- They made a big hit in that show tonight.

1046
01:22:50,714 --> 01:22:53,774
I still say she doesn't compare to you.

1047
01:23:05,395 --> 01:23:11,300
<i>The girl I love</i>

1048
01:23:11,568 --> 01:23:15,834
<i>Is on a magazine cover</i>

1049
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:23,844
<i>It seems they painted her</i>
<i>Just for me</i>

1050
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:27,943
<i>I'd fall in love</i>

1051
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:32,187
<i>If I could ever discover</i>

1052
01:23:32,522 --> 01:23:40,293
<i>A little girl quite as nice as she</i>

1053
01:23:40,764 --> 01:23:44,632
<i>If I could meet</i>

1054
01:23:44,901 --> 01:23:48,667
<i>A girl as sweet</i>

1055
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:51,806
<i>I'd simply claim her</i>

1056
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:57,038
<i>And name her my queen</i>

1057
01:23:57,514 --> 01:24:01,473
<i>For if she ever came</i>

1058
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:04,449
<i>I would love her the same</i>

1059
01:24:06,022 --> 01:24:11,324
<i>As I love her</i>
<i>On the cover</i>

1060
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:17,865
<i>Of a magazine</i>

1061
01:26:13,617 --> 01:26:16,711
<i>If I could meet</i>

1062
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:20,050
<i>A girl as sweet</i>

1063
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:22,986
<i>I'd simply claim her</i>

01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:27,289
<i>And name her my queen</i>

01:26:27,731 --> 01:26:31,258
<i>For if she ever came</i>

1066
01:26:31,434 --> 01:26:34,597

<i>Of a magazine</i>

1071
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:18,346
Here, take this. I'm not through yet.

1072
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,176
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1073
01:27:22,686 --> 01:27:26,952
My former partner, Mr. Don Hewes,
is here this evening.

1074
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:31,025
And perhaps we can persuade Mr. Hewes
to do one of our old numbers:

1075
01:27:31,194 --> 01:27:34,925
"It Only Happens When I Dance With You."

1076
01:27:35,131 --> 01:27:36,894
Oh, no.

1077
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:41,894
Please, Don.

1078
01:29:17,233 --> 01:29:20,999
- What time does the last show start?
- This isn't an all-night joint...

1079
01:29:21,171 --> 01:29:22,798
Hannah.

1080
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:24,200
Hello, Mike.

1081
01:29:24,374 --> 01:29:25,841
Gosh, it's good to see you.

1082
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:29,103
If I knew you were coming,
I'd have cleaned the place up.

1083
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,771
Oh, no, it's never looked so wonderful.

1084
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:35,042
- Gosh, you look pretty.
- Hello, Joe.

1085
01:29:35,218 --> 01:29:37,482
- Hello, Hannah.
- Been reading all about you.

1086
01:29:37,654 --> 01:29:40,316
How does it feel to be a big success?

1087
01:29:42,392 --> 01:29:44,292
Fine.

1088
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:48,489
- How are things with you, Mike?
- Oh, always the same.

1089
01:29:48,665 --> 01:29:52,226
Problem with every drink.
People's troubles never change.

1090
01:29:53,002 --> 01:29:55,061
- Don't they?
- No. They always come in...

1091
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:57,206
...whenever they've got...

1092
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:01,135
How about some champagne?

1093
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:03,911
No, thanks. I don't think so.

1094
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,345
Well, I'm gonna celebrate
your opening night.

1095
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:13,448
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1096
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,858
This is your opening night, isn't it?

1097
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:21,263
Well, what are you doing here by yourself?

1098
01:30:21,531 --> 01:30:23,965
Oh, I don't know. I just...

1099
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:26,534
...wanted to get away for a while.

1100
01:30:26,703 --> 01:30:28,762
Sure.

1101
01:30:29,305 --> 01:30:33,833
If there's anything I can do,
break anyone's neck, just say the word.

1102
01:30:34,444 --> 01:30:36,207
No, thanks, Mike.

1103
01:30:36,513 --> 01:30:39,038
There isn't anything anyone can do.

1104
01:30:40,483 --> 01:30:44,681
Don't say that.
No man is that important.

1105
01:30:45,588 --> 01:30:47,249
Plenty of fish left in the sea.

1106
01:30:47,423 --> 01:30:50,187
- You know, it's always darkest...
- Oh, Mike, please.

1107
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,387
I don't think you've got a motto
for what my kind of trouble is.

1108
01:30:54,731 --> 01:30:56,494
Maybe not.

1109
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,531
Maybe not.

1110
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:02,170
But I've got a poem.

1111
01:31:03,206 --> 01:31:07,870
<i>For ev'ry rose that withers and dies,</i>
<i>Another blooms in its stead</i>

1112
01:31:08,044 --> 01:31:14,108
<i>A new love waits to open its eyes</i>
<i>After the old love is dead</i>

1113
01:31:15,785 --> 01:31:20,916
<i>That sounds all right</i>
<i>In a careless rhyme</i>

1114
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:27,827
<i>But there's seldom</i>
<i>A second time</i>

1115
01:31:28,865 --> 01:31:31,766
<i>Better luck next time</i>

1116
01:31:31,935 --> 01:31:36,463
<i>That could never be</i>

1117
01:31:37,173 --> 01:31:43,772
<i>Because there ain't gonna be</i>
<i>No next time</i>

1118
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,908
<i>For me</i>

1119
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:50,746
<i>No, sirree</i>

1120
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,855
<i>Made up my mind</i>

1121
01:31:54,023 --> 01:31:58,687
<i>To make another start</i>

1122
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:03,030
<i>I've made my mind up</i>

1123
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:10,128
<i>But I can't make up my heart</i>

1124
01:32:11,007 --> 01:32:18,846
<i>I'd like a new lucky day</i>

1125
01:32:19,249 --> 01:32:23,049
<i>That would be nice</i>

1126
01:32:23,453 --> 01:32:30,723
<i>But this comes</i>
<i>Just once in a lifetime</i>

1127
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:33,158
<i>Not twice</i>

1128
01:32:34,897 --> 01:32:41,359
<i>So don't say</i>
<i>"Better luck next time"</i>

1129
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:47,442
<i>That can never be</i>

1130
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:53,981
<i>Because there ain't gonna be</i>

1131
01:32:54,617 --> 01:32:57,916
<i>No next time</i>

1132
01:32:58,087 --> 01:33:03,320
<i>For me</i>

1133
01:33:10,566 --> 01:33:12,830
Good evening, Miss Brown.
Congratulations.

1134
01:33:13,002 --> 01:33:14,731
Thank you.

1135
01:33:17,373 --> 01:33:19,603
- Any messages?
- No.

1136
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:23,040
- Good night.
- Good night.

1137
01:33:29,585 --> 01:33:30,950
Hannah.

1138
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:34,746
I was beginning to think
you were never coming.

1139
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:37,050
If I knew you'd be here,
you'd be right.

1140
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:38,557
- Oh, listen.
- You're lost.

1141
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:40,320
This isn't the Ziegfeld roof.

1142
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:42,930
Why did you run off
without letting me explain?

1143
01:33:43,099 --> 01:33:46,000
You don't have to explain.
This is after working hours.

1144
01:33:46,169 --> 01:33:49,229
- I had to dance with Nadine.
- You made that very obvious.

1145
01:33:49,405 --> 01:33:50,929
You couldn't wait, could you?

1146
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:54,201
Was it fun watching me make a fool
of myself all those months of rehearsal?

1147
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:57,210
I was willing to do anything to make good,
but I thought it was for us.

1148
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,042
- But it was.
- No. The whole thing was a buildup...

1149
01:34:00,216 --> 01:34:03,379
...to get Nadine back. Well, now
you've got her. Excuse me.

1150
01:34:03,553 --> 01:34:05,783
You're wrong.
I don't want her. I want you.

1151
01:34:05,955 --> 01:34:08,219
Depends on what song
is being played.

1152
01:34:08,391 --> 01:34:11,383
- Would you listen to me?
- I'm sick of listening to you.

1153
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:14,257
I'm sick of you
using my life for a checkerboard.

1154
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:18,025
I've had enough. Now go on back to Nadine
and her Russian wolfhounds.

1155
01:34:18,201 --> 01:34:20,032
Tell her the experiment worked.

1156
01:34:20,203 --> 01:34:22,637
You can dance with anybody.

1157
01:34:22,805 --> 01:34:24,033
Good night.

1158
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:27,542
Hannah...

1159
01:34:27,777 --> 01:34:30,803
...even a murderer is innocent
until he's proved guilty.

1160
01:34:31,647 --> 01:34:35,105
All right, I told you I did start this thing
to get Nadine back.

1161
01:34:35,284 --> 01:34:37,081
I was sore when she walked out.

1162
01:34:37,253 --> 01:34:40,984
I wanted to show her I didn't need her.
Well, I found out I don't.

1163
01:34:41,157 --> 01:34:44,058
I didn't know that until I met you.

1164
01:34:45,261 --> 01:34:48,424
How was I to know that you'd be
the most wonderful...

1165
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:51,195
...girl in the whole world?

1166
01:34:52,602 --> 01:34:57,005
Hannah, will you please open the door
just for a minute?

1167
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:01,003
I'm gonna stay right here
until you do, if it takes all night.

1168
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:04,510
Baby?

1169
01:35:08,317 --> 01:35:09,807
Baby?

1170
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:14,082
- Oh, hello.
- Well, it's nice to see you too.

1171
01:36:17,153 --> 01:36:18,984
Did you come alone?

1172
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:20,747
Certainly.

1173
01:36:23,226 --> 01:36:24,853
Well, do you mind if I come in?

1174
01:36:25,027 --> 01:36:26,892
Oh, I'm sorry. Please do.

1175
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:32,894
I thought maybe Don might...

1176
01:36:36,839 --> 01:36:39,034
We had a little misunderstanding.

1177
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:42,405
I know. I stayed over at his place last night.

1178
01:36:43,546 --> 01:36:45,571
I haven't slept all night.

1179
01:36:45,882 --> 01:36:48,009
Didn't close my eyes.

1180
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:52,216
- How's he?
- I don't know.

1181
01:36:52,388 --> 01:36:55,380
- He was still asleep when I left.
- Asleep?

1182
01:36:55,558 --> 01:36:57,617
You mean he wasn't upset?

1183
01:36:57,793 --> 01:37:01,422
Oh, a little. It's always a nuisance
auditioning a new partner.

1184
01:37:01,597 --> 01:37:03,588
Auditioning?!

1185
01:37:03,766 --> 01:37:06,394
He can't do that to me!

1186
01:37:06,569 --> 01:37:09,663
- Why not?
- Because he loves me, that's why not!

1187
01:37:10,473 --> 01:37:13,465
He's under the impression that
you weren't fond of him.

1188
01:37:13,643 --> 01:37:16,077
But I am. Terribly.

1189
01:37:16,245 --> 01:37:22,377
- I'm afraid it's a little late.
- Late? That can't be. What'll I do?

1190
01:37:22,552 --> 01:37:27,114
Well, if I loved someone,
I'd find a way to let them know it.

1191
01:37:27,523 --> 01:37:29,787
Well, it's different with a man.

1192
01:37:30,326 --> 01:37:32,692
- Why?
- I don't know. It just is, that's all.

1193
01:37:32,862 --> 01:37:35,228
It's easier. They can...

1194
01:37:45,308 --> 01:37:48,209
Johnny. Johnny.

1195
01:37:48,377 --> 01:37:51,346
Put on his favorite dress.
You'll be late for the Easter Parade.

1196
01:37:51,514 --> 01:37:53,675
Do something about your face.
You look horrible.

1197
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:56,215
Oh, Johnny, thank you.

1198
01:37:56,385 --> 01:37:58,216
Thank you.

1199
01:38:08,664 --> 01:38:12,566
Hello, operator. Plaza 3-1598, please.

1200
01:38:14,804 --> 01:38:16,465
Hello, Nadine?

1201
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,871
Nadine, get out all the hounds.
We're going for a walk.

1202
01:38:29,051 --> 01:38:31,019
Mr. Hewes' apartment?

1203
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:35,384
Sam, where'd you put my...?

1204
01:38:35,558 --> 01:38:37,890
- What's that?
- These just arrived.

1205
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,687
- Who are they for?
- For you.

1206
01:38:39,862 --> 01:38:44,196
For me? Well, they couldn't be.
Sam, well, don't put them down there.

1207
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:46,858
- Go catch the fella...
- No card.

1208
01:38:48,204 --> 01:38:50,172
There must be some mistake.

1209
01:38:50,339 --> 01:38:52,899
Find out where they belong,
will you, Sam?

1210
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:56,773
- They're very pretty.
- For you.

1211
01:38:56,946 --> 01:39:00,438
- For me? Well, who brought them?
- A messenger.

1212
01:39:00,616 --> 01:39:02,481
Put them down, will you?

1213
01:39:06,155 --> 01:39:09,818
Sam, do you know anything about this?

1214
01:39:11,694 --> 01:39:13,924
You think we dare open it?

1215
01:39:17,466 --> 01:39:19,934
"Happy Easter, darling."

1216
01:39:22,605 --> 01:39:25,472
There must be some mistake.
He got the wrong apartment.

1217
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:28,804
- Shall I open the other one?
- No, I'll open it.

1218
01:39:46,262 --> 01:39:49,823
What a cute little rabbit.

1219
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,824
Hello, little fella. Hello, there.

1220
01:39:54,003 --> 01:39:56,267
Isn't he cute?

1221
01:39:57,073 --> 01:40:00,634
Aren't you hungry?
Where did you come from?

1222
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,471
Bunny want a cracker?

1223
01:40:02,645 --> 01:40:04,237
I'll get it.

1224
01:40:08,751 --> 01:40:11,151
- Hello, Sam.
- Oh, hello, Miss Brown.

1225
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,720
- Meet bunny.
- We're old friends. Happy Easter.

1226
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,356
- Happy Easter.
- Thank you.

1227
