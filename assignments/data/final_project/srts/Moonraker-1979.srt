1
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,110
How we doing, Richard?

2
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,280
We should pass over the English coast
15 minutes ahead of time, sir.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,450
Well, with this load on our
back, that's good going.

4
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,580
Just trust the RAF, sir.

5
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,870
- What the hell is that?
- The shuttle ignition.

6
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,590
Disappeared? And what
happened to the Moonraker?

7
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,100
Good God.

8
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,980
Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.

9
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,490
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?

10
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,870
He's on his last leg, sir.

11
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,290
Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.

12
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,510
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.

13
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,640
You're so right, Mr. Bond.

14
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,810
This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.

15
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,150
A little premature, isn't it?

16
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,820
Enjoy your flight.

17
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,760
- Good morning, Moneypenny.
- James.

18
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
But why are you so late?

19
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,640
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.

20
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,010
- Who's in there?
- Q and the Minister of Defense.

21
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,770
You don't believe me, do you?

22
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,190
- And you should go right in.
- Yes, Moneypenny.

23
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,320
- 007. At last.
- Good morning, sir.

24
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,990
I think you know Frederick
Gray, Minister of Defense.

25
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,740
- Commander.
- Minister. Q.

26
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,370
007.

27
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,950
Moonraker?

28
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,960
- What do you know about Moonraker?
- What I read in the newspaper, sir.

29
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Then you'll know that
Moonraker, the space shuttle,

30
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,130
was being flown over here

31
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,630
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.

32
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,880
Yes, which crashed somewhere in the Yukon,

33
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,180
aircraft and shuttle totally
destroyed, correct?

34
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,260
- That's the official version.
- The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.

35
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,970
Look at this.

36
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,610
Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.

37
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,440
That's all that's left of the fuselage.

38
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,450
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,

39
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,030
but there's no sign of
Moonraker, not a trace.

40
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,620
Are you suggesting the shuttle
was hijacked in midair?

41
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,910
That's for you to find out, 007.

42
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,460
The shuttles are built in
California by Drax Industries.

43
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,420
Yes. We were responsible for the
safety of that shuttle, Commander.

44
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,670
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.

45
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,590
I can imagine. Then, California
must be the place to start.

46
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
- I agree.
- Don't make any mistakes, 007.

47
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,270
The situation is critical. We've
got to find that shuttle.

48
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,770
Yes, sir.

49
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,440
If that's all, gentlemen...

50
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,030
Just a minute, 007. I've
got something for you.

51
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,740
Roll up your right sleeve, will you?

52
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,740
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.

53
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,790
Strap it on your wrist.

54
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,420
It's activated by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.

55
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,840
Like this?

56
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,720
Oh, thank you, 007.

57
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,220
- Be careful, will you?
- Yes, Q.

58
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,430
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,

59
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,730
five red-tipped, cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.

60
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,730
Very novel, Q. You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.

61
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,770
Good morning, gentlemen.

62
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,500
- Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
- I like it already.

63
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,180
My name is Corinne Dufour.

64
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,930
Oh, and you're going to be showing
me around, are you, Corinne?

65
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,270
No. I'm just a humble pilot in the
service of the Drax Corporation.

66
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,030
This is the Drax estate now. Everything
you see belongs to Mr. Drax.

67
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,580
- Owns a lot, doesn't he?
- What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.

68
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,710
We're approaching the main complex now.

69
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,630
That's where the Moonraker shuttle is made?

70
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,640
That's right, workshops, hangars,

71
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,850
design and experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.

72
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,390
Very impressive.

73
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,740
I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.

74
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,490
Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.

75
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,420
The Drax residence. Every
stone brought from France.

76
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,680
- Cute, isn't it?
- Magnificent.

77
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,510
Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower as well?

78
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,220
He did, but the French government
refused him an export permit.

79
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,750
Look there. Those are
the astronaut trainees.

80
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,420
Mr. Drax is financing the entire
training program out of his own pocket.

81
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,590
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.

82
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,150
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in
the drawing room, Miss Dufour.

83
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,530
- Thank you, Cavendish.
- This way, please, sir.

84
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,200
Mr. Bond, sir.

85
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,990
- Mr. Bond.
- Mr. Drax.

86
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,370
Allow me to present, before they
leave us, Countess Lubinski,

87
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,420
Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.

88
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,960
How do you do?

89
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,260
Well, my dear fellow, your
reputation precedes you, of course.

90
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,720
I'm honored that your government should
send you on so delicate a mission.

91
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,220
Delicate, Mr. Drax?

92
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,270
Well, to apologize in person for
the loss of my space shuttle.

93
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,190
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?

94
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,490
"To lose one aircraft may be
regarded as a misfortune,"

95
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,580
"to lose two seems like carelessness."

96
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,080
Well, an apology will be made to
the American government, Mr. Drax,

97
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,300
when we've discovered why there was no
trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.

98
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,420
And your loyalty commands
respect, Mr. Bond.

99
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,600
You have arrived at a propitious moment,

100
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,020
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution

101
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,930
to Western civilization.

102
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,770
Afternoon tea.

103
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,400
- May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you, no, nothing at all.

104
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,320
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

105
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,030
No. I own a number of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

106
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,870
producing components.

107
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,040
The conquest of space represents
an investment in the future

108
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,250
of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.

109
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,840
It is, therefore, logical to seek out
the best that each nation has to offer.

110
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,720
- Are you referring to people or skills?
- Both, Mr. Bond.

111
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,060
- Am I too soon?
- Not at all.

112
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm sure Mr. Bond is
eager to start his tour.

113
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,240
Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.

114
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,450
Ask anything you like.

115
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,040
- Thank you for being so cooperative.
- A pleasure.

116
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,180
Look after Mr. Bond. See
that some harm comes to him.

117
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,520
You'll find Dr. Goodhead
first on the right.

118
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,020
- Oh. Thank you for the ride.
- Call on me if you need anything.

119
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,210
Good afternoon.

120
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,800
- Can I help you?
- Yes. My name is Bond.

121
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,590
James Bond. I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

122
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,310
- You just found her.
- A woman.

123
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,190
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

124
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,230
James, to my friends.

125
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,730
Holly Goodhead.

126
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,030
- Are you training to be an astronaut?
- I'm fully trained.

127
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,160
On loan from NASA, the
Space Administration.

128
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,830
Well, Mr. Bond, I guess
we'd better get started.

129
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,120
You don't want to lose time as
well as a space shuttle, do you?

130
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,550
This is it, the Moonraker.

131
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,050
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

132
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,350
Orbiting the Earth and reentering
the atmosphere to land

133
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,810
like any conventional aircraft.

134
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,020
This is the centrifuge training.

135
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,740
It simulates the gravity force
you feel when shot into space.

136
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,790
The speed is controlled by the
instructor from up there.

137
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,960
Why not try it?

138
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,460
Why not?

139
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,590
- Strap yourself in firmly.
- Yes, Doctor.

140
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,680
Now your arms.

141
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,230
That's to prevent you from
knocking yourself out.

142
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,600
I see.

143
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,780
How fast does it go?

144
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,080
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

145
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,910
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

146
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Most people pass out at seven.

147
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,580
You make a great saleswoman.

148
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,710
You don't have to worry. This is
what we call a "Chicken Switch."

149
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,880
You just keep your finger on that button,

150
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,430
the moment the pressure gets too
much for you, release the button

151
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,930
- and the power's cut off.
- Just like that?

152
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,390
Come on, Mr. Bond. A 70-
year-old can take 3 Gs.

153
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,110
Well, the trouble is there is never a
70- year-old around when you need one.

154
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,860
- You want me?
- Mr. Drax says to telephone him.

155
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,660
All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.

156
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,750
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.

157
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,430
Yes. We're taking good care of him.

158
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,750
I don't know what could've happened.

159
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,920
Something must've gone
wrong with the controls.

160
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,600
Let me help you.

161
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,260
My mother gave me a list of
things not to do on a first date.

162
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,930
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.

163
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,100
No. What do you want then?

164
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,400
Would your feelings be shattered
if I were to say information?

165
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,740
- Why should I tell you anything?
- Why, indeed?

166
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,660
You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.

167
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,220
What goes on here besides the
manufacture of Moonraker?

168
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,930
And the astronaut training program?

169
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,560
There are other laboratories,
but not much is happening now.

170
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,480
No?

171
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,700
They were working on something very
secret, but everything's been moved.

172
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,700
Where to?

173
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,540
I don't know.

174
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,630
What about that list of your mother's?

175
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,340
I never learned to read.

176
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,980
What are you doing?

177
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,610
You whetted my appetite for information.

178
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,120
Is there a safe in here? Thank you.

179
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,330
James, no.

180
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,250
That's amazing.

181
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,670
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.

182
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,460
Eighteen karat.

183
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,420
You must go.

184
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,550
Well, you go first. I'll
turn off the lights.

185
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,550
Thank you.

186
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,230
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.

187
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,790
My dear Bond.

188
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,920
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.

189
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,380
- Ladies.
- I'll see you at lunch.

190
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,050
A pity you leave us. Such good sport.

191
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,640
Unless you're a pheasant.

192
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,230
Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.

193
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,690
I only stopped to thank
you for your hospitality.

194
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,270
Fraser will get you to the
airport in plenty of time.

195
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,070
Come now.

196
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,470
- I doubt if I'm in your class.
- Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.

197
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,520
Over there.

198
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,070
You missed, Mr. Bond.

199
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,860
Did I?

200
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:46,540
As you said, such good sport.

201
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,810
You called for me, Mr. Drax.

202
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,020
You were with Bond last night in my study.

203
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,110
No, I...

204
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,320
- You showed him the safe.
- I didn't.

205
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,240
I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.

206
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,830
Franco, I'll call you to
tell you where to meet me.

207
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,610
Could I interest you in something?

208
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,480
Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.

209
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,110
But I think maybe I'd
better have a look around.

210
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Please. Go anywhere you wish.

211
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,240
And in 1955, the Venini
Museum and Glass Works

212
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,160
was taken over by Drax Industries.

213
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,790
And here, ladies and gentlemen, we
have some of the rarest examples

214
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,380
of the glassblower's art.

215
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,090
As you know, everything was
done absolutely by hand.

216
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,010
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati,

217
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,600
sometime between 1850 and 1860. If
you'd like to follow me over here.

218
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,020
This exquisite bowl was fashioned
about 1520, over 450 years ago.

219
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,070
If it ever came on the market,
it would certainly fetch a price

220
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,360
in excess of one million American dollars.

221
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,990
But if any of you are
thinking of taking it...

222
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,200
Now, we have here a very
early 17th century dish

223
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,960
with an aquamarine medallion.

224
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,880
Over here, we have something
very, very interesting.

225
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,340
This glass-handled sword,

226
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,920
the only one of its kind in the world,

227
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,720
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century

228
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,010
and is the work of Bruno...

229
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,300
14th century.

230
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,220
Dr. Goodhead.

231
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,810
I can only hope your presence
here is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.

232
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,020
- I dislike being spied on.
- Well, don't we all?

233
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,610
You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?

234
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,940
- Yes. How did you know?
- Well, I like to keep abreast of things.

235
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,280
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?

236
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm addressing a seminar of the
European Space Commission.

237
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,870
My, heavy stuff.

238
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,080
But there again, I keep
forgetting that you are

239
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,870
more than just a very beautiful woman.

240
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,130
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.

241
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,130
I have more important things on my mind.

242
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,300
That's what I'd like to talk to you about.

243
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,260
- Dinner this evening?
- This evening I'm giving my address.

244
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,720
Well, then, can you think of reason
why we don't have a drink afterwards?

245
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,560
Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.

246
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,270
Franco.

247
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,410
Play it again, Sam.

248
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,360
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Convalescing.

249
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,150
Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.

250
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,990
And you think I had
something to do with it?

251
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,740
Well, the thought had
flashed across my mind.

252
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,330
- What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

253
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,710
- You leaving me your telephone number?
- I don't see the point.

254
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,760
Now I do.

255
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,470
Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.

256
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,230
James, why don't you pour yourself a drink?

257
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,900
Thank you.

258
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
Daily diary.

259
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,160
Fairly deadly diary.

260
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,580
Bollinger. If it's '69,
you were expecting me.

261
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,480
Trifle overpowering, your scent.

262
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,820
Standard CIA equipment.

263
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,700
And the CIA placed you with Drax, correct?

264
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,460
- Very astute of you, James.
- Oh, not really.

265
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,540
I have friends in low places.

266
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,380
Could this possibly be the moment
for us to pool our resources?

267
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,880
It could have its compensations.

268
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,730
Where are you planning on going from here?

269
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,570
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

270
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,740
Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly. We
would be better off working together.

271
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,830
- Detente?
- Agreed.

272
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,710
- Understanding?
- Possibly.

273
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,790
- Cooperation?
- Maybe.

274
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,090
- Trust?
- Out of the question.

275
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,630
Send the night porter up for
my bags immediately, please.

276
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,340
I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.

277
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,060
007 doesn't usually push the panic
button unless it's something serious.

278
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,430
- I should hope not.
- Good morning, Inspector.

279
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,140
- Good morning.
- I see you've covered everything

280
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,810
- with our Italian friends.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,410
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,460
Gas masks?

283
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,590
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.

284
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,790
Frederick Gray. What a surprise.

285
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:06,380
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.

286
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,130
You must excuse me,
gentlemen, not being English,

287
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:14,300
I sometimes find your sense of
humor rather difficult to follow.

288
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,390
On behalf of the British
government, I apologize.

289
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,650
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.

290
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,940
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

291
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,320
Your man should be taken
off the assignment.

292
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,450
I'll see you at the consulate.

293
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,620
I'll have to do what he says.

294
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,460
Well, before you do that, sir,
have Q do an analysis of this.

295
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,580
I took it from the laboratory.

296
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,250
Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.

297
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,840
So, there was a laboratory.

298
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,930
You better take two weeks
leave of absence, 007.

299
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,470
Do have any thoughts about
where you might go?

300
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,560
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.

301
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,520
I think I can recall your mentioning it.

302
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:15,400
007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.

303
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,950
Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.

304
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,500
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise

305
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,750
is to be rerouted as from today.

306
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,670
Now, regarding a replacement for Cha,

307
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,880
do you have someone in mind?

308
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,390
Oh, yes, well, if you
can get him, of course.

309
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:45,930
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro
now boarding, gate number seven.

310
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,550
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.

311
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,810
- The President Suite.
- Really?

312
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,730
Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.

313
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,500
- Do you come with the suite?
- It depends who's renting it.

314
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,250
Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.

315
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,590
Why were you following me from the airport?

316
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,050
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.

317
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,220
I work for Station VH. We have
been asked to assist you.

318
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,680
M thinks of everything.

319
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:54,140
Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?

320
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,980
C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.

321
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,190
They are very big importers in Rio.

322
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,200
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.

323
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,370
They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.

324
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,580
I'd like to pay it a
discreet visit tonight.

325
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,120
Tonight? I think you may find
that a little difficult.

326
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:18,750
Difficult or not, it's
something we have to do.

327
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,210
And meanwhile,

328
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,970
how do you kill five hours
in Rio if you don't samba?

329
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,960
- There's the warehouse.
- And not a soul about.

330
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,540
- I think there's a way around the back.
- Good thinking.

331
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,540
This is it.

332
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,670
Don't talk to any strange men.
I'll be back.

333
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:35,800
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.

334
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:39,100
I did tell you not to
talk to any strange men.

335
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,640
- Did you find anything in there?
- Only this.

336
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,020
"Drax Air Freight."

337
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,560
Do you know which airport
they operate from?

338
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:52,030
Yes. San Pietro. Do you
want me to take you there?

339
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,820
No, I think you need some rest.

340
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,660
- Come on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

341
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:32,420
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- The face is familiar, as is the manner.

342
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,260
It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.

343
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,170
Well, that was before you walked out on me.

344
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,220
Yes, nearly tripping over your
suitcase on the way through the door.

345
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,590
So?

346
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,600
So why waste time working
against each other?

347
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,980
I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.

348
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,480
That's no surprise. Since I've been here,

349
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,940
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.

350
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,320
- Yes. He's moving out.
- Where to?

351
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,450
That's what we're going to find out,

352
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,870
now that we're working together.

353
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:13,580
- I still don't know if I trust you.
- I don't know if I trust you either.

354
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,090
That's what makes it more
exciting, doesn't it?

355
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:53,960
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

356
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,920
But I'm sure we're better off out than in.

357
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,590
Bring that chain.

358
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,950
- Hang on, James.
- The thought had occurred to me.

359
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,040
I might have guessed.

360
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,580
- Do you know him?
- Not socially.

361
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,170
His name's Jaws. He kills people.

362
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,070
Here, give me the chain.

363
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,000
Come on. Hang on to me.

364
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,960
Jump.

365
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,780
- Have you broken something?
- Only my tailor's heart.

366
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,950
- What was that for?
- For saving my life.

367
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,290
Remind me to do it more often.

368
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,720
Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.

369
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,790
Sorry about that.

370
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,160
James! You look as though you've
just fallen off a mountain.

371
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,620
Well, it's funny you should
say that, Moneypenny.

372
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,460
As a matter of fact, I was
in a cable car and...

373
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,250
- Never mind.
- The other courtyard.

374
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,800
- There you are, 007.
- Balls, Q?

375
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,760
Bolas, 007.

376
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,650
- Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
- Yes, sir.

377
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:46,610
- Where's M?
- He's in the office over there.

378
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,340
This way.

379
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,670
- Good morning, 007.
- Good morning, sir.

380
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,470
- You're just in time. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

381
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,970
- Q's come up with something.
- Splendid.

382
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:16,190
- Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
- Afraid not. Right, Q.

383
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,190
Well, it's a breakdown on that phial
of liquid you picked up in Venice.

384
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:23,110
- You know, you seem to be right, 007.
- Thank you.

385
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:28,030
It's a highly toxic nerve gas that
appears to have no effect on animals.

386
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,330
May I see the formula?

387
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,420
It's a chemical formula of a plant.

388
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:47,720
Orchideae anegra. A very
rare orchid indeed.

389
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,090
Yes. It was thought to be extinct.

390
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:54,220
Until a missionary brought one back
from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.

391
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:57,270
Well, actually he brought it back
from the area of the River Tapirape.

392
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:01,270
Well done, James. You better
get up there and fast.

393
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,440
And I've got something to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted to look after it.

394
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:16,680
Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts
to plan an amusing death for you.

395
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,400
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

396
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,570
Why did you break off the
encounter with my pet python?

397
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:25,190
I discovered he had a crush on me.

398
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,320
Jaws.

399
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:42,380
Moonraker One on preset launch
program, minus two minutes.

400
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,840
Retract crew access arm.

401
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,260
CAA retracted.

402
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,090
- Transfer orbiter power.
- Internal power transferred.

403
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,050
Activate hydraulics.

404
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,890
- Hydraulics activated.
- Activate auxiliary power unit.

405
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:01,060
- APU activated.
- LH2 replenish.

406
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:05,270
- Status confirmed.
- Pressurize MPS helium tanks.

407
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,990
Helium flight pressure confirmed.

408
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,490
What exactly are you up to here, Drax?

409
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:16,490
- And why the orchids?
- The curse of a civilization.

410
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,500
It was neither war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race

411
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:23,000
who built the great city lying around us.

412
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,420
It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.

413
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:31,050
Because long-term exposure to
its pollen caused sterility.

414
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,430
Correct, Mr. Bond.

415
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:37,260
As you discovered, I have
improved upon sterility.

416
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,940
Those same seeds now yield death.

417
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:46,690
Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.

418
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:49,400
Moonraker launch program now commencing.

419
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:50,990
Minus 20 seconds.

420
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:54,530
- SRB gimbal profile.
- Activated.

421
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,870
- Cooling pumps.
- On.

422
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,790
- IMU to inertial.
- IMU confirmed.

423
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,000
Moonraker One, liftoff.

424
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,300
We have liftoff.

425
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:17,050
Moonraker Two, T minus ten,
nine, eight, seven, six,

426
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:23,020
five, four, three, two, one.

427
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,270
Main engine start.

428
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,230
Moonraker Two, liftoff.

429
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:36,120
- Moonraker Three.
- Moonraker Three, liftoff.

430
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,990
- Moonraker Two, confirm program pitch.
- PP confirmed.

431
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,580
Moonraker Four on preset launch program.

432
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,620
Moonraker Four, liftoff.

433
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,500
Moonraker One, SRB jettison.

434
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,840
We have separation. Confirmed.

435
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,010
Moonraker Three, confirm program pitch.

436
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,220
Moonraker Five, on preset launch program.

437
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,600
- Minus ten...
- Drax, one more thing.

438
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,270
You delivered a shuttle to the U.S.
government,

439
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:08,150
then you hijacked it. Why?

440
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,980
Because I needed it.

441
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:16,360
One of my own Moonrakers developed
a fault during assembly.

442
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,990
Now, you have distracted me enough.

443
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:24,460
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim.

444
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,290
Place him where he can
be assured of warmth.

445
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,960
- Confirmed.
- Moonraker Two, go for orbit.

446
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:33,010
Velocity, 1,000 feet per second.

447
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:35,970
- All systems...
- SRB jettison.

448
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:38,550
Separation motors fired.

449
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:43,350
Moonraker Five, cleared for launch.

450
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,610
James.

451
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:04,910
Thank God, you're safe.

452
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,920
Moonraker Five, transfer orbiter power.

453
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:25,640
Hydraulics activated.

454
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:29,980
- Activate auxiliary power unit.
- APU activated.

455
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:32,730
- LH2 replenish.
- Confirm.

456
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,110
Even in death, my munificence is boundless.

457
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,570
When this rocket lifts off,

458
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,820
I shall be leaving you in
your own private crematorium.

459
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:46,790
Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead, I bid you farewell.

460
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,630
- EPS, power on.
- EPS, power confirmed.

461
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,720
Come on, the air vent.

462
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,560
Fuel tanks go, and go.

463
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:15,690
Moonraker Five, preset.

464
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,280
External LH2 pressure.

465
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,160
- Retract crew access arm.
- CAA retracted.

466
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,700
Get back quick.

467
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,500
T minus ten seconds, nine,

468
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,050
seven,

469
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:40,590
- six, five, four...
- Bang on time.

470
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,680
- Four, three, two...
- Come on, quick.

471
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,470
Straight on.

472
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:04,160
Moonraker Six, astro-technicians
prepare to embark.

473
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:12,000
I repeat, Moonraker Six
astro-technicians, prepare to embark.

474
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,340
- Moonraker Five crew.
- All systems go.

475
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,850
Moonraker Six, start launch sequence.

476
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,060
- Go for orbit.
- Confirm.

477
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,980
We have separation.

478
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:41,280
Moonraker Five ground crew stand down.

479
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,780
Thrust 6.8 million pounds.

480
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:04,170
We're going the wrong way.

481
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:14,730
Moonraker Six, preset
launch program completed.

482
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:17,600
Pilots proceed from base to launch area.

483
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:34,040
Shuttle go. Boosters go.

484
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,250
Launch pad go.

485
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:41,670
- External LO2 pressure?
- Confirmed, 21 psia.

486
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:47,090
- External LH2 pressure?
- Confirmed, 42.5 psia.

487
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:49,890
- IECF to internal power.
- CAA retracted.

488
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:53,850
Moonraker Six cleared for launch.
T minus 10 seconds.

489
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:59,730
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

490
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:03,110
three, two, one, go.

491
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:06,740
It's all right. We're on a
prearranged flight program.

492
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,290
That's Drax in Moonraker Five.

493
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,520
- What about the others?
- I don't know. Let's see.

494
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,810
We're all on parallel courses.

495
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,730
So, we must be headed for
a rendezvous in orbit.

496
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,700
Let's see what cargo we have.

497
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:29,710
- The animals went in two by two.
- What do you mean by that?

498
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,220
Noah's Ark. This operation.

499
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,620
We're converging.

500
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,170
- Control rockets?
- Yes, we're slowing down.

501
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,850
What's that?

502
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,510
There's no image on the radar scanner.

503
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:15,240
An entire city in space and still
nothing on the radar scanner.

504
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,320
- So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
- Right.

505
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:24,080
Drax must have a radar-jamming system.

506
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:29,830
All Moonrakers prepare to
initiate docking procedures

507
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,090
and continue radio silence.

508
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:02,370
Moonraker Six, you are now in manual.
Initiate docking sequence.

509
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,390
All shuttles now docked. Execute
station activation procedure.

510
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:59,070
Gravity, normal conditions.
Life-support system, nominal.

511
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:05,490
Moonraker Six technicians,
commence operational sequence.

512
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,870
- Sequence four initiated.
- Check airlock seals.

513
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,910
ALS secure.

514
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,550
All personnel to Command satellite.

515
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,760
All personnel to Command satellite.

516
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,010
All crews to M5 segment.

517
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:34,810
Moonraker Six technicians to M2 segment.

518
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:38,190
Moonraker One and Three to M1 segment.

519
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:42,860
Moonraker Four and Five to M4 segment.

520
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:46,030
Moonraker Two to M5 segment.

521
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:51,280
Units four and seven,
man console as planned.

522
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:56,540
Units one, three, five and six,
assume pre-assigned stations.

523
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,920
- Pressure on-line?
- Confirmed.

524
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,880
- Life support?
- Normal.

525
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:09,970
Those are the globes I saw in Venice
with the nerve gas phials inside.

526
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:19,480
First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.

527
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:24,230
Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens

528
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,400
will be created a new super-race,

529
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:32,160
a race of perfect physical specimens.

530
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:37,250
You have been selected as
its progenitors, like gods.

531
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:42,290
Your offspring will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.

532
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:47,050
You have all served in humble
capacities in my terrestrial empire.

533
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,260
Your seed, like yourselves,

534
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:55,310
will pay deference to the ultimate
dynasty which I alone have created.

535
01:40:55,390 --> 01:41:00,230
From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up

536
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:05,860
and know that there is law
and order in the heavens.

537
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,240
All units, start Operation Orchid.

538
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,160
If we were visible from
Earth, they'd investigate.

539
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:22,170
Where do you suppose that
radar-jamming system is?

540
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:26,170
We didn't pass anything on the
way here, so let's try this way.

541
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,510
Station two, check coordinates, mode four.

542
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:35,640
Initiate globe launch timing sequence.

543
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:38,890
Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.

544
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,590
This is it, the radar-jamming system.

545
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:14,340
- Coordinate conversion program.
- Check.

546
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:17,930
- Side lobe gain.
- Check.

547
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,730
- Spectral response.
- Check.

548
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:26,860
- Spin stabilizer correction factor.
- Okay.

549
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,280
Gigahertz reflector efficiency.

550
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,450
Solar photon screen.

551
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:57,390
Where did you learn to
fight like that? NASA?

552
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:58,850
No, Vassar.

553
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,610
- Switched off?
- Permanently.

554
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:13,030
Now we can be spotted from Earth.

555
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:21,580
- This doesn't look good at all.
- It's over 200 meters in diameter.

556
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:24,080
Yes, yes.

557
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,380
Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.

558
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:32,550
Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?

559
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:36,380
We've taken action already. We're
sending up a vehicle to intercept.

560
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:40,100
Very well, but if we don't hear
from you in the next 12 hours

561
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,850
we take action ourselves and hold you
responsible for the consequences.

562
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:47,900
We'll be in touch, General.

563
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:51,020
- Sorry to have woken you.
- I was already awake.

564
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:56,400
How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.

565
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:59,410
Problems, problems.

566
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,950
Marine astronauts to launch pad.

567
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:16,380
- Launch pre-program complete, sir.
- Launch globe number one.

568
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:17,570
T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.

569
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:24,950
There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.

570
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:29,080
Well?

571
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:32,380
Jamming power supply and
backup have failed, sir.

572
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:36,340
- Investigate immediately.
- Investigate number 28, immediately.

573
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,630
James Bond.

574
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:45,970
You appear with the tedious
inevitability of an unloved season.

575
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,850
I didn't think there were
any seasons in space.

576
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:52,400
As far as you're concerned, only winter.

577
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,480
And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.

578
01:45:55,570 --> 01:46:00,320
Despite your efforts, my finely wrought
dream approaches its fulfillment.

579
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,070
Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare
it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.

580
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,290
You think not? We shall see.

581
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:10,870
We're coming up to second launch position.

582
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,920
Launch globe number two.

583
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:28,640
No doubt you have realized the
splendor of my conception.

584
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:32,270
First, a necklace of death about the Earth.

585
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:38,320
50 globes, each releasing its
nerve gas over a designated area,

586
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:42,450
each capable of killing 100 million people.

587
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:48,240
And the human race as you
know it will cease to exist.

588
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:52,960
Then a rebirth, a new world.

589
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,750
U.S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.

590
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:01,210
Activate laser. Prepare
to destroy spacecraft.

591
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:20,570
You see, my dear Bond, we're well able to
protect ourselves against all enemies.

592
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:27,870
Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.

593
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:33,000
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.

594
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,340
And you, Dr. Goodhead.

595
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:44,130
Your desire to be America's
first woman in space

596
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,180
will shortly be fulfilled.

597
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:51,680
Leaving you on your flying stud farm,
conceiving your new master race?

598
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,980
If you like, yes.

599
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:59,440
And of course, anyone not measuring up
to your standards of physical perfection

600
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,440
- will be exterminated.
- Certainly.

601
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,700
Interesting.

602
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,160
Most interesting.

603
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,290
Jaws, expel them.

604
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,460
Jaws! You obey me!

605
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,140
Expel them!

606
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:43,360
Hold them!

607
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:49,820
Sir, U.S. spacecraft, three
minutes to intercept.

608
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:52,330
Stand by to laser it.

609
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:04,840
- Initiate firing sequence.
- Initiating.

610
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:09,340
U.S. spacecraft in laser
range, 25.5 and closing.

611
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,260
Range 15.

612
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:13,680
Range 10.

613
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,020
Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...

614
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,210
It's stopped rotating.

615
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,380
Open the cargo doors.

616
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:35,510
Number one platoon, EVA.

617
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,600
Number one platoon, EVA.

618
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,610
Let's try docking.

619
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,320
Colonel Scott will take the first landing!

620
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:18,530
Intruders have docked at
satellite seven, sir.

621
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:22,200
Double the guard at every
entrance in this satellite.

622
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:25,120
Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.

623
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:27,410
Number three globe ready
for launching, sir.

624
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,540
Proceed!

625
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:42,760
Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.

626
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:53,230
- Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
- Hold your fire.

627
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:58,820
Corridor five penetrated. Intruders
advancing on Command satellite.

628
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,280
Maintenance crew needed, section three.

629
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:12,350
At least I shall have the pleasure
of putting you out of my misery.

630
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,190
Desolated, Mr. Bond?

631
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:23,410
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.

632
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:26,950
Allow me.

633
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,460
Take a giant step for mankind.

634
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,720
- Where's Drax?
- He had to fly.

635
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,560
How's Scott doing?

636
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,810
He's got control of the Command satellite.

637
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:56,230
We put the launching gear for
the globes out of action.

638
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:59,690
When the station breaks up, they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.

639
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,820
But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.

640
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:04,240
Those three must be destroyed.

641
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:17,540
Come on!

642
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:26,720
Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.

643
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,850
Your mission is completed.

644
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:31,600
Sergeant, round up your men, get
them back to the shuttle. Fast!

645
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,980
Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!

646
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:02,670
Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.

647
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,220
We can track those globes and destroy them.

648
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,760
It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.

649
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,640
All right, let's go.

650
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,860
Docking release system is jammed.

651
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:34,560
Release the door lock. I'll see
if I can operate it manually.

652
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:36,220
It's jammed too.

653
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:53,240
Well, here's to us.

654
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:13,050
Jaws, we can't disengage. The
docking release system is jammed.

655
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:15,100
Can you help us?

656
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:41,000
We're free.

657
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:00,430
Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.

658
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,100
Let's get a read-out on those globes.

659
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:28,790
I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.

660
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:38,890
There it is.

661
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:46,650
The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.

662
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:03,950
One down, two to go.

663
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:09,840
Number two straight ahead.

664
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:18,140
What is it?

665
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,470
We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.

666
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,850
In range.

667
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:36,360
- We should see the last one soon.
- There it is.

668
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,120
- It's getting hot.
- It can't be helped.

669
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:52,170
I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I
should in order to catch that last globe.

670
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:04,430
I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.

671
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,220
Just a few seconds more.

672
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:21,320
Automatic firing system negative. Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.

673
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,340
Controls aren't responding.

674
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:44,970
- The wings are beginning to glow.
- Just hold her steady.

675
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:48,600
Steady.

676
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:07,580
It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.

677
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,250
Steady.

678
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:34,810
Colonel Scott reports picking up two
survivors from the space station,

679
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,020
a tall man and a short blonde woman.

680
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:39,820
Right. Okay.

681
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,490
Dr. Goodhead reported their
position 20 minutes ago.

682
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:45,700
They're just coming into range of our
tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.

683
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,240
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes

684
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:48,990
from the remote onboard TV monitors.

685
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:57,420
Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. Houston calling.
Confirm your position.

686
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:06,640
As this is the first joint venture
between our two countries,

687
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:10,640
I'm having it patched directly to the
White House and Buckingham Palace.

688
02:03:10,730 --> 02:03:13,690
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.

689
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:16,190
- We have audiovisual.
- At last.

690
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:30,200
- 007.
- My God, what's Bond doing?

691
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:32,910
I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.

692
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:49,600
- James?
- I think it may be time to go home.

693
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:53,060
Take me round the world one more time.

694
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:55,140
Why not?
