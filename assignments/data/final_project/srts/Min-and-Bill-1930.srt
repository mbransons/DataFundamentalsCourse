1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,876
All right. Pack her up there.

3
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,409
Hey, Sandy,
Put on a straight line, will ya.

4
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:41,705
Come on, Alec, get off that lard.
What do you think this is?

5
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,566
Cover your exit, will ya?

6
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:48,784
Come on Alec, get those hatches off.

7
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,410
Come on, let's get to moving.

8
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,415
That's a mighty haul of fish, Captain.

9
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,423
Yeah, the tuna are running outside.

10
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,192
We're ready. Let it go.

11
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,812
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Min.

12
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:17,721
Hello.

13
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:20,102
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hello, Min.

14
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:22,568
- How's everything?
- Fine. Had a great trip.

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,000
- That's fine. Where's Bill?
- He's over here.

16
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:39,697
Hello, Bill.

17
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,750
- Hello, Min, how are you?
- Right in the pink.

18
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,061
- Say, Min.
- What?

19
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,158
- I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?

20
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,388
- 6 bottles of vodka.
- Vodka?

21
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,675
You've drunken vodka?

22
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:54,972
I've drunk everything
from bug juice to rotgut.

23
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:59,535
I got it off a fellow
outside the 12 mile limit.

24
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,861
- Ivan Novich. You know him.
- Oh the Russian.

25
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:02,907
Yeah.

26
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,732
How much is it gonna set me back?

27
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,938
$10 for the 6 bottles.

28
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,003
- TEN BUCKS?
- Yes.

29
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,660
I'd kill a Russian for ten bucks.

30
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:12,221
Ten bucks, why?

31
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:17,256
Why don't you go 50/50?
You'll swill most of it down.

32
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:19,453
Now ain't that gratitude?

33
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,994
After me boarding with you for years
and paying my rent every week.

34
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,421
Well, you ain't sore, are you, Bill?

35
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:31,912
Yeah. Well no, I'm not so sore now.

36
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,140
You go up to the hotel.

37
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,901
I'll be up in a minute and
we'll crack one of those bottles.

38
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:43,366
- You old hooliver.
- I'll be right up.

39
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,901
Brush up on your minute tour gulf.

40
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,269
Come on, let's get these fish
off of here.

41
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,343
What do you think this is,
a holiday, Alec?

42
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,919
- Come on, gang, I'll see you later.
- Okay, Min.

43
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:39,245
- Hey, where's Nancy?
- She's upstairs.

44
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:40,477
Weird.

45
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:46,461
- Hey, Nancy?
- I'm coming.

46
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,092
Why do you always hang around
upstairs for?

47
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,776
They're fumigating the bed.

48
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:53,549
Fumigating the bed again.

49
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,303
Min, a couple things.

50
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,100
That cop was here again.

51
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:01,403
You can go belly-aching around
after all I done for you?

52
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,605
Honestly, I didn't see.

53
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,628
I told them you've always
been good to me.

54
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,712
Yeah, now cut out the applesauce.

55
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:09,983
Just what did you say?

56
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:14,281
Well, I told them that my mother
I left me here when I was a baby.

57
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,706
And that you'd brought me up.

58
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,468
And I helped you with the work.

59
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:20,371
- That you've always been good to me.
- Oh that's all right.

60
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,539
Did they say anything about
taking you away from me?

61
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,612
Yes, he did.

62
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,337
Well?

63
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,352
What did you say?

64
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:34,840
I said I couldn't stand
to be taken away from you.

65
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:36,477
You ain't lying?

66
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,460
Honest, Min, I ain't. I swear it.

67
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:40,852
Yes.

68
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,900
Oh well, go on.
Take that fish in the kitchen.

69
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,903
Hey!

70
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,363
He didn't say nothing about
coming back, did he?

71
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,667
I said he didn't say
nothing about coming back.

72
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:53,897
Oh no. No.

73
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,998
All right, get out of here.
Go on, go on.

74
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,168
Well, Nancy.
Ain't you gonna say hello to me?

75
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,817
What for, Alec?

76
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,571
Any mail for me?

77
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,353
Not a chance.

78
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,071
That blonde forgot about you long ago.

79
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:41,672
Maybe I could do with a
brunette for a change..

80
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,652
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:46,382
Did you miss me?

82
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:47,807
Who are you kidding?

83
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:49,983
- Nobody.
- Oh yeah?

84
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,631
Come on, Nancy, don't be stingy.

85
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:54,462
Let me go. I've got work to do.

86
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,727
What was he saying to you?

87
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,294
Oh. He was only kidding.

88
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,193
Alec's like that.

89
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,274
Aw, he didn't mean nothing.

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,828
Sticking up for him, huh?

91
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,419
I want to tell you something.

92
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,864
Any time he comes here and
he says to you...

93
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,967
Hey Min! Come on out here.
I'm wait for a shave.

94
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,821
Go on. Finish your work.

95
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,551
Come on, Min. Will ya?

96
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,381
Come on, quit your poking around.

97
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,357
I want to get a shave. Get out here.

98
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,104
Oh yes.

99
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:04,000
What's eating on you?

100
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,113
Fleas.

101
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,314
Besides that?

102
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,567
Well... Alec's been
making eyes at Nancy.

103
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,748
The way you worry about her,
you'd think she's your own kid.

104
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,157
Sometimes I wish she was.

105
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,189
Don't go feeling sorry for yourself.

106
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:35,427
So you give me a pain in the neck.

107
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:37,912
Yeah, you ain't so hot yourself.

108
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,554
When I was young,
I used to make them sizzle.

109
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:51,734
Back in the Civil War days,
they were not so particular.

110
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,267
What's that about the Civil War days?

111
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,740
Aw, Min!

112
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:05,046
Did you ever hear the story about
the old Civil War veteran?

113
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:07,797
Yes. Now pike pike now
when I was a kid.

114
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:17,620
You get out of here!

115
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,104
All ears.

116
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,872
- Say, uh-
- I don't want to hear it now.

117
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,920
Hey handsome, how are you?

118
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,384
Well, how are you?

119
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:43,851
I'm fine.

120
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,918
Hey, there.

121
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,276
What are you doing up there?
Cut that out!

122
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,934
You don't you watch what you're doing?

123
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,170
Aw, gee, I didn't do it on purpose.

124
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,813
Oh no. Of course not.

125
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,279
Hey, you ain't so special.
I oughta give you my bucket too.

126
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,673
Yeah, you do and you'll be sorry.

127
00:09:58,697 --> 00:09:59,996
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

128
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:03,128
Any more gab out of you
and I'll have a go.

129
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,141
Hey, what's the matter?
What's the problem? What's wrong?

130
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,012
- He's a liar.
- Who's a liar? Why?

131
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:11,287
I just dumped some trash overboard
and he said I did it on purpose.

132
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:14,024
You can't call her no liar.
I won't let you.

133
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,825
She just threw a bucket at me.

134
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,705
I did not.

135
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,868
If you don't like it around here,
you get out! See?

136
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,349
I'm running a decent joint.

137
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,767
I don't go for you boys
chasing around here at all.

138
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,074
Get out of here! Now go.

139
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,284
Min, what's the matter?

140
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:30,486
He calls her a liar. He insults me.
I want him off the place.

141
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,833
Calm down. Listen.

142
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,627
That's old man Cameron's son.

143
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,506
He runs the cannery
over there where I work.

144
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:38,164
I don't give an abalone
if he runs the jail.

145
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:41,335
And he can't park his putt putt
under my pylons either.

146
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,617
- Hey, where are you going now?
- None of your business.

147
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:46,218
Paying my taxes around here.

148
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,227
I ain't gonna have nobody tell me
what I'm going to do.

149
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:51,228
Don't touch that water.
You'll get in trouble!

150
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,663
I pay my taxes.

151
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,147
What are you doing in that boat?

152
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,784
I'll gonna get this bucket.

153
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,273
Get the bucket and come on out!

154
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,898
Come out right now.

155
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:01,603
I don't want anybody hanging around-

156
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,152
Hey, stop it.

157
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,707
Stop that motor.

158
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:09,937
Help!

159
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:11,439
Stop!

160
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,237
Bill!

161
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:28,430
Bill!

162
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,720
Help!!

163
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,825
Bill! Bill!

164
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:03,333
You're trying to kill me.

165
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,917
Rats! I'm dead.

166
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,826
Hey, give us more speed!

167
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,248
Help!

168
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,561
Help!

169
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,460
- Hello, Min.
- Hello, Bill.

170
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,911
How are you feeling now?

171
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,118
Feeling?

172
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,949
I ain't got no feeling.
I'm numb all over.

173
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,315
My neck is broke.

174
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,079
- Your neck?
- Yeah, my neck.

175
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,780
- Let me get my big paws on it.
- Wait a minute.

176
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,595
- I won't hurt you, Min.
- Well be careful.

177
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:15,766
I'll be careful. You just hold still.
Let me get a hold of you.

178
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,871
Is that all right now?

179
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:25,538
Ow, you got your big
thing in my spherix!

180
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,436
That's all right? How is your spine?

181
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:30,537
My spine.
It's never been better in this life.

182
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,251
- Oh Bill, wait a minute.
- I'm waiting now.

183
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,082
Come on, I'm fine.

184
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:40,030
- I'm fine, Bill.
- Fix it all right?

185
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,631
Yeah, you'll fix it. Yeah, I'm fine.

186
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:45,405
Cut the cards and
I'll tell your fortune.

187
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:46,902
I'm fixed all right.

188
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,574
I had a dream last night.

189
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,714
About me, Min?

190
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,684
No, about a canary flying
in the window.

191
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,120
- Oh you did.
- Yes I did.

192
00:14:56,928 --> 00:15:00,503
Look it there. See all them spades.

193
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,864
I tell you there's nothing
but trouble around here.

194
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:03,965
- Hey Min!
- What is it?

195
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:04,873
The cops!

196
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,693
The cops? What do they want?

197
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:08,794
- They are for me.
- For you?

198
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,907
They'll get your over my dead body.

199
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,861
Min, pull in your horns. Cops is cops.

200
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,662
Cops or no cops, they're not
gonna take the kid away from me.

201
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,020
Bill, I'm scared.

202
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,799
Come out with me.

203
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,210
What do you want?

204
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,180
Groot's my name. I'm a truant officer.

205
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,252
How long have you had this girl?

206
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:44,452
Ever since she was six months old.

207
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,147
Where did you get her?

208
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,768
Her mother left her here.

209
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,175
Where is her mother now?

210
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,545
How do I know?
She kicked the bucket.

211
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:59,435
Reports come in this girl
is terribly overworked.

212
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:02,036
She don't work any harder
than anyone else.

213
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,248
That's the gospel truth I don't.

214
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:08,776
The cook gets up at 4 o'clock.
But I don't get up until 5.

215
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,029
I suppose you finish your work
about 9 o'clock at night.

216
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,593
Sure I do. Sometimes 8:30.

217
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:18,005
Oh. Of course. Or course.

218
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:22,419
Well, that's why you don't go to school.

219
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,651
I won't go back to school.

220
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,415
I hate those stuck-up kids.

221
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,440
They give me a pain in the neck.

222
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,431
You've been kept from school.

223
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,858
Come on, tell me the truth!
Don't be afraid!

224
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,099
You think I'd tell a lie to a cop?

225
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,263
Shut up and answer this guy
as if he was a gentleman.

226
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:41,788
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,976
A young girl like you needs schooling.

228
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,355
A nicer environment.

229
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:48,297
Discipline.

230
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:49,963
You can't get that here.

231
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,148
I do too.

232
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,130
I don't walk a chalk line.

233
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,511
Min wears the life out of me.

234
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:57,794
Don't you, Min?

235
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:00,105
That's discipline, ain't it?

236
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,989
It certainly is.

237
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,592
Another complaint is that you've been
a party to the selling of liquor.

238
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,646
- You mean booze?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:11,955
You think we'd give that
bootleg stuff to the gang?

240
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,389
Why we wouldn't give that to Bill!

241
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:16,488
You've seen it around, haven't you?

242
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,112
Sometimes.

243
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,245
When some of the fellas
brings him a flask.

244
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,658
Then he breaks it over his head.

245
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,764
That's just how sore it makes him.

246
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:33,198
Say, you're not going
to take this kid away from me?

247
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,628
I think as much of her
as if she was my own kid.

248
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,813
I... who are you?

249
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,055
Perhaps you remember me?

250
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,229
I'm superintendent of Nancy's school.

251
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,328
We were very much interested
in her when she attended.

252
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:49,013
I thought now that she's going back.

253
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,538
You might let her come to our home.

254
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,237
Mrs. Southard will be very kind to her.

255
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,380
Can help a little in the household.

256
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:59,672
It will be a nice quiet
environment in which to study.

257
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,135
I don't want to go.

258
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,661
Now you shut up now.

259
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:05,538
No, she ain't going.
She's gonna stay right here with me.

260
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,268
Get that? Right re with me!

261
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:11,248
Of course, she can go to school though.

262
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,941
I don't mind if she goes to school.

263
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Now you see that she's in school
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

264
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,479
And if I have more complaints
about this place,

265
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:22,200
I'll see that it's closed up!

266
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,108
Yes, yes.

267
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,450
Gee that was a tight squeeze.

268
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,551
I'm gonna wet my whistle.

269
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,883
That was a swell lie I told
about the booze, wasn't it?

270
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:59,458
It sure was. I couldn't have
done much better myself.

271
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:04,326
Min, they can't take me from you.

272
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,748
I would just die.

273
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:08,783
Aw, cut the bull now.

274
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:11,465
Go on out in the kitchen where you
belong. Go on. Get out of here.

275
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:13,762
What does it read?

276
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:20,657
- 32.65.
- All right. Hand it over.

277
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,668
Nancy, how about a dance?

278
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:26,954
Swell.

279
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,996
Yeah, I'll take that too.

280
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,190
Hey! You get out in the kitchen
where you belong!

281
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:49,415
Go on, get out of here. Go on!

282
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,286
And Alec Johnson!

283
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:58,181
You watch your step!

284
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,777
Ohh!

285
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:08,269
You come out here and
I'll sock you in the jaw, Min.

286
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,611
Is that so?

287
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,020
Come on in here.
I'd like to see you try it.

288
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:17,477
You're a sneak. A sneaking thief.
That's what you are.

289
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,444
Gee Min, but you're a hellion.

290
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,640
Yeah.

291
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,809
I guess that's why I like you.

292
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:27,896
Is that so?

293
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,067
A bum. That's how you are.

294
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:36,617
So that's where you keep your socks.

295
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,504
You know it ain't safe.

296
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,293
Some dirty skunk might peek
through the keyhole some night.

297
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,826
Is that so?

298
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,016
Well, if he does,

299
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:51,431
I'm ready for him.

300
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:57,169
You trust me, don't you?

301
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,228
Sure I trust you. You're too dumb
to be anything but honest.

302
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:05,314
That's the same way I feel
about you, Min, too.

303
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,735
Gee, it's hot in here.
Open up a window or something.

304
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:17,140
No Bill,

305
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,717
nobody's gonna
get my hard-earned dough from me.

306
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:26,016
I've been over 40 years
saving up them dimes and nickels.

307
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:30,166
When I get enough, I'm going back
to Seattle, where I come from.

308
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,651
And I'm gonna buy myself
a sealskin cap. Mm-hm.

309
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:37,557
Yes and a new bridge
with three gold teeth in them.

310
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:42,756
- Min!
- What?

311
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,161
There's Alec with his arm
around some gal.

312
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,967
- It ain't Nanc is it?
- I think he is.

313
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,383
Don't whistle. Wait a minute.

314
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,513
Gee, it's swell out here.

315
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:08,630
You know, I love this old boat.

316
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:11,138
I used to come here when I was a kid.

317
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,214
I dreamed about going places.

318
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,349
You'll be going places before long.

319
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,038
And you won't be alone either.

320
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,509
Who's gonna take me, you?

321
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:20,674
You said it.

322
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:22,563
We'll sneak away, me and you.

323
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,041
And we'll go up to Frisco.

324
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,542
Yeah? Fat chance I've got
of getting anywhere.

325
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,812
Hey you know Nancy, you're
a lot prettier out here.

326
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,591
That's gotta stop.

327
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,975
You won't have to work
anymore if you come with me.

328
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:38,666
I know a way you can
make a lot of money.

329
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,500
Let me go.

330
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:45,179
You smell like hot steam.

331
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,498
Well? What's the idea?

332
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:50,620
You get in the house! Go on! Get!

333
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,650
Bill. Calm him down.

334
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,191
What's the idea?

335
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:03,025
Ain't Min asked you a dozen
times to let that kid alone?

336
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,228
Gee Min, I didn't do nothing.

337
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,703
Go on. Get up there. Go on.

338
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:28,147
I saw you fooling with Alec?

339
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:30,357
Oh I didn't do nothing, Min.

340
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,340
I washed dishes and
cooked stuff all day long.

341
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,787
Well, I'm crabbing about that.

342
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:37,913
Girls got to have some fun.

343
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,052
You call that fun?

344
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,882
- He didn't mean nothing by it.
- Hmm.

345
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:43,517
That's what you think.

346
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,916
I don't see why it ain't right
for me to dance and flirt

347
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,151
and have a good time like
the rest of the girls who come here.

348
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,377
- You don't?
- You don't try to stop them.

349
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,619
You tell them "Go out and dance and
have a good time in your joint."

350
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:54,667
But me.

351
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,539
Well you ain't gonna have a
say over me much longer.

352
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,523
I'll be old enough
to put makeup on and

353
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,650
dance and drink with
the gang if I want to.

354
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:06,365
- Then I'll show you.
- Yeah.

355
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,662
You'll be showing me.

356
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:10,499
That teacher and the cop was right.

357
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:14,027
This is no place for a kid like you.

358
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,531
What are you doing?

359
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,376
You're not going
to send me away, are you?

360
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,944
You're gonna live
with the school teacher.

361
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,592
Don't do it, Min.
I don't want to leave you.

362
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:49,793
- Now you stop...
- I'm sorry I made you sore.

363
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,993
Stop squawking now.
And go and pack your duds.

364
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,634
I'll be a good kid, I swear it.

365
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,065
Please don't send me away. No.

366
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,138
I want to stay here with you.

367
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:03,813
I'm sending you away because I don't
want you to make me no trouble.

368
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,257
I don't care nothing about you. Just me.

369
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,943
Go on now.
You ain't got no time to use.

370
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,229
Now we ain't got no time to lose.

371
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:14,297
Go on.

372
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:20,804
- Don't send me away.
- Now you listen to me.

373
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:22,753
No.

374
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,320
You may think she's no common kid.

375
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:29,654
Oh no.

376
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,820
Yeah, her father was a doctor
in the Northwest someplace.

377
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,493
And her mother brought her
on here when he died.

378
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,837
When she drifted in here,

379
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,835
she was dying when
she come to this place.

380
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:50,706
Well, that's all there is.

381
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:52,876
You see she ain't legally mine.

382
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:56,597
So there won't be
no papers to sign or nothing.

383
00:26:57,043 --> 00:27:01,611
But I'm just like your own kid.

384
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,665
You can't send me away.

385
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,237
Why this is a swell joint.

386
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:11,297
Gee if you can't be happy here,
you're dumber than I thought you was.

387
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:16,211
Well, that's all there is to tell.

388
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:18,696
I guess I'll beat it.

389
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,414
Min! Min! Please!

390
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,213
Go on away.

391
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,480
I got my work to do.

392
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,422
Min, please!

393
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:54,686
Hello, Nancy, how are you?

394
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,229
Fine, how are you, Captain?

395
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,620
Fine.

396
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,085
Can I fish?

397
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:04,117
Sure. Help yourself.

398
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:05,971
Gee, that's great.

399
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:11,878
So you got homesick for us, did you?

400
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,144
You're darn right, I did.

401
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,758
That's why I'm back.

402
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,092
Up easy.

403
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:19,847
Did Min say so?

404
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,246
I don't know.

405
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,906
I stopped in to see her.

406
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,652
They said she was at the grocery.

407
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,935
But she'll let me stay when I explain.

408
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,419
Yeah?

409
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:31,755
Mm-hmm.

410
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,070
That's a great fish, Nancy.

411
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:48,911
Aw, gee!

412
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,411
How did I do that?

413
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:05,210
Oh, up to your old tricks again?

414
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:06,577
Here's your cap.

415
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:09,416
What you need is a darn good spanking.

416
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,408
Is that the way you treat a lady?

417
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:14,057
You're no gentleman!

418
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,134
You big abalone.

419
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,629
What's the matter with you?

420
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,174
Come on in here!

421
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:24,695
What's the matter with you?

422
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,034
Say.

423
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,206
Say. What are you doing here?

424
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,827
Did you see what he did to me?

425
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:33,445
Yes, I did. And that's what
I ought to be doing to you.

426
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,067
What are you doing back here,
playing hooky?

427
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:36,925
I can't stand it any longer, Min.

428
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,584
I come back for good.

429
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,198
You think you come back for good.

430
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:42,848
You're gonna get right out of
here and go right back to school.

431
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:44,397
I can't go back, Min.

432
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,342
- You can't?
- No I-I-

433
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
What have you done?

434
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,165
- Uh...
- Well.

435
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,966
- I hit a girl in the eye.
- Well?

436
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,521
She called me wharf rat.

437
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:55,661
Why didn't you give her-

438
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,503
That's exactly what I did.

439
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:58,604
That isn't here or there.

440
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:00,700
You just go back to Southards
where you belong.

441
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,482
Now go on! Get out of here.

442
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:04,212
Oh Min, I can't stand it
at the Southards any longer.

443
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,078
The evenings are so quiet.

444
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:08,582
Gee, they don't ever have a fight.

445
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,567
Don't get sore.

446
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,322
It's just like a jail up there.

447
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:15,001
Well...

448
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,188
that's just what you're aiming to do.
Send me to jail.

449
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:19,168
What do you mean?

450
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,348
I mean just what I say.

451
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:22,688
If the cops don't find
you're not at school,

452
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,393
they'll take my license away.

453
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:27,676
You're just an ungrateful little brat.
That's what you are.

454
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:28,964
Trying to ruin my business.

455
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:31,260
Go on back to Southards where
you belong. Go on, on, on.

456
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:32,611
Go on now.

457
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,070
Oh but let me explain.

458
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,567
I'll explain.

459
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:39,321
Will you get out of here?

460
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,397
Go on now.

461
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,303
Please.

462
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,552
Give me just one more chance!

463
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,111
I'll give you a chance.

464
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,778
Get out of here. Go on now!

465
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,333
And I never want to see you here again!

466
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,182
Yeah.

467
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,269
He did?

468
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:21,665
That's funny.

469
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,164
Hello Min.

470
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,830
Hello, Min.

471
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,280
Hello, Bella Pringle.

472
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:34,910
What are you doing here?

473
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,779
You know what I'm doing here.

474
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,832
Come on upstairs to my room.

475
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,833
Wait a minute.

476
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:43,167
How long you been here?

477
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:44,610
About an hour.

478
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:50,898
Belle's my old friend of mine
from Seattle.

479
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,480
About 14 years since
we've seen each other.

480
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,984
Let's drink to old times.

481
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,117
You said it.

482
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,156
How long you gonna be here?

483
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:01,510
Oh I don't know.

484
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,873
Say.

485
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,291
I thought maybe I'd
look over the place.

486
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,860
And get the lay of the land.

487
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,924
Yeah. Stick around a bit.

488
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,750
Oh get you.

489
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,425
I don't mind, Bill.

490
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,361
Ain't nothing doing around here.

491
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:22,965
- Naw?
- No.

492
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,187
There's a boat going to Frisco
this afternoon.

493
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,846
Yeah?

494
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:30,384
Who says I was leaving
here this afternoon?

495
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:32,480
Come on, Bill.

496
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,857
Come on.
Show us the bottom of the bottle.

497
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:37,593
You're like a sieve, ain't you?

498
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:40,203
Belle, come on upstairs to my room.

499
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:42,746
Wait a minute. Will ya?
Wait a minute.

500
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,171
Here's to ya, big boy.

501
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,133
You ain't so bad.

502
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:48,804
I've seen worse.

503
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,187
Yeah, I've been told that before.

504
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:57,024
Hey Belle, I've got something
to tell you. Come on upstairs.

505
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:58,388
Come on.

506
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,012
Pardon me.

507
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:55,743
What are you doing here?

508
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:57,387
You know what I'm doing here.

509
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,596
- Where's my kid?
- She's dead.

510
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,322
- You're a liar!
- Who's a liar?

511
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:02,656
You're a liar.

512
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,654
She died in Fresno
five or six years ago.

513
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,014
What she die of?

514
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,283
You know she was a puny kid.

515
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:10,513
That's right.

516
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,658
- Tough luck for me, ain't it, Min?
- Yeah.

517
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:18,112
I thought that kid would take care
of me in my old age.

518
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:19,667
It's too bad.

519
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,906
Come on Bella, take off your duds

520
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:25,018
and rest a bit. You look all in.

521
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,012
- I'm a wreck.
- Yeah.

522
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:29,187
Ain't it just like a kid?

523
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:33,149
The more you do for them,
the more ungrateful they are.

524
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,731
I know. There ain't
no gratitude in the world.

525
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,176
There ain't nothing.

526
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,242
No there ain't. That's right.

527
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:42,243
- Nothing, I'm telling you.
- All right, Belle.

528
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:49,882
You just rest there a while.
You'll be all right now.

529
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,929
- Min?
- What?

530
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,692
Just one more little drink.

531
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:13,315
You'll find them in the bureau
drawer there. The last-

532
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:14,724
I'll be back in a minute.

533
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,674
Hi, baby.

534
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,558
Hello, big boy. Come on in.

535
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,347
How's chances for a little snort?

536
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:36,884
I won't be difficult.

537
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:38,327
Come on. Sit down.

538
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:39,711
Make yourself at home.

539
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,342
Here you are, kid.

540
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,339
Ma'll kill you for it.

541
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,132
What's the little thing, boy.

542
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,796
Why don't you turn
on something snappy?

543
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:52,107
That's the way I always feel when I
see a swell-looking guy like you.

544
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,668
You mean that?

545
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:56,039
And how!

546
00:36:56,103 --> 00:36:57,700
Wait, I'll turn on the phonograph.

547
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:59,417
Make it snappy, baby.

548
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:10,203
- Oh how do you do?
- How do you do?

549
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:11,494
I come to see Nancy.

550
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,990
- Won't you sit down?
- No.

551
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:16,113
I can say what I got to say standing
on my feet as well as I can sit-

552
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,359
Min!

553
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:18,762
You've came for me!

554
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:20,461
Come for you? Nothing. Oh.

555
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:21,502
- How do you do?
- Hello.

556
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,914
We're so grateful to you
for sending Nancy home.

557
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:26,415
We think she'll be much
happier here as time goes on.

558
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:27,716
Yeah I hope you're right.

559
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:29,875
- Min, I...
- Will you shut up?

560
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,039
Say, her mother left some
money for her with me.

561
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:36,312
And I got it here
and it's a big wad too.

562
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:38,137
- Really?
- Yes, it's real.

563
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:40,569
I had intended to keep it myself.

564
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:44,065
But every once in a while,
my conscience goes crazy.

565
00:37:44,091 --> 00:37:45,666
And I have to do the right thing.

566
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,573
Well anyhow...

567
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,338
when she was dying,
she says to me "Min..."

568
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:53,353
"when my Nancy grows up to be a girl,

569
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,883
I want you to see that she goes
to a young lady's school."

570
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:57,399
My mother said that?

571
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,355
Will you stop horning in?

572
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,891
When you gonna send her?

573
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,745
Now speak up quick before
you get the dough.

574
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:05,910
I know a very fine school up north.

575
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:07,602
The Westmoreland School.

576
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:09,401
A friend of mine is head of it.

577
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:10,739
That's the ticket. Here.

578
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:13,043
You see that see goes quick too.

579
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,740
Because she's never gonna get
nothing hanging around here.

580
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:17,973
Not that I give a hoop.

581
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,693
Min, you've been so kind to me.

582
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:22,930
Aw. Can the baloney, will ya?

583
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,487
- Won't you say goodbye?
- Goodbye.

584
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,600
And you see that behave yourself
the next joint you go to.

585
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,524
You come on out here.
I want to see you.

586
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:38,240
I just want to tell you.

587
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:41,843
Get that kid out of here before
24 hours or I'll take her back.

588
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:44,144
- But why?
- Never mind why. You just do it.

589
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:45,315
All right.

590
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:00,444
Why you dirty...

591
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:03,108
What kind of a drunk? Get out of here!

592
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,358
Hey Bill, wait!

593
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,135
I'll get you for that!
I'll get you someday!

594
00:39:09,136 --> 00:39:10,831
Bill, she's trying to kill me!

595
00:39:11,294 --> 00:39:13,594
Bill, help me.
Min's trying to kill me!

596
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:15,611
You filthy old wretch you.

597
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,674
You dirty old rotten louse!

598
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,291
Well.

599
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,075
That's what I'll give you.

600
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:22,995
I'll get you!

601
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,862
You come back!

602
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,018
You ain't mad at me, Min, are you?

603
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,086
No,

604
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,747
I ain't mad at you.

605
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:52,827
We just had a couple snifters.

606
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:55,518
And I got to feeling kind of wild.

607
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,104
Can’t you take a joke?

608
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,331
You stupid dummkopf!

609
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,264
Don't you talk to me.

610
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:10,135
Stop your fooling, will you, Min!

611
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,196
Oh now, Min!

612
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:20,232
Now, now, ho, Min.

613
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:22,250
No, Min. No, Min!

614
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:26,733
There goes my mother's picture!

615
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:31,151
Will you stop that?
Min, will you stop that!

616
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:34,636
Stop it, Min.

617
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:35,807
Stop what?

618
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,952
Come here. Come here!

619
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:43,294
Min, you're pulling my pants off.
Now stop that!

620
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,348
Stop this, Min.

621
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,161
Get this thing out of my eye,
will you?

622
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:52,879
Get your hands out of my-

623
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:01,818
Don't call me a dummy.

624
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,004
Stop that!

625
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,112
I'm warning you.

626
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:11,420
Stop it, will ya? Cut it out!

627
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:12,518
Cheat with me, will ya?

628
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:13,956
Hey, Min!

629
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,862
Dog gone you anyway!

630
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:19,101
Will you come here? Come here.

631
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:20,578
Come here, you prick.

632
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:22,996
Come here, you.

633
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,730
Come on out here!
Come on out here and finish this!

634
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:29,178
Go on away from here, Min.

635
00:41:29,204 --> 00:41:30,518
And let me alone, will ya?!

636
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,921
What you so quiet for, Min?

637
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:36,478
You give up?

638
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,808
Give up?

639
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:40,151
Give up nothing. You come out!

640
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,375
Aw, stop that, dear.

641
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:45,222
Stop that, will ya?

642
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,321
Stop it.

643
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,464
Come out here and take
your licks like a man.

644
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:49,611
- Come on now!
- Stop it!

645
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,208
Give me that thing, will ya?
Give me that ax.

646
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:54,077
Give me the ax
before you hurt yourself, Min!

647
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,908
- Give me!
- Give me that.

648
00:41:58,128 --> 00:41:59,588
You'll be sorry!

649
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,403
Dog gone you anyway.

650
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,920
I don't bite my arm!

651
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,008
Stop!

652
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,581
Now stop that, Min!

653
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,484
Min now mad.

654
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:24,248
Bill, you ain't hurt? Be ya?

655
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,805
Are you hurt, Bill?

656
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:29,214
Oh, gee. You made me so sore.

657
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,362
Bill!

658
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:02,626
Dear Min,

659
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:05,342
I'll be home soon.

660
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:10,062
And I do hope you
changed your mind about seeing me.

661
00:43:12,777 --> 00:43:15,580
Last Christmas they told me
you had gone away.

662
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:19,478
And the day I was leaving,
I saw you on the wharf.

663
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,152
Bill, she seen me on the wharf.

664
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:28,580
You couldn’t hide that face
of yours with a beard.

665
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:34,683
It'd break my heart if I thought I'd
done anything to hurt your feelings.

666
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:38,318
After all your kindness to me.

667
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:44,774
Do you realize it's over two years
since we've seen each other?

668
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:48,669
I'm so grown up, you wouldn't know me.

669
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:51,307
Bill, she's grown up.

670
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,682
Sure, she is. Why not?

671
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:56,583
Do remember Dick Cameron?

672
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,394
I'll tell you a secret.

673
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,688
We're coming home on the same boat.

674
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:07,434
Oh Min, he's wonderful.

675
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:12,020
I'll tell you all about him
if you'll only see me.

676
00:44:13,808 --> 00:44:16,608
- Say hello to Bill for me.
- Hello.

677
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:20,765
We're coming on the HS Alexandria.

678
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,462
With love and kisses, Nancy.

679
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,567
Bill, when does the Alexandria get in?

680
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:31,302
It docks in the morning.

681
00:44:32,606 --> 00:44:33,827
The morning.

682
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,477
Oh don't go blubbering around.

683
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:18,772
Too windy?

684
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:48,671
Let's get married
as soon as we get home.

685
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:57,385
Dick, I'd love to have Min
come to the wedding.

686
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,112
Of course we'll ask her.

687
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:00,738
But I think she'll won't come.

688
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:02,162
I do.

689
00:46:02,186 --> 00:46:03,547
If I beg her to.

690
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:05,648
She doesn't care for you
very much, does she?

691
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:06,679
Oh yes she does.

692
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:08,512
Then why doesn't she want to see you?

693
00:46:13,016 --> 00:46:14,249
I don't know.

694
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,769
But I'll see her tomorrow.

695
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,694
And I know she'll be happy
when I tell her...

696
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:25,423
What's the excitement?

697
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:28,376
I'm sorry but gentlemen are not
allowed in the ladies' cabins.

698
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:29,456
Oh.

699
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:31,222
That's a lie.

700
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,806
There is no gentleman in my stateroom.

701
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:38,831
Besides, he ain't no gentleman.

702
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:43,695
Oh, it's snooty time.

703
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:46,372
We're not good for you.

704
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:24,912
You remember Dick.

705
00:47:24,938 --> 00:47:27,599
Yes, I'm happy to see you.
How do you do?

706
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:43,211
Where's my grip? My valise.

707
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,956
- Hello Bella.
- Hello, old rigamathing.

708
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,120
What are you doing here?

709
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,962
I just thought I'd look
the old place over.

710
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:56,160
Are you coming down to the joint?

711
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:57,556
No. Not a chance.

712
00:47:57,557 --> 00:47:59,819
Aw, come on. Let bygones be bygones.

713
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,866
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Min pays.

714
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:03,913
A nice kid came in this morning.

715
00:48:03,985 --> 00:48:05,685
- She did?
- Sure, come on.

716
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,188
Come on, Bella.

717
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:14,063
You go right upstairs.

718
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,134
Hey Min.

719
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:21,039
You ain't gonna give me another sendoff
like you done a couple years ago.

720
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,365
Oh no. Everything's all right now,
Bella.

721
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:26,041
Where is that big bozo?

722
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:28,205
I don't know where he goes.

723
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:30,526
Hey, you. Come on back!

724
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:32,106
We're all friends again.

725
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:34,709
Yeah, we're all washed up, Bill.

726
00:48:34,735 --> 00:48:36,068
All right.

727
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,660
Hey, listen you.

728
00:48:37,686 --> 00:48:40,099
You never saw me before
in all your life.

729
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,643
I don't even know you.

730
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:43,477
Hi, you big hippo.

731
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,719
As far as I'm concerned,
you just stink.

732
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,767
Yeah? Yeah.

733
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,115
Aw, Min.

734
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:53,662
You can't guess who I just
saw down at the dock.

735
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,677
She had clean ears and...

736
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,553
What are you laughing, you hyena?

737
00:49:00,714 --> 00:49:02,064
Was I laughing?

738
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,474
Maybe I was thinking about
something funny.

739
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,215
Okay, Min.

740
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,412
Hey, Min?

741
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,569
Hey, what?

742
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,398
Where is that hair tonic?

743
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:38,816
You drank it.

744
00:49:39,139 --> 00:49:40,632
Oh, so I did.

745
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,960
Min, come here a minute.

746
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,599
Aw, what do you want?

747
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,830
The back of my hair needs
touching up a bit.

748
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:50,745
What it needs is a couple
of fine tooth combs.

749
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:52,997
If you find any gray hairs,
pull them out.

750
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,380
- Yeah.
- Oww!

751
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,440
If I pulled them all out,
you'd be bald as an egg.

752
00:49:57,466 --> 00:49:59,809
A bad egg. That's me all right.

753
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:09,686
What's the matter, got the dropsy?

754
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:11,366
Oh say, Bella.

755
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:13,842
I got fine tonic down
in the barbershop.

756
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:15,452
I'll bring it right up. You wait here.

757
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,022
Don't you think you'd
better see her alone?

758
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:24,048
Maybe I had.

759
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:25,512
I won't be long.

760
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,845
Min, darling.

761
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:40,130
What are you doing here?

762
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:41,875
Didn't you get my letter?

763
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:43,543
Yeah I got your letter. What of it?

764
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:46,050
Well, I wanted to tell you about...

765
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:49,478
If you want to tell me anything,
you come on in the barbershop.

766
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:50,954
Go on.

767
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:56,592
Well...

768
00:50:57,023 --> 00:50:58,565
Shoot. Get it off your chest.

769
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,504
Min, I'm going to be married.

770
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:01,863
To Dick Cameron.

771
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:03,974
And we want you
to come and live with us.

772
00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:06,607
I don't know what
you're talking about.

773
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:07,486
Listen, Min.

774
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:08,909
We're going to live in Boston.

775
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:10,497
- In Boston?
- Yes.

776
00:51:10,523 --> 00:51:13,523
He's going to have part
of his father's cannerys.

777
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:15,158
- Oh Min.
- Yeah.

778
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:17,006
We're going to have a sweet home.

779
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:21,274
With green terraces and gardens.

780
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,960
And a beautiful orchid room for you.

781
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:26,378
With windows that look
right out on the sea.

782
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,506
And I'd be at home
in a trellis in an orchid room.

783
00:51:49,924 --> 00:51:52,768
Dick's going to give you a limousine
for a wedding present.

784
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:54,225
What is lemonzine?

785
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:56,094
One of those lovely motor cars.

786
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,001
Oh, automobile.

787
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:58,255
Think of it.

788
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,351
Can't you see us?

789
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,880
You and me...

790
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:03,600
staying in a home
with our noses in the air.

791
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:05,891
Oh it's just like a dream.

792
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,473
A dream... Say.

793
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:11,393
Now I want you to get this right
under your bonnet.

794
00:52:11,603 --> 00:52:13,773
I ain't gonna never leave this joint.

795
00:52:13,774 --> 00:52:15,833
And I ain't never gonna live on charity.

796
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:17,935
Oh, Min.

797
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:20,182
I didn't mean it that way.

798
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:22,773
You misunderstood me.

799
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,265
Well, understand this then.

800
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,639
You go live your life and
please let me live mine!

801
00:52:28,202 --> 00:52:29,363
Charity!

802
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:31,227
But Min, Dick wants you.

803
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:34,801
Yeah? Now you go! Get out of here!

804
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,145
Ohh.

805
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,926
So it's the snooty girl
that I met on the boat, huh?

806
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,070
How do you do, dearie?

807
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:49,527
Min, you were so long
getting that hair tonic

808
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:51,395
I thought for goodness
you were drinking it.

809
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:53,744
Say, Bella,

810
00:52:53,759 --> 00:52:59,069
what do you say you and me open a real
bottle just for the sake of old times?

811
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,789
Baby, you're an elk.

812
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:02,146
That's right.

813
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:11,624
What's the matter, Nancy?

814
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,401
She never wants to see me again.

815
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:15,743
What happened?

816
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,690
I tried to tell her what
we wanted to do for her.

817
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:23,236
Oh, Dick!
She just doesn't care anymore.

818
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:26,022
That's all right, honey. I do.

819
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:28,569
We'll forget all about her.

820
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,405
Going down the coast, Bill?

821
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:51,617
Yeah, going down off Mexico.

822
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:53,987
The tuna's running down off Magdalena.

823
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:55,240
How soon you shoving off?

824
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,513
About a half hour.

825
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:07,229
Gee ain't she a pip?

826
00:54:07,255 --> 00:54:09,103
Yeah. That's Cameron's boat.

827
00:54:09,104 --> 00:54:11,745
Young Cameron is gonna get married
today. They're going east in it.

828
00:54:11,754 --> 00:54:14,185
Yes, Min was telling me.

829
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,703
She sure is a beaut.

830
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,381
Now cut them three times towards you.

831
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,277
- All right.
- That's it.

832
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:28,281
Keep your shirt on.

833
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:30,266
Yeah. Little nervous today, ain't you?

834
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:33,695
Oh there you go. Bellla?

835
00:54:33,696 --> 00:54:35,150
- Yes?
- King of diamonds!

836
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,984
- You're gonna meet a rich guy.
- Ha!

837
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:40,518
Gee, Min. You're a pain
in the eye to me.

838
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:42,771
That's over.

839
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:44,807
Yes, sir, it is.

840
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,131
- Say, Bella.
- Yes?

841
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,497
Come on back here.

842
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:49,066
You're gonna wear diamonds.

843
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:50,976
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:53,332
- Oh, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
- Mm-hm.

845
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,973
Say, Min. Where's a curling iron?

846
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:56,769
What for?

847
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,533
What do you suppose what for?
To pick my teeth with?

848
00:54:59,738 --> 00:55:01,338
I want to crimp my hair up.

849
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:04,084
In the top drawer of the
bureau there on this side.

850
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:05,085
All right.

851
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:10,289
Thinking of taking
the afternoon boat to Frisco?

852
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,119
I don't know.

853
00:55:13,149 --> 00:55:15,176
Go on, talk. I ain't deaf.

854
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,747
I can hear you from here.

855
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:20,308
Whoa, you're gonna ride in a big car.

856
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:21,949
Oh a hoist?

857
00:55:21,982 --> 00:55:25,301
Oh no, a swell car. Yours.

858
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:26,700
- Mine?
- Mm-hmm.

859
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:30,667
Gee I tell you when you get this guy,
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

860
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:33,590
- When I get him?
- Yes, it's all here in the cards.

861
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,389
Frisco is the place. I tell ya.

862
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,659
Yeah, that's a swell line, Min.

863
00:55:37,993 --> 00:55:40,031
But I ain't thinking
of getting out of here.

864
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:41,736
- No?
- No.

865
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,767
- Ain't you?
- No, I ain't.

866
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,908
I kinda like this joint.

867
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:48,572
I think I'll stick around a while.

868
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:52,269
Well, I think you're foolish.

869
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:54,280
It's all here in the cards.

870
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,461
You think so, Min?

871
00:55:58,006 --> 00:56:00,406
Gee, that must be the whistle
from the yacht, huh?

872
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:03,261
That's a fishing boat.

873
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,689
No, it ain't, Min.

874
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:07,216
I seen it this morning from the porch.

875
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,059
Alex pointed it out to me.

876
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:11,091
It belongs to the Camerons.

877
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:14,543
I hear that Cameron guy,
that young fella

878
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:17,694
is gonna get married this morning
to a girl by the name of Smith.

879
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:18,695
Oh.

880
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,306
- Ever hear of her?
- Sure.

881
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:24,155
There's a million Smiths around here.

882
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:27,062
They say she used to
hang around the waterfront.

883
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:28,147
I have never seen her.

884
00:56:28,171 --> 00:56:30,280
That's a lie, Min! And you know it.

885
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:31,504
That's my kid.

886
00:56:33,418 --> 00:56:36,229
What are you talking about,
Bella Pringle. You're crazy.

887
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,630
I ain't so crazy.

888
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:40,762
You can't make a fool of me no
longer, you dirty lying rat!

889
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:41,807
I don't know what your game is.

890
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,904
But you can't make a sucker
out of me no longer.

891
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:44,604
Now Bella!

892
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,260
You can throw me out
of your dirty old joint.

893
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:48,207
Now I'm gonna get even with you, Min.

894
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,871
For everything you ever done to me.
See?

895
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:51,897
Bella I...

896
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:55,522
I- I don't know what you mean.

897
00:56:55,577 --> 00:56:58,001
What do I mean?
I'll show you what I mean!

898
00:56:58,158 --> 00:56:59,695
I'll nail you on a cross.

899
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:02,299
You can you dirty little stuck-up brat.

900
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:18,916
Bella!

901
00:57:19,777 --> 00:57:20,947
I'll teach ya.

902
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:23,849
You don't know what you're saying.

903
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:25,358
Oh I don't, huh?

904
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:26,503
The game is over, darling.

905
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:28,908
Yes, Bella.
At the end of a long journey.

906
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,540
You're darn right they'll
be diamonds around me.

907
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,119
And I'll see that I get them too.

908
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,259
And that she'll give them to me.
Or I'll know the reason why.

909
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:36,181
Hey.

910
00:57:36,207 --> 00:57:37,424
The dirty little snob.

911
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,278
Turning up her nose against me
as if I'm not good enough for her.

912
00:57:40,312 --> 00:57:42,812
You wouldn't hurt the kid.
Aw, say, please now...

913
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:45,181
Leave me alone, will ya? A fat chance!

914
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,131
She's a swell kid.

915
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:49,063
The first break she's ever had.

916
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:52,050
Break? I'll give her a break
for hiking out on me.

917
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:54,500
- It wasn't her fault.
- Ha!

918
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:56,797
She never even knowed she had a mother.

919
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:59,677
I suppose you told her
that the stork brought her.

920
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,470
Well, I told her you was dead.

921
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,457
That's where you're out of luck,
you filthy old liar.

922
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,943
I'm gonna show you up. Both of you.

923
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:10,277
You wouldn't do that. It'd kill her.

924
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:14,955
Say, this is her first chance
to be happy and respectable.

925
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,658
Respectable? Ha ha ha!

926
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:22,084
Respectable!

927
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:26,047
So she's gonna live in a swell house
on the top of a hill, is she?

928
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,691
And she's gonna have diamonds
and servants to wait on her?

929
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:31,783
And I'm gonna be right there
to get my share, believe me.

930
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,565
I'm gonna get those diamonds
you seen in my castle.

931
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:36,605
Or I'll know the reasons why.

932
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:42,814
He's gonna have a church wedding, huh?

933
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,919
And the mother's gonna be right there
in time to kiss the blushing bride.

934
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,726
If they see you at the church...

935
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,120
Aw, dry up, will ya?

936
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:51,672
You've had your say.

937
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:00,488
Aw, don't.

938
00:59:01,224 --> 00:59:02,729
Don't look at me like that, Min.

939
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,675
I ain't afraid of ya!

940
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,162
I ain't afraid of any of ya!

941
00:59:08,972 --> 00:59:11,490
If they don't like me,
they know what they can do.

942
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:14,306
They can pay me to get rid of me.

943
00:59:14,904 --> 00:59:16,056
And plenty too.

944
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:18,634
If they don't do it, I'm gonna
yell it from the housetops.

945
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:22,276
I'm gonna stand on the corner
and I'm gonna spit at them!

946
00:59:22,494 --> 00:59:23,638
So good-bye, Min.

947
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,106
I'll point my finger
right straight at her.

948
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:28,666
And tell her who she really is.

949
00:59:28,951 --> 00:59:30,350
And what I think of her.

950
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,409
You know me, Min.

951
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:37,336
When I call a spade a spade,
nobody forgets.

952
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:42,896
Mm-hmm.

953
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:45,101
You ain't gonna leave this room.

954
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,107
No? Who's gonna stop me?

955
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,039
I'm gonna stop ya.

956
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:50,830
You ain't got the guts to do it.

957
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:53,035
You got you just where I want you.

958
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:54,298
Yeah?

959
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:56,009
Now you listen to me.

960
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,456
You, gutter rat!

961
00:59:58,644 --> 01:00:02,144
You or nobody else is gonna
ruin that kid's chances!

962
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,680
No, sir.

963
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:07,035
I loved her with all the clumsy love
that I had.

964
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:09,298
And I'm gonna tell you something.

965
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,627
She's a swell kid.

966
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,776
Clean, loyal.

967
01:00:13,802 --> 01:00:16,325
Even to an old sea cow like me.

968
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:19,195
And I'm warning you, Bella.

969
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:22,502
You ain't gonna leave the room!

970
01:00:23,761 --> 01:00:24,761
I ain't?

971
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,725
No, you ain't.

972
01:00:28,784 --> 01:00:31,184
- You mean that?
- Umm.

973
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:39,289
Gee!

974
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,639
Min!

975
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:17,584
Min!

976
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:35,837
Min.

977
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:37,423
What did you do that for?

978
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:39,046
What did you do it for?

979
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:42,493
That boat of mine is
all ready to go to Mexico.

980
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:43,851
You're going with me.

981
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:33,701
Min, come on. Let's go. Will ya, Min?

982
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,552
Bye!

983
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,703
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Nancy!

984
01:04:31,774 --> 01:04:34,574
Min, let's go, will ya, please?
Let's go, Min.

985
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:37,575
Bye!

986
01:04:37,622 --> 01:04:38,522
Come on.

987
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:40,505
What's the matter?
She ain't done nothing.

988
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:42,228
She knows. Come on!

989
01:04:42,687 --> 01:04:44,687
Aw, don't get tough with her.

990
01:04:45,305 --> 01:05:45,644
