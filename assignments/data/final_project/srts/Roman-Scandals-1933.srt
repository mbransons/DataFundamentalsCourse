1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,531
As mayor of West Rome, it gives me

3
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,881
great pleasure to welcome you.

4
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:41,710
And to introduce
our first citizen.

5
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,756
Warren Finley Cooper.

6
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:47,107
Thank you, mayor.

7
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,718
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

8
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,633
Lend me your ears.

9
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,896
You see, I know my Roman history.

10
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,856
In fact, I have humbly donated

11
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:02,948
this expensive,
magnificent temple of Roman art.

12
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:06,517
That the citizens of West Rome
may become familiar

13
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:10,130
with the citizen of historic Rome.

14
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,740
Come, ladies.

15
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,615
Now, uh, this room, ladies

16
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,182
is chiefly devoted to the period

17
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,271
in which Rome invaded Britain.

18
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,621
Over here we have
a particularly interesting..

19
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,583
- Fox.
- Yes, sir?

20
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,367
Is that your hat?

21
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,586
No, sir, I, uh..

22
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:34,066
Careless fool.

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,068
Now over here, we have..

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,898
How did that get there?

25
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,639
- You see, sir, I...
- Take it away.

26
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,250
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,134
I-I-I'll remove it at once, sir.

28
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,222
Yes, you'd better

29
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,963
before I have you removed.

30
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,184
You'll hear more about this later.

31
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,491
And over here we have the statue
of Empress Agrippa.

32
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,810
- Oh!
- Eddie!

33
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,203
Why, what's the meaning of this?

34
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,944
- You can't sleep here.
- It is a bit noisy.

35
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,164
You see, sir,
he has no place to sleep.

36
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,253
- Why you...
- It isn't his fault.

37
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,734
This is the first morning
he forget to wake me up.

38
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:36,564
The idea, using the statue
of a Roman Empress for a bed?

39
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,696
Well, it's the only statue
lying down, sir.

40
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,829
You see, I can't sleep
standing up.

41
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,700
The fellow is crazy!
Call the wagon!

42
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,746
- Yes, sir.
- You can't arrest him, Warren.

43
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,661
- It's Eddie.
- I know who it is.

44
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,639
But he has no right to be
around town doing nothing.

45
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,968
He works for everybody.

46
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,232
Just now he's helping out
in Keep's Grocery.

47
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,364
Oh, please forgive him,
Mr. Cooper.

48
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,714
He has such honest eyes.

49
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,890
Where did you get those big eyes?

50
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,414
Well, they say before I was born

51
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,981
my mother was always looking
for my father.

52
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,114
That's why my eyes are so big.

53
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,290
Oh, isn't that too bad?

54
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,727
Tell me, did she find your father?

55
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:12,643
I don't know.
I can't find my mother.

56
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,343
Oh, the poor dear. You must
forgive him, Mr. Cooper.

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,432
Well, alright.

58
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,172
Get your clothes on.
Get out of here.

59
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,050
Well, a character like Eddie
happens in every town.

60
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:31,880
He knows nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

61
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,535
Here we have a statue of
one of the last of the Caesars

62
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,580
'the Emperor Valonius.'

63
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,973
Valerius.

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,498
Valonius and don't interrupt me.

65
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,718
But Mr. Cooper, it's Valerius.
I know.

66
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:47,112
The Empress Agrippa, the one
I was sleeping with is his wife.

67
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,159
- Idiot.
- But, Mr. Cooper, he's right.

68
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,335
- It's Valerius.
- Really?

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,122
Why, of course. You were right.

70
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,689
But if I hear another word
out of you

71
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,212
I'll have you locked up.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,997
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,565
Let us proceed.

74
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,966
Well, this is the last straw!

75
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,881
No, sir,
this is my hot water bottle

76
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,709
I've been looking all over for it.

77
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,973
If you say another word,
I'll have Fox call the wagon.

78
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,193
The wagon. Yes, sir.

79
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,675
Ladies, this statue has
the most interesting history.

80
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,198
It's the Empress Silvia.

81
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,721
- Unh-unh.
- Of Gaul.

82
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,158
- Unh-unh.
- Who captured Valerius.

83
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,335
- And later married him.
- Unh-unh-unh.

84
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,381
What is the matter with you?
I suppose I'm wrong again!

85
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,731
No, no, no, no, you're right,
Mr. Cooper, except

86
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,343
it wasn't the Empress Silvia,
it was the Princess Silvia.

87
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,736
She didn't from Gaul,
she came from Britain

88
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,435
She didn't capture Valerius,
Valerius captured her

89
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,263
and didn't marry Valerius,
she married Josephus

90
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,918
and your name
is Mr. Cooper and Bob..

91
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,877
- Yes?
- The wagon.

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,232
I wanna talk with you.

93
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,714
Now, Eddie, if you wanna keep on
making deliveries for me

94
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,891
you got to stop giving
my groceries away for nothing.

95
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,372
Well, you charge it against
my salary, don't you?

96
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:16,245
Sure I do. That's why you never
have any salary coming.

97
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:19,248
Do you realize that last week
you gave away..

98
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,946
Wait, I give it
to you black and white.

99
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,775
$2. $4.90.

100
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:33,828
Look! You gave away $14
and 50 cents worth of groceries.

101
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:37,875
This is $12 and 50 cents more
than your salary.

102
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,399
What are you gonna do about it?

103
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,749
Couldn't you raise my salary?

104
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,229
- You're lucky I don't fire you.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,623
- Is this my property?"
- Yes.

106
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,582
The city condemned
that entire block.

107
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:49,887
Why aren't those people out?

108
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,169
Well, the sheriff served notice
on them

109
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,673
but they refused to move.

110
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,259
But they know that
I'm gonna build a new jail

111
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,608
and donate it to the city,
don't they?

112
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,547
- Yes, but...
- There are no buts.

113
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,594
Civic progress.
Have them evicted at once.

114
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,639
By the way, boys

115
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,728
we came out alright on the museum.

116
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,251
I donated the land

117
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,055
but I'll split
with the contractors making us

118
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,299
just three times
what the property cost.

119
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,302
Here's your check, Charlie.

120
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,564
- Harry.
- Thanks.

121
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,697
We really don't need a new jail,
Warren.

122
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,874
'Well, you can fill it, a smart
chief of police like you.'

123
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,746
You, uh, think it's safe
to give us these checks?

124
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,792
Well, I own the bank, don't I?

125
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:32,669
Look at that, Julia,
my fourth seven in a row.

126
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,716
I owe myself $265.

127
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,152
This is my lucky day.

128
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,988
Oh, so, it's you again, eh?

129
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,120
Now I oughta put you in jail
for reckless driving.

130
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,819
Don't arrest him, chief,
Eddie's harmless.

131
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,429
He never really had a chance.

132
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,823
Well, have I had any more chance?

133
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,000
I started in this town
with nothing, but my brains.

134
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:00,828
It was a bad start.

135
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,351
Why?

136
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,919
Well, we haven't got time
to bother with you now.

137
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,355
Come on.

138
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,283
Oh, chief!

139
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,949
Well, I guess they finished
our job.

140
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,168
They're all moved out now.
Come on, Bill.

141
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,387
Okay, chief.

142
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,309
What is this?

143
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,026
What are you doing?
Waiting for an earthquake?

144
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,182
The city's taking away our home.

145
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,488
The city? Why?

146
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,855
They're gonna build a jail here.

147
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,143
- A jail?
- Yeah!

148
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,884
What are we gonna do, ma?

149
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,408
I don't know, darling, we can't
very well live in the street.

150
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,671
Why not?
It seems to be well furnished.

151
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,456
Look, the city put you here,
well, you stay here

152
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,111
until the city put you
somewhere else.

153
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,635
What's he sayin'?

154
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,159
He said the city put us here
and we should live here.

155
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,031
He said the city put us here
and we should live here.

156
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:17,034
Come here, everybody.
Come here. Listen to me.

157
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,558
Why not live out here?

158
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,472
What's the matter with the sky
for a ceiling?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,562
But Eddie,
how can we live out here?

160
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,954
Just as you lived inside.

161
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,217
But out here
you'll have more fresh air

162
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,176
more help and more flies.

163
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,917
But it could be done.

164
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,266
Look!

165
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:32,963
Don't you believe in signs?

166
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,010
You see? Even Mr. Cooper says
it's a good idea.

167
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,882
Build a little home.
You have everything here.

Stop this nonsense!

00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,705
Mr. Cooper, you're just
in time for dinner.

244
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,341
I warned you
to keep out of my way.

245
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,647
My good friends

246
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,999
I sacrificed to buy
this property and why.

247
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,871
A year from now,
where those buildings stand

248
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,961
you'll see a grand new jail.

249
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,460
Say, the old jail was
good enough for your father

250
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,398
it ought to be
good enough for you.

251
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,965
What?

252
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,769
You think you're a great man,
but look what you do.

253
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,926
You built homes
for statues and criminals

254
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,425
and put these people
out on the street.

255
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,016
Mr. Cooper, you're, you're..

256
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,368
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

257
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,327
That's enough,
this time it's final.

258
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:40,026
- Call the wagon.
- Never mind.

259
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,811
- I can walk.
- Alright, you walk.

260
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,422
Walk him to the city limits,
and throw him out.

261
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,033
Come on.

262
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,734
Can I please say goodbye
to Julian?

263
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,910
Go ahead.

264
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,477
Goodbye, Julian.

265
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,484
They're throwing me out
because I told the truth.

266
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,265
Cooper, that big floor flusher.

267
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,833
He compares West Rome
to ancient Rome.

268
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,966
Rome, that was a real place.

269
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,453
They knew how
to treat people there.

270
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,060
Well, here we are.

271
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,018
Where am I going?
Where am I going to live?

272
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,802
Why don't you go back
to ancient Rome.

273
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,128
You're always talking about it.

274
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,457
I wish I could.

275
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,807
They didn't put people
out on a street in Rome.

276
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,679
Send us a telegram
when you get there.

277
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,073
Sure, we'll come up
and see you some time.

278
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,596
Get going.

279
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,043
Rome. There was a city.

280
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,698
Rome. Rome.

281
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,396
Rome. Rome.

282
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:50,009
Rome. Rome. Rome.

283
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,037
Hey! Why don't you blow your horn?

284
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,175
Hail, brother.

285
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,524
Hello, fellas.

286
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,356
Where's the circus?

287
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,576
Down this road and straight ahead.

288
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,796
Oh, I thought for a minute..

289
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:42,235
- What circus is it?
- The Circus Maximus, of course.

290
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,542
Maximus..
Not Ringling Brothers?

291
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,978
Are you bound for Rome?

292
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,937
No, I was just thrown out..

293
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,808
I mean, I just left there.

294
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,550
Have they heard of our glorious
victory over the Bretons?

295
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:57,076
- They lost their shirts.
- Yeah, but they got your pants.

296
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,643
Look, why don't you boys run
back into the dressing room

297
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,905
and put them on, huh?

298
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:05,388
Is it thus you greet the
soldiers of Emperor Valerius?

299
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,738
Me thinks thou art a spy.

300
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:11,046
- Me thinks thou art nuts.
- Nuts?

301
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,266
Yes, I'm giving you the raspberry.

302
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,530
Nuts, raspberry,
perhaps he's a food vendor.

303
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,749
Well, I used
to help out at Keeps grocery

304
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,534
but when Cooper saw me
with Agrippa.

305
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,189
The Empress Agrippa?
You know her?

306
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,712
Do I know her..

307
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,192
Where do you think I sleep nights?

308
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,758
What?

309
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,543
He insults Her Imperial Majesty.

310
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,547
And by the Gods, he shall die.

311
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,940
Hey, this guy is alright,
he can act.

312
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,441
Hey, look out with that thing,
you know you almost cut me then?

313
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,076
- Stop!
- Let him die like a Roman.

314
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,819
With steel in his hand.

315
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,951
- And steel in his heart.
- Listen you!

316
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,388
Keep on playing with those knives

317
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,930
the first thing you know
you'll hurt somebody.

318
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,739
Look at the point of that thing.
Look at it.

319
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,946
How would you like to have me
poking at you like that?

320
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,309
Huh? Here.

321
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,137
You play with him.
And we'll watch.

322
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,142
The coward will not fight.

323
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,970
Boil him in oil.

324
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,930
- Cut his head out.
- Let him go.

325
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,367
Hold your tongue!

326
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,239
Well, it seems kinda silly
but if you want me

327
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,544
to do it, I'll do it.

328
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,111
Tie him to that stake.

329
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,418
He will make a worthy target
for our arrows.

330
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,377
- A good laid plan.
- Yeah, what's so good about it?

331
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,640
Wait a minute, you can't now,
get me around like this.

332
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,252
What do you think you're doing?
Wait a minute.

333
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,949
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

334
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,733
Big boys like you playing Indian.

335
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,128
If you guys are
trying to scare me..

336
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,651
Yes.

337
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,044
You're going fine.

338
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:39,569
Oh!

339
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,092
Don't worry, whiskers.
I can fix it.

340
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,094
See, I've got some string here
in my pocket.

341
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,274
My pockets are gone.
My pants are gone.

342
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,583
Good heavens! Help!

343
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,412
You mean, this is no fooling?

344
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,241
I'm really living in Rome?

345
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,330
Yes, but not for long.

346
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,027
But wait a minute!

347
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,570
If this is really Rome,
you can't kill me.

348
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,856
Oh, no?

349
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,815
No, 'cause I haven't
been born yet.

350
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:11,122
It would not only be murder,
it would be birth control.

351
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,560
Say! Wait a minute!

352
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,606
Well.. Help! Help!

353
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:17,912
Help!

354
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,230
Hail, Josephus,
friend of the people.

355
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,014
Well, what manner of game is this?

356
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,061
It ain't post office,
friend of the people.

357
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,237
This fellow is a spy.

358
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:43,154
- He is a traitor.
- It's your turn now.

359
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,852
This dog maligned
the Empress Agrippa.

360
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,222
Oh, I did not, all I said was I
used to sleep beside her at...

361
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,292
Enough!
This is blasphemy!

362
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,077
Death is too good for him.
Take him to the slave market.

363
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,055
I'd be much much more useful
around the fish market.

364
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,517
- I used to work for...
- Silence!

365
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,997
You will be sold
to the highest bidder.

366
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,956
Perhaps, I'll buy you myself

367
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,784
if only to let you feel my whip.

368
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,655
Save your money,
I can feel it here.

369
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,091
At the slave market!

370
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,839
- Hah!
- Yuu, ya, ya!

371
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:20,888
Well, what am I bid for this
sturdy little captive?

372
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,629
What am I bid?

373
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,716
Ladies, please don't touch
unless you're gonna buy.

374
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,156
And don't buy.

375
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,853
Isn't anybody gonna bid?

376
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,072
What, nobody?

377
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,421
Well, if nobody wants me

378
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,467
I might as well go home.

379
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:37,731
Slaves who are not sold
are thrown to the lions.

380
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,820
To the lions?

381
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,493
Well, what are you waiting for?
Let's have a bid.

382
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,302
Yeah. Come, come, citizens.

383
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,999
What am I offered for this slave?

384
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,306
Well, somebody say five dinars?

385
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,959
Do I hear five dinars?

386
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,265
I don't even hear four dinars.

387
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,745
What's the matter with you people?

388
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,549
'Don't you know a bargain
when you see one?'

389
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:54,922
Well, somebody make a bid.

390
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,228
Look at me.
I can cook a little.

391
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,100
I can take care of the children.

392
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:01,581
If there are no children,
I can take care of that

393
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,104
by being a son to you.

394
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,627
Doesn't anybody want him?

395
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,674
Doesn't anybody want me?

396
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,632
It looks like
you're going to the lions.

397
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,243
Oh, come people, you may never
get a chance like this again.

398
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,636
I can sing.

399
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,203
♪ All of me ♪

400
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,988
♪ Why not take all of me ♪

401
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,555
- What about this
- Look, I can dance.

402
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,172
- Take him to the lions!
- 100 pifix.

403
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,826
100 pifix.

404
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:32,916
You, oh, mister, you'll never
be sorry for this.

405
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,483
Tell me, how much
is the 100 pifix.

406
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,355
One tenth of one gold dollar.

407
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,879
Why that's ten cents, what do
you think this is, wool wear?

408
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,925
Silence!
100 pifix has been bid.

409
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,798
- Do I hear more?
- One gold dinars.

410
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,669
Say, one gold dinars,
that's more like it.

411
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,845
The dinars is bid by Josephus.

412
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:49,933
Who?

413
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,957
Oh, please, mister, don't sell
me to him. He wants to whip me.

414
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,156
He told me so.

415
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:56,853
One dinars's bid,
one dinars's bid.

416
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,440
Why don't you sell me
to the man with the pifix

417
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,248
after all he spoke first.

418
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,424
- Pifix are not bad.
- One dinars's bid.

419
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,295
- Do I hear two?
- Look!

420
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,404
Look, people, look what
you can get f-for two dinars.

421
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,995
Look at these skins, imported.

422
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,842
- All the way from Russia.
- One dinars's bid.

423
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:11,627
One dinars, one dinars.
One dinars, one dinars.

424
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,088
If I throw in two pair
of pants, will you take me?

425
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,220
Going to Josephus for one dinars.

426
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,136
- Going, going..
- 'Two dinars!'

427
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:23,227
Two dinars! Who bid that?

428
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,926
- Somebody over there.
- Two dinars a bid!

429
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,581
- Three dinars!
- Three dinars a bid!

430
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,409
- Four dinars!
- Four dinars..

431
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:35,022
- Who bid that four dinars?
- Same fella.

432
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,546
- Four dinars a bid!
- Five dinars!

433
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:41,332
Five dinars! Now let me hear
another dinars.

434
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,379
♪ Dinar
is there anything finer? ♪

435
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,990
- Silence!
- Ooh! Ooh!

436
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,296
What do I hear?

437
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,559
You just heard me saying dinars.

438
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,432
Going to Josephus for five dinars!

439
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,609
- Going! Going!...
- Six dinars!

440
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,872
Wrap me up.

441
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,222
- Who bid that?
- I did..

442
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,658
'Six dinars a bid.'

443
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,878
But, lady, you're just
throwing your money away.

444
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,706
I'm weak, I can't do any work.

445
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,708
I'm not buying you for work.

446
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,536
That's just what I was afraid of.

447
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,078
'Six dinars's a bid,
do I hear seven?'

448
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:14,017
Listen, buddy, why don't
you bid seven dinars?

449
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,542
Why the gold in my teeth
is worth more than that, see?

450
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,413
- Seven dinars.
- 'Seven dinars a bid.'

451
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,284
- Eight dinars.
- 'Eight dinars a bid.'

452
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,635
'Eight dinars a bid, eight
dinars a bid, do I hear nine?'

453
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:24,854
No more bid? Alright.

454
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,334
Going to the lady
for eight dinars.

455
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,815
- Going! Going!
- What about you.

456
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:32,253
Or you? Mr. Josephus,
please, buy me.

457
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,776
You can even whip me
on my day off.

458
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,475
- Ten dinars!
- Ten dinars!

459
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,912
Going for ten dinars! Going!

460
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,957
Going! Going..

461
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,917
Gone.

462
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,929
You understand, Olga?

463
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:59,193

Have you ever been
lashed before, slave?

493
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,501
Oh, yes, when I was a kid.

494
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:35,894
Where was that, slave?

495
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,722
In the regular place, you know?

496
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,421
Well, do you want me
to cross your knees?

497
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,553
No, I'm not going to whip you.

498
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,294
- You're not?
- No.

499
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,993
Oh, well, then I won't need this.

500
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,519
- Hail, Majordomo.
- Hail, Marcius.

501
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,608
You are a strange fella.
I like you.

502
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,088
I like you too.

503
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,351
But maybe you better
let me hold the whip.

504
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,830
Oh, that's my chariot whip.

505
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,310
Watch.

506
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,534
Say, you're a good
whipper snapper.

507
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,710
Look, could you please
let me try it once?

508
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:11,668
- Go ahead.
- I just like to try it once.

509
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,937
Now you are in trouble. That's
the emperor's Majordomo.

510
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,394
You dog, I'll have you
whipped without an inch

511
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:23,506
of your life for this.

512
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,073
I assure you it was an accident.

513
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,510
Do you never tire feeding
the cause of others?

514
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,034
I'm afraid not.

515
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,427
Well, the emperor is tired
of it, Josephus.

516
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,863
If you can take a warning.

517
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,348
Gee, thanks a lot.

518
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,543
You know, I couldn't have
hit him with this thing

519
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,872
if I wanted to.

520
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,179
All I tried to do was
to crack it like this.

521
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,316
Well, what are we waiting for?

522
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,931
Josephus, our friend.

523
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,108
See, everybody seems to be crazy
about you here, you know.

524
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,719
I like being your slave.

525
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,721
You are no longer my slave.

526
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,680
No?

527
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,377
I guess I'm just a failure,
I can't even

528
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:09,857
keep a job as a slave.

529
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,033
Oh, I bought you to set you free.

530
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,339
Don't throw away the price tag

531
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,746
you won't be able to get a refund.

532
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,431
Tell me what's your name?

533
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,781
- Eddie.
- Oh, there's no such name.

534
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:23,784
- I'll call you Oedipus.
- Alright, I'll call you Joe.

535
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,357
Make way for the emperor!

536
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,837
Hail! Hail!

537
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,841
Hail! Hail!

538
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,280
Hail! Hail!

539
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,456
When are they going to say
"The gang's all here?"

540
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:48,200
Hail! Hail!

541
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,382
What good are these conquests?

542
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,645
- They only mean higher taxes.
- Yeah.

543
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,479
Josephus, it's an outrage.

544
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,568
The emperor parades
while we starve.

545
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:11,223
Be patient, my friend.
Our day will come.

546
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,660
We'll put an end to his tyranny
if necessary by force.

547
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:18,360
Look, Joe, a girl.
Who is that?

548
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:22,364
It's the Princess Silvia of
Britain. A prisoner of war.

549
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,758
Why doesn't the emperor
let her ride?

550
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,934
Only the emperor can ride
in the emperor's chariot.

551
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,285
Yeah, why doesn't he get
a chariot with a rumble seat?

552
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,302
Hey, Valerius, you can't
treat her like that.

553
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,784
Valerius! Valerius!

554
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,615
- Take him to the dungeons.
- Yeah, take him to the dungeon.

555
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,272
Who's got the boar?

556
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:16,505
These wars exhaust me, Domo.
I need some relaxation.

557
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,246
Have Olga come and sing for me.

558
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,814
Olga was sold today
in the slave market

559
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,381
by your Majesty's command.

560
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:25,166
No, no, Domo.
I said depose her.

561
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,950
Not dispose of her.

562
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:30,389
Olga has long been my
favorite, Olga loves me.

563
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:34,001
True, she has slipped a little,
but we must not be ungrateful.

564
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,872
You must find some reward
for her devotion.

565
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

566
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:41,400
I have it, she should be made
slave to my new favorite.

567
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,751
Who better than Olga
can tell her what to do?

568
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,188
Or more important, what not to do.

569
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:49,538
Meaning, of course,
the Princess Silvia.

570
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,323
Don't hurry me, Domo.

571
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,612
- I know you.
- You do?

572
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:23,790
Yes, you are the man I just saw
the soldiers bring in here.

573
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,357
I know you very well.

574
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,272
Too bad you didn't see
them arrest me

575
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,751
we might have been relatives.

576
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,061
Who are those guys?

577
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:36,803
They are the emperor's torturers.

578
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,634
They twist your spine
and bend your bones.

579
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:43,592
Oh, chiropractors.

580
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,379
They torture their victims
with hot irons

581
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:48,989
and fire.

582
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:55,082
Oh, come, come, come
it isn't as funny as all that.

583
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:58,303
Oh, to me, all life is comedy.

584
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,135
I have found the secret
of eternal laughter.

585
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:17,322
There is a legend
of the gods that a volcano

586
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,368
is but a mountain
bursting with laughter

587
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,848
at the world.

588
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,154
I suppose an earthquake
is just a giggle.

589
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,679
Yeah, from such a mountain

590
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:31,597
I have gathered what no one
else in the world possesses.

591
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,990
I have lava gas.

592
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,340
Oh, you'll be alright.

593
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,298
Take a little
bicarbonate of soda...

594
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,431
Uh, no, no, no.

595
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:42,347
One whiff of this lava gas

596
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,566
and you will roar with laughter

597
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,351
even though you're suffering.

598
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,483
You mean to say if I just take
one whiff of this

599
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,770
I'll burst right out laughing.

600
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,269
- Yes. Yes.
- I'd like to try, then.

601
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:54,620
No, only when you are suffering.

602
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,099
Oh.

603
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,585
What's that?

604
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,196
Hungry lions

605
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,676
in the next cell.

606
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,375
Oh, I'd like to feed them.

607
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:11,462
You will.

608
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,869
I guess he laughed himself out.

609
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,528
This cell is empty.

610
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,530
Wait here.
The rest go down there.

611
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:37,967
Stop. Why can't
I go with my people?

612
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:40,056
It's the emperor's command.

613
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,537
Princess, I'm frightened.

614
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:44,757
Yes, I know.

615
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:46,759
But we mustn't
let the Romans know it.

616
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,457
In there.

617
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,036
Princess, Princess!

618
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:08,694
Don't be afraid.

619
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,609
I'm not afraid.

620
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,139
Wasn't it you who tried
to save me?

621
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:22,055
Well, I did kinda wanna talk
to Valerius about you.

622
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:23,622
Then it's my fault you're here.

623
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,886
No, Princess.
I'm always in trouble.

624
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,367
But don't worry,
we won't be here long.

625
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,890
Josephus will get us out.

626
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,500
Josephus? Who is he?

627
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,329
He's my boss.

628
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,158
Remember during the parade
when you were looking at me?

629
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,029
Yes.

630
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,249
Well, he was standing
right next to me.

631
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,444
But I guess you didn't see him

632
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,687
on the account of looking at me.

633
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,127
- Oedipus!
- Joe!

634
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,197
Quick, Your Highness,
there's no time to lose.

635
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,267
- I've come to free you.
- It's Joe, Josephus.

636
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,095
The man I've been telling
you about.

637
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,313
What about the guard, Joe?

638
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,750
A bribe has made him a friend.

639
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,229
Why are you doing this for me?

640
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,231
To gain your favor,
I'd give my life.

641
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,059
- Merely for my favor?
- Willing.

642
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,411
Take it. It's a bargain.

643
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:14,692
You must hurry, Your Highness.

644
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:15,717
Come, Oedipus.

645
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,508
Joe, I can't go with you.

646
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,249
I've gotten sort of attached
to this place.

647
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,468
Get the the key for this.

648
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:31,603
Josephus! The emperor.

649
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,169
- Tell him we're out.
- You must go.

650
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,388
I'll be back.

651
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:38,697
Josephus.

652
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,002
Your Majesty.

653
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:41,197
You did not tell me that Josephus

654
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,396
was my prisoner.

655
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,224
Your Majesty,
I'm here to see my slave

656
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,747
who has been unjustly imprisoned.

657
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:48,620
You've crossed my path
to often, Josephus.

658
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,187
I advise you to leave unless you
care to stay here permanently.

659
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:05,917
Are you quite comfortable here,
Your Highness?

660
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,290
Quite, Your Majesty.

661
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,640
I only hope that someday

662
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,555
I shall be able to entertain you

663
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,121
as comfortably.

664
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,341
I believe you'll find my palace
more restful.

665
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,212
I prefer it here.

666
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,823
So be it.

667
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,260
I take pride in my conquest
of the heart.

668
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,654
I cannot desire you
unless you desire me.

669
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:24,830
Therefore, I should keep you
imprisoned here

670
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,701
until you do desire me.

671
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,050
'What a lover!'

672
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,662
Who said that?

673
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,272
I did.

674
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,882
And that's not all I'm gonna say.

675
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,381
I want to tell you a few words,
perhaps..

676
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:40,714
Who is this slave?

677
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,021
He is the dog that tried

678
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:43,346
to attack you
during the procession.

679
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,763
- I didn't. I merely...
- Silence!

680
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,392
Before that, he attacked me
with a whip.

681
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,549
- A horse whip!
- That was only one I had.

682
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:49,916
'Gag the dog!'

683
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:51,857
And now, my dear.

684
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,336
Doesn't it flatter you to know

685
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,382
that of all the lovely ladies
in the Rome

686
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,602
I have chosen the Britain
for my favorite?

687
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,299
I prefer your alliance.

688
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,257
I wonder if your countrymen
down the corridor

689
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,520
have the same preference?

690
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:03,869
- You wouldn't dare..
- Why not?

691
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:07,655
- Come, Domo.
- Wait.

692
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,920
If I got to your palace..

693
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,749
...do you promise no harm
will come to my countrymen?

694
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:15,968
On my honor.

695
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:22,496
Domo, escort the princess
to the palace.

696
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:29,764
And now, put this dog
to the torture.

697
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,200
And when he's screaming in agony

698
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:33,463
I should come back
and enjoy his suffering.

699
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,255
You boys leaving?

700
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,483
Nice development.

701
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,616
- The hot iron!
- Make mine cold.

702
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,840
Oh!

703
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,798
- Much hotter.
- Listen, boys.

704
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,800
Why can't we talk this thing over?

705
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:07,497
Please, sit down.
Just sit down. Let's...

706
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,369
Oh!

707
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:13,765
I'll tear you to pieces for this.

708
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:15,723
Honest, mister, I didn't mean it.

709
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,508
I feel terribly sorry

710
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,727
if I hurt you.

711
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:23,905
Think it's funny, huh?

712
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,211
We'll show you.

713
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:29,519
Oh, boys! You're killing me.

714
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,696
Oh, you're breaking my arm.

715
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:33,436
Suppposing,
I was your own brother.

716
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,699
I have no brother.

717
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:39,965
He died last week.

718
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,272
Let's chain him
and put the hot irons..

719
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,274
...against his feet.

720
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,104
I bet it'd be horribly painful.

721
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:52,542
It will probably cripple you.

722
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,726
What is the meaning of this..

723
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:04,269
I come to watch a slave suffer
torture and I hear him laughing.

724
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:06,165
But I am suffering, Your Majesty.

725
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:08,950
Enough of this nonsense!

726
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:10,125
Give him the hot irons!

727
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:15,174
But slowly.

728
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:25,488
'Closer. Closer.'

729
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,142
Now, we'll get some screaming.

730
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,541
You fools!
You'll die for this.

731
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:37,152
We are sorry, Your Majesty.

732
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,545
You sat down on the..

733
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:41,287
You dare laugh..

734
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:44,682
...when your emperor is wounded?

735
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,990
But Valerius, you're laughing too!

736
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,602
So I am.

737
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,517
It's the first time in years.

738
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,738
Release him!

739
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,749
You shall live, slave.

740
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:10,533
Did you hear that, boys?

741
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,318
- As long as you can amuse me.
- Yeah.

742
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:13,493
Don't go away, fellas.

743
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,016
I might be back any minute.

744
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,201
You have a nice war, Valerius?

745
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:27,855
Hmm, rather dull.

746
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,117
The weather was warm

747
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,032
and the mosquitos were terrible.

748
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:33,513
It's wonderful, my dear

749
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,862
having you home again.

750
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:38,910
Thank you, Agrippa.

751
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,215
Come, let us drink

752
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,261
to our undying love.

753
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:45,830
By all means.

754
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,706
- Your health, me dear.
- My health?

755
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,839
May I keep it always.

756
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:56,057
Always.

757
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:02,107
Food taster.

758
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,211
Oh, Valerius!

759
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,473
This is horrible

760
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,040
to think

761
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:23,302
it might have been you!

762
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,696
There, there, my dear.

763
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,264
Do not let it disturb you.

764
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:31,179
Perhaps you'll have better luck
the next time.

765
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:45,715
- Has there been an accident?
- No.

766
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,543
Something he ate, no doubt.

767
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:02,471
Oh, you'd love America.

768
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:04,082
And have we got a traffic system

769
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,040
with all kinds of lights.

770
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:07,302
Take for instance

771
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,522
a man wants to cross the street

772
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,177
but he can't do it because
the red light is against them.

773
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:13,526
Well, he couldn't do it anyway

774
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,310
two policemen are watching him.

775
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:17,312
They've got burglars
all over towns

776
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,140
speakeasy, people are killing
each other

777
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:20,446
but the police have got to see

778
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,317
that he doesn't cross the street.

779
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:24,537
Well?

780
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:26,191
When the police aren't looking

781
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:28,410
he sneaks over as far
as the safety zone.

782
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,021
What's that?

783
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:31,737
That's where the people wait
for a street car.

784
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,783
They have a white line.
It's called the safety zone.

785
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:35,417
And is that a good idea!

786
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:37,985
Phew! If an automobile
should hit you

787
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,509
while you're within the safety
zone, that doesn't count.

788
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:42,990
It's gotta go all the way around
and hit you again.

789
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:44,905
Yes, but what about this man?

790
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:46,733
Oh, he gets hit in the front

791
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,735
by a truck, in the back
by a street car.

792
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,477
But he gets there, even if he
has to go in an ambulance.

793
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:52,826
'Where is he going?'

794
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,828
To the movies
to see "Mickey Mouse."

795
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,699
- "Mickey Mouse?"
- 'Sure.'

796
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:58,745
'Mickey Mouse
and his sweetheart, Minnie.'

797
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,443
A mouse has a sweetheart?

798
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,010
'And is she a mouse too?'

799
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:06,231
Sure. Otherwise it would be
very inconvenient.

800
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,102
And when Mickey goes to see Minnie

801
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:10,975
what do you think Minnie is doing?

802
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,150
Well, what is she doing?

803
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:13,803
♪ There was Minnie ♪

804
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,066
♪ Kicking the gong ♪

805
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:16,632
♪ Around ♪♪

806
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:18,938
Oh!

807
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,289
See, give me those.

808
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,335
- They're my lucky dice!
- Lucky?

809
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,337
Let me see those cubes.

810
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:27,078
Do you mean to, you've, uh

811
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,906
never seen a dice before?

812
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,124
Never.

813
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:33,432
Oh, emperor,
are we going to have fun?

814
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,303
Come on, I'll shoot you
for five dinars.

815
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,131
You'll shoot your emperor
for five dinars?

816
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:38,828
Alright. I'll shoot you
for three dinars.

817
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,613
- Why...
- I mean with the dice.

818
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,397
- Oh, oh!
- Come on now.

819
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,008
Let's see if you're lucky.

820
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:46,619
If-if I win, that's a good sign.

821
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:48,577
If you win, that's a miracle.

822
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,234
Come on, seven!

823
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,411
'It's a natural.'

824
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,240
'Oh, dice'

825
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,415
'be good to me.'

826
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
'Huh!'

827
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:13,646
Twelve is my point.
It's a little tough.

828
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:14,864
But I'll make it.

829
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:19,913
- I win.
- Oh, no, no. Just a moment.

830
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,523
You lose. 12 was your point.

831
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,090
You threw a three and a four.

832
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,092
Well, three times four is 12.
Isn't it?

833
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,839
Well, now let's see how we stand.

834
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,188
You owe me the Colosseum

835
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:36,538
and the forum and the Major Domo.

836
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,932
Remember? I won him
when I rolled a nine.

837
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,629
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

838
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:43,110
I'll give you back everything..

839
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:44,197
...that I've won.

840
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:45,547
You will?

841
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:46,698
And I'll tell you
what're you gonna do for me.

842
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:47,810
What?

843
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:49,247
You can free the Princess Sylvia.

844
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,557
You seem much interested
in my prisoner.

845
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:56,950
I am, Your Majesty.

846
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,908
I'm crazy about her.

847
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,389
Oh, you are?

848
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:07,004
'How would you like to be
the official food taster?'

849
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,963
I find myself in need
of a food taster.

850
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,506
You mean all I have to do
is just eat?

851
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,748
Exactly.

852
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,359
You eat the same food I eat.

853
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:15,795
Only you eat it first.

854
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:18,363
'Say, that job sounds alright.'

855
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,775
But I'd like to ask you
one question.

856
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,236
- What's that?
- Do you like spinach?

857
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:24,803
No.

858
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:26,936
Well, in that case

859
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,026
I can go to work right away.

860
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:31,202
Ah, the wine!

861
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,421
Your Majesty,
this is the last glass

862
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:34,640
of your favorite wine.

863
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,337
Hmm, that's a pity.

864
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:39,166
This wine has given me
much pleasure.

865
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:41,299
- Taste, Oediphus.
- Alright.

866
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,561
I don't mind if I do.

867
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:48,567
I would say, uh..

868
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,395
Well, well?

869
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:51,657
Don't hurry me.

870
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,402
I may be right.

871
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:00,970
And then..

872
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:05,149
...I may be wrong.

873
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,419
I was wrong.

874
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:15,550
It's good stuff.

875
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:22,818
- Josephus!
- Shh.

876
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:25,212
Find Sylvia.
I've come to take her away.

877
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,431
Wait here.

878
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,532
- Sylvia!
- This is madness.

879
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,490
- You must go.
- And you're coming with me.

880
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:43,970
I can't let you do this.

881
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,972
If you're caught,
it means certain death.

882
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,192
Oh, Josephus, I love you.

883
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,410
If you love me

884
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:50,629
come with me.

885
00:52:07,602 --> 00:52:10,431
Double the guards
about these gardens.

886
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,041
And the next time, shoot to kill.

887
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:18,831
Manius bring me Oediphus,
the new food taster.

888
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,398
What do you want him for?

889
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:23,140
He's in love
with the Princess Sylvia.

890
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,185
And therefore,
should hate the emperor.

891
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:27,753
'Valerius must be poisoned.'

892
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,015
He could be very useful

893
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,497
Hello!

894
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:35,761
Hello!

895
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:38,502
Hello!

896
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,031
Are you the new food taster?

897
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,469
You want something tasted?

898
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:51,429
The empress wants to see you
in her chambers.

899
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:53,387
Does the emperor know about this?

900
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,607
What the emperor doesn't know
won't hurt him.

901
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes, but what he will know
might cripple me.

902
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,088
Come.

903
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Oediphus.

904
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,204
'Oediphus.'

905
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,082
'Don't be afraid.'

906
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,173
What's the matter, empress?

907
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,393
Don't you feel well?

908
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,611
I don't feel so good myself.

909
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,223
I've got hiccups.

910
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,963
Sit beside me, Oediphus.

911
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,758
- Let me hold your hand.
- No. No.

912
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,455
You'll start out
by holding my hand

913
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,805
and pretty soon you'll wanna
shuffle the whole deck.

914
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,248
Why are you so cold?

915
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,553
Maybe it's these clothes.

916
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,641
I'm not used to 'em.

917
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:16,077
Excuse me.

918
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:23,477
Oediphus.

919
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:29,091
You'll wear something out
doing that.

920
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:31,833
Have you ever been fired
by passion?

921
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,096
No, but I've been fired
by everybody else.

922
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,709
Tell me about your country.

923
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:38,840
What do they know about..

924
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:41,408
...love?

925
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,889
Well, enough to keep things going.

926
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,065
We're still building schools.

927
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:51,810
Show me... show me.

928
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,510
I'm sorry.

929
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:57,816
I'll tell you what.

930
00:54:57,903 --> 00:54:58,904
You scare me.

931
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,558
That'll stop it.

932
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:01,820
Listen to me, Oediphus.

933
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:07,695
Tonight the emperor
is going to be poisoned.

934
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:08,957
Why should that scare me?

935
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,525
See?

936
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:15,616
He's going to be
poisoned... by you.

937
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:21,535
That did it, you notice?

938
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:23,102
It stopped.

939
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,846
No. It didn't work.

940
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:30,109
- See here, Oedipus.
- Wait a minute.

941
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:31,632
I think I can scare myself better.

942
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,812
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.

943
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,118
Here.

944
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,428
They got me.
I've been attacked.

945
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:46,560
- We're amongst enemies.
- Oh, Oedipus.

946
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:51,260
Look, no more hiccups.

947
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,175
I scared myself good, huh?

948
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:55,787
Well, thanks for trying.

949
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:56,875
Wait.

950
00:55:57,963 --> 00:55:59,312
What about the poison?

951
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,855
Look, you don't have to
scare me anymore.

952
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,708
- They're gone now.
- Stop wasting time.

953
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:07,364
Listen, in a few hours
the Princess Sylvia

954
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,843
is dining with the emperor.

955
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,802
The princess is in great danger.

956
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:13,282
You can save her, Oedipus..

957
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,068
...by poisoning the emperor
at the banquet.

958
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:20,942
Your own husband?

959
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:22,727
Why, that's murder, isn't it?

960
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,512
Listen, Mrs. Valerius,
of course, it isn't my business

961
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,296
but you're not being
a very good wife.

962
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,994
- You dare?
- Yes.

963
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:30,691
Your husband works hard all day

964
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:32,780
to give you a nice house
and fine clothes

965
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,826
he comes home at night
tired and hungry

966
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:37,698
and what does he get
for his supper? Poison.

967
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:42,355
Five food tasters are dead

968
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:45,053
because they were afraid
to carry out my plans.

969
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,274
I'm... not afraid.

970
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:51,320
- I think you are.
- No.

971
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,018
Really. I'm not scared.

972
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:55,759
See?

973
00:56:58,284 --> 00:57:00,895
I command that you leave Rome
by tomorrow never to return.

974
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,898
At Ostia, a boat will be waiting
to carry you to Carthage.

975
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,379
See that you do not miss
that boat.

976
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:07,554
Take him away.

977
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:14,953
Joe!

978
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,737
May I say goodbye to my friend?

979
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,524
Goodbye?

980
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:23,004
Why, you haven't said hello yet.

981
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,398
Oedipus, I'm leaving Rome forever.

982
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:27,531
You're leaving?
Do you have to?

983
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:29,271
The emperor has banished me.

984
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:30,882
Well, he can't get away with that.

985
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:33,101
The people love you, Joe.
They won't stand for it.

986
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:35,147
The people will do
nothing against Valerius

987
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,628
until they have definite proof
of his dishonesty.

988
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,795
Oh, I'd give my right arm
if I could find such proof.

989
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:41,501
Your right a..

990
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:44,373
Joe, you're hurt.
How did it happen?

991
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,027
The emperor.

992
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,029
I'm lucky he spared my life.

993
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:49,920
Wouldn't it have been wise,
Your Majesty, to have

994
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,424
had Josephus killed?

995
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:55,341
The people love him far too much.

996
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:57,822
In the present temper,
it would have been dangerous.

997
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:01,347
But do not worry,
I've forgotten nothing.

998
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:04,002
Josephus will not bother us again.

999
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,414
If they're going to serve
poisoned food

1000
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,396
then Sylvia's in danger.

1001
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,485
Oh, yeah.

1002
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:09,636
I must get to her and warn her.

1003
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,835
Wait.

1004
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:12,160
I can't let you do it for me, Joe.

1005
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,664
You'd be caught.

1006
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:17,972
Besides, I, well, you know,
Sylvia and I..

1007
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:20,932
But I must, Oedipus,
you see, I love her.

1008
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:25,197
You... love her?

1009
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,112
Yes. My heart throbs for her.

1010
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,157
My blood tingles,
my head's in a whirl.

1011
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:31,203
Say, you ought to be in bed.

1012
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,900
You've got the flu.

1013
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,511
'Time's up, Josephus.'

1014
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:37,383
But Sylvia..

1015
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:40,299
Don't worry. I'll get to her.

1016
00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:44,433
Tell her I'll be waiting outside
the palace with my chariots.

1017
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,088
If the plot succeeds,
bring her to me quickly

1018
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:48,829
the three of us
will leave Rome together.

1019
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,788
If it fails,
I'll come for her myself.

1020
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:54,313
- And, Oedipus.
- Yes?

1021
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,054
Tell her I love her.

1022
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:01,363
Have you seen the Princess Sylvia?

1023
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,757
- She's in the royal bath.
- Through the gardens?

1024
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:06,630
Wait! If you go in there,
it means death.

1025
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:10,895
Doesn't anybody around here
ever die of old age?

1026
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:12,853
You were told to let
no man into these gardens

1027
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,465
yet Josephus got in. I warn you,
don't let it happen again.

1028
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,728
To your posts!

1029
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,002
Help!

1030
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,092
Let go, will you?

1031
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,746
Hey!

1032
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,182
You've caught me..

1033
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:41,229
You've caught me by the foot.

1034
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:47,018
Hello, major.
Fancy meeting you here.

1035
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:48,585
I'll kill you for this.

1036
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:56,288
It was Oedipus. Get him.

1037
00:59:57,855 --> 01:00:01,206
I found him trying
to get over the garden wall.

1038
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:03,991
I've waited a long time
for this opportunity.

1039
01:00:04,078 --> 01:00:06,211
Give him a 100 lashes
across the back.

1040
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:08,866
But, Your Excellency,
it's no use whipping him.

1041
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,129
He can't be hurt,
you know how he laughed

1042
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,913
when the emperor had him tortured.

1043
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,481
He's right. You'd just be
waiting your time whipping me.

1044
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,352
Why, when I'm hit
all I do is laugh.

1045
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:18,963
So you can't be hurt, eh?

1046
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,138
No.

1047
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:22,531
Well, we'll see.

1048
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:27,754
See? Ha-ha.

1049
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:29,538
I didn't feel anything.

1050
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,323
- No?
- No.

1051
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,672
Well, I'll try again.

1052
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:34,718
Certainly.
Help yourself.

1053
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,763
And this time I'll make sure.

1054
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:43,683
Well... when are you gonna hit me?

1055
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,251
- What?
- I told you it was no use.

1056
01:00:46,338 --> 01:00:48,557
It must be black magic.

1057
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,951
Black magic.
That's what it is.

1058
01:00:51,038 --> 01:00:52,257
Black magic.

1059
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,606
But how do you do it, slave?

1060
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,216
Oh, just plain everyday magic.

1061
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,654
I've got a certain magic word.

1062
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,873
- Yes?
- Yes.

1063
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,658
If I say that magic word

1064
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,877
would it mean that I too
could never feel pain?

1065
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,574
Well, I, uh, no, no..

1066
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,838
- What is that magic word?
- Oh, I couldn't tell you.

1067
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,274
You'd go around telling everybody.

1068
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:11,363
No, I promise you,
I'd never tell anyone.

1069
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,279
Oppo mopo dopo.

1070
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,847
Oppo mopo.. Wait!
We'll try that.

1071
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,545
I'll say the magic word
and you strike me.

1072
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:20,851
No. No, no, no, no thanks.

1073
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:22,461
Do as I say!

1074
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,637
Alright, if you insist,
but honestly

1075
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:27,205
I wouldn't do this
for my own mother.

1076
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,555
One, two. Ready?

1077
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,513
Oppo mopo.. Ah!

1078
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,385
You hurt me.

1079
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:35,300
- I felt that.
- Sure you felt it.

1080
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:39,086
You see, I said "Oppo mopo dopo"
and what did you say?

1081
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:40,566
- What did I say?
- You see?

1082
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:42,263
You don't even know yourself.

1083
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,178
Come, come, come.
I'll get it this time.

1084
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:46,528
Yeah?
You'll get it.

1085
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,357
One, two.
Ready?

1086
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,925
Oppo mopo.. Uh!
Why, you!

1087
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,188
I know just exactly
what you're gonna say.

1088
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:55,799
You felt it again, sure you did.

1089
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,539
You see? You put
the accent on "Oppo"

1090
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,020
instead of putting it
on "Mopo," you dopo.

1091
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:01,718
- Yes?
- Yes.

1092
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,205
Well, perhaps
I'd learn more quickly

1093
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,721
if I saw you struck again.

1094
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,026
Oh, no, no, no, no...

1095
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:07,553
Guard, you strike him
while I listen.

1096
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,029
And strike him as hard as you can.

1097
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:11,075
Oh, but, but listen,
it-it-it's silly.

1098
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:13,164
How can you learn
if I'm gonna do the practicing?

1099
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,080
Besides, I don't feel anything.

1100
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:17,211
Strike him!

1101
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:23,130
See? I didn't feel a thing.

1102
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:58,818
Sylvia?

1103
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:12,005
Oh, yes. This mud is
absolutely wonderful.

1104
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:15,617
Take this little girl right here.

1105
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:17,794
Why, she's only had two treatments

1106
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,404
and already you wouldn't
recognize her.

1107
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:21,406
A man in here?

1108
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:24,191
I must find him.

1109
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:26,628
There, it's all finished.

1110
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:28,587
Now keep perfectly quiet.

1111
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,816
Who are you?

1112
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,818
- You don't know who I am?
- No.

1113
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:45,386
Oh, am I glad... to meet you.

1114
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:48,259
Oh.
Aren't you the Ethiopian..

1115
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:50,454
- Ethiopian. Beauty. Specialist.
- Beauty. Specialist.

1116
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:52,393
You sure guessed it,
that's what I is.

1117
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1118
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,396
And the emperor sent me down here

1119
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,877
to kinda look after
the Princess Sylvia.

1120
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:00,053
Oh, I see.

1121
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,317
Slave. I'll have you taken to her.

1122
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:06,668
Show the doctor to the
Princess Sylvia's compartment.

1123
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:09,584
Thank you, miss.

1124
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:21,031
Sylvia, I have an
important message

1125
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:22,293
for you from Josephus.

1126
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,034
From Josephus?
Oh, quick, give it to me.

1127
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,949
Don't eat anything
at the emperor's banquet.

1128
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:27,036
- Why not.
- Never mind.

1129
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,125
Just lay off the food

1130
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:29,276
I'll bring
an ice-cream soda later.

1131
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,867
What of Josephus? Is he safe?

1132
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,801
He's okay, and he's waiting
to take you to Ostia

1133
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:33,913
right after the banquet.

1134
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,480
Oh, thank the gods.

1135
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,960
I almost forgot.

1136
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,484
- He told me to tell you..
- Yes?

1137
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:41,399
He said he loves you.

1138
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:44,228
And I think he means it
because he was feeling terrible.

1139
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:50,277
Doctor, we just heard
you were here.

1140
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:53,541
Yes, doctor, can you give us
some beauty hints?

1141
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:56,196

1207
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:37,624
But, Your Majesty,
these taxes will amount to

1208
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:40,323
millions of dinars more
than your palace will cost.

1209
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,629
Exactly, if the bill is passed

1210
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,065
you will share in those millions.

1211
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,416
You promised us that when we voted

1212
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:47,741
on the taxes for the Colosseum.

1213
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:48,896
And the Circus Maximus.

1214
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,985
And we're still waiting
for our money.

1215
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:53,510
This time I promise it
before the gods.

1216
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,903
I should be for it
before we pass the bill.

1217
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,776
The emperor can do no wrong.

1218
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,387
So great a truth
should be in writing.

1219
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,867
Also your promise.

1220
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,434
Then you shall have it in writing

1221
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:06,958
for after all,
don't we trust each other?

1222
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:16,359
Oh.

1223
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:20,537
- Oh..
- Who are you?

1224
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:21,799
- Idiot.
- A fool!

1225
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:23,104
I'm pleased to meet you.

1226
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:25,193
Have you no respect for senators?

1227
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:30,895
Say, boys,
you dropped something. Say..

1228
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:35,943
Just like all senators,
never listen to the people.

1229
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,213
Say... Joe might be able
to use this.

1230
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:55,920
Goodbye.

1231
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,704
It's been fun knowin' you.

1232
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:00,228
Come, Oedipus.

1233
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,845
Your Majesty,
my kitchen is honored.

1234
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:10,195
- Is everything in readiness?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1235
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,812
- Mm, squabs, I love 'em.
- Careful.

1236
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:20,747
There's enough poison
in one of those nightingale

1237
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:23,730
to kill 50 men.

1238
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:25,993
No wonder the poor little thing
is dead.

1239
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,256
At the banquet, Oedipus,
you will be able to eat

1240
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,302
one of these nightingales.

1241
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,304
Thank you very much,
but I'm on a diet.

1242
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,262
My doctor has forbidden me
any poison.

1243
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,830
Only one contains the poison.

1244
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,484
And that one..

1245
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,007
...is for the emperor.

1246
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:43,794
- The emperor.
- The emperor. Long may he live.

1247
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,188
Listen closely, Oedipus

1248
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:49,558
for the banquet, the emperor
has ordered these nightingales

1249
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:51,410
his favorite food.

1250
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:53,107
When the dish is passed

1251
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:55,414
you would take the one
without the pasley

1252
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,939
for the one without the pasley
is the one without the poison.

1253
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:02,682
In a few hours, I should be
the supreme ruler of Rome

1254
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:05,119
and you, Oedipus,
will be the most popular man...

1255
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:07,818
In the cemetery.

1256
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:10,908
When I'm ruler, you shall
have a province at Egypt.

1257
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:13,650
Egypt.

1258
01:13:13,737 --> 01:13:16,609
What I have always wanted.

1259
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:19,133
Remember, Oedipus,
the one without the pasley

1260
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,832
is the one without the poison,
there must be no mistake.

1261
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,051
You're telling me

1262
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,663
the one without the pasley
is the one without the poison.

1263
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,492
The one without the pasley is
the one without the pasl.. No.

1264
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:32,408
The one without the pasley
is the one without the poison.

1265
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,757
Come, Oedipus.

1266
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:34,932
The one without the pasley

1267
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:36,847
is the one without the poisley.

1268
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,284
The one without the p..
The one without the pa..

1269
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:40,285
The one without the pa..

1270
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,393
The one without the poison

1271
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,853
is the one without the pasley..

1272
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:47,510
Egypt. Egypt.

1273
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:51,992
There, I can feed my wife
to the crocodiles.

1274
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:54,865
The one without the pasley..

1275
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:56,823
The one without.

1276
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:01,848
The one without the pasley
is the one without the poison.

1277
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:03,589
The one without the pasley
is the one without the poison.

1278
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:05,773
The one without the pasley
is the one without the poi..

1279
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:10,097
Let the banquet begin.

1280
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,056
Where is my food taster?

1281
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,058
Where is Oedipus?

1282
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:16,582
- Oedipus!
- Oedipus!

1283
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:18,192
- Oedipus!
- Oedipus!

1284
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,545
Did, uh, someone call me?

1285
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:26,984
Am I late? I must be late.

1286
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,899
- You going to bed already.
- Oedipus, I...

1287
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:30,727
I know just what you gonna say.

1288
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:32,772
I'm fired
and you're absolutely right.

1289
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:34,470
If a fella can't
get to work on time

1290
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:36,472
he doesn't deserve
to hold the job.

1291
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,257
I hope this will teach me
a lesson. Good bye.

1292
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:42,042
Wait. I forgive you, Oedipus.

1293
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,654
What's more?
I have a special treat for you.

1294
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:47,134
Double nightingales.

1295
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,440
I don't deserve it.

1296
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:51,095
Double nightingales
is my favorite dish.

1297
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,314
Somehow I never seem
to get enough of them.

1298
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:55,534
You'll get enough of them.

1299
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,318
- What's that?
- My lunch.

1300
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:59,930
A hot dogs and the pickle.
Domo, get the mustard.

1301
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:01,975
You are my food taster
and you eat what I eat.

1302
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,542
Oh!

1303
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,718
What are you doing?
Hey, wait a minute.

1304
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,068
That frank would've cost me
four pifix.

1305
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:13,596
Oop! Oww! Oh!

1306
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:15,641
- Now what?
- He wanted to bite me.

1307
01:15:15,728 --> 01:15:17,248
- How do you know?
- Because he bit me.

1308
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:18,470
She won't harm you.

1309
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:20,385
That's Cleopatra,
the royal crocodile.

1310
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:22,518
Well, Cleopatra's made her mark.

1311
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:26,347
She almost tore my toga.
Go away. Shoo! Scram.

1312
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:29,437
Careful, slave,
Cleopatra's of royal descent.

1313
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,222
Well, she doesn't behave like it.

1314
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:33,050
Biting people's togas.

1315
01:15:36,793 --> 01:15:39,665
- The nightingales.
- The nightingales.

1316
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:41,272
- The nightingales.
- The nightingales.

1317
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:42,886
- The nightingales.
- The nightingales.

1318
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:44,278
'The nightingales.'

1319
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:53,852
Egypt.

1320
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,558
Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!

1321
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:09,652
The one without the pasley..

1322
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,219
The one without the pasley
is the one without..

1323
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,707
We'll wait here, Lucius.

1324
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:24,623
Banquet must've started by now.
If the plot fails..

1325
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,495
By the God to save Silvia,
I'll kill the emperor myself.

1326
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:34,502
- After you, major.
- Drink.

1327
01:16:47,777 --> 01:16:49,537
- Oedipus, what's wrong?
- What's the matter?

1328
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:52,651
Oh, I've got a pain, maybe
it's something I'm gonna eat.

1329
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:53,976
Is there a doctor in the house?

1330
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,262
- No.
- Well, alright then.

1331
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,457
I'll run down to his office.

1332
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:58,178
It'll be a little cheaper anyway.

1333
01:16:58,265 --> 01:16:59,702
Taste the nightingales, Oedipus.

1334
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:02,443
You call those nightingales?

1335
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,228
Look, look how tough they are.

1336
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,491
But don't worry,
we have got a dish here

1337
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:09,146
that you'll be crazy about.

1338
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:11,278
- Cheese blintzes.
- Well, I..

1339
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,716
- One cheese blintzes.
- We have no cheese blintzes.

1340
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:16,370
Oedipus, taste.

1341
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:17,676
That's food for your stomach

1342
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,417
but is the food for your soul? No.

1343
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:22,550
- Food for the soul?
- Yes, food for your soul music.

1344
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,987
That's what you need.

Stop. I am not amused.

1380
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,438
- Taste the nightingales.
- Alright, if you insist.

1381
01:19:20,712 --> 01:19:23,236
- What are you doing there?
- She's hungry.

1382
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:26,022
You see I am your food taster
and Cleo is mine.

1383
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:29,112
How dare you risk the life
of a royal crocodile?

1384
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,567
Don't you realize
that might be poisoned?

1385
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:32,811
Do I realize..

1386
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,595
It's an even bet.

1387
01:19:34,682 --> 01:19:36,597
Are you going to eat?

1388
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:43,300
Of course, I'm going to eat.

1389
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:44,910
I like nightingales.

1390
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,130
Why I can eat nightingales
all day long.

1391
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:49,088
You would never make any..

1392
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,226
There's something strange
going on here.

1393
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:58,073
- What do you do about it?
- Nothing, I'm a stranger.

1394
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:00,230
- Yeah, I just came to...
- Send for the chef!

1395
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:03,494
Valerius. Valerius.
Don't touch those nightingales.

1396
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:06,453
- They're poisoned.
- What?

1397
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,673
He did it.
He, Silvia and Josephus.

1398
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,675
They wanna murder you.
The chef just confessed.

1399
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:13,504
- Oh, for heavens..
- I can believe of Josephus.

1400
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:16,376
And this fool would do anything.

1401
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:18,683
But I'm sure you must be
mistaken about the princess.

1402
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:21,947
You're right, she didn't do it.
She didn't even know about it.

1403
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,949
- Just as I thought.
- It is true.

1404
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,733
I wanted you to be destroyed.

1405
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,518
You and your whole rotten empire.

1406
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:28,887
Don't believe her.
She had nothing to do with it.

1407
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:30,173
Hush! Hush.

1408
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,565
The child is hysterical.

1409
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:33,176
Olga, take her away.

1410
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:38,746
You're the bravest man
I've ever known.

1411
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,139
Goodbye, Oedipus.

1412
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,365
The stairway.

1413
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:02,640
Where are you taking me?

1414
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:04,598
To Josephus.

1415
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:05,817
Oh, Olga.

1416
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:12,345
Well, Oedipus, we come to you.

1417
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:13,694
Couldn't you skip me?

1418
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,305
Your Majesty, oughtn't we first

1419
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:17,152
to capture Josephus
before he leaves the city?

1420
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:19,352
I've told you,
I've forgotten nothing, Domo.

1421
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,093
Orders have been given
to kill Josephus

1422
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,878
and anyone who accompanies him.

1423
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,765
The moment they set foot
on the boat in Ostia.

1424
01:21:24,836 --> 01:21:26,925
You did that to Joe,
you double-crossing...

1425
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,579
- Silence.
- Let them speak.

1426
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:29,841
These out his last words.

1427
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:31,799
Alright, I know all about you,
Valerius.

1428
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,845
You and your racket,
you put up palaces

1429
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:35,736
and the people put up
twice as much as they cost.

1430
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,936
- And I've got the proof.
- Enough!

1431
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,807
I commend this very day

1432
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,785
that the food taster, Oedipus,
be thrown to the lions

1433
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:44,073
and torn limb from limb
until he's dead.

1434
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:48,555
Now have you anything to say?

1435
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:51,558
No, I guess
that covers everything.

1436
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:52,951
Take him away.

1437
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:56,954
Forward!

1438
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:00,741
March!

1439
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,323
Forward! March!

1440
01:22:27,464 --> 01:22:30,771
Wait here, Lucius, if Olga
succeeds bring Oedipus with you.

1441
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:33,339
Goodbye, Olga.
May the gods protect you.

1442
01:22:36,603 --> 01:22:38,388
The paper was taken from us
by force.

1443
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:41,130
Oedipus attacked us
in the corridor.

1444
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:43,741
So that's where he got his proof.

1445
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,004
Oedipus.

1446
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:47,658
Where's Joe?
We've gotta stop him.

1447
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:48,983
He and the Princess Silvia
have started for Ostia.

1448
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:50,487
Silvia too? Oh!

1449
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:52,160
We've gotta stop 'em
before they get on that boat

1450
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:53,707
or they'll be killed.

1451
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:55,405
- How far is it, Ostia?
- Fourteen miles.

1452
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:56,972
Quick. Step on the gas.

1453
01:22:59,235 --> 01:23:00,235
Oh!

1454
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,430
Say, how do you stay
in this thing?

1455
01:23:09,462 --> 01:23:11,551
Chain him to the chariot.

1456
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:13,205
- Chain me?
- Yes.

1457
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,511
- Your Majesty?
- Yes.

1458
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:16,208
- Oedipus escaped.
- What?

1459
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,471
Get him immediately.
Catch him dead or alive.

1460
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:20,386
Take my fastest charioteers, Domo.

1461
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:22,473
And remember, your emperor's
honor depends upon it.

1462
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:31,789
Oedipus the food taster
has escaped.

1463
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:33,636
One thousand dinars
to the man who brings him back

1464
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:36,446
dead or alive.
Preferably dead. After him!

1465
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,375
Faster. Faster.
We must get to Ostia.

1466
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,994
Help! Oh, help!

1467
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,056
Oh!

1468
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:40,075
They're after us. Quick!

1469
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:44,035
Faster! Faster!

1470
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,130
Ram him to the wall!

1471
01:24:58,484 --> 01:24:59,790
Look out! Look out!

1472
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:17,112
- After him!
- Come on!

1473
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,383
We've got to stop Joe and Silvia.

1474
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:34,346
There they are! Silvia and Joe.

1475
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:43,312
Hey, Joe, don't go to Ostia.

1476
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:45,879
The emperor, you'll be killed.
They're after us.

1477
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:53,626
Stay off the road. I'll follow.

1478
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:19,348
Lucius? Oh! Oh!

1479
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:23,308
Oh-oh!

1480
01:26:36,365 --> 01:26:37,888
Hey! Look out!

1481
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,340
Oh!

1482
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:58,387
Ow!

1483
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:02,825
Whoo!

1484
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,230
Hey! Hey!

1485
01:27:52,136 --> 01:27:54,094
Faster, faster!

1486
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:40,792
Oh!

1487
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,410
Oh-oh!

1488
01:29:03,512 --> 01:29:04,556
Help!

1489
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:11,954
Oh!

1490
01:29:15,132 --> 01:29:16,132
Oh!

1491
01:29:59,306 --> 01:30:01,221
- What hit me?
- You're alright.

1492
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:03,572
The wagon hardly touch you.
Come on.

1493
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:05,574
Oh, no. Let me go.
I forgot something.

1494
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:07,053
- I've gotta catch Josephus.
- Hm.

1495
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:08,580
I have the evidence
against Valerius.

1496
01:30:08,664 --> 01:30:10,492
- Here in my toga.
- In your what?

1497
01:30:12,145 --> 01:30:15,105
It's gone. But I had a toga.

1498
01:30:15,192 --> 01:30:17,107
And I had the letter
written by the emperor

1499
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:18,195
bribing the senators.

1500
01:30:18,282 --> 01:30:19,892
What are you talking about?

1501
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:23,809
Here. Here is Valerius bribe
to the senators.

1502
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:25,202
Here it is.

1503
01:30:26,638 --> 01:30:28,335
No. No.

1504
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,686
It's Cooper's bribe
to the chief of police.

1505
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:33,123
Let me look.

1506
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:36,082
Eddie, you're coming back
to West Rome with me.

1507
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:39,434
- 'Twenty years.'
- 'He deserves it.'

1508
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:41,000
'It serves him right.'

1509
01:30:41,087 --> 01:30:42,872
The town oughta be
pretty thankful for Eddie.

1510
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:44,264
Eddie oughta get a medal.

1511
01:30:44,351 --> 01:30:45,657
Yes, Sara.

1512
01:30:45,744 --> 01:30:47,746
We'd still be living in the street

1513
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,356
if it wasn't for Eddie.

1514
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:54,666
Pa! Eddie's coming! Pa!

1515
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:56,538
Eddie's coming! Ma!
