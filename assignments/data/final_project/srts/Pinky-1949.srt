1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,309
Good morning, ma'am.

3
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:03,041
Sure is a fine day today, isn't it?

4
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:08,985
Getting this washing up.
Should've had it up long ago too.

5
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,187
If it's Aunt Dicey Johnson
you're lookin' for, ma'am, here I be.

6
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,361
Pinky?

7
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:40,320
- Pinky, child?
- Yes, Granny. It's... It's me.

8
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,126
Pinky. My Pinky.

9
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:52,160
Thank you, Lord,
for bringing my child back to me.

10
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:57,169
She'd be such a far piece and long journey,
and this be the morning of her return.

11
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:57,969
- Amen.
- Granny.

12
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:05,836
No frettin', honey.
'Cause you're home safe and sound.

13
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,744
Come on in and let Granny
scare you up a mite of breakfast.

14
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:09,704
Come on.

15
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,190
Come on, sugar. Come on.

16
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:30,330
Oh, me. It sure do me good
to see you standin' there.

17
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:34,601
Just think. My Pinky baby all growed
up and come home to her old granny.

18
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:39,077
- How did you know I'd come back?
- That's why I sent you away, sugar... so you'd come back.

19
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,514
Come back and help the sick,
the halt and the needy.

20
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,786
Remember what I say
the day I put you on the train?

21
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:53,885
I said, "Pinky, baby,
no matter how far you go...

22
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,828
"how much you learn, you
gotta bring it all back with you.

23
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:01,459
"That's why I'm sending you.
Because the Bible say...

24
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:04,538
A little leaven shall
leaven the whole lump. "'

25
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,468
Granny...

26
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,568
Granny, did you ever think
I might wanna stay up north?

27
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:21,188
There's some things
we gotta trust the Lord about, Pinky...

28
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,449
some things we can't do ourself.

29
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:27,083
We gotta depend on him.

30
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:32,430
Everything just like you left it, sugar.

31
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:58,355
- What is it, Pinky?
- Oh, I wish you'd never sent me away.

32
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,859
You mean, you wish you'd growed up
ignorant, no-account good-for-nothin'?

33
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,464
You wish you'd never learned to read and
write and make your way in this world?

34
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,763
Oh, no, but don't you see?

35
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,794
Yes, Pinky, I do see.

36
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,369
Let me say something
once and for all and never again.

37
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:18,875
Why is it you write me
less and less as time go by?

38
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,245
Why is it after you go to
the hospital, I get no letter at all?

39
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,046
No. You don't need to say nothin'.
You think I don't know.

40
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:29,247
You think poor old ignorant woman
like me livin' in a shack like this...

41
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:33,191
don't know nothin',
but you're wrong, Pinky.

42
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,751
I do know. And I know what you done.

43
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:40,163
And you know I never told you
to pretend you is what you ain't.

44
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:46,723
I didn't mean to, Granny.
It just happened.

45
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:50,507
But that's a sin before God,
and you know it.

46
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:55,446
It was a conductor on the train. He put
me back in another car... the white one.

47
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,576
- But he knowed who you was. I put you where you belonged.
- No. No, no.

48
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,586
It was after that,
when they changed conductors.

49
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,988
- Then why you ain't tell the new conductor?
- Granny, I don't know.

50
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:10,355
- I was only a child.
- Then what about school? What about that?

51
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,160
Other children talk
about their kinfolks, don't they?

52
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:17,931
What you say when they asked you about
your'ns? You tell 'em who your granny is?

53
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,434
Oh, shame... shame be on you, Pinky.

54
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:28,709
Denying yourself like Peter
denied the good Lord Jesus.

55
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:32,308
Here. Get down. Get down.

56
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,445
That's where you belong.
Now you tell the Lord what you done.

57
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,083
Ask his forgiveness
on your immortal soul.

58
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,287
Come on out and get your breakfast. I
don't wanna hear another word from you...

59
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:45,628
<i
>- About what you done again as long as you live. -

60
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,737
<i>Tom.</i>

61
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:03,213
<i>- Tom.
- Tom, please.</i>

62
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:07,344
<i>- Please, Tom.
- Tom.</i>

63
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,344
<i>Tom.</i>

64
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:14,857
<i>Tom.!</i>

65
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:27,924
- Good morning, honey. You up, I see.
- Yes, Granny.

66
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:40,007
You do this much every day?

67
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:44,049
Ain't missed a day 'cept the time I was
down sick with pneumonia three years ago.

68
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:49,487
- Here. I'll help you.
- I ain't sent you away for you to come back and take in washing.

69
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,389
Granny, I was awful glad
when you stopped sending me money.

70
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:56,974
- What you mean?
- I didn't want you breaking your back for me forever.

71
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,525
Stopped? I ain't never missed once.
I give Jake Waters that money...

72
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,128
just like I been doin' every week
since his pa died.

73
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:10,677
I gotta see Jake about that.
Kind of superstitious about him.

74
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,259
I'll go see Jake.
I'll get it back for you.

75
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,771
How much do you get
for a wash like this?

76
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:19,819
- Oh, they don't count, far as money goes.
- You mean you're not paid for it?

77
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:23,969
- Course not. They're Miss Em's.
- Yeah. I can see it's Miss Em's.

78
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:28,050
- You mean to say she doesn't pay you for it?
- Not in cash money.

79
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,427
Miss Em ain't got no cash money.
Besides, she's old now... old and sick.

80
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:36,094
- She has a house full of valuable antiques, hasn't she?
- But they're family things.

81
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,401
Can't sell them.

82
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,807
Besides, why are you
so set agin Miss Em?

83
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,458
<i>- She ain't never hurt you.
- Look at her house.</i>

84
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:51,040
Slave-built, slave-run
and run-down ever since.

85
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:56,680
I went through that gate in her garden
once, just once, when I was a little girl.

86
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:59,953
She ordered me out,
and I'll never forget it.

87
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:03,210
Oh, Miss Em ain't never liked
children traipsin' around in her garden.

88
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,433
Why, when she had that boarding school,
she made them girls play...

89
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,660
on the other side of the house.

90
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:13,638
Guess I'll look in on her now like I do
every morning to see if she's all right.

91
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,847
<i>Tom. Tom.</i>

92
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:03,547
<i>I'll send him a telegram. Western Union.</i>

93
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:08,788
<i>I want to send a telegram.
Yes. Straight wire.</i>

94
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:09,688

96
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:25,110
<i>"Darling. All a terrible mistake.</i>

97
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:29,977
<i>"Returning by the first train.</i>

<i>I love you, love you,
love you, love you. '</i>

100
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:05,812
Get up there.
Come on, you lazy devil. Come on.

101
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,244
Can you tell me where Jake Waters lives?

102
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,749
- Right down on the corner.
- Thank you.

103
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:46,151
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

104
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,633
- This where Jake Waters lives?
- Uh-uh.

105
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:11,112
- You're Jake Waters, aren't you?
- Uh, yes, ma'am, I am.

106
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:14,744
- This is my house here.
- I'm Patricia Johnson.

107
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,258
- Who?
- You know Mrs. Dicey Johnson, don't you? I'm her grandchild.

108
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:19,978
Pinky?

109
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,132
Well, what do you know?
Come right in, Miss Pinky.

110
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:31,693
I'm mighty glad to see you.
Mighty glad. Yes.

111
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:36,708
- I've come to get the money my grandmother gave you to send me.
- Oh, the money! Come on in.

112
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,042
I've been tryin' to get over to see your
granny, but every time I start over there...

113
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,012
something happens to stop me.

114
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,312
Yes, sir.
Mighty busy these days. Mighty busy.

115
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,978
This won't take long.
I shan't ask you...

116
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,113
why you held back the money
so long as you return it.

117
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:54,421
Oh, sure, sure.
Don't worry about it. Sit down.

118
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:58,554
Oh. You know,
you've been away a long time.

119
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,066
- What about the money?
- You'll get it. You'll get it. Every cent of it.

120
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,146
Sit down.

121
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,263
Why'd you come back, Miss Pinky?
Never figured that you would.

122
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:13,039
- Why shouldn't I? This is my home.
- Don't give me that, Miss Pinky.

123
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:17,378
Jake's smart. He sees things.
Man most likely, huh?

124
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:21,214
White man? Couldn't tell him
and couldn't not tell him, huh?

125
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,017
- Look, Jake, I haven't got all...
- Of course. Didn't mean to be nosy, Miss Pinky.

126
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:27,021
Jake's your friend.
He only wants to help you.

127
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,956
Help me by giving me back
my grandmother's money.

128
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:33,527
Oh, yes. The money. Well, I never
keep much cash money on me.

129
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:37,063
- Keep it all in the bank, Miss Pinky.
- Is it far to the bank?

130
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:40,731
Bank's closed today. Saturday.

131
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,400
Very well. You can give me
whatever you have on hand...

132
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,807
and I'll tell my grandmother
you'll pay her the rest on Monday.

133
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:50,610
- Of course, I never keep much money around the house.
- Mind giving me what you have?

134
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:55,316
Just a minute. I'll look around.

135
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,126
<i>This every bit of money I got
in the house. A ten and a five makes $ 15.</i>

136
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,584
<i>I'll tell my grandmother
you'll give her the rest on Monday.</i>

137
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,972
<i>- Monday. Sure.
- You be sure and come by Monday.</i>

138
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:25,263
- I'll be there, all right.
- Jake, what's she doin' with my money?

139
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,409
- Rozelia, you know I didn't...
- What you doin' with my money?

140
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,200
- Rozelia, you know who that is? Miss Pinky.
- I don't care.

141
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,921
- Miss Pinky, that happens to be my money.
- Let go of me!

142
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:38,896
Come high, don't you? Drop that. Why, you...
I'll split you open if you don't give me my money.

143
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,366
Hey there. What's up?

144
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,572
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothin' at all, Captain.

145
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:57,480
- Everything's all right now.
- They been botherin' you, ma'am?

146
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:00,782
Pull your dress up, girl.

147
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:07,020
<i>- Got a knife, Chief.
- Okay. Get it.</i>

148
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,162
Well, I reckon it's just as well
we come up when we did.

149
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:17,168
Uh, just what
was the trouble, ma'am?

150
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:21,262
- I don't care to make any charges.
- Just a minute, if you please.

151
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:25,742
I reckon you're a stranger in this part
of the country, but this fella Jake...

152
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:29,304
- Did he molest you in any way, ma'am?
- No. No.

153
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,373
And the girl.
What about her, ma'am?

154
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:35,648
She even so much as thought of
threatening you, we wanna know about it...

155
00:17:35,683 --> 00:17:37,689
Or if she give you any of her impudence.

156
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,125
- Shut up, girl.
- Excuse me, sir, but why are you two white men "ma'am-ing" her?

157
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,992
She's nothin' but
a low-down colored gal.

158
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,658
- Tried to steal my man.
- Make him stop! Make him stop!

159
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,566
You heard what she said. He's got
to slap her down, unless it's true.

160
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes, it's true. I'm colored.
My grandmother's Mrs. Dicey Johnson.

161
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,672
Mrs. Dicey Johnson!
I oughta slap 'em both down, Chief.

162
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,009
Nah. Hold it.

163
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:05,015
- Why, I think I'll be going now.
- Go?

164
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,144
- You ain't goin' anywhere till I tell you. Get in that car.
- I'm under arrest?

165
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:11,156
- What do you think?
- On what charges are you holding me?

166
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,955
You heard what I said.
Get in that car.

167
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:24,528
Don't worry.
I'll fix it. I know the judge.

168
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,198
Let me handle this.

169
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,651
It looked like there was gonna
be some trouble, and I searched her.

170
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:00,601
Then I took this knife off her,
Judge Walker. It was in her garter.

171
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:03,642
So I just brought 'em all in.

172
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:08,077
- Is this your knife?
- She's the one started trouble, comin' takin' my money.

173
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:12,243
- That'll do. Find anything on the other one?
- Didn't search her.

174
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,212
- Nothin' there, Judge.
- She had plenty time to throw it away.

175
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,494
- Rozelia, I could send you up for this knife business.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,039
And I will if I hear one more word about this
matter... about a knife or razor or any trouble.

177
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:35,164
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

178
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,174
- Now, go.
- Thank you, sir.

179
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,611
- As for you, Jake...
- Yes, sir. I was just...

180
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,979
You've been in this kind of
trouble before.

181
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,141
- After this, keep your hands off other people's money.
- No, sir.

182
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:46,116
Never touch a nickel
that ain't mine, sir.

183
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:50,519
- I'm going to let you off this time.
- Thank you. Much obliged, Judge.

184
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:54,081
- But next time will be the last.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

185
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:58,756
Now it's to you, Pinky. If Jake owes you
money and doesn't pay it, let me know.

186
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,733
- I'll see that he does.
- Thank you.

187
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,804
I remember years ago,
after your mother died.

188
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,136
I remember when Dicey sent you away
to school. Aunt Dicey's a good woman.

189
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:12,745
I've always thought highly of her, and I'd like
to be able to think well of her grandchildren.

190
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,541
I've done nothing, Judge Walker,
and I'm telling you the truth.

191
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:18,550
- I'm not saying you aren't, but...
- But because I'm colored, you don't believe me.

192
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:22,748
You're not sure.
That's it, isn't it?

193
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:26,052
How'd you make out up yonder?

194
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:29,821
I graduated, then I took
three years' training as a nurse.

195
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:33,490
Oh, I didn't know. You managed to do
all that on what Dicey could send?

196
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,227
- Yes.
- Hmm.

197
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:39,202
I won scholarships. I worked,
waited tables. I got along.

198
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,107
Oh, that's good. That's very good.
All the more reason...

199
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,256
you should keep on being a credit
and comfort to your grandmother.

200
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,370
You've had advantages which are
denied to most members of your race...

201
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:51,417
people like Jake
and Rozelia, for example.

202
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,178
Just try to keep out of trouble.
That's all.

203
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,918
Thank you, sir.

204
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,555
- Pinky.
- Yes, Granny?

205
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,836
Why don't you try and...

206
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,347
- Going somewhere, honey?
- Just for a walk.

207
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,099
- Evenin', Sister Johnson.
- Come in, Jake.

208
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:43,066
Stop sneakin' in here
behind me like that too.

209
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,604
I told Miss Pinky I'd drop around,
so here I is, man of my word.

210
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,574
Good. Pinky give me the $15 you give her,
said you'd be here to give me the rest.

211
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,544
I guess she was kind of riled
after that little run-in.

212
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,241
- Run-in? What you mean, run-in?
- Oh, nothing.

213
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:00,944
- You workin' mighty late, Sister Johnson.
- Oh, I reckon I'll die...

214
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:05,354
with the shoes on my feet and that old
smoothin' iron in my hand, good Lord willing.

215
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,689
You're a worker
from way back yonder. Yes, sir.

216
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:12,423
- I always admire a good worker.
- Look who's talkin'.

217
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:17,469
Well, there's work and then there's work.
My biggest work, I do with my brain.

218
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,630
Liable to get top-heavy
overworking that brain, eh, Jake?

219
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:25,652
That's the way to rise up in the world.
No more being the skim milk for Jake.

220
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:30,639
- He's gonna be the cream on top.
- Cream gotta be cream first before it rise.

221
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:34,118
- Where you goin', Sister?
- I gotta take this wash back to Miss Em's.

222
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:34,868
Oh.

223
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:40,447
- Give me that.
- Don't you want me to read it for ya?

224
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:43,028
- Give it back, I say. It's mine.
- I can see... I can see that.

225
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:46,293
Give me that letter!

226
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:52,968
Not gonna read this letter
to nobody.

227
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:57,474
Well, you burned it up, didn't you?
That ain't gonna stop nothin'.

228
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,480
I got a feeling that a fast letter coming
like that is a shadow moving before.

229
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:06,783
- Think so, Jake?
- Folks is coming, they come treadin' on their shadows.

230
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:11,388
Course, I can stop him. Got his
name and address right here in my head.

231
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,959
Didn't I tell you I worked with
my brain? I can write a letter to him.

232
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,861
Say, I never seen
no colored man write like that.

233
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:22,560
Two stamps on the letter and his name and
address in the corner with "M.D." after it.

234
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:26,468
- That means doctor.
- You think you'd be doing right?

235
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:32,045
You wanna keep Miss Pinky, don't you?
I'll send him a telegram.

236
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,102
That'll stop him just like that.

237
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:39,617
Don't you worry, Sister.
Jake's gonna take care of everything.

238
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:45,623
Course, telegrams cost money, and I like
to do everything business-like.

239
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:50,489
That'll be a deductible item
from what I owe you.

240
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:38,601
- Evenin', ma'am. Can we give you a lift?
- No, thank you.

241
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:42,112
Excuse me, ma'am. You must be a stranger
around here. We can't let no white girl...

242
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,581
walk by herself through
this here nigger section.

243
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,618
- I live in this section.
- You what?

244
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:51,019
- I said I live here. Now, just let me alone.
- Lives here? What do you know?

245
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,752
Who'd ever figure that?

246
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,332
- That's the whitest dinge I ever saw.
- Look at that swamp rabbit go.

247
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:15,439
- What do you say, let's go get her?
- Boy, let's go now.

248
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:39,530
We ain't gonna hurt you, baby. Don't be
afraid, baby. We ain't gonna hurt you.

249
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:43,041
- We just wanna have a little fun, baby.
- Take it easy.

250
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,077
Come here, honey.

251
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,044
No! No! Stop! Stop!

252
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,528
- Please! Don't! Don't!
- What a build on her.

253
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:55,943
Let's see your face, baby.
Hold up your face.

254
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:59,602
Oh, you're pretty.
You're pretty. You're real pretty.

255
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:03,212
What's the matter, baby? You want a drink?

256
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:06,753
Hey, Al, give me that bottle.

257
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:10,563
Come back here, gal! Come on back here, gal!

258
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:13,299
Ah, let her go.

259
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:16,535
<i>Pinky? Pinky?</i>

260
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,937
<i>Pinky? Pinky?</i>

261
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,134
<i>- Pinky?
- Granny?</i>

262
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,134
<i>Yes.</i>

263
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:29,341
- What you got the door locked for?
- Granny, what is it?

264
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:33,976
- What's wrong? Tell me, Granny.
- It's Miss Em. Miss Em, honey.

265
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:38,318
- What's the matter with her?
- Oh, Doc Joe say it's her heart again.

266
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:42,986
Her heart give out. It happened while
I was puttin' the linen in the closet...

267
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,461
talkin' to her
when she took her spell.

268
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:49,625
So I run down to the corner fast
as I could, phoned Doc Joe.

269
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,207
- He picked me up on the way back. He come that fast.
- Her heart? How old is she?

270
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:56,792
Oh, a year or two older
than me maybe.

271
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,307
Course, she never
allow that to my face.

272
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:03,246
Lord, I kinda hoped you'd take me
before you took Miss Em.

273
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,807
<i>I kinda hoped you would.
Thy will be done.</i>

274
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:11,083
- Everyone has to die, Granny.
- You're right, baby...

275
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:14,125
but the least we can do
is ease their passin'.

276
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,960
I'm so glad you're here. Seems like the
Lord sent you here out of pure goodness.

277
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:22,964
- Me?
- I say, "Doc Joe... " I say, "Never you mind. "

278
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:26,934
And was I proud to say it.
I say, "Never you mind, sir.

279
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,735
My Pinky's here,
and she's a good nurse. "

280
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,141
- So he's sittin' there waitin' for you right now.
- You told him I'd nurse her?

281
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:37,170
Course, honey. Doc Joe say
everything depend on good nursing.

282
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:41,811
He say she gotta have a trained nurse, and he
can't lay his hand on one for love or money...

283
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,515
<i>if Miss Em had the money,
which she ain't.</i>

284
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,819
Then tell him to keep right
on looking. I'm not interested.

285
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:49,053
- But she'll die.
- Then let her die.

286
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:52,597
- Pinky!
- I didn't mean that, but, Granny, try to understand my side.

287
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:55,360
I only came back here because
I hadn't anywhere else to go.

288
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:59,404
I'd forgotten what it was like. I've been away
a long time. I've known another kind of life.

289
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:04,738
I've been treated like a human being.
Try to understand... like an equal.

290
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:09,178
Don't you see I can't go back into that
house? Haven't I had enough without that?

291
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:09,898
Pinky.

292
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,019
I worked long
and hard to give you an education...

293
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:20,490
and if they done educated
the very heart out you...

294
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,926
everything I've worked
and slaved so hard for is wrong.

295
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:27,123
Now, hear me!
You're goin' up to Miss Em's!

296
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:30,292
You're gonna take good care of her,
like the nurse you is...

297
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:34,737
or I swear on the Holy Bible,
I'll rip the livin' daylights out you!

298
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:58,664
Yes. I'm going away.
I should never have come back here.

299
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:11,741
Here. Let me help you.

300
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:16,178
Kind of wrinkled. Reckon
I'd better run the smoothin' iron...

301
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,649
over it before you pack it.

302
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:24,917
Kind of pretty too. Must take a heap
of studying, learning to be a nurse.

303
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:28,448
The course is three years,
as you know.

304
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,564
- Miss Em didn't have no training at all.
- Why should she?

305
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,497
Her kind never
learns anything useful.

306
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,570
Didn't stop her from nursing me, though, when
I was down sick with pneumonia, fixin' to die.

307
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:42,937
Miss Em nursed you?
I'd like to see that.

308
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:47,273
Where you been living, child? What
sort of stuff they teach you up yonder?

309
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:52,818
Have I put in all my work on you for you to
turn out to be nothin' but low-down trash?

310
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,384
Yes, Pinky.
Miss Em did nurse me.

311
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:08,399
If you don't believe me, ask Doc Joe. Miss
Em stay here, sleep in your little room.

312
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:13,529
She cook for me, feed me with a spoon,
wash my poor, tired body.

313
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:16,939
Even emptied my slops
like she was my loving servant.

314
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:19,943
Now she's fixin' to die...

315
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:24,346
and my own grandchild
done hardened her heart agin her.

316
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:43,629
- Doctor.
- Oh, yes. Glad you could come. She's at pretty low ebb.

317
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,361
Under the hypo right now.

318
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:49,023
No fear of disturbing her.

319
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:54,128
Oh, yes. Pinky, isn't it?
A nurse. Of course.

320
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:58,870
Your granny's talked a lot
about you, but I didn't realize that...

321
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:03,779
Uh, some things
I've jotted down here for you.

322
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,942
Really not very much
we can do right now.

323
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:12,389
She's reached the age where
the mechanism begins to slow down.

324
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:17,361
If she has another attack...
Have you ever given a hypo?

325
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:21,490
- I'm a graduate nurse.
- Yes, yes, of course.

326
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:25,664
Well, I'm very glad to leave
Miss Em with a graduate nurse.

327
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:29,804
No phone in this house,
and I'm pretty hard to get hold of...

328
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,925
so it'll be a matter
of using your own judgment.

329
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,012
- I understand, Doctor. Your hat.
- Oh, no. Here.

330
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:41,985
Yes. Thank you.

331
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,219
You know, of course, that Miss Em
can't afford to pay for a trained nurse.

332
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:49,385
- Or do you?
- I know, Doctor.

333
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,056
Might be some of her old pupils could pay
you something. Most of them still live...

334
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:57,364
No, Doctor. It isn't a question of money.
I'm doing it for my grandmother.

335
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:03,002
- Well, I'll look in tomorrow afternoon.
- Good night, Doctor.

336
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:59,955
- Who are you?
- I'm your nurse.

337
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,361
Dicey's girl, Pinky, aren't you?

338
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:09,289
- Yes.
- Why didn't you say so?

339
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:12,607
Come over here
and let me see you.

340
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:20,785
You didn't call yourself Pinky
when you were off up yonder, did you?

341
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,584
- No.
- Speak up. What name did you go by?

342
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,818
Patricia.

343
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,393
Pinky's better.

344
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:40,218
- What are you doing there?
- Dr. McGill left some pills for you.

345
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:43,733
You didn't think I'm gonna take
any more of Joe McGill's stupid dope?

346
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:47,335
They'll relieve the pain,
Miss Em. You are in pain?

347
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,577
Course I'm in pain. What do you think?
That you die in ease and ecstasy?

348
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:56,678
- What's this thing on my feet?
- Hot water bottle.

349
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,915
Take it away. I won't have it.

350
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,722
Brick's much better.
Over there on the hearth.

351
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:06,628
Put it in the embers.

352
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:13,499
Go to the wardrobe.
Open the door.

353
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:19,374
Look on the second shelf. You'll find
a bit of blanket to cover the brick.

354
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:23,608
Take your hands out of there.
I said the second shelf.

355
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:28,153
Miss Em, I'm not dishonest, if that's what
you're implying. Furthermore, I don't have to...

356
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,654
Miss Em?

357
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:34,290
Miss Em!

358
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,155
Miss Em.

359
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,807
<i>Now, make tracks, y'all.
Don't wanna see hide nor hair of ya...</i>

360
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,808
till tomorrow.

361
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,672
- That you, Pinky honey?
- Yes, Granny.

362
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:06,145
Miss Em ain't...

363
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,833
No. She's better.

364
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:11,486
Praise the Lord.

365
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:18,930
Dr. Joe's with her now. He said for me
to come on down and get some rest.

366
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:22,083
You're supposed to sit with her
for the rest of the afternoon.

367
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:25,201
- Then you get some sleep, honey.
- I don't feel like sleeping.

368
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,396
What you doing
with my clothes?

369
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,373
With you being so busy
and all, I reckoned I'd unpack for you.

370
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,674
Put them back.
They can stay packed till I leave.

371
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,940
It's only a matter
of a few days, at the most.

372
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,812
Doc Joe say that?
A few days?

373
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:44,912
I can see for myself. Oh, for heaven's
sake, Granny, it's only a mean old woman.

374
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,118
She's been driving me and nagging me
ever since she woke up this morning.

375
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,956
She do that?
That's good.

376
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:54,559
- What's good about it?
- Then she do feel better, sure enough.

377
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:58,092
Miss Em start feelin' better,
the more "coniferous" she act.

378
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,434
Pay no attention to her worrisome ways,
sugar. She don't mean nothin' by it.

379
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:04,305
She means to put me
in my place and keep me there...

380
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,741
just as she's kept you
all these years.

381
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:12,442
Oh, Pinky child, when folks is real
friends, there ain't no such thing as place.

382
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:20,155
<i>Hello? Anybody home?</i>

383
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,321
<i>Miss Johnson?</i>

384
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:29,465
I beg your pardon.
You're Miss Pinky Johnson?

385
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:37,398
Yes, sir.
You're looking for me?

386
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,568
- I'm Dr. Canady from over in Leesburg.
- How do you do, Doctor?

387
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:43,477
My wife and I heard you were here. We'd
like you to come over to the house to dinner.

388
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:47,041
- Well, that's...
- If you'll just set the date... any night that's convenient.

389
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:49,882
I'm on a case now,
and after that, I'm going away.

390
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:53,981
When you come back then. Your being here
is the best news we had in a long time.

391
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,721
We had some girls over in Leesburg,
high school graduates...

392
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:58,887
with no chance
for regular training.

393
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:02,831
- With your help, we can set up a real nursing school.
- It's out of the question.

394
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:06,029
<i
>- You see. - Excuse me. How are you and your family these days?

395
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:09,505
- Fine, thank you, Aunt Dicey.
- You see, I...

396
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,204
I'm not planning
to come back.

397
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:19,781
I see. I have never been north.
I took my M.D. at Meharry.

398
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:23,747
I was tempted to go, of course,
but I felt my job was here.

399
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:28,793
These girls I was telling you about, it's
gonna be kind of hard to disappoint them.

400
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:32,445
I'm sorry, but my plans
are all made.

401
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,062
Well, good luck
to you, Miss Johnson.

402
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,417
<i>Get the feet.</i>

403
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,488
Mind that candlestick.

404
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:10,193
My great-grandfather bought that when
they sold Thomas Jefferson's things.

405
00:41:10,228 --> 00:41:15,228
Things. Hmm.
They last longer than people.

406
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:18,287
This furniture was made
to present to Henry Clay...

407
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:21,311
if he was elected,
but the voters thought different...

408
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:25,213
and Grandfather bought it
at auction.

409
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,867
Look what you've done.
My best brooch.

410
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:32,452
Well, you've looked
at it long enough.

411
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:36,152
- What do you think of it?
- It's very nice, Miss Em.

412
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:38,319
Don't be evasive. I want the truth.
What do you think of it?

413
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:42,958
It's one of those rather clever imitations
one can buy in the chain stores for a dollar.

414
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:48,301
Ninety-eight cents.
Any fool would know that.

415
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:51,137
Now, go dust that center table.
Bring me a pitcher of water.

416
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,724
Miss Em, I've already done
those things, and you know it.

417
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:56,868
- Don't be impudent.
- It isn't impudent to say what's true.

418
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:59,977
I'm a trained nurse,
and I won't be spoken to like that.

419
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:05,717
You don't like it here:
why did you come?

420
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:08,952
Because my grandmother said she'd whip the
living daylights out of me if I didn't.

421
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:12,826
That Dicey. Nobody
like her. Did she really say that?

422
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:17,265
- That's the sort of answer you want to hear, isn't it?
- No.

423
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,361
I prefer the truth.

424
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:23,532
You forgot that fire screen.

425
00:42:26,145 --> 00:42:29,602
Don't be so upset.
I'll be dead soon...

426
00:42:29,637 --> 00:42:32,547
<i>and you'll be free
to go back north again.</i>

427
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:35,483
Going to give up your nursing
when you get back up yonder?

428
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:40,023
Nursing's my profession. In certain
places, a nurse is treated with respect.

429
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:44,529
Nobody deserves respect as long as
she pretends to be something she isn't.

430
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:48,122
How I live my life
is my own business, Miss Em.

431
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:52,210
Course it is. It isn't your husband's
business or your children's.

432
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:56,229
You can go now, Pinky. I'll be all right
till your grandmother comes.

433
00:42:56,264 --> 00:43:00,971
You can't dismiss me as you did when I was
a child and you drove me out of your garden.

434
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:03,891
Oh, you remember.

435
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:06,742
Yes. Very clearly.

436
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:10,413
What do you want me to do, stay here and
live this sort of life when I don't have to?

437
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:13,424
Just prove you're addicted
to the truth, like you pretend.

438
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,652
Wherever you are, be yourself.

439
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:19,856
What am I then? You tell me. You're the
ones that set the standards, you whites.

440
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:22,194
You're the ones that judge people
by the color of their skins.

441
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:26,485
By your own standards, by the only ones
that matter to you, I'm as white as you are.

442
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,707
<i>That's why you all hate me. What should
I do? Dye my face? Grovel and shuffle?</i>

443
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:36,247
Say "yes'm" and "no'm"? Marry some man like
Jake Waters? Carry a razor in my stocking?

444
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:42,248
Nobody hates you, Pinky.

445
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:45,880
<i>Don't just stand there.
When you leave the room, go quickly.</i>

446
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,721
I hate dawdling.

447
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:11,249
Pat!

448
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:21,754
- Oh, darling.
- Oh, if you only knew what I went through finding you.

449
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:27,656
What's wrong? What got into you,
running off like that?

450
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:31,167
- How did you find me?
- I got your old address from the nuns' school...

451
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:35,263
and then that crazy telegram
came, signed Pinky Johnson.

452
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:39,367
- Why "Pinky"?
- I didn't send you any wire.

453
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,942
Come on.
Come on up to the house.

454
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:48,112
What's it all about, Pat?
I can see you're working, but why here?

455
00:44:48,147 --> 00:44:52,248
Why didn't you want me to know?
What are you doing, charity work?

456
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:55,555
No. I live here.

457
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:08,829
Is that it? Is it because you were ashamed
of telling me you lived in a place like this?

458
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:11,808
<i>I often wondered why you never
spoke about your home and family, but...</i>

459
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:15,176
Don't you know who lives
in this kind of house?

460
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:24,388
Come on in.

461
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:29,624
Come here, Tom.

462
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:35,798
There's an old colored woman
who can't read or write...

463
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,630
a washerwoman
people around here call Aunt Dicey.

464
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:43,299
There's the basket she carries her
clothes in. There's the ironing board.

465
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:48,073
And those are the heavy irons
she heats on that old wood stove.

466
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:51,706
<i>Year in and year out,
she's washed and ironed...</i>

467
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:54,820
<i>and carried her clean clothes
to people's back doors...</i>

468
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:58,480
<i>through rain and cold
and the heat of summer.</i>

469
00:45:58,515 --> 00:46:02,583
<i>And she saved her money and lived
on scraps white people gave her.</i>

470
00:46:02,618 --> 00:46:06,893
<i>Why? For me. So she could
send me off to school...</i>

471
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:09,660
<i>so I could learn to be a nurse.</i>

472
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:14,501
So her granddaughter would be spared
the kind of life she's had to live.

473
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,838
- Her granddaughter?
- Yes. Her granddaughter.

474
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:21,588
Me.

475
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:26,278
Now you understand.

476
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:33,692
- Pat...
- My name is Pinky.

477
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:47,094
She's coming.
Tom, please... please go.

478
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:50,182
- I don't want her to find you here.
- I've got a car. We'll drive.

479
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:53,236
- No. No.
- Not until you tell me the whole story. Come on, Pat.

480
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:30,797
And then, that day at the hospital,
I met you for the first time.

481
00:47:30,832 --> 00:47:34,316
At first, I tried to keep you away,
even to the point of being rude.

482
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,513
That's true,
isn't it? Remember?

483
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:43,288
But you wouldn't give up. I thought I could
take the chance of seeing you, being with you.

484
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:50,766
I'd never been in love. I never
dreamed it would ever be serious.

485
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:55,770
When I found it was, a kind of daring
came over me, with your love.

486
00:47:55,805 --> 00:48:00,740
So I thought I could have everything.
For a few weeks I believed it...

487
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:04,406
until you wanted
to get married right away.

488
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:08,452
Remember? You said I'd have
to make up my mind sometime.

489
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:13,383
Then I realized what
my decision would have to be.

490
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,840
So I ran.

491
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,832
- Poor Pat...
- I'm not looking for pity, and don't tell me it doesn't matter.

492
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:26,803
- I couldn't stand that.
- I won't lie to you. Of course it matters.

493
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:31,204
It makes... makes problems,
important problems.

494
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,336
- But let's try and face them like rational people.
- Rational.

495
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:43,081
What's rational about prejudice?

496
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:55,564
I don't think I'm prejudiced. I'm a
doctor and I hope enough of a scientist...

497
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,468
not to believe in the mythology
of superior and inferior races.

498
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,738
It is a tricky business, though.

499
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:09,245
You never know what exists
deep down inside yourself.

500
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,545
I want to be absolutely sure
nothing like that exists inside of me.

501
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,247
You'd be so easy to hurt, Pat.

502
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:21,052
In this case, too much kindness
could easily be misunderstood...

503
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:24,095
and hurt worse
than cruelty.

504
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:28,700
A man should be able to lose
his temper and cuss out his wife...

505
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:32,497
once in a while without her
misunderstanding the reason.

506
00:49:32,532 --> 00:49:36,095
That's why I didn't give way
to my impulse when you first told me.

507
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,709
I wanted to sort of hold myself
under a microscope a little bit longer...

508
00:49:38,744 --> 00:49:41,006
till I could be sure I was right.

509
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:46,049
- What do you mean?
- I've got two reservations on the plane from Birmingham.

510
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:53,047
I don't know.

511
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:57,595
I don't know.

512
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:02,799
- Come on, Pat. We've got an hour to catch our train.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

513
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:08,202
- Darling, I love you.
- Tom, we can't... Wait...

514
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:11,537
- I couldn't help myself, even if I wanted to.
- I don't know. I don't...

515
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:14,838
That's the important thing. The rest
of it we can work out between ourselves.

516
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:18,781
It'll be our secret.
Nobody else will ever know it.

517
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:31,027
Here.

518
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:35,156
- Come on. We'll stop at your house and pick up your things.
- Tom, I can't go with you now.

519
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:37,132
- Why not?
- Not now. I'm on a case.

520
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,499
- Let them get somebody else.
- This isn't just a case. It's a debt that has to be repaid.

521
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:42,368
- That's the true reason?
- Oh, I swear it is. I'm through with running away.

522
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:46,638
- You're being honest? You promise you'll come as soon as you can?
- I'll take the next train.

523
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:50,943
- If you don't, I'll be here wanting to know why.
- Oh, I will!

524
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:10,535
- George, you still drive too fast.
- Yes, ma'am.

525
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,864
Well, shut off the engine.

526
00:51:26,685 --> 00:51:32,020
About time.
Oh, so you're the one.

527
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:37,618
I'd heard you were light, but I'd no idea
you were... Well, you're practically white.

528
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:43,232
- What is it that you want, please, ma'am?
- I'm here to see Miss Emma.

529
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:47,451
- I'm sorry. She's not supposed to receive visitors.
- I'm her cousin, Mrs. Wooley.

530
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:51,635
Oh, yes, Mrs. Wooley. Well, if you'll wait
down here, I'll see if Miss Em can see you.

531
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:56,373
- How is she?
- She's improving. Won't you have a chair, please?

532
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:14,899
- Miss Em, I'm afraid...
- I know. Let her come up. But don't leave me alone with her.

533
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:18,531
- She'll wanna be alone with you, Miss Em.
- Well, I don't.

534
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:22,129
<i
>- How is my dear Cousin Em today? -

535
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:27,779
Well, I'll find out.

536
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,146
Sit in that chair.

537
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,649
If I knock over the bell, tell her I have to
have an enema or something. Get rid of her.

538
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:38,951
- But Miss Em, I've just started your luncheon.
- Do what you're told, honey.

539
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:43,959
- Oh, Mrs. Wooley, Miss Em can see you now.
- I know. I can hear.

540
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,791
Cousin Em, what do you mean,
gettin' sick like this?

541
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:49,923
When you're 80 years old,
you expect to be sick. Sit down.

542
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,004
<i>Now, now. Naughty, naughty.
Eighty years young is what we say.</i>

543
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,768
I don't. It's old,
and I won't have it minimized.

544
00:52:57,803 --> 00:53:01,339
Takes a lot of livin' to get
there and pure, cursed endurance.

545
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:04,841
- Eighty years young indeed!
- Yes, yes, Cousin Em. Of course.

546
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:08,783
- That's all now. I'll be sitting here with Cousin Em.
- Stay there, Pinky.

547
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,687
She's a trained nurse.
I want her there in case I have a spell.

548
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:16,022
Oh. Now, tell me, dear.
Are you being taken care of?

549
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:19,028
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing.

550
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:23,300
Jeffers and I have been away on holiday,
and we didn't know a thing until yesterday.

551
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:27,216
<i>I said to Jeffers, "I'm gonna see
Cousin Em tomorrow no matter how busy I am.</i>

552
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:30,680
<i>I just have to know whether she's
getting every single thing she needs. '</i>

553
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:34,110
And Jeffers said to me, "Melba, that's
just like you. You can never rest...

554
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:36,145
"till you know
you've done your duty.

555
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,978
And if you can take a little sunshine into
the life of that poor old soul, you'll... "

556
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,688
Cousin Em?

557
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:50,321
She's nappin'.

558
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:57,561
- Or is she doped?
- Just tired. She's been very ill.

559
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:03,067
Well, I'll just
sit here till she wakes up.

560
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:07,474
Oh, Pinky, I do believe I forgot to tell
George to put the brake on my car.

561
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:10,810
Go down there
and make sure it's on.

562
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,180
- Cousin Em...
- I never nap, and I'm not doped.

563
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:23,226
- My goodness, she's whiter than I am!
- Prettier too.

564
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,591
Well, it just
gives me the creeps.

565
00:54:25,626 --> 00:54:28,062
Seriously, Cousin Em. I gotta
talk to you alone. It's important.

566
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,966
I came in to warn you about this girl, Pinky.
My new maid, Rozelia, knows all about her.

567
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:35,486
Now, Melba. I'm not gonna soil
my ears by listening to kitchen gossip.

568
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:38,972
But for all you know, lyin' up here
in bed, she's stealin' you blind.

569
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:41,636
Oh, Melba.

570
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:45,077
I think I left my brooch
over there on the bureau.

571
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:48,448
- See if it's still there.
- Well, I certainly will.

572
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:52,284
I most certainly will.
That's just what I been talking about.

573
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,452
<i>- Oh, is this it?
- Yes.</i>

574
00:54:56,487 --> 00:54:59,955
<i
>- Well, thank goodness. It's still here. - Oh.

575
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,423
Mrs. Wooley,
George says your brake is still on.

576
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,958
- What do you think of the brooch?
- Hmm?

577
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:12,304
Oh! Oh, it's lovely, Cousin Em.
Priceless. A real antique.

578
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:16,107
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, I know you like jewelry.

579
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:20,651
Just wanted to be sure.
I was thinkin' of makin' my will.

580
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:23,914
Oh, Cousin Em,
you mustn't think of such a thing.

581
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:28,492
Why, it isn't as if you had a lot of relatives.
Jeffers and I are the only two you got.

582
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:33,062
And I know how strongly you feel
about keepin' things in the family.

583
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:37,515
What an idea to make a will.
Why, you'll live years and years, dear!

584
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,934
Pinky's a nurse. She graduated
from one of the best hospitals up yonder.

585
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:45,771
Let's ask her.
Think I should be makin' my will?

586
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:49,847
Well, if you were ever gonna make a will,
Miss Em, it's time you were getting it done.

587
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:55,147
There, Melba. There's
a nurse's opinion. Very sensible...

588
00:55:55,182 --> 00:55:57,277
especially as it agrees
with my own.

589
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,481
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.
Miss Em must rest now.

590
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:04,561
Well, she looks fine to me, and besides, we
haven't finished our little visit yet, have we?

591
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:08,690
I do feel a little queer.
Maybe I have another fit comin' on.

592
00:56:08,725 --> 00:56:11,233
- Fit?
- That's the way they start.

593
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:15,896
- Then I go clean out of my head.
- Oh.

594
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:19,442
Well, in that case,
I guess I had better be on my way.

595
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:23,639
- Oh, you going? But you'll come back, won't you?
- Oh, yes, dear.

596
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:27,911
I'll be in first thing next week.
I certainly will.

597
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:31,454
And no more nonsense about
making a will, you naughty girl.

598
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,491
No more nonsense!

599
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:40,781
Stop that. I won't have
you laughing at my relatives.

600
00:56:40,816 --> 00:56:44,699
Sorry, Miss Em.
She's not a blood relative, is she?

601
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,834
She married my cousin, Jeffers Wooley.
He's my first cousin, once removed.

602
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:52,934
He nearly removed himself clean out
of the family when he married her.

603
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:56,570
Jeffers never did have much sense.

604
00:56:56,605 --> 00:57:00,344
His father wanted him to study law.
Didn't have the brains for it.

605
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:03,853
<i>Took up insurance.
Tried to sell me a policy.</i>

606
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,388
Life insurance, he called it.

607
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,461
I asked him if it would insure that I should
live one day longer that the Lord allows.

608
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:13,981
He said it didn't, so I said,
"Well, call it death insurance.

609
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:17,466
You oughta be ashamed mentioning
it to one of your own family. "

610
00:57:21,907 --> 00:57:24,503
Why are you
standing there for?

611
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:26,508
Do you want tea or milk
with your lunch?

612
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,806
- Coffee.
- Miss Em, you know the doctor said...

613
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:31,212
I said coffee,
and make it strong.

614
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,613
Yes, Miss Em.

615
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:36,346
<i>And, Pinky,
when you bring my tray...</i>

616
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:38,580
bring me paper, pen and ink.

617
00:57:38,615 --> 00:57:42,284
<i>When you've washed the dishes, you
can take the rest of the afternoon off.</i>

618
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,793
I don't like to leave
you alone, Miss Em.

619
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,659
- Then send Dicey over.
- She can't stay long.

620
00:57:47,694 --> 00:57:51,098
- This is her afternoon to take the wash into town.
- Don't argue.

621
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,467
Do as I say. Don't want you
back here till after 5:00.

622
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:57,632
<i>- Yes, Miss Em.
- Make that coffee strong.</i>

623
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:01,405
- I want the spoon to stand up in it.
- Yes, Miss Em.

624
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:27,797
Miss Em!

625
00:59:57,062 --> 01:00:00,326
- Miss Em! Miss Em.
- Why am I in bed for?

626
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:03,127
- Thought I was sittin' in a chair.
- You've had another attack.

627
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:05,258
You've been up
and doing too much.

628
01:00:05,293 --> 01:00:07,769
Whose business is it
if I do too much, I'd like to know?

629
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,897
Nobody's at all
if you want to shorten your life.

630
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:13,000
- Flat on her back.
- No. No. Prop me up.

631
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:15,135
Give me some pillows.

632
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,237
I'm not gonna lie flat
until I'm laid out.

633
01:00:18,272 --> 01:00:22,649
- Be soon enough now.
- Might as well let her have her own way.

634
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:26,485
That's all I ever wanted...
to have my own way.

635
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,320
Here.
Open your mouth.

636
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:33,124
- What's that? Dope?
- Open your mouth.

637
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:40,963
I want some fresh water.
It's stuck in my throat.

638
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:43,768
<i>No, I said fresh water.</i>

639
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:51,546
Close the door behind you.
There's a draft in here.

640
01:00:53,184 --> 01:00:56,537
<i
>- - I don't want that girl knowin' my business.

641
01:00:56,572 --> 01:00:59,890
Now, go over there and look
on the second shelf...

642
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:02,049
in that book.

643
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:04,285
No, no.
The other end. The other end.

644
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,727
There. Now, open the book.
There's an envelope in it.

645
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:11,893
Get the envelope.
Bring it here.

646
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:15,782
- That's my will, and I want you to witness it.
- Of course. Surely.

647
01:01:15,817 --> 01:01:19,636
- No. You don't have to read it. I just want you to sign it.
- Mmm.

648
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:23,372
Here. You'll have to sign it
again... in my presence.

649
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:27,073
- You know my signature.
- Sign it again, please.

650
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:29,448
These things
have to be done legally.

651
01:01:29,483 --> 01:01:34,547
Oh, lawyers have more fool
rigamarole than doctors.

652
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:39,925
There. Now, put it back
in the envelope.

653
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,329
Seal it up.

654
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:45,792
Put it away.

655
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,419
Who's your executor?

656
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:51,733
- You are.
- Me?

657
01:01:51,768 --> 01:01:55,869
- Isn't Judge Walker your lawyer?
- He's retiring.

658
01:01:55,904 --> 01:01:57,880
Aren't you my friend?

659
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:06,714
No.
Never mind that now.

660
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:09,258
I don't need it.
It's gone down.

661
01:02:10,662 --> 01:02:14,264
You didn't think
I'm plannin' to die this minute?

662
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:17,867
I'll be up to meet my classes
right after holidays.

663
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:19,937
Mm-hmm.

664
01:02:21,306 --> 01:02:24,263
My school...

665
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:28,470
What'll the girls be doin'
with me in bed?

666
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:31,810
Don't you worry, now.
You'll be up and around in a few days.

667
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:34,350
Try to get some sleep now.

668
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,723
A fine woman.
One of the old school.

669
01:03:21,758 --> 01:03:26,200
Never afraid to speak her mind or take
a stand for what she thought was right.

670
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:29,261
- How long, Doctor?
- Can't tell.

671
01:03:29,296 --> 01:03:34,470
Extraordinary vitality,
but the last attack...

672
01:03:34,505 --> 01:03:38,845
Perhaps a week.
Perhaps only a few hours.

673
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,918
Isn't there anything...

674
01:03:42,353 --> 01:03:45,405
There, now.
You did a good job.

675
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,458
I might even say a devoted job.

676
01:03:49,594 --> 01:03:53,724
Well, I'll stop in
first thing tomorrow.

677
01:03:53,759 --> 01:03:56,299
- Good night.
- Good night, Doctor.

678
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:42,495
<i>Twenty cents, please.</i>

679
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:51,171
- Somethin' for ya, ma'am?
- Yes. Do you have any mourning veils, please?

680
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:53,512
Right this way, ma'am.

681
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:05,460
This is our best quality, ma'am... 2.98...

682
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,224
and the last
we got in stock.

683
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:11,095
Yes. That'll be fine.
I'll take it.

684
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,733
I'll allow you're goin'
to Miss Em's funeral, ma'am.

685
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:16,301
- They say she had a lot of friends.
- Miss Viola.

686
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:19,137
- Come wait on me, please.
- Sorry, Ms. Wooley. Just a minute, please.

687
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:21,403
- I'll be right with ya.
- Where's Mr. Goolby?

688
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:25,448
- Excuse me, please, ma'am. I only meant I was waitin' on someone.
- Mr. Goolby!

689
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:28,130
<i
>- I only have to wrap this and get the change. - Mr. Goolby.!

690
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:30,742
Why, yes, Mrs. Wooley, what can
I do for you today, please, ma'am?

691
01:06:30,777 --> 01:06:34,790
Since when has it been your policy
to wait on nigras before white folks?

692
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,516
Why, I...
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley. I'm...

693
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:41,392
I'm sure that Miss Viola just...
just didn't see you.

694
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:44,557
<i>- Miss-Miss Viola.
- Well, I'm... I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.</i>

695
01:06:44,592 --> 01:06:48,096
<i>I should think you would be. I'll repeat...
Since when has it been your policy...</i>

696
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:51,600
Now, just what would you be interested in
this morning? We have some nice broadcloth.

697
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:53,574
- We also have some...
- What's that?

698
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:58,045
Well, that's the money...
the money, ma'am, she gave me... $5.00.

699
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:05,652
- Is that Miss Em's money?
- No, Mrs. Wooley.

700
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:11,792
<i>Would you mind tellin' me
where you did get it?</i>

701
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:15,024
I don't care to say
where I got it, Mrs. Wooley.

702
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,226
Well, that's all you'll get away with.
You can rest assured of that.

703
01:07:18,261 --> 01:07:20,496
Charge this.

704
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,538
What's going on?

705
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:26,157
I'll take my veil now,
Mr. Goolby...

706
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:28,706
unless you don't sell
to colored people.

707
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:32,942
I'm in business to sell goods, and
your money's good if it's honest money.

708
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:36,147
It's honest money.
My grandmother earned it...

709
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:39,317
by harder work
than selling goods over a counter.

710
01:07:39,352 --> 01:07:43,120
Do you wish
to sell me the veil?

711
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,080
4.98.

712
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,434
Very well, Mr. Goolby.
My change, please.

713
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:27,632
When are you fixin'
to leave, honey?

714
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:30,103
Oh, uh...

715
01:08:30,138 --> 01:08:32,800
in the morning.

716
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:35,901
There's a train at 9:00.

717
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:41,075
Then, in that case, I'm gonna fix ya
a nice, hot supper tonight.

718
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,847
Oh, Granny,
please don't trouble yourself.

719
01:08:43,882 --> 01:08:45,855
I don't...

720
01:08:48,826 --> 01:08:50,884
<i>Oh.</i>

721
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,325
<i>- Howdy, Aunt Dicey.
- Howdy, Doc Joe.</i>

722
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,830
<i>- Howdy, Pinky.
- Here. Have a chair, Dr. Joe.</i>

723
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,265
- Somebody sick out this way?
- No. Nobody's sick.

724
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,532
I... got some news for you, and I thought
the sooner you knew it, the better.

725
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,574
<i>Copy of Miss Em's will.</i>

726
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:08,679
She left her pa's law books
to her cousin, Mr. Wooley.

727
01:09:08,714 --> 01:09:10,803
Family portraits too.

728
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:12,813
And her jewelry to Mrs. Wooley.

729
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:16,818
Good, 'cause Mrs. Wooley sure likes
all kinds of geegaws and fixin's.

730
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,155
"To my faithful servant and
friend, Dicey Johnson, colored...

731
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:23,422
I leave all personal clothing
of which I died possessed. "

732
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:26,997
Bless her heart. Sometimes I think
she always get her shoes extra big...

733
01:09:27,032 --> 01:09:30,431
'cause when these fit her just
right, they pinch my bunion.

734
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:33,900
And I'm mighty proud
to have her clothes too.

735
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,666
Miss Em left you the house,
Pinky, and everything in it.

736
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:40,072
<i>The land too... about 20 acres.</i>

737
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:42,474
"The remainder of my estate
I give and bequeath...

738
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:45,479
"to the aforesaid
Dicey Johnson's granddaughter, Pinky.

739
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:49,881
<i>"This bequest being an expression
of my genuine regard for her...</i>

740
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:53,787
<i>and my confidence in the use
to which she will put this property. '</i>

741
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,725
- That what the paper say?
- Here. Read it for yourself.

742
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,954
<i>It say it for a fact, Doc Joe?</i>

743
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:02,155
<i>That's the way she wrote it.</i>

744
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:05,011
<i>But if I were you,
I wouldn't count on it just yet.</i>

745
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:07,833
You see, the Wooleys...
Mrs. Wooley in particular...

746
01:10:07,868 --> 01:10:09,871
figured on gettin' all that stuff.

747
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,463
<i>Hear they've already hired a lawyer.</i>

748
01:10:12,498 --> 01:10:15,170
You mean, they're gonna contest it?
On what grounds?

749
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:18,907
Undue influence, I suppose...

750
01:10:18,942 --> 01:10:23,510
question Miss Em's sanity,
that sort of thing.

751
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:25,781
There's already been some talk.

752
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:29,086
So that's why Mrs. Wooley
and those men in town...

753
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:32,688
Don't you think
Miss Em was sane?

754
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:34,662
Far as I know, she was.

755
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,267
That last night her mind
wandered a bit...

756
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:39,733
but that's not unnatural.

757
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:43,237
You just keep that if you want
to look it over some more.

758
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,037
But I don't believe
I'd count on gettin' it.

759
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:48,372
<i>Better wait and see.</i>

760
01:10:48,407 --> 01:10:52,676
I don't know how the folks
around here are gonna take this.

761
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:11,165
I wonder why she did it.

762
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:17,437
Ain't you gonna finish
your fried chicken, honey?

763
01:11:17,472 --> 01:11:20,922
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I wonder why she did it.

764
01:11:20,957 --> 01:11:24,372
Well, Miss Em had grown
powerful fond of you.

765
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:26,574
But she should've known better.

766
01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:29,446
Pinky, I've lived
in this world a long time...

767
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:33,387
long enough to know for sure if it's somethin'
white folks don't want you to have...

768
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,520
or somethin' they
want for their self...

769
01:11:35,555 --> 01:11:37,618
you might as well
forget all about it.

770
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:39,923
But she meant me to have it.

771
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,293
"Expression
of my genuine regard for her...

772
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:46,459
and my confidence in the use
to which she will put this property. "

773
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:49,903
- What did she mean?
- That don't mean nothin' where the white folks is concerned.

774
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:54,603
<i
>- 'Sides, you goin' back up yonder, so why... -

775
01:12:04,588 --> 01:12:08,717
- Evenin', Sister Johnson. Evenin', Miss Pinky.
- Hello, Jake.

776
01:12:08,752 --> 01:12:12,439
Well, I just started uptown,
and I thought I'd stop by for a while.

777
01:12:12,474 --> 01:12:15,752
Well, Miss Pinky, I hear as how
you got some property comin' to ya.

778
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:19,031
- What else have you heard?
- Well, the white folks are sayin'...

779
01:12:19,066 --> 01:12:21,433
you kept Miss Em
doped all the time.

780
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:25,338
They say she must have been out of her head,
and you must've made her write that will.

781
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:27,968
- It's nonsense, and they know it.
- Is or ain't, I don't know.

782
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:30,876
But it sure spells
trouble for somebody.

783
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,895
If I was you, Miss Pinky, I'd stick
close to the house for a while.

784
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,879
- She's leavin' first thing in the morning.
- Goin' back up north?

785
01:12:36,914 --> 01:12:39,501
- Yes.
- That's good.

786
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:42,053
That's mighty good.

787
01:12:42,088 --> 01:12:44,649
Then Ms. Wooley
get the property by default.

788
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:48,356
- Everything's fine... no trouble for nobody.
- Is that the law?

789
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:52,891
Default? Well, unless you get
a lawyer to file an answer.

790
01:12:52,926 --> 01:12:57,133
Of course, me, I've had considerable
dealings with the law, but I ain't licensed.

791
01:12:57,168 --> 01:13:00,836
But even if I was licensed,
I wouldn't touch your case...

792
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,778
for a stack
of hundred dollar bills that high.

793
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:08,181
I got a nice house
and no fire insurance.

794
01:13:10,788 --> 01:13:13,347
And I'm glad you decided
to be sensible about this thing.

795
01:13:13,382 --> 01:13:16,460
Because if you hadn't, I was gonna make
reservations across the state line...

796
01:13:16,495 --> 01:13:19,188
and go fishin'
for three or four weeks.

797
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:26,169
Oh, what is it?
What is it, child?

798
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:37,968
Pinky.

799
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:44,753
Pinky, tell me.
What are you fixin' to do?

800
01:13:48,225 --> 01:13:53,094
I'll be staying on for a while,
till this business is settled.

801
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:55,130
Miss Em meant me
to have the house...

802
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:58,702
and I'm not gonna give it up
to please Mrs. Wooley...

803
01:13:58,737 --> 01:14:01,600
or anybody.

804
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:06,675
Granny.

805
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:18,253
Can't do it, Pinky.
You know that I'm retiring.

806
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:21,187
As judge, yes, sir. But that
leaves you free to take my case.

807
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:23,487
Frankly, I don't want to get
mixed up in this.

808
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:26,357
There's too much feelin', too many tales
around about you and Miss Em.

809
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:28,953
- They're not true, sir.
- Possibly they're not, but...

810
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:31,675
Say, perhaps you could compromise...
settle it out of court.

811
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,327
<i>- I'm sure Mrs. Wooley would be generous.
- With my property?</i>

812
01:14:34,362 --> 01:14:37,531
- Court'll decide whose it is.
- It won't even come up before the court...

813
01:14:37,566 --> 01:14:39,904
unless I can
induce a lawyer to act for me.

814
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:44,378
But you don't want a lawyer who thinks
the will was ill-considered and a mistake.

815
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:48,512
All right, sir.
Good-bye.

816
01:14:51,455 --> 01:14:53,945
Judge Walker, Miss Em
was your lifelong friend.

817
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,619
Whether the will was a mistake or not, wouldn't
she expect you to help carry out her wishes?

818
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:08,104
- I'll take your case.
- Thank you, sir. Of course, I'll pay the customary fees.

819
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:11,373
Oh, no. There'll be expenses you'll have
to meet, but there won't be any fee.

820
01:15:11,408 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm a fool to take your case and
the only one who can win it for you...

821
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:17,171
but if I'm gonna get into a fight,
it'll be on clean ground.

822
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:20,148
Come see me tomorrow.

823
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,588
<i>But it was Miss Em who owned the
property, and she wanted this girl to have it.</i>

824
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,591
- But that isn't the point. Doc.
- It's the principle.

825
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,661
Dr. Joe?

826
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:37,999
- Come on. See ya later, Doc.
- Be seein' ya, Doc.

827
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,900
Dr. Joe, could you help me...
help me to find a job?

828
01:15:41,935 --> 01:15:45,440
I only need a few days...
to help cover the court expenses...

829
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:47,407
and I can't ask Granny.

830
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,707
She's been ill lately,
hasn't been able to work at all.

831
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:52,974
Might as well face it, Pinky.

832
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:55,209
I couldn't possibly
get you a job now.

833
01:15:55,244 --> 01:15:58,448
A lot of the folks even down
on my neck about this thing...

834
01:15:58,483 --> 01:16:01,652
blamin' me for puttin' you
over there in the first place.

835
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,990
- If it isn't too much, I could...
- Oh, no, Doctor.

836
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:07,689
Thank you. I'll find a way.

837
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:12,202
Good-bye.

838
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:27,864
Hello.

839
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:36,372
Pinky?

840
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:42,214
Yes, Granny?

841
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,460
Tom.

842
01:17:51,535 --> 01:17:56,563
Darling, come here.
Granny.

843
01:17:56,598 --> 01:18:00,074
Granny, this is
Dr. Thomas Adams.

844
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:05,879
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

845
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:09,976
I reckon you got things
to talk about.

846
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:34,636
Why on earth
are you doing this?

847
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:37,108
I needed some money.
Granny was sick.

848
01:18:37,143 --> 01:18:39,693
- Could've asked me for it.
- No, Tom.

849
01:18:39,728 --> 01:18:42,209
This is something
I have to do by myself.

850
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:44,512
I still don't know
what it's all about, Pat...

851
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:47,680
or why you think it's important
enough to change our plans.

852
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:52,888
Quite a stir in the papers up north,
Negro papers in particular.

853
01:18:52,923 --> 01:18:55,225
Got a hold of some clippings for you.

854
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,391
I read in one of'em
the trial was set for tomorrow.

855
01:19:01,038 --> 01:19:03,131
Read them.

856
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:11,170
"Negro Heiress Defies Lynch Law. "

857
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:15,445
Yes, there... there was a reporter here,
but I didn't tell him anything.

858
01:19:19,556 --> 01:19:23,287
"Negro Girl Fights To Hold Her... "

859
01:19:23,322 --> 01:19:27,852
I had no idea
they'd make so much of it.

860
01:19:27,887 --> 01:19:31,126
Why go through with it? What for?
It isn't too late to back out.

861
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:33,168
- The trial's tomorrow.
- Let it go by default.

862
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:36,066
We don't need the house.
I got plenty for both of us.

863
01:19:36,101 --> 01:19:39,197
- Be sensible. Pack, and let's get out of here.
- I can't do that, Tom.

864
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:44,713
- What are you fighting for, a run-down house and a few acres of worthless land?
- No.

865
01:19:44,748 --> 01:19:47,579
If I should back out now,
I'd be letting Miss Em down.

866
01:19:47,614 --> 01:19:50,764
I can't do that.
I can't let her down.

867
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,509
I can't let myself down
or... my people.

868
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:56,184
- They're not your people, Pat!
- What?

869
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,556
Not really. There'll be
no Pinky Johnson after we're married.

870
01:19:58,591 --> 01:20:01,061
You'll be Mrs. Thomas Adams
for the rest of your life.

871
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:06,966
Tom, you can change your name, but I wonder
if you can change what you really are inside.

872
01:20:10,374 --> 01:20:13,901
What's behind all this?
You haven't really told me.

873
01:20:15,379 --> 01:20:19,048
I don't know.
I'm not being heroic. I'd hate that.

874
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:22,048
I just know I have
to go through with it to the end.

875
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,014
You see, they're trying
to steal the property...

876
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:28,057
steal it from Miss Em
as much as from me.

877
01:20:28,092 --> 01:20:30,853
They'll probably
get away with it.

878
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:34,492
But I'm gonna make them
do it out in the open...

879
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:38,097
right out in court
for everyone to see and hear.

880
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:45,034
It won't be pleasant, Tom. They'll lie.
They'll try to humiliate me.

881
01:20:45,069 --> 01:20:47,406
They'll try
every trick of prejudice.

882
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:49,411
But I just...

883
01:20:56,486 --> 01:21:00,946
All right, Pat.
I'll be there. I understand.

884
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:19,032
<i>We also propose to show, Your Honor,
that the defendant, Pinky Johnson...</i>

885
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:22,737
colored... is of a violent nature...

886
01:21:22,772 --> 01:21:24,972
quarrelsome,
a troublemaker...

887
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:28,744
<i>that she is capable of executing
the scheme I have described to you...</i>

888
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:33,448
and that she had every
opportunity of doing so.

889
01:21:33,483 --> 01:21:35,922
The deceased
was unquestionably senile.

890
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,823
The fact that she signed the will twice
is evidence of a confused mind.

891
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:43,690
She was unduly influenced by
the defendant as I have outlined to you.

892
01:21:43,725 --> 01:21:47,167
And she was under
the influence of drugs...

893
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,999
administered by the defendant.

894
01:21:50,034 --> 01:21:54,553
Furthermore, this will
was written at a time when...

895
01:21:54,588 --> 01:21:59,072
reliable witnesses will prove
she was of unsound mind.

896
01:21:59,107 --> 01:22:01,308
May I see that will again, please?

897
01:22:01,343 --> 01:22:04,477
In view of these things, we therefore
ask that the will be set aside...

898
01:22:04,512 --> 01:22:07,751
and the property inherited
by the next of kin.

899
01:22:09,459 --> 01:22:11,825
I yield to you, Judge Walker.

900
01:22:14,954 --> 01:22:16,965
Your Honor.

901
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:22,070
I agreed to act
for the defendant in this case...

902
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:25,388
because I feared
an injustice was about to be done.

903
01:22:25,423 --> 01:22:28,637
Your Honor, apparently
my fears were well-founded.

904
01:22:28,672 --> 01:22:30,974
Counsel for the plaintiff
has made it perfectly clear...

905
01:22:31,009 --> 01:22:35,106
that my client in effect
is to be tried because she is a Negro...

906
01:22:35,141 --> 01:22:39,450
<i>and because a Negro cannot be permitted
to inherit property in this community.</i>

907
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:45,391
<i>That is
a harsh fact, but we must face it.</i>

908
01:22:45,426 --> 01:22:48,054
Though many of us
may criticize this bequest...

909
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:51,827
I do not believe any of us who knew Miss
Em... and most of us knew and loved her...

910
01:22:51,862 --> 01:22:55,267
can accept the contention
that she was insane.

911
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:57,896
<i>I do not believe counsel
for the plaintiff can prove...</i>

912
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,237
<i>that undue influence
was exerted by my client.</i>

913
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:04,780
I think most of us know how difficult it
was to influence Miss Em in any respect.

914
01:23:04,815 --> 01:23:08,408
<i>We need not look too far
for a motive in making this bequest.</i>

915
01:23:08,443 --> 01:23:11,612
She was a proud woman
who'd leave no debt unpaid.

916
01:23:11,647 --> 01:23:13,586
This was a real obligation.

917
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:17,318
She took the only means open to her
of paying for my client's services...

918
01:23:17,353 --> 01:23:20,589
through the provisions
of her will.

919
01:23:20,624 --> 01:23:23,722
The expressed wishes of the dead
should not be set aside...

920
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:27,361
to gratify the greed
or the prejudice of the living.

921
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:32,573
Your Honor,
this is a small country town.

922
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:36,839
We've always thought that what happened
here was our own private concern.

923
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:38,971
This is no longer true...

924
01:23:39,006 --> 01:23:41,744
<i>just as it is no longer true
that our country as a whole...</i>

925
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:44,615
<i>can exist
entirely to itself.</i>

926
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,253
What is done in our courts
in cases such as this...

927
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:51,821
has become a matter of moment
in the eyes of the world.

928
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:56,126
Let us examine our conscience. Let us
look into our attitude and our tradition.

929
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:58,701
Let us take care,
lest it be said of us that here...

930
01:23:58,736 --> 01:24:00,928
there is neither law
nor justice.

931
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:05,337
<i>Your Honor, we're all anxious to get to
the bottom of this as quickly as possible...</i>

932
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:08,323
before the temperature of this room
reaches the boiling point.

933
01:24:08,358 --> 01:24:11,275
Fortunately, there is one witness
who is qualified to testify...

934
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,780
on the only matters
of pertinence to this hearing...

935
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:18,115
the question of Miss Em's sanity
and the question of undue influence.

936
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,678
Incidentally, he will be
the defense's only witness.

937
01:24:21,713 --> 01:24:25,488
He was Miss Em's physician, in constant
attendance during her last illness.

938
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:28,529
He was also her confidant,
witnessed her will...

939
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:33,033
and is the executor of her estate...
Dr. Joseph McGill.

940
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:36,003
Your Honor, I disagree with
my esteemed opponent's notions...

941
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,234
of what is or isn't
pertinent to this hearing.

942
01:24:39,269 --> 01:24:43,676
But I am perfectly willing to have
Dr. McGill take the stand at this point.

943
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:46,407
- Very well. Call Dr. McGill.
- Do you think that's...

944
01:24:46,442 --> 01:24:50,350
Oh, let him put his witness
on first. We'll close with ours.

945
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,784
Dr. Joe doesn't seem
to be here, Your Honor.

946
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:54,913
Well, take a look in the corridor.
See if he's there.

947
01:24:54,948 --> 01:24:58,687
- He ain't out here, Your Honor.
- Well, that bein' the case...

948
01:24:58,722 --> 01:25:01,110
we'll have to proceed with
the plaintiff's witnesses.

949
01:25:01,145 --> 01:25:03,464
<i>- Are you ready, Mr. Stanley?
- Yes, Your Honor.</i>

950
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:07,070
- Better find Dr. Joe and bring him here.
- Yes, Judge Walker.

951
01:25:07,337 --> 01:25:10,704
Money and a man, I believe,
is what caused the trouble.

952
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,332
The usual thing.

953
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:16,445
Well, we picked 'em both up, along
with the man they was fightin' over.

954
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,913
<i>Judge Walker heard the case.
That's all I know about it.</i>

955
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,541
Yeah, money and a man.

956
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,382
Thank you. Your witness.

957
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:32,574
Chief Anderson, what was the final
prison sentence imposed on my client?

958
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:37,025
- Why, Judge Walker, you know there wasn't any.
- So she was cleared.

959
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,692
Is that correct?

960
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:43,362
- Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
- You wouldn't?

961
01:25:43,397 --> 01:25:47,840
You generally always let 'em off with
a good talkin' to, like you give her.

962
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:50,503
You know how it is.

963
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:54,878
- If you put them niggers in jail every time somethin' happens...
- That'll do.

964
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:58,317
Your Honor, this witness's testimony should
be ignored and stricken from the record...

965
01:25:58,352 --> 01:26:00,445
<i>- As totally irrelevant to the hearing.
- Your Honor, I object.!</i>

966
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:05,254
Just a minute! The court is capable
of deciding any questions of relevancy.

967
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:07,907
<i>Motion denied.
Call the next witness.</i>

968
01:26:07,942 --> 01:26:10,585
Well, for one thing,
on my last visit...

969
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,193
this girl simply wouldn't
leave the room.

970
01:26:13,228 --> 01:26:16,828
And I could see that Cousin Em
actually didn't dare to dismiss her.

971
01:26:16,863 --> 01:26:20,102
<i>Then Cousin Em began
to talk about makin' a will.</i>

972
01:26:20,137 --> 01:26:24,839
Well, I tried to cheer her up, but she turned
to this Pinky and said, "What do you think?"

973
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:27,781
as if... as if she didn't dare
to make up her mind alone...

974
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:30,215
which was never
like Cousin Em... never.

975
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:33,651
- What did the girl say?
- Oh, she spoke up, bold as you please...

976
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:37,052
and said Cousin Em had better
make a will if she was ever goin' to.

977
01:26:37,087 --> 01:26:39,822
- That's the part I mentioned to you.
- Impudent, yes...

978
01:26:39,857 --> 01:26:42,863
but the way she said it...
a threat too.

979
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:47,902
And I'm just glad that Cousin Em was
allowed to die a natural death in her bed.

980
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:52,964
<i>I think everyone in this courtroom
understands what you mean, ma'am.</i>

981
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:56,978
Did you notice anything peculiar
about her condition that day?

982
01:26:57,013 --> 01:27:01,664
Oh, yes. She closed
her eyes while I was talkin'.

983
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:05,477
She kept droppin' off
in a stupor. She was doped!

984
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,886
And then she told me
she was subject to fits...

985
01:27:08,921 --> 01:27:12,260
that half the time she was
clean out of her mind.

986
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:15,162
Poor soul. Poor soul.

987
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:18,029
Thank you, Mrs. Wooley.

988
01:27:18,064 --> 01:27:21,227
<i>Your witness.</i>

989
01:27:21,262 --> 01:27:26,187
Mrs. Wooley, you have testified
that my client's tone was threatenin'.

990
01:27:26,222 --> 01:27:30,447
Now, Miss Em must've made some
sort of reply if she was threatened.

991
01:27:30,482 --> 01:27:34,637
- What were Miss Em's next words?
- I don't remember. She was doped.

992
01:27:34,672 --> 01:27:39,050
Didn't she say Pinky's opinion was sensible
because that agreed with what she thought herself?

993
01:27:39,085 --> 01:27:42,716
Were you there, Judge Walker, or are you
just bein' primed by that girl over there?

994
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:47,091
- Did you ever hear such...
- Uh, answer the question, please.

995
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:51,462
- Isn't that what Miss Em said?
- I'd certainly remember it if she had.

996
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:54,449
- Mrs. Wooley, do you know the penalty for perjury?
- I object!

997
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:57,402
Your Honor, I object to this attempt
to intimidate the witness!

998
01:27:57,437 --> 01:27:59,633
She's answered the question.
She doesn't remember.

999
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:02,472
And now, if my opponent will stop
putting words in the mouth of the dead...

1000
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:06,537
No personalities, gentlemen.
It's hot enough in here as it is.

1001
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:09,618
<i
>- Will Your Honor please rule on my objection? - Objection sustained.

1002
01:28:09,653 --> 01:28:12,585
Thank you!

1003
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,587
Didn't I tell you he's a good'n?

1004
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:20,026
So, Aunt Dicey, you were there in
the room when she was writing her will.

1005
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,222
Yes, sir.
Sittin' right there...

1006
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:25,060
like I always done
when my Pinky's out.

1007
01:28:25,095 --> 01:28:29,227
And Miss Em was still writin'
when I left to take the wash uptown.

1008
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:33,172
'Cause Judge Walker and some is mighty
particular when they gets their wash.

1009
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,336
<i>I understand, Aunt Dicey.</i>

1010
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:42,239
- You know what a hypodermic is?
- Yes, sir.

1011
01:28:42,274 --> 01:28:46,446
Did you ever see your granddaughter
stick one of those things in Miss Em?

1012
01:28:46,481 --> 01:28:49,513
Yes, sir.
I see her do it twice.

1013
01:28:49,548 --> 01:28:55,291
- What happened?
- Miss Em... talked to herself for a while.

1014
01:28:55,326 --> 01:28:58,662
<i>You mean raved?</i>

1015
01:28:58,697 --> 01:29:00,667
<i>Kind of mumbled, like.</i>

1016
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:04,035
Then she go off to sleep
like she a little baby.

1017
01:29:05,275 --> 01:29:09,302
Now, just one more
question, Aunt Dicey.

1018
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:16,275
What makes you think it was her will
that Miss Em was writing that day?

1019
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:22,187
- I know it was, sir.
- Well, you see, Aunt Dicey, this is a court of law...

1020
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:25,522
and you're sworn
to tell the truth before God.

1021
01:29:25,557 --> 01:29:29,098
Some of us think this will may have
been written at some other time...

1022
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:31,758
while your granddaughter
was present.

1023
01:29:31,793 --> 01:29:36,167
Did Miss Em tell you
she was writing her will?

1024
01:29:36,202 --> 01:29:38,705
No, sir, Mr. Stanley.

1025
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:43,438
But you were sitting where you could see
the paper she was writing on, weren't you?

1026
01:29:43,473 --> 01:29:46,912
Yes, sir, Mr. Stanley.

1027
01:29:46,947 --> 01:29:50,644
Well, now, didn't you see
enough of it to know what it was?

1028
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:53,813
He's going to trap her. He knows she
can't read, and she'll never admit it.

1029
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:56,756
<i>- From Dr. Joe.
- Come, now, Aunt Dicey.</i>

1030
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,953
Let's have an answer.

1031
01:30:01,498 --> 01:30:04,661
You know, sir,
as well as me it ain't manners...

1032
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:07,429
readin' what ain't meant
for you to read.

1033
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:12,370
<i>Then how can you swear
before God you knew it was her will?</i>

1034
01:30:12,405 --> 01:30:14,874
Now, Aunt Dicey,
you answer me the gospel truth!

1035
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,841
Couldn't this will have been written at
some other time? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

1036
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:20,773
- Yes...
- Couldn't Pinky have helped Miss Em make a will when you weren't around?

1037
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:23,853
<i>- I reckon she could, sir.
- Your witness.!</i>

1038
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:31,393
Your Honor, we'll waive
cross-examination of this witness.

1039
01:30:31,428 --> 01:30:34,257
All right, Aunt Dicey.
You can step down now.

1040
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:37,798
I have here a note from Dr. Joe in which
he says he's going to be delayed.

1041
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:41,268
Now, on the basis of this note,
I petition for a brief recess.

1042
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:43,999
May I see this note, please?

1043
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:49,572
- Do I have your permission to read this to the court?
- You certainly have.

1044
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,045
"Sorry. Mary Picken's baby
jumped the gun.

1045
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,666
"When it gets here,
I'll get there.

1046
01:30:54,701 --> 01:30:57,218
Joe McGill. "

1047
01:30:57,253 --> 01:31:00,082
Seriously, Your Honor,
I object to this petition...

1048
01:31:00,117 --> 01:31:04,626
or to any legal strategy intended solely
to drag out this unfortunate affair...

1049
01:31:04,661 --> 01:31:06,887
which should have never
seen the light of day anyway.

1050
01:31:06,922 --> 01:31:09,430
Judge Walker had as much time
as we did to summon witnesses...

1051
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:11,488
<i>and to make sure they'd be here.!</i>

1052
01:31:11,523 --> 01:31:14,090
<i>As for this note, it's easy
to read between the lines.</i>

1053
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:17,598
Naturally, Dr. Joe didn't want
to hurt his old friend's feelings here...

1054
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:21,036
with a direct refusal to appear
as a witness in this unpleasant case.

1055
01:31:21,071 --> 01:31:24,943
It's obvious, however, that bountiful
nature and the ethics of his profession...

1056
01:31:24,978 --> 01:31:27,038
Have come to his aid.

1057
01:31:27,073 --> 01:31:30,949
<i
>- - Oh, this is going to be a long confinement!

1058
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:36,787
He's not asking for a recess, Your Honor.
He's asking for a postponement!

1059
01:31:39,487 --> 01:31:42,861
- Petition denied, Judge Walker.
- Thank you, Judge Shoreham.

1060
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:49,164
Any more of that,
and I'll have the room cleared.

1061
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,672
- Have you any further witnesses?
- No more, Your Honor.

1062
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,072
I agree with counsel for the plaintiff.

1063
01:31:55,107 --> 01:31:58,873
- There's no point in dragging this out any longer.
- Thank you.

1064
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:02,143
<i>The court has heard all the facts
and is ready to announce its finding.</i>

1065
01:32:02,178 --> 01:32:04,650
Thank you, sir.

1066
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:08,449
<i>I do not intend to defend
the wisdom of this bequest...</i>

1067
01:32:08,484 --> 01:32:13,153
nor do I intend to base my findings
on the conclusions of the witnesses...

1068
01:32:13,188 --> 01:32:16,663
<i>nor on the hearsay evidence
admitted here today.</i>

1069
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,666
This will is a legal document.

1070
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:23,499
I have examined it, and I see no reason
to doubt that it was written...

1071
01:32:23,534 --> 01:32:26,369
<i>by a woman
in full possession of her faculties.</i>

1072
01:32:26,404 --> 01:32:31,606
Moreover, plaintiffs have failed
to establish that any undue influence...

1073
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:34,147
was exerted by the defendant.

1074
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:37,936
<i>The will is therefore
declared to be good and valid...</i>

1075
01:32:37,971 --> 01:32:41,690
and the executor shall
carry out its terms as written.

1076
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:43,724
But Judge Shoreham!

1077
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:45,952
<i>I want it clearly understood...</i>

1078
01:32:45,987 --> 01:32:49,360
<i>any attempt to interfere with
the defendant or her property...</i>

1079
01:32:49,395 --> 01:32:51,694
will be answerable to this court.

1080
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:55,531
Court is now adjourned.

1081
01:32:57,106 --> 01:33:00,507
<i>Quiet.! Quiet, please.!</i>

1082
01:33:05,715 --> 01:33:09,617
Judge Walker,
I don't know how to thank you.

1083
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:15,350
Well, Pinky, you won.
You got the house and the land.

1084
01:33:15,385 --> 01:33:17,687
And you got justice.

1085
01:33:17,722 --> 01:33:21,490
But I doubt if any other interests
of this community have been served.

1086
01:34:02,772 --> 01:34:05,138
Come on, darling. Let's go.

1087
01:34:07,777 --> 01:34:10,268
All right, Tom. All right.

1088
01:35:17,847 --> 01:35:21,077
Big old houses like this
are a drug on the market.

1089
01:35:21,112 --> 01:35:24,311
We'll find a good real estate man
and turn it over to him.

1090
01:35:27,089 --> 01:35:30,237
We'll auction off the furniture
and the silver separately.

1091
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:33,385
You know, some of those pieces
down there look valuable.

1092
01:35:35,631 --> 01:35:38,464
We'll sell them all in your name,
so you'll be independent...

1093
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:42,129
just in case you decide
to run away from me again.

1094
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:12,556
This is... is quite a room.

1095
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:17,339
Yes.

1096
01:36:19,575 --> 01:36:22,509
Oh, say, isn't this
a beautiful fire screen?

1097
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:26,638
Miss Em was proud of that. Martha Washington
is supposed to have done the embroidery.

1098
01:36:26,673 --> 01:36:30,913
Oh, we can't let this get away from us.
We'll have it sent out to Denver.

1099
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:34,389
Denver?

1100
01:36:36,959 --> 01:36:39,893
Didn't I tell you? I...

1101
01:36:39,928 --> 01:36:44,363
I've accepted a position
in a clinic there.

1102
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:46,958
But all your ties are in Boston...

1103
01:36:46,993 --> 01:36:50,279
your family.

1104
01:36:50,314 --> 01:36:53,566
Oh. But the...

1105
01:36:56,579 --> 01:36:59,112
- The publicity.
- Oh, it's partly that...

1106
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:01,610
but I've always thought
about moving out west.

1107
01:37:01,645 --> 01:37:05,346
Besides, too many people in Boston
know, or they might find out.

1108
01:37:07,156 --> 01:37:10,956
Pat, you'll love it in Denver. Some
friends of mine are starting this clinic.

1109
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:13,528
They want me to go in with them.

1110
01:37:18,901 --> 01:37:23,167
I can't sell the house, Tom. That isn't
why she left it to me... to sell...

1111
01:37:23,202 --> 01:37:25,899
or why I went through
with the trial.

1112
01:37:25,934 --> 01:37:28,788
She said, with confidence in the use
to which I'd put the property.

1113
01:37:28,823 --> 01:37:31,642
Let's be practical. Her lawyer
had it straight when he said she was...

1114
01:37:31,677 --> 01:37:33,873
merely... merely trying
to pay off her debt to you.

1115
01:37:33,908 --> 01:37:36,411
- Now, if you'll let me...
- No, that wasn't her reason.

1116
01:37:36,446 --> 01:37:38,914
She'd have left it to Granny.
She owed her far more.

1117
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:41,853
Miss Em accepted service as her due.

1118
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:45,551
No, she had some purpose...
something she wanted me to do.

1119
01:37:45,586 --> 01:37:48,755
Come on now, Pat. I know she was
a wonderful old woman and all that...

1120
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:51,889
and she made a deep impression
on you, but she's dead.

1121
01:37:51,924 --> 01:37:54,730
Your own life is much more important
than her purpose, if she had one.

1122
01:37:54,765 --> 01:37:56,702
It's my life she was thinking of.

1123
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:59,568
She told me once
to be myself wherever I was.

1124
01:37:59,603 --> 01:38:02,041
- Well, that's pretty good advice, but...
- But you said yesterday...

1125
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:05,636
there'd be no Pinky Johnson
after we were married.

1126
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:09,079
- How can I be myself?
- It was only a figure of speech.

1127
01:38:09,114 --> 01:38:12,779
Now, let's get out of this place. You're
letting the trial get under your skin.

1128
01:38:12,814 --> 01:38:15,481
- Will you forget it?
- You mean run away from it, Tom.

1129
01:38:15,516 --> 01:38:18,719
This time to Denver,
running away for the rest of our lives.

1130
01:38:18,754 --> 01:38:21,887
- You're all confused.
- No. I'm just beginning to understand.

1131
01:38:21,922 --> 01:38:24,966
She didn't want me to go. She didn't
want me to pretend. We talked about it.

1132
01:38:25,001 --> 01:38:27,159
- Pat...
- That's why she wrote the will.

1133
01:38:27,194 --> 01:38:30,466
- She thought the house would keep me here.
- But she was wrong.

1134
01:38:30,501 --> 01:38:34,270
<i>- That's why she wrote it.
- She was wrong, wasn't she?</i>

1135
01:38:34,305 --> 01:38:36,277
Wasn't she?

1136
01:38:43,052 --> 01:38:45,986
I can't go with you.

1137
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:50,217
I'm sick of lying, Tom.
We wouldn't be happy, either of us.

1138
01:38:50,252 --> 01:38:54,819
What do you expect to do, crawl into a
closet and live there the rest of your life?

1139
01:38:54,854 --> 01:38:57,364
Close the door and lock it...
lock everything?

1140
01:38:57,399 --> 01:38:59,365
Pat, look at me. Look at me!

1141
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,300
Will you come to your senses? You've
got to make a break, get away from it!

1142
01:39:02,335 --> 01:39:05,134
I don't want to get away
from anything.

1143
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:08,367
I'm a Negro.
I can't forget it, and I can't deny it.

1144
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:13,073
I can't pretend to be anything else,
and I don't want to be anything else.

1145
01:39:13,108 --> 01:39:18,119
- Don't you see, Tom?
- No, I don't.

1146
01:39:18,154 --> 01:39:21,917
You can't live without pride.

1147
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:28,555
I'm sorry, Tom.

1148
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:31,666
I'll never forget you
or what you tried to do.

1149
01:39:33,302 --> 01:39:36,999
But please go now.
Don't say anything.

1150
01:39:37,034 --> 01:39:39,006
Just go.

1151
01:40:09,972 --> 01:40:13,271
What did you mean, Miss Em?

1152
01:40:13,306 --> 01:40:15,275
Tell me.

1153
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,307
<i>Come here a minute.</i>

1154
01:40:20,342 --> 01:40:24,851
I'm sure you will.

1155
01:40:24,886 --> 01:40:28,252
- Miss Pinky, you have to do something about Aunt Dicey.
- What is it this time?

1156
01:40:28,287 --> 01:40:30,586
She's been at that
new sterilizer again.

1157
01:40:30,621 --> 01:40:33,889
Every time I sterilize the sheets, she puts
'em back. Says they ain't white enough.

1158
01:40:33,924 --> 01:40:37,454
I'll speak to her about it,
but I doubt if it'll do much good.

1159
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,864
<i>- Lunch is laid out.
- All right. I'll get them in.</i>

1160
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:41,902
- Good morning, Miss Pinky.
- Hello, Teejoe.

1161
01:40:41,937 --> 01:40:44,835
- Teejoe is gonna do a little flying. That right, Teejoe?
- Yes, Dr. Canady.

1162
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:46,805
- Well, Pinky.
- Hello, Dr. Joe.

1163
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,807
- Mornin', Doctor.
- Mornin', Doctor.

1164
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,573
- Uh, thought I'd look in on the Freeman boy.
- He's in the dining room.

1165
01:40:53,305 --> 01:41:53,415
