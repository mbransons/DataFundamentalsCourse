1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,384
It is the dawn of the 17th century.

3
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,221
After the assassination of his father,

4
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,683
the young King Louis XIII
ascends to the French throne.

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,481
His once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides.

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,696
Within the borders of France itself,
Cardinal Richelieu, the King's advisor,

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,365
plots in secret to seize power for himself.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,078
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,246
find themselves without a single friend.

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,208
Europe is a powder keg waiting to explode

11
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,919
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent.

12
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,090
And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse.

13
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,985
Move out!

14
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,698
Halt!

15
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,096
Don't.

16
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,890
Getting careless?

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,517
The feeling is mutual.

18
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,612
For future reference, "I love you"
would have been a more suitable reply.

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,950
Could have just said, "Hello."

20
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,994
What would be the fun in that?

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,788
- How was the bishop?
- Not as good as you.

22
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,707
You are incorrigible.

23
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,127
I bet you say that to all the girls.

24
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,841
But, sir! Remember I am a lady!

25
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,051
Let me touch your bosom.

26
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,802
Sir, keep your hands to yourself!

27
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,514
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

28
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,809
thy will be done, on earth
as it is in heaven.

29
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,686
Give us this day our daily bread,

30
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,647
and forgive us our trespasses,

31
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,316
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

32
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,359
Amen.

33
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,032
That's enough wine, I can assure...

34
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,466
- What?
- Key.

35
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,810
You mean this key?

36
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,529
Who are you?

37
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,913
- I'm not a priest.
- I'm not really a lady.

38
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,373
I have 10 minutes.

39
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,795
♪ There once was an aunt from Lorraine.

40
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,048
♪ With an incredible tolerance for pain.

41
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,261
♪ She had a nasty habit
♪ Involving a chicken, a frog, and a rabbit

42
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,222
I expected more
from a man of your reputation.

43
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,352
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis?

44
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,898
Never heard of them.

45
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,571
You French spies.
You're very, very arrogant. And foolish.

46
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,780
And you're so...

47
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,240
Sexy?

48
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,951
Lt's a wonder it took me so long
to catch you.

49
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,619
You didn't!

50
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,787
I beg your pardon?

51
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,750
You didn't catch me.

52
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,377
And what exactly are you doing here?

53
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,129
Catching you.

54
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
Key.

55
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,949
Vive la France!

56
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,453
Da Vinci's Vault.

57
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,957
Leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions.

58
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,133
Shall we?

59
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,973
Now.

60
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,453
Your part's done. Why don't you stay back?
We'll meet at the rally point.

61
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,330
We came together,

62
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,333
we leave together.

63
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,648
I'll go.

64
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,066
Wait, wait.

65
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,901
Too easy.

66
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,881
- Pressure plates under the floor.
- Oh!

67
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,717
- I could scale the walls.
- Run a cable along the roof.

68
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,052
- Could be booby-trapped, too.
- Hmm.

69
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,415
Well? We don't have all night.

70
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,086
You're absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages?

71
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,254
And no secret tunnels?

72
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,089
Positive, sir. lt's a vault.

73
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,633
One way in, one way out.

74
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,929
Excellent! I want these Musketeers dead!
I want them dead!

75
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,515
The guards change in two minutes,
maybe less.

76
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,517
Less!

77
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,773
What now?

78
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,733
- C'est la vie?
- No.

79
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,985
Contingency plan.

80
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,448
Got it.

81
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,792
Athos, you do know what's up there?

82
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,585
Just hold your breath.

83
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,811
Get out!

84
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,522
Hey! Get back down there! Now!

85
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,452
Go ahead, say it!

86
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,495
I love you.

87
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,875
I hate to ruin the mood,
but perhaps we could go elsewhere?

88
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,004
You know, for once I think
the padre may be right.

89
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,469
All for one.

90
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,138
And one for all.

91
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,518
So, what's next?

92
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,270
Back to Paris, I guess.

93
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,688
And then what?

94
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,190
Wherever they send us,
whatever France needs.

95
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,359
Lt's who we are. lt's what we do.

96
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,071
I do love you.

97
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,323
I know.

98
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,993
Then please try and understand
that this isn't personal.

99
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,162
Lt's strictly business.

100
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,373
He made me a better offer.

101
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,051
Ah! Athos.

102
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,844
Buckingham.

103
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,521
A toxin.

104
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,071
In case you were wondering, it wasn't
in your drink, it was on your cup.

105
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,741
Inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid.

106
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,746
Don't worry.

107
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,749
Lt isn't fatal.

108
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,128
Although I suspect
a part of you wishes it was.

109
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,383
You take all the risk and I get the reward.

110
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,927
Hardly seems fair.

111
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,806
Well, just so you don't leave empty-handed,

112
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,641
a word of advice.

113
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,565
Trust no one, especially women.

114
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,069
You'll live longer.

115
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,247
Telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him.

116
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,460
I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

117
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,172
I only took away his prize.

118
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,800
You took a lot more than that.

119
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,855
At last, the war machine.

120
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,355
Look down.

121
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,526
Lt's a trick an old friend taught me.

122
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:03,323
Your adversary will not always be
as noble as you.

123
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,366
Remember that,

124
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,369
and I have nothing left to teach you.

125
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,537
I doubt that, Father.

126
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,875
Keep it.

127
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,755
Lt's passed down from generation
to generation, from father to son.

128
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,381
Lt's yours now.

129
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,096
The weapon of a Musketeer.

130
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,557
The real weapon of a Musketeer

131
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,601
is here.

132
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,770
All for one.

133
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,563
And one for all.

134
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,857
You remind me of somebody.

135
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,984
Let me guess. You.

136
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,572
No, no.
The man I wish I was when I was your age.

137
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,327
Well, you should really be on your way.

138
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,749
Take this purse. There's 1 5 crowns in it.
Lt's enough to get you to Paris.

139
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,254
And you'll need a mount.
Your mother's insisting you take Buttercup.

140
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,257
- I know it's not much, and...
- It's plenty.

141
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,974
Take care of yourself, my son.
Try not to get into any fights.

142
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,436
If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I might
have to do a little bit of fighting.

143
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,605
Stay at the back if you can.

144
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,315
Yes, Mother.

145
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,444
- There's one more piece of advice.
- I know, I know. Don't get into any trouble.

146
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,779
Wrong.

147
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,322
Get into trouble.

148
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,241
Make mistakes.

149
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,161
Fight, love, live.

150
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:39,127
And remember, always,
you're a Gascon and our son.

151
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,173
Now go. Go.

152
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,214
In the name of God,
what kind of beast is that?

153
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,176
And the beast he's riding
doesn't look much either.

154
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,636
- Ostler.
- Sir?

155
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,971
- Please see that my horse is watered and fed.
- Oh!

156
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,890
Lt's a horse, is it?

157
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,351
My friends here thought it was a cow.

158
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,313
Excuse me.

159
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,858
See, I know you men
are just kidding around.

160
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,610
Buttercup,

161
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,072
well, she gets a little sensitive.

162
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,617
I'm afraid I must ask you to apologize.

163
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,205
Well, I'm afraid I'm not in the habit
of apologizing to Gascon yokels.

164
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,082
Not to me.

165
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,167
To my horse.

166
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,172
You've hurt her feelings.

167
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,135
And if I don't?

168
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,346
I shall have to kill you.

169
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,192
You shot me!

170
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,736
Most observant of you, young man.

171
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,739
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

172
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,701
Flesh wound.

173
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,079
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

174
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,872
Captain Rochefort, I...

175
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,919
Whoa, whoa, steady.

176
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,046
Wouldn't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

177
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,757
So, boy,

178
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,718
consider this a lesson.

179
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,885
Your last.

180
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,430
No.

181
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,561
He's too pretty for that.

182
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,064
As you wish, Milady.

183
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,943
Rochefort, come.

184
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,070
We're expected in Paris.

185
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,447
Thank you.

186
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,277
Make way!

187
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,869
I think you've had enough.

188
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,248
Where's my tankard?

189
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,875
Excuse me!

190
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,879
You think you're better than me?

191
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,548
No.

192
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,133
Watch yourself, boy!

193
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,135
All for one.

194
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,178
Excuse me!

195
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,140
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

196
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,225
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

197
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,518
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

198
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,229
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

199
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,814
I'm in a hurry.

200
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,902
- Here.
- 1 0 sous?

201
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,364
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- The town drunk, from the smell of you.

202
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,867
Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

203
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,996
- What are you saying exactly?
- Blind and deaf.

204
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,373
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

205
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,250
Great! When can you fit me in?

206
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,003
12:00, Cooper's Yard, St. Germain.

207
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,254
I'll be there.

208
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,258
Excuse me!

209
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,302
I just can't decide.

210
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,723
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

211
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,101
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

212
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,811
Equally important.

213
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,315
Dignified. Dashing.

214
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,110
In the words of King
Solomon, I'll take both!

215
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,237
A most excellent choice, sir.

216
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,617
Darling, you spoil me.

217
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,952
I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

218
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,705
- Watch yourself!
- My apologies.

219
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,499
Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

220
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
This isn't mine.

221
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,712
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

222
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,673
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

223
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,301
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

224
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,845
Do you know who I am?

225
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,055
No!

226
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,473
Then we're even.

227
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,310
You're in luck, boy.

228
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,481
Ordinarily, I would slaughter you on the
spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

229
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,859
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 1:00.

230
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,403
I suggest you dress for a funeral!

231
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,905
What?

232
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,584
- Lottery!
- There you go.

233
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,087
Lottery ticket, sir?
Might be your lucky day!

234
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,844
What the hell?

235
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,013
5 francs?

236
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,140
Hey! Hey!

237
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,393
What is this?

238
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,353
Lt's a citation.

239
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,189
Lt's a ticket.

240
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,359
Failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area.

241
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,527
French.

242
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,947
Your horse took a dump on the street.

243
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,366
You're joking.

244
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,910
That's what they all say.

245
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,870
You know what?

246
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,626
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 2:00.

247
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,048
Strange boy.

248
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,237
Milady de Winter!

249
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,007
Close game, Your Eminence.

250
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,842
- Hmm.
- Who's the opponent?

251
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,262
Myself. No one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge.

252
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,103
Hmm.

253
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,438
What news of England?

254
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,940
He's coming.

255
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,942
- Buckingham?
- Hmm.

256
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,944
And...

257
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,321
And?

258
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,324
He built it.

259
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,242
The war machine.

260
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,036
And he doesn't question your loyalty.

261
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,247
He thinks he's so cunning.

262
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,416
So evil.

263
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,460
Evil is just a point of view.

264
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,712
Ah!

265
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
Richelieu.

266
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,929
Is this lady the emissary from England?

267
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,264
Your Majesty is exceptionally alert.

268
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,811
So, madam,

269
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,064
what of Buckingham?

270
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,817
Majesty?

271
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,985
Well, what's he wearing these days?

272
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,697
Green, Your Majesty.

273
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,492
- Green?
- Hmm.

274
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,702
Very interesting.

275
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,830
And you had the gall to recommend blue?

276
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,332
Of course it should be green.

277
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:42,545
Why am I surrounded
by incompetent idiots?

278
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,965
Green, green, green!

279
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,300
Do I have to do everything myself?

280
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,604
Ah!

281
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,732
There you are. Shall we get to it?

282
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,527
So, are you eager
to meet your maker?

283
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,070
I have other appointments.

284
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,780
You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

285
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,241
Well, I'll try my best to be on time.

286
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,076
My seconds.

287
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,244
You!

288
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,079
You're fighting this rascal?

289
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,541
My appointments.

290
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,544
1:00. 2:00.

291
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,089
How long have you been in Paris?

292
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,133
- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

293
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,386
Patience is not one of my virtues.

294
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,679
Well, neither are good manners.

295
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,056
Wait for your turn, old man.

296
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,812
What would you like me to put
on your headstone? "Little shit"?

297
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,816
D'Artagnan.

298
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,152
I'm Athos.

299
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,904
This is Porthos and Aramis.

300
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,283
The Three Musketeers.

301
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,743
I've heard of you.

302
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,414
From my father, a Musketeer himself.

303
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,333
In fact, I came to Paris to be one of you.

304
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,834
I'm afraid you're a little late.

305
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,628
What happened?

306
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,922
Oh, a bad mission. Budget cuts.

307
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,840
Cardinal, progress.

308
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,300
Take your pick.

309
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,471
Well, then, welcome to Paris.

310
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,264
Pity we'll have to kill you.

311
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,978
Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

312
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,522
Or three.

313
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,526
Kill him already.
Lt's lunchtime and I'm starving.

314
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,246
Halt!

315
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,458
Jussac.

316
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,255
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

317
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,423
Dueling in defiance of the edicts?

318
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,718
You got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change?

319
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,972
- Now...
- Seal the square!

320
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,934
Surrender your weapons
and come along with us.

321
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
Seal it off!

322
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,730
Unless, of course, you would rather resist.

323
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,898
New plan.

324
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,236
Kill the boy, kick their asses,
and then go get some lunch.

325
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,029
I could do with some exercise.

326
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,288
Seal it off, boys!

327
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,039
You were saying?

328
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,627
On the other hand,
discretion is the better part of valor.

329
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,004
You're the Musketeers.

330
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,297
Wrong.

331
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,092
We were the Musketeers.
Now we're just...us.

332
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,691
Rochefort.

333
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,698
Shall we?

334
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,051
Finish them off.

335
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,847
Let's even the odds.

336
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,747
Enjoying the show?

337
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,373
- You!
- Watch out!

338
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,684
You didn't
answer my question.

339
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,019
Are you always this cocky?

340
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,812
Only on Tuesdays

341
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,693
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

342
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,196
Damn you!

343
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,951
Can't you see
we're trying to have a conversation?

344
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,886
What is your name?

345
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,555
Constance.

346
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,267
Constance. Sounds very steadfast.

347
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,603
A quality you seem to know little about.

348
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,355
Oh, I beg to differ.

349
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,233
Deep down, I am a hopeless romantic.

350
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,235
Back for more?

351
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,791
Musketeers! Musketeers! Musketeers!

352
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,088
I'd forgotten what it feels like.

353
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,048
We all have.

354
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,803
The name is D'Artagnan.

355
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,973
You must come from a very small town.

356
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,266
How did you know?

357
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,726
Lines like yours
might actually work there.

358
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,771
This is Paris.
I suggest you stick to swordplay.

359
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,568
In the battle of wits,
you, sir, are unarmed.

360
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,741
She's right, lad.

361
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,161
The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

362
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,498
They have 1,000 ways of saying, "No,"
and only some of them mean, "Yes."

363
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,417
I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

364
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,420
And unless you wish to
fight an entire army.

365
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,299
Elsewhere.

366
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,764
So, now what?
Do we pick up where we left off?

367
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,892
I think there's been enough fighting
for one day.

368
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,478
Besides, any man who's an enemy
of Rochefort is a friend of mine.

369
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,646
Who's Rochefort?

370
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,982
Captain of the Cardinal's guards.

371
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,443
The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

372
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,862
Rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in Europe.

373
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,823
You certainly know how to pick your fights.

374
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,910
Like I said, he insulted my horse.

375
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,665
You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous,

376
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,835
probably be dead by sundown,
but I like you, lad.

377
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,089
- Where are you staying?
- No idea.

378
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,091
Ah! Do you have any money?

379
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,679
Well, good sir,

380
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:17,184
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home.

381
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,811
For the time being.

382
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,273
That goes in there.

383
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,194
Come on.

384
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,322
What shall we drink to?

385
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,783
How about the King?

386
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:37,663
He's a child. Cardinal rules in all
but name, might as well drink to him.

387
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,707
To France.

388
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,544
We served it, fought for it and bled for it.
Look where it got us.

389
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,296
Friendship? Love?

390
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,550
Word of advice, boy.
Trust no one.

391
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,055
Must be something you still believe in.

392
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,059
This.

393
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,561
And this.

394
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,609
Anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something.

395
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,746
I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly,
but don't let it fool you.

396
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,583
- Deep down...
- He really is cold and unfriendly.

397
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,711
What happened to him?

398
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,089
What happens to any man, a woman.

399
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,051
You know, I don't want to offend anybody,

400
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,432
but I thought you'd all be
a little bit more...heroic.

401
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,105
What my esteemed colleague
was trying to say, in his own way,

402
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,566
is that we are obsolete.

403
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,820
We're warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

404
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,283
And so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the Cardinal's guards

405
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,201
and then we drink some more.

406
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,122
What we need is a great cause.

407
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,625
But there are no great causes left.

408
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,587
Which is why I keep telling you it's not
too late to do that priest thing again.

409
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,838
Beats working for the city.

410
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,133
Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then there's the nuns.

411
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,843
You were a priest?

412
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,054
Until I realized being a man of God

413
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,473
and a man of the cloth
aren't always the same thing.

414
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,893
And yet, he still says prayers
for those he kills.

415
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,020
- Old habit.
- On the contrary.

416
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,647
The men I kill deserve to die.

417
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,150
But they also deserve peace.

418
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,527
After all, they must have believed
in something.

419
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,822
We all do. Even the worst of us.

420
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,033
I'll drink to that!

421
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,411
Planchet! More wine!

422
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,664
Planchet!

423
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,875
Sorry, sirs.

424
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,169
I'm afraid

425
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,255
there's none left. You've drunk the lot.

426
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,673
What sort of answer's that?

427
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,134
Well, go get some more, man!

428
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,512
Very good, sir. It's just, I can't, sir.

429
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,848
We've run out of money.

430
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,353
Planchet, what are you?

431
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,064
- Complete and utter waste of space, sir?
- And?

432
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,358
- As much use as a fart in a bottle, sir?
- Right.

433
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,736
In short, sir, a total tit, sir.
But I can't work bleeding miracles!

434
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,863
Planchet?

435
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,866
Oh!

436
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,954
Thank you very much, sir!

437
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,041
That's incredibly generous
from such a handsome, young man.

438
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,210
Thank you very, very much.

439
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,420
Will you be staying here tonight?

440
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,839
He'll be taking your bed, Planchet.

441
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,343
Right, and so I'll be sleeping...

442
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,886
You may take the balcony.

443
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,347
Outside? The balcony outside in the cold?

444
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,392
With birds shitting on my head all night?

445
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,269
Great, can I just say you...

446
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,728
Wine! Wine!

447
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,065
- Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!
- Yes! Of course! Wine it is, sirs!

448
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,630
Check.

449
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,300
This is a ridiculous game.

450
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,011
Surely the King
should be the most powerful piece?

451
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,847
The King is the most important piece.

452
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,349
But he's vulnerable, he needs protection.

453
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,643
May I suggest you castle him?

454
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,944
Checkmate.

455
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,160
There. What do you think of that?

456
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,788
Your Majesty is a force of nature.

457
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,709
- Took you by surprise, eh?
- Yes, indeed, you did.

458
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,297
May we speak a little about foreign policy?

459
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,926
- It's not about Buckingham, is it?
- Oh, I'm afraid it is.

460
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,887
He's arriving in Paris tomorrow.

461
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,266
His master, King James, has agreed
to hear our peace proposal.

462
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,938
Good, good. Well, he knows better
than to mess with me, then.

463
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,397
There's also another matter.

464
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,525
A dangerous rivalry has sprung

465
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,195
between Your Majesty's Musketeers
and my personal guards.

466
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,863
Who was involved?

467
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,200
Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

468
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,827
The usual suspects.

469
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,413
And a young man called D'Artagnan.

470
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:36,002
I have summoned them to the palace so that
Your Majesty can punish them severely.

471
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,066
His Majesty, the King!

472
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,360
Well, well, well.

473
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,407
Brawling with the Cardinal's guards.

474
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,409
That's very bad.

475
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,536
What have you got to say for yourselves?

476
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,164
- We...
- Humbly beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

477
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,709
Yes.
Yes, I should hope so, too.

478
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,087
So, tell me, how many
were involved in the altercation?

479
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,882
There were four of us against 40 of them,
Your Majesty.

480
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,551
Four against 40?

481
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,556
And you beat them like a drum?

482
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,767
And, yes, you shall have to be reprimanded,
of course,

483
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,602
most harshly, I'm afraid.

484
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,230
- You do understand that, don't you?
- We do, Your Majesty.

485
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,398
Her Majesty, the Queen.

486
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,365
Anne.

487
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,826
What a... What a pleasant surprise!

488
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,246
My ladies and I wanted to see
the valiant Musketeers

489
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,040
who stood against the Cardinal's guards.

490
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,751
Four against 40?

491
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,002
Or was it 400?

492
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,005
Just 40, Your Majesty.

493
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,631
Lt was an off day.

494
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,343
That's my Musketeers for you.

495
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,179
By the time they write songs about them,
it'll be 4,000.

496
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,764
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

497
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,059
After all, boys will be boys.

498
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,107
You must be D'Artagnan.

499
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,446
My lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

500
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,324
But you must try not to be so reckless.

501
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,784
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

502
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,286
- Your Majesty, the culprits.
- Ah! Yes, yes.

503
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,915
Well, stand up, then.

504
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,215
Athos.

505
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,300
Porthos.

506
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,302
Aramis.

507
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,810
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

508
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,397
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

509
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,191
A former Musketeer as well.

510
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,027
These are the only clothes I have.

511
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,155
Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

512
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,660
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

513
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,455
New suits all around, I think.

514
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,917
Yes. You'll see to that, Cardinal?

515
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,630
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

516
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,257
You'll see to that as well, Cardinal.

517
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,259
And, yes, before I forget,

518
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,137
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

519
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,596
Hmm?

520
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,351
Or there'll be none of them left.

521
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,856
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

522
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,858
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

523
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,402
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

524
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,654
After all, they are his Musketeers.

525
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,197
Good day, gentlemen.

526
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,581
Well, now,
off with you rascals.

527
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:05,003
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

528
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,923
I tire of these royal children.

529
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,218
Lt's time to make our move.

530
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,181
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

531
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,266
During his visit, we will reveal

532
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,811
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

533
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,398
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

534
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,111
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

535
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,198
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

536
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,076
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

537
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,746
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

538
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,081
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

539
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,627
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

540
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,048
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

541
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:54,886
A piece of the Queen's jewelry given
to Buckingham as a token of affection.

542
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,096
Buckingham will be humiliated.

543
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,640
The King will be outraged.

544
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,267
The Queen will be executed.

545
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,687
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

546
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,068
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

547
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:16,324
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

548
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,159
Hmm.

549
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,914
Someone like Your Eminence.

550
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,136
About face!

551
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,657
Well, where is he, then?
Lt's just appalling manners.

552
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,640
Drop anchor!

553
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,100
Anchor aweigh!

554
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,366
Damn his impudence!

555
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,203
What is that thing called
anyway, Richelieu?

556
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,873
An airship, Your Majesty.

557
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,799
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

558
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,136
Right, right. Well, build me one.

559
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,069
Secure the lines!

560
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,987
All lines secured!

561
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,964
Buckingham.

562
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,510
Blue.

563
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,012
Oh.

564
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,644
Your Majesty.

565
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,271
Love the outfit.

566
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,023
Very retro.

567
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,525
We were all wearing those in London,

568
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,862
when was it, last year or the year before?

569
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,034
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

570
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,953
Not at all. No.

571
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,287
On the contrary.

572
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,333
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

573
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,627
Cardinal.

574
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,970
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

575
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,307
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

576
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,143
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

577
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,728
Your Majesty.

578
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,315
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

579
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,942
You've met before?

580
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,527
A long time ago.

581
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,572
An evening I shall cherish forever.

582
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,159
Right. Well, shall we?

583
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,915
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

584
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,793
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

585
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,670
We've met, yes.

586
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,758
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

587
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,552
Most unfortunate habit.

588
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,346
Lt's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

589
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,850
I look forward to it.

590
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,020
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

591
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,904
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

592
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,572
Wine?

593
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,199
I don't drink.

594
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,994
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

595
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,831
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

596
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,334
And yours in mine.

597
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,672
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

598
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,383
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

599
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,554
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

600
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,015
Whose advantage? Yours?

601
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,099
Ours.

602
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:58,231
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

603
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,401
Very impressive.

604
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,491
And march!
Left, left, left, right, left!

605
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,621
Hold your line!

606
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,872
Halt!

607
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,749
About face!

608
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,086
Stay where you are!

609
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,255
This is the Queen's wing.
You can't be up here.

610
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,673
Oh, thank goodness.

611
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,135
I got so lost. I took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me.

612
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,682
I've been trapped up here, in the sun,
in this heat.

613
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,017
- It's going to be all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna faint.

614
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,395
- You're in safe hands.
- Thank you.

615
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,938
And march!

616
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,003
Halt!

617
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,214
You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

618
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,591
Shh!

619
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,634
Wait for it!

620
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,979
Left, left!

621
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,067
Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey, excuse me!

622
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,737
Pardon, Your Majesty.

623
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,739
This will only take a moment.

624
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,659
What are you doing here?

625
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,704
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

626
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,206
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

627
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,458
I was...

628
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:45,046
I was thinking, after I'm finished
with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

629
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,881
I can't. I have plans.

630
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,965
What about tomorrow?

631
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,091
I have a lot of plans.

632
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,801
- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

633
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,846
You may have a new set of clothes
and the King's favor,

634
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,223
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

635
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,975
Now excuse me.

636
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,369
And halt!

637
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,163
About face!

638
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,916
And march!

639
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,419
Left! Left, right, left!

640
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,885
Two summons in two days.
Your Majesty honors me.

641
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,930
Cut it out.
Please, think nothing of it.

642
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,891
You're a good fellow, D'Artagnan.

643
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,728
So, how are the ladies
treating you these days?

644
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,690
- Can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

645
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,025
Well, same here, of course. Thing is...

646
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,656
I've got this friend.

647
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,450
Just a regular chap, like you and me.

648
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,536
He got married very young.

649
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:02,081
Political alliance, arranged marriage,
you know the sort of thing.

650
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,374
Hardly knew the girl.

651
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,460
- But he likes her?
- Oh, yes.

652
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,670
Mmm-hmm.

653
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,754
Very much.

654
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,881
Well, does she like him?

655
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,719
Well, funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

656
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,971
He's... He's not sure.

657
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,308
Well, he just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

658
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,937
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

659
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,899
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

660
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,693
Lt's torture just to look at her.

661
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,530
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

662
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,494
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

663
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,832
He should speak his heart.

664
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,878
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

665
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,007
Be himself.

666
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,176
Well, that's what I told him.

667
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,094
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

668
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,972
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

669
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,893
Yes. Yes. lt's good to have friends.

670
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,315
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

671
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,650
I don't believe it.

672
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,867
How are you?

673
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,786
Very well.

674
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,831
I'm wearing blue.

675
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,000
And you look very handsome in it.

676
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:34,090
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

677
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:38,094
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

678
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,555
How beautiful you are.

679
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,558
Thank you, My Lord.

680
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,738
- How did it go?
- Clockwork.

681
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,281
Good.

682
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,535
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

683
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,329
And what should I do with them?

684
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,249
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

685
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,293
- The Tower of London.
- Yup.

686
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,464
When the scandal breaks,
he'll deny everything.

687
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,133
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

688
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,011
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

689
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,891
And what of the future of France?

690
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,645
I am France.

691
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,989
One last thing.

692
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,162
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

693
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,332
for a double agent to play both sides.

694
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,795
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

695
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,463
Spare me the rhetoric.

696
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,550
I know who you are. I know what you are.

697
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,597
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

698
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,516
I admire such skills.

699
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,936
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

700
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,438
you might be using them against me.

701
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,317
Do we understand one another?

702
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,696
There

703
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,074
is another side to that coin.

704
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,912
Lt's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

705
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,874
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

706
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,961
rot in jail or on the gallows.

707
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,965
Your point being?

708
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:08,178
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

709
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,558
An insurance policy, if you will.

710
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,644
My word should suffice.

711
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,690
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

712
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,568
substantial.

713
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,991
"It is by my order
and for the good of the State

714
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:33,162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

715
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,122
Satisfied?

716
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,623
Immensely.

717
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,381
Your Majesty.

718
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,841
Purple?

719
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,304
Fashion favors the bold.

720
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,681
Here.

721
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,600
Try this for size.

722
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,144
Oh, well.

723
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,937
Do give my regards to the Queen.

724
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:03,317
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

725
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,320
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

726
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,280
All mine.

727
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,829
Your Eminence.

728
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Richelieu!

729
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,768
Richelieu!

730
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,687
There has been
the most distressing development.

731
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,147
Certain letters,

732
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,234
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

733
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,568
Letters from him.

734
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,238
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

735
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,407
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

736
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,827
No. Of course I haven't.
She'll just deny the whole thing!

737
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,203
Hmm.

738
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,997
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

739
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,252
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

740
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,755
- A token of affection, perhaps?
- Yes.

741
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,298
Yes, there is.

742
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,553
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

743
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,432
"I shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me,

744
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,268
"the proof of our consummated love."

745
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,355
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

746
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,274
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

747
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,569
Oh, my God!

748
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,239
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

749
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,867
What? How would that help?

750
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,454
Lt would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

751
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,746
that she wear your gift.

752
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,877
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

753
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,504
So, if she has the diamonds...

754
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,381
Your Majesty can rest easy.

755
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,634
And if she doesn't?

756
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,055
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

757
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,892
Send my diamonds to the jeweler's
to be polished.

758
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,936
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

759
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,416
I hope I am not interrupting.

760
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,336
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

761
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
I know.

762
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,299
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

763
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,134
I know.

764
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,844
Yeah.

765
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,805
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

766
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,893
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

767
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,104
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

768
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,815
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

769
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,526
I thought you'd say that.

770
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,154
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

771
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,281
To look into your eyes when you said it.

772
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,251
Your Majesty.

773
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,631
All may not be lost yet.

774
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,013
Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

775
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,558
Lt's not a matter of
life or death, you know?

776
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,476
Actually, it is.

777
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,478
You want me to go to England,

778
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,313
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

779
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,315
might be in Buckingham's possession,

780
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,734
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

781
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,070
highly impregnable facility?

782
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,280
The Tower of London.

783
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,241
Since the Cardinal's spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

784
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,617
it is the most logical choice.

785
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:45,163
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

786
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,208
mercenary, bounty hunter,

787
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,045
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

788
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,839
Did I miss anything?

789
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,507
All in five days.

790
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,801
A minor detail. Anything else?

791
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,011
No.

792
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,097
Well, I really only have
one question for you.

793
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,142
Why in the world would I do that?

794
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,943
England it is.

795
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,198
Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

796
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,659
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

797
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,745
Who's with me?

798
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,628
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

799
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,716
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

800
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,346
Besides, I hear the English women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

801
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,182
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

802
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,978
This isn't a great cause,
but it'll have to do.

803
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,444
Buckingham's there, so is she.

804
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,904
Who?

805
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,906
Countess de Winter.

806
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,532
Charlotte Backson.

807
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,160
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

808
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,412
Milady.

809
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,081
Milady?

810
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,626
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

811
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,544
She's switched sides again.

812
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,588
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

813
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,131
What are you going to do if you catch her?

814
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,428
Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

815
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,597
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

816
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:30,769
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

817
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,147
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

818
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,901
The moment they step out,

819
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,986
kill them.

820
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,615
Light the torches!

821
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,410
I'll count to five, then
we'll burn you out!

822
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,208
One!

823
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:54,751
Two!

824
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,294
Three!

825
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,380
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

826
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,673
Damn you!

827
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,970
Fire!

828
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,361
Let me guess.

829
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,739
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

830
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,575
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

831
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,536
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

832
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,831
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

833
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,542
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

834
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,587
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

835
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,257
- Was it not?
- Eminence...

836
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,009
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

837
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:47,095
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

838
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,723
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

839
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,601
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

840
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,686
Post a bounty on their heads.

841
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,605
The bigger, the better.

842
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,523
Yes, Your Eminence.

843
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,066
Rochefort.

844
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,322
Do not fail me again.

845
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:19,503
Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

846
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,546
How the hell did he get here so fast?

847
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,719
- Now what?
- We need a distraction.

848
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,346
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

849
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,680
I could go.

850
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,390
Probably not.

851
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,517
Wrong.

852
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,394
Wrong on all counts.
You'll need every sword where you're going.

853
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,105
I can't help you there, but I can help.

854
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,399
Right here, right now.

855
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,734
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

856
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,445
- If they catch you...
- I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

857
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,614
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

858
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,742
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

859
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,411
Which one of us should be worried?

860
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:54,955
Go.

861
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,207
Go so that you can come back.

862
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,428
Now give me that hat.

863
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,104
D'Artagnan!

864
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,313
Get after him!

865
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:37,956
Wait!

866
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,461
The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

867
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,132
located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

868
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,259
The lock is state of the art.

869
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,137
Lt requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

870
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,805
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

871
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

872
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,727
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

873
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,229
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

874
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,023
Please don't tell me off.

875
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,984
Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

876
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,945
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

877
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,072
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

878
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,657
with a predilection for not being robbed.

879
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,494
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we're coming, thanks to Milady,

880
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,079
that number is likely to be greater.

881
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,999
And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

882
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,170
Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

883
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,757
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

884
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,760
Athos is coming.

885
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,429
Tell me.

886
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,016
What do you suppose he's after?

887
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,893
What does it matter?

888
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,607
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

889
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,735
He wants me.

890
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,446
And he wants you.

891
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,409
We shall have to be ready for him.

892
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,870
Won't we?

893
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:03,875
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

894
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,795
He'll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

895
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,799
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

896
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,884
She knows us.

897
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,388
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

898
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,890
He'll divide his forces, independent teams,

899
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,102
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

900
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,270
There are four of us. So we use...

901
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,190
Well, there's five of
us, actually, if you...

902
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,196
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route, through the Traitor's Gate.

903
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,412
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

904
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,873
Check every tower, every rooftop.

905
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:50,422
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

906
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,259
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

907
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,475
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

908
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,187
One more thing.

909
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,527
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

910
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,529
Claim to have secret information

911
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,240
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

912
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:21,661
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

913
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:25,248
or you're looking to get rid of me.

914
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:32,630
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

915
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,259
Although,

916
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,015
I suppose I should

917
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,603
search you for concealed weapons.

918
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,899
That's how it's done.

919
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,903
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

920
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,406
So we do the unexpected.

921
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,952
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

922
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:06,539
With all the extra security, there'll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

923
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,834
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

924
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,463
We are the decoys.

925
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,300
Now we'll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

926
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,260
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

927
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,554
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

928
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,808
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

929
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,601
You want to serve France?

930
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,645
This is your chance.

931
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,489
Left, right, left, right, left!

932
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:40,949
I thought you saw the signal!

933
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,119
- I saw you waving like an idiot!
- Well, that was the bloody signal!

934
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,954
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

935
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,498
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

936
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,041
- Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
- Yes!

937
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,417
That's enough of that!

938
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,421
Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

939
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,466
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

940
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,551
Arrest me?

941
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,927
You can't arrest me!

942
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,388
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

943
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,432
- Bantams? They are rotten!
- They are not rotten!

944
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,501
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

945
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,920
The game is afoot.

946
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:40,091
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

947
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,011
Double everything.

948
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,679
Sir!

949
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,515
They'll come to us.

950
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,768
Well, then.

951
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,646
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

952
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,108
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

953
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,613
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary.

954
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,449
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

955
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,951
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

956
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,416
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

957
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:20,965
Red.

958
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,051
Why?

959
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,262
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

960
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:28,973
Hmm.

961
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,693
As far from here as possible.

962
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,334
Well, well, well.

963
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,798
Look at what the cat dragged in.

964
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,551
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

965
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:10,515
Still his surly,
insufferable self, I'm sure.

966
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,143
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

967
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,938
I should feel insulted.

968
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,110
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

969
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,573
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

970
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:31,411
Although the price of loss,
as you'll come to discover,

971
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,663
is a little bit higher.

972
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:36,833
What?

973
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,502
No last words?

974
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,838
No insults?

975
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,674
- Pleas for mercy or...
- What time is it?

976
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,848
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

977
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,686
Look out of the window.

978
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,863
They weren't the decoys. I was.

979
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,270
Ahhh!

980
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,471
Permission to come aboard?

981
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,639
Granted.

982
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,158
Athos!

983
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:56,013
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

984
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,684
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

985
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,102
Eminence.

986
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,481
The pride of victory
without the risk of loss.

987
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,152
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

988
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,321
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

989
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,449
Such as?

990
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,176
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

991
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,302
Nope.

992
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,679
Milady likes hedging her bets.

993
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,722
She'd never have taken the chance

994
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,390
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

995
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,852
So where are they now?

996
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,688
With the only person she trusts.

997
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,488
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

998
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,114
I wouldn't say that.

999
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,789
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

1000
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,335
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

1001
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,171
that was someone else entirely.

1002
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,968
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

1003
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,267
Driver! What the hell is going on?

1004
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,479
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

1005
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,885
Whoo-hoo!

1006
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,818
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

1007
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,528
well done.

1008
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,154
Thank you, sir.

1009
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,824
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

1010
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:20,950
Shut up, Planchet.

1011
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,159
Yes, sir.

1012
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,668
Don't.

1013
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,299
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

1014
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,515
What now?

1015
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,144
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

1016
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,520
Dealer's choice.

1017
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,443
- Anything else you'd like me to take off?
- Outside.

1018
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,665
Boys.

1019
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,917
Been a while.

1020
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,048
This must be the young Gascon.

1021
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,550
We've met before.

1022
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,178
Ah, yes.

1023
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,805
Small world.

1024
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,851
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

1025
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,438
You do remember that, don't you?

1026
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,406
- Did you kill Buckingham?
- No.

1027
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,451
- But you will kill me?
- Yes.

1028
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,247
You would spare him, but kill me?

1029
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:53,167
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

1030
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,552
Here.

1031
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,971
You may find use for this.

1032
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,476
Move.

1033
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,469
Athos.

1034
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:08,159
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

1035
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,205
She did it for me.

1036
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:19,462
I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

1037
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,674
Come on, let's go home.

1038
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,773
But I can't get it.

1039
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,858
How marvelous!

1040
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,196
Oh! So great!

1041
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,705
Oh!

1042
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,875
Your Majesty.

1043
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,543
My dear.

1044
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,712
You look troubled.

1045
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,840
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

1046
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,092
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1047
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,054
I just wanted to drop by

1048
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,972
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

1049
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:17,561
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

1050
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,772
But you,

1051
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,859
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

1052
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,446
And especially since
you'll wear the diamonds.

1053
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,949
You will wear them, won't you?

1054
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:33,994
Well, it's very important
to me that you do.

1055
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:38,374
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

1056
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,126
Until tonight, then.

1057
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,763
She promised she'll wear them.

1058
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,267
You do think she'll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

1059
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,395
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

1060
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,105
I'm sure she will.

1061
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,135
I hate air travel!

1062
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,443
Damn!

1063
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:19,683
Hard to starboard!

1064
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,407
Well, now that we have their attention,

1065
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,701
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

1066
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,745
More or less.

1067
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,624
Ah, Gascon!

1068
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,211
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

1069
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,171
But, once again, you're outmatched.

1070
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:51,382
You can thank Milady for that.

1071
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,343
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

1072
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,012
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

1073
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,224
Isn't she a beauty?

1074
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,684
What do you want?

1075
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,020
The diamonds.

1076
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,398
- Come and take them.
- Gladly!

1077
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,360
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

1078
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,778
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1079
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,989
you'll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

1080
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,411
You have 60 seconds.

1081
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,206
He'll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

1082
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,290
We can't outrun them.

1083
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,917
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

1084
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,253
- Oh, D'Artagnan.
- What?

1085
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,381
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

1086
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:33,716
What if she dies?

1087
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,300
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

1088
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,302
what would you do
if you were in my position?

1089
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,266
I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

1090
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:45,436
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

1091
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:48,605
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

1092
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:53,068
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

1093
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,778
Don't end up like me.

1094
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:58,949
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1095
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:01,785
France will take care of itself.

1096
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:04,955
Time's up!

1097
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:09,626
An exchange.

1098
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,048
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

1099
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,258
Once I know she's safe,

1100
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,802
I give them to you.

1101
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,806
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

1102
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,725
Planchet.

1103
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,812
Cut her loose.

1104
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,650
- Deploy the gangway!
- Deploy the gangway!

1105
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,661
Satisfied?

1106
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,543
You never learn, do you?

1107
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:40,884
Fire!

1108
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,057
Hard right!

1109
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,159
Fire!

1110
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,923
Good.

1111
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,593
I really want you to see this.

1112
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,052
Finish them off!

1113
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,265
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

1114
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:31,226
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

1115
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,103
We hide. In there.

1116
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,612
Fire!

1117
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:42,946
Fire!

1118
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,799
Lay in a pursuit course!

1119
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,260
Lay in a pursuit course!

1120
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:06,428
Fire!

1121
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,769
He's persistent, I'll give him that!

1122
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:16,313
Fire!

1123
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,695
But, sir! We can't go into the storm!

1124
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:29,076
Anyone?

1125
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:32,120
Anyone else who wants to question orders?

1126
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,749
Good.

1127
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:55,477
Sir, now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise?

1128
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,687
Shut up, Planchet.

1129
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:58,021
Yes, sir.

1130
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,873
Where are they?

1131
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,420
You're never gonna find them in there.

1132
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:24,006
I beg to differ.

1133
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,815
Keep after them!

1134
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,067
I'll take the Gascon!

1135
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,154
Hard to starboard!

1136
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,683
You know what your problem is, boy?

1137
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:21,021
You read too many books,
and then you believed them.

1138
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,149
Courage, honor.

1139
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,443
All for one.

1140
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,530
But history isn't written by heroes,
it's written by victors.

1141
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,657
Keep your eyes open!

1142
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,002
Round two.

1143
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,295
Oh...

1144
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:57,349
Return fire!

1145
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,360
Pull up, damn it!

1146
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:09,694
We're too heavy!

1147
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,698
You scared to take me in a fair fight?

1148
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:16,284
Hardly.

1149
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,912
I just don't fight fair.

1150
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:25,752
Captain Rochefort!

1151
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:27,712
Oh, well.

1152
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:46,690
Drop the ballast!

1153
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,316
Drop everything!

1154
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:50,444
And fire up the burners!

1155
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,237
Over the side!

1156
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,573
Drop those barrels!

1157
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,658
Faster! Move!

1158
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:09,629
Shall we?

1159
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:20,974
Hold on!

1160
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,438
Get out of the way!

1161
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,232
Go! Run!

1162
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:45,433
I still have the diamonds.
What do you propose to do about that?

1163
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,060
Kill you.

1164
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,987
If you insist.

1165
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:07,998
Oh!

1166
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,807
You should've stayed in Gascony, boy.

1167
01:35:39,483 --> 01:35:42,026
You should've apologized to my horse.

1168
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:19,689
Surround the palace!
Shoot the Musketeers on sight!

1169
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:23,359
Use every man at your disposal!
Any means necessary!

1170
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:25,278
- Your Eminence!
- Don't interrupt!

1171
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,280
These men must not...

1172
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:54,599
Arrest these men!

1173
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,274
What is the meaning of this?

1174
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,070
Your Majesty, these men...

1175
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:10,406
Are delivering a gift for Your Majesty.
Compliments of the Cardinal.

1176
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,577
Cardinal, you shouldn't have.

1177
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:20,542
Well, Your Majesty did ask me
to get you one of those, so...

1178
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:22,293
So I did.

1179
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:27,340
But what happened to it?

1180
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,176
Buckingham's spy, Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

1181
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:32,095
- He's been dealt with.
- Rochefort?

1182
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,639
He's Captain of your guards, isn't he?

1183
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,849
Actually,

1184
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:39,644
His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

1185
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,526
"lt is by my order
and for the good of the State

1186
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:50,738
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

1187
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:55,910
- That's your signature, isn't it, Richelieu?
- It would appear so, Your Majesty.

1188
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:57,996
Well, let me get this right.

1189
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:02,750
You brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst?

1190
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:05,420
How can I ever repay you?

1191
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:07,505
I could think of a few ways.

1192
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:09,757
Anne.

1193
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:13,469
I was just returning from the jewelers.

1194
01:38:16,473 --> 01:38:18,433
Well, I realize it's a little early,

1195
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:21,644
but the orchestra's here and so are we.

1196
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:24,814
Would Your Majesty care to dance?

1197
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:26,941
I would love to.

1198
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,988
Well, mind out, you fellows!

1199
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:33,448
D'Artagnan.

1200
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:35,491
Well, well, well.

1201
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:40,163
Looks like you aren't the only one
who gets the girl.

1202
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,457
Your Majesty is a natural.

1203
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,043
Guess I am.

1204
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,837
As a matter of fact,

1205
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:51,424
I think you'll start noticing
a few more changes around here.

1206
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,760
Thank you.

1207
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:56,888
For everything.

1208
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,431
Any time.

1209
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,601
Well, strike up, then!

1210
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:02,977
Your Majesty!

1211
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,229
Positions, please, gentlemen!

1212
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:11,778
Well-played.

1213
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,289
I could use men like you.

1214
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,837
I already have a job.

1215
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,215
- I'm a drunk.
- I'm independently wealthy.

1216
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,050
Thanks, but no.

1217
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,596
The day will come
when you'll wish you had said, "Yes".

1218
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:39,889
Maybe.

1219
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,265
But not today.

1220
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,393
Maybe not today.

1221
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,446
Enjoying the show?

1222
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,573
Are you always this cocky?

1223
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,075
Only on Tuesdays

1224
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:01,452
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

1225
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,579
So you think I'm beautiful.

1226
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,666
Actually, it's Tuesday.

1227
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:36,487
- So, what now?
- We drink.

1228
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:37,947
And then what?

1229
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,242
Wherever they send us.
Whatever France needs.

1230
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,328
I thought you didn't believe
in that stuff anymore.

1231
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:46,998
I believe in us.

1232
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:49,167
Till the day I stop believing that,

1233
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,628
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for.

1234
01:40:58,594 --> 01:40:59,677
All for one!

1235
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,304
And one for all!

1236
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:04,807
You know, sirs,

1237
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:10,146
I know you can be mean, tough,
foul-tempered bastards,

1238
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:14,192
but sometimes I get the feeling
that deep down you're all...

1239
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,694
Shut up, Planchet!

1240
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:18,863
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1241
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:35,838
In case you're wondering,
this isn't the afterlife.

1242
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,341
I'm not dead,

1243
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:40,593
and neither are you.

1244
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,265
What?

1245
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:49,852
How did you...

1246
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:52,146
Followed Athos.

1247
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,524
We fished you out of the Channel.

1248
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,698
- Where are we going?
- To France, of course.

1249
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,035
Sail away!

1250
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:10,998
To get back what's mine
and pay back, with interest.

1251
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:13,000
