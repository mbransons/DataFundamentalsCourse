00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,331
I don't care how many
missions you've flown!

159
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,653
I don't care how good you
think you are! You're nobody!

160
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,922
And for the next ten days, nobody
takes a crap unless I say so!

161
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,526
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

162
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,245
I said "Attention".

163
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,349
Now, didn't I make myself clear?
Or don't you take orders?

164
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,744
When I say "Attention",
I mean "Attention".

165
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,769
Yes, sir!

166
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,372
- Now!
- (BOOING)

167
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,280
- You eyeballin' me, mister?
- No, sir!

168
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,482
The next time I see that
ugly face of yours,

169
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,253
I want it clean-shaven!
Suck in that chest!

170
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,101
Pfaffenbach!

171
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,963
- What you lookin' at, boy?
<i>- No-one, sir!</i>

172
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,384
Oh, I'm some lowlife that's not
good enough for you to talk to?

173
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,587
Well, that attitude is
short on collateral!

174
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:50,116
This lowlife is God as
far as you're concerned!

175
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,741
Hey, hey. Lighten up.

176
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,827
Cut the kid some slack.

177
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,919
Who the hell are you
talkin' to, son?

178
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,423
Your ego's writin' checks
your body can't cash.

179
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,028
Now you got five minutes
to stow your gear.

180
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,506
Get movin'!

181
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,311
Yeah, I'm sure deep
down he means well.

182
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,873
I hope you were paying attention.

183
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,585
- I don't think we've met.
- Kent Gregory.

184
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,671
Excuse me if I don't
shake your hand.

185
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:28,301
Your father killed someone very special
to me: Dominic "Mailman" Farnham.

186
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,053
- You mean...
- Yes.

187
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,907
Dominic Farnham was my father.
I was his love child.

188
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,753
- It was a hunting accident.
- Accident, my deep-blue eyes.

189
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,230
It was reckless, irresponsible
flying, and you know it.

190
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,708
Are you OK?

191
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,026
This is an incredible coincidence,

192
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,050
but the hunter who mistakenly
killed your father

193
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,229
was Henry Pfaffenbach, my father.

194
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,975
I feel terrible.

195
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,982
Isn't this Henry Alva Pfaffenbach?

196
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,856
My mother was a Pfaffenbach.

197
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,859
Not... Doreen Pfaffenbach?

198
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,073
- From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

199
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,157
Then we're cousins! We used to
spend our summers in Eagle River.

200
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,205
PILOTS: Eagle River?

201
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,037
I hope you can forgive me for this.

202
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,166
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

203
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,759
That's all right. It's not your fault.
Anyone could have made that mistake.

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,760
But him... he's the type that could end
up killing every man in this outfit.

205
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,848
Wait a minute. Why are you mad at me?
He's the one who ate your father.

206
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,856
Like father, like son. You've
already been tossed out once.

207
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,146
Hold it, hold it.

208
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,534
We can't fight among ourselves.
We're all on the same team here.

209
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,487
I want the two of
you to shake hands.

210
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,536
There, now. Isn't that better?

211
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,746
- (FALSETTO) Yeah.
- (FALSETTO) Sure.

212
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,091
There. We're friends again.

213
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,921
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

214
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,635
Look, Dead Meat. We fly together, we
sleep next to each other, but that's all.

215
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,226
Don't get too close. Let
me handle my own affairs.

216
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,652
He's so complex.

217
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,257
Aerial photos and recon reports
indicate a defensive arsenal

218
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,551
in the D, and perhaps -C,
categories.

219
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,053
There's also some
anti-aircraft squadrons.

220
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,474
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella high
enough to make any attack ineffective.

221
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,811
I don't have a clue what
you're talkin' about, Phil.

222
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,815
I have a shell the size of a
fist in my head Pork Chop Hill.

223
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,858
The only way I can
make this toup stay on

224
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,529
is by magnetizing the upper
left quadrant of my skull.

225
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,824
You just go ahead and do what
you do. Do you have any soup?

226
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,411
Of course, sir. I'll have the
mess bring something right up.

227
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,247
I love soup. I mean,
I think I love soup.

228
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,898
Son-of-a-bitchin' shell. It's either soup
or duck. Which one do you shoot?

229
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,144
Duck, sir.

230
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,132
- Are you all right, sir?
- Of course I'm all right.

231
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,780
Why? What have you heard?

232
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,620
Nothing, sir.

233
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,055
Send some soup up for the
admiral, on the double.

234
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,767
Let's go over this Slippery
Weevil one more time.

235
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,805
I wanna familiarize myself with
it as much as I possibly can.

236
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:30,025
So... give it to me, Ben.
Every word. Every detail.

237
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,219
Dot every comma.

238
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,703
(UNSCREWING LIGHT BULB)

239
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,880
Those are some long legs.

240
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,185
I just had them lengthened.
Now they go all the way up.

241
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,685
Wow.

242
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,179
It's nice to see you again.

243
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,581
I was really impressed, the way
you handled that stallion.

244
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,231
When I saw you dig your
heels into his sides

245
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,586
tighten the reins and
break his spirit,

246
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,655
I never wanted to be a
horse so much in my life.

247
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,327
After I finish off this shrink, we can
take a quick canter in the meadow.

248
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,534
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

249
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,266
- You're the psychiatrist?
- That's what the diploma says.

250
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,728
I've never been to a psychiatrist
before. You will be gentle?

251
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,172
<i>(DOG YAPS)</i>

252
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,609
I've been ordered to
review your records.

253
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,432
You were discharged from the service 18
months ago for willful insubordination.

254
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:05,453
You disobeyed a direct order and
lost a $13m fighter in the process.

255
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,332
Yes, I did. But I'm payin'
it off at ten bucks a week.

256
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,733
I should have gotten that
extra collision coverage.

257
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,989
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

258
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,134
- What do you mean?
- Leland "Buzz" Harley.

259
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,137
Three Purple Hearts,
presidential commendation.

260
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,707
Then this incident,
the Dominic Farnham death.

261
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,059
1971, his Visa card was canceled.

262
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,437
1975, a broken man,

263
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,758
suffocated while working the
night shift in a Fotomat booth.

264
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,003
Tell me how these
events affected you.

265
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,449
Well, I... I don't
think about it much.

266
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,554
That was a long time ago.

267
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,272
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some guns to grease.

268
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,540
Lieutenant...

269
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,770
Have you thought about seeing a
psychiatrist on a regular basis?

270
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,272
I thought you'd never ask.

271
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,027
I mean professionally.

272
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,823
Thanks, Doctor.

273
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,454
Thanks for the advice.

274
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,080
- Be careful out there.
- Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

275
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,103
- No. You're going to get hurt.
- I don't need your help, or anybody's.

276
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,547
I'll be just fine.

277
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,963
Are you OK?

278
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,263
Yeah. I'm fine.

279
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,941
TOPPER: (SHAKILY) Oh...

280
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,276
Attention on deck.

281
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,027
At ease, men.

282
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,607
Be seated.

283
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,345
Many of you are wondering
what's wrong with my pants.

284
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,104
Well, they started running
short of material right before

285
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,825
they got to the knee. So
don't give me any shit.

286
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,316
Now, I look out there at all of
you guys and I say to myself:

287
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,736
what I wouldn't give
to be 20 years younger,

288
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,963
and a woman.

289
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,410
You know, I've flown over 194 missions,
and I was shot down on every one.

290
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,832
Come to think of it, I've never
landed a plane in my life. Now,

291
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,127
<i>you men'll be piloting the backbone
of our proud American arsenal:</i>

292
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,382
<i>the Oscar EW 5894 Phallus
tactical fighter bomber.</i>

293
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,719
<i>Its lightweight sweptwing design makes
it extremely maneuverable and agile.</i>

294
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,767
<i>Beneath its 21st-century skin is a highly
advanced avionics and weapons package.</i>

295
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,478
<i>Designed for speed and
combat acrobatics,</i>

296
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,551
<i>it features the latest Mrs Halver
series 3800 radar-jamming Framus.</i>

297
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,779
- Admiral.
- Nurse.

298
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,284
<i>BLOCK: Sleepy Weasel's success depends
on our maneuvering below enemy radar.</i>

299
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,621
<i>I wanna see a major display of low-level
flying. Topper, Kent, you're up first.</i>

300
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,125
<i>- Show me what you can do.
- Copy that, Purple Fluffer Nutter.</i>

301
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,228
<i>Roger that, Milli
Vanilli Chilly Willy.</i>

302
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:06,129
<i>Bring 'em down, boys. I want your
bellies to scrape the sagebrush.</i>

303
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:07,745
<i>Let's see who's the best.</i>

304
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,114
<i>KENT:
I'm heading for the canyon floor.</i>

305
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,664
<i>- For your information, I'm at 150 feet.
- I'm at 3rd and Main.</i>

306
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,722
Very pretty, but enough

00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,095
May I?

459
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,754
Shouldn't you be getting
back to the base?

460
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:02,453
I suppose, if I played life by
the rules, but you know I don't.

461
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,437
All right. You can walk
me to my apartment.

462
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,091
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

463
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,866
But when I want something
that bad, I get all fired up.

464
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,082
Maybe that's why I worry so.
Maybe more than I should.

465

Something terrible
could happen. You must...

- Don't worry.

Everything will be fine. I promise.

- It's OK.

I have a nosy landlady.

613
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,402
I've been puttin' a little
away for the past ten years.

614
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,258
It's not much. 2500.
I wish I could do more.

615
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,554
Why, Topper.

616
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,311
That's so sweet.

617
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,083
Why, with the three million
I won on this lucky Lotto ticket,

618
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:39,860
I can take this 2500 and
just blow it all on hats.

619
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,536
Right, and halt!

(DOG YELPS)

621
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,044
Pete "Dead Meat"
Thompson... is dead.

622
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,299
So is Mo Green,

623
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,614
Tataglia, Barzini,

624
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,218
the heads of all the five families.

625
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:14,372
It is at moments like these, my dear
friends that we must ask ourselves,

626
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,459
"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

627
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,066
Do good men like Dead Meat Thompson
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

628
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,759
One minute you're in bed
with a knockout gal, or guy,

629
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,737
and the next,
you're a compost heap.

630
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,496
Doesn't that bother you? Because it
scares the living piss outta me!

631
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,978
BLOCK:
I never thought this could happen.

632
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,314
Don't we have what we
need now, Mr Wilson?

633
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,264
This should be enough to prove that
our planes need to be replaced.

634
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,240
No. Those planes have to fail in
combat for the world to take notice.

635
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:48,087
This is a minor incident.

636
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,306
Minor? I just lost
one of my best men!

637
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,310
Are you backing out on us, Block?

638
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,018
I'm doing this for my
country, not for you.

639
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,242
We'll need the backup plan.

640
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,323
Ready... Fire!

641
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,746

00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,765
God, I love a good funeral.

648
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,914
Topper, where are you going?

649
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,247
I'm handin' in my resignation.

650
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,582
You were right. You said
I was dangerous, and I am.

651
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,046
Topper, wait.

652
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,804
Please, let's talk. Huh?

653
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,556
They're right. I'm no
better than my father.

654
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,019
It seems, no matter what I do,
I end up hurting someone.

655
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,475
Ow!

656
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,421
You've got to stop comparing
yourself with your father.

657
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,465
You're two different people.

658
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,551
- We both killed a man.
- That's just a coincidence.

659
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,720
He loved jets. So do I.

660
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,972
He was a loner, just like me.

661
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,667
For God's sakes, I've even
got my father's eyes.

662
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,168
- Topper, please!
- Ah, they're just for luck.

663
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,690
You've got to make your own luck.

664
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,544
Get back in the sky
and prove yourself.

665
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,879
Besides, there's something else.

666
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:57,307
After our first meeting in my office,
I sent my evaluation to Commander Block.

667
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,311
I recommended you be grounded.
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

668
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,021
What are you saying?

669
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,359
I think someone wants
Sleepy Weasel to fail.

670
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,341
- That's heavy.
- Totally.

671
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,927
That's the other reason
why you need to fly.

672
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,597
This could be your only
opportunity to save the mission

673
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,544
and solve your personal problems,
all in one fell swoop.

674
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,675
Now read it back to me, Francine.

675
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,286
"And if you ever put your goddamn
hands on my wife again..."

(KNOCKING)

677
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,125
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Blank. Come in.

678
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,877
I've been expecting someone.

679
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,527
- That'll be all, Francine.
- Yes, sir.

680
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,113
- Pudding?
- No, thank you, sir.

681
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,641
I'll put this to you straight.
Thompson's death shocked us all.

682
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,643
And that hot shot
Harley is responsible.

683
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,463
I want that smirking little
wise-ass outta here.

684
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:13,088
Morale on this base is shot
to hell. Just look out there.

685
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,429
Quiet. Now, hardly a man moving.

686
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,303
Roy? Roy!

687
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:25,437
Huh? I even went to school with
that man. It's just not the same.

688
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,627
Been ignoring me all day.
Remind me to send him a note.

689
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,150
Sir, may I say something?

690
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,409
I know Harley acted irresponsibly.

691
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,113
But his kind lives on the edge.
Always willing to take a chance.

692
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,283
Now, we need Topper for this
mission for just that reason.

693
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,479
I like your thinking, Colonel.

694
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,107
Besides, Thompson wasn't
that good a pilot.

695
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:56,154
He only had a small family. The kids are a
pain in the ass. The wife's on the sauce.

696
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,553
Poor bastard's better off dead.

697
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,513
What size shoes do you wear?

698
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,933
- A nine, sir.
- Good.

699
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,497
It's settled. We'll send
Harley to the front.

700
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,543
By the way. Thank you for having
us over to dinner the other night.

701
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,113
Cheryl and I thought the
stroganoff was marvelous.

702
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,611
Sir, we didn't have
dinner the other night.

703
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:16,638
Really?

704
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,613
Well, where the hell was I?
And who's this Cheryl?

705
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,789
Ah, doesn't matter.

706
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,495
Run along, Sid.

707
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,503
Cheryl?

708
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,884
Kent?

709
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:43,701
I came to get my chafing dish. Our orders
just came. We're shipping out in one hour.

710
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,995
Are you comin' along this time?

711
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,081
- The chafing dish is not yours.
- It is.

712
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,291
- It isn't.
- OK, I don't want it.

713
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,832
- I'll take it.
- You stay out of it.

714
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,545
This is not the time or place.

715
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,900
I've got a big score to
settle with you, my friend.

716
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,742
Excuse me.

717
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,367
I've hurt him.

718
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,453
Topper...

719
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,838
Topper, you better go.
I have to think.

720
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,083
Well, I don't.

721
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,463
- I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.
- I'm sorry?

722
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,384
My heart is fallin' down around my
ankles like a wet pair of pants.
