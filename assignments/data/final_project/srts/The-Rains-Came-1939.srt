1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,890
Good morning, miss macdaid.
Good morning.

3
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,510
Good morning, Rama.
Good morning.

4
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,512
What's this,
Target practice?

5
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,514
If I didn't, they wouldn't
Leave me any flowers.

6
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,516
What about stopping for a drink
Or perhaps a cup of tea?

7
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,518
Oh, it's a temptation,
Mr. Ransome,

8
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,319
But they're expecting me
Back at the hospital.

9
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,656
In other words,
One of my patients has simply
Made up his mind to die...

10
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
If miss macdaid isn't there
Every hour she can spare...

11
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
Out of the 24
She already works.

12
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,496
Very well, but next time
I won't take no
For an answer.

13
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,584
I'll hold you to that.
Try and persuade major Safti
To take some rest.

14
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,874
There goes a great
And good woman.

15
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,377
Yes, there's no one
Quite like her.

16
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,881
Now, there's one
Of the mysteries of India...

17
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,384
I'll never be able
To understand.
What's that?

18
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,219
That stringless quartet
Over there.

19
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,775
They never
Seem to listen
Or to say anything.

20
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,777
But I know perfectly well
That by Tomorrow morning...

21
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,780
My innermost secrets
Will be the common talk
Of Ranchipur.

22
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,649
But of course,
You have nothing
To hide.

23
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:23,152
Brandy and soda?
Yes, thanks.

24
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,956
No, I don't think
I'd better.

25
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,326
I may have to operate
This afternoon.
Oh, just a drop.

26
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:34,831
Steadies the hand, see?
Well, kind of.
Hmm.

27
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,333
Then there's a conference
With the maharajah
At the palace.

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,837
In this heat?
Major, your energy appalls me.

29
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,340
Why, it isn't hot.
It's only 109 in the shade.

30
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,312
Aren't you ever
Going to finish it?
Is there any hurry?

31
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,148
But you haven't
Done a stroke since
The last time I was here.

32
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:56,019
Oh, stop.
You're making me perspire.

33
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,520
If the rains
Would only come.

34
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,106
They were praying at the temple
As I drove by this morning.

35
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,108
I had half a mind to join them.

36
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,077
In prayer?

37
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,579
I didn't know
You had faith
In anything, Tom.

38
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,083
Oh, that's where you're wrong.
I've got faith
In a lot of things.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,951
For instance, uh--
For instance?

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,756
Well, for instance,
Queen victoria.

41
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,175
That old statue?

42
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,177
Oh, to you
She's only a statue,

43
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,680
But to me she's an old friend--

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,184
A living reminder of the fine,
Brave days before the world
Went to seed.

45
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,688
When london bridge did
Its falling to a dance step,

46
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,691
Not to the threat
Of Tomorrow's bombs.

47
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,695
When every american
Was a millionaire--
Or about to be one--

48
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,198
And people sang in vienna.

49
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:46,202
There she stands
In her cast-iron petticoat,

50
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:51,207
Unconcerned about wars,
Dictators and appeasement,

51
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,210
As serene as ever.

52
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,878
God bless her.

53
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,881
The world is not as bad
As you think, Tom.

54
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,885
No? Only trying
To commit suicide
As fast as it knows how.

55
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,887
I don't agree with you.

56
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,390
Here in Ranchipur,
We're trying to make it
A little better.

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,392
The whole world?

58
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,895
Our world--
India in general,
Ranchipur in particular.

59
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,898
I rather like the old place
Just as it is.

60
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,684
You see it as an artist.

61
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,069
I see it as an Indian.

62
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,573
My people are crying for help,
After centuries of disease...

63
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,825
And poverty and superstition.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,499
The american girl
And her mother
From the mission.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
They're not stopping here,
Are they?

66
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,789
Mother, please don't.
I'll die if you do.
Oh, don't be silly.

67
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,792
If he wanted to know us,
He'd have called before this.
Hold the reins.

68
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,044
Is the honorable
Mr. Ransome in?

69
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,013
I'll find out, memsahib.
Please.

70
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,445
Oh! Mr. Ransome.
Do forgive me
For intruding.

71
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,864
I'm so anxious to have you come
To a little garden party...

72
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm giving this afternoon
For lily hoggett-egburry...

73
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,203
And some of the nicer
English people.

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,039
Well, the major and I
Had planned some tennis
For this afternoon, and--

75
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,459
Well, I'm sure that major Safti
Won't mind giving up his tennis
Just this once.

76
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,128
Well, I'm afraid
That's for Mr. Ransome
To decide.

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,131
There, you see?
It's all settled.
5:00 for tea.

78
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,884
We'll be looking
For you.

79
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,720
Now, why did I say I'd go?

80
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,006
You didn't.
She did.

81
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,572
So nice to see you, lily.

82
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,524
Thank you, my dear.

83
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,527
Oh, you know major craddock
And mrs. Palmer, of course.

84
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,529
How do you do?
Mrs. Hoggett-egburry.

85
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,032
How do you do?
How do you do?

86
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:58,534
Lily, Tom Ransome
Is dropping in later.
Tom Ransome!

87
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,254
Oh, my dear!
What a catch for you.

88
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,257
I mean, my dear,
A realpukka sahib,

89
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,260
And one of the very best
County families
In all england.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,262
But, being an american,
Of course that means
Nothing to me.

91
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,265
No, of course not.
Oh! How do you do?

92
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,767
Why, how are you?
I'm so glad to see you.
This is a surprise.

93
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,386
- and how do you do?
How nice seeing you.
- fine, thank you.

94
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,862
Phew!

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,991
I wish you'd do something
About that dreadful
Smiley woman.

96
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,494
Yes, dear.
Look at her.
She just does it to annoy me.

97
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,497
Does what, dear?
Sits there
And looks so--

98
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,499
Oh, so middle west
In front of my guests.

99
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,668
I wish you'd do
Something about it.
What can I do, dear?

100
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,670
Well, you're head
Of this mission, aren't you?

101
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,172
Yes, but it's her verandah,
My dear.

102
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,510
Here comes Mr. Ransome.

103
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,900
Hello, Tom!

104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,402
Oh, hello, aunt phoebe.

105
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,244
How do you keep so cool
In this infernal heat?

106
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,747
No hotter than iowa
In good corn weather.

107
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,249
Mmm! All dressed up,
Fit to kill.

108
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,085
Where you going?
Across the way.

109
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,838
Are you going over?
No, sirree.

110
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,040
We've got
A gentleman's agreement.

111
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,510
She keeps her nose
Out of the mission school,

112
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,845
And I don't have to go
To her parties.

113
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,298
You might call it
An armed truce.

114
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,300
How are you, homer?
Hello, Tom.

115
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,802
Hello, darling.
Hello.

116
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:42,305
What do you think you are,
A two-year-old?

117
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,307
Working after hours
In this heat.

118
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,809
My husband's a fool.
Now, now, ma.

119
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:50,062
You know what
It says in scripture
About calling people fools.

120
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,065
I had to keep
One of my pupils
After school.

121
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,067
He'd been throwing
Spitballs.

122
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,069
You'll be staying
To tea, of course?

123
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,539
Oh, he can't.
He's going to the party.

124
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,041
Oho.
Better hurry up, Tom.

125
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,044
Mrs. Simon will be
Climbing that hedge
After you.

126
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,832
Here I go.

127
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,923
So glad you could come.

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,231
It's my last tea this season.
We'll be leaving for simla
Before the rains.

129
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,099
You'll be going too,
Of course?
Naturally.

130
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,570
No one stays in Ranchipur
During the monsoon.

131
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,905
No? Only about
Five million people.

132
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,857
Oh, you know what I mean.

133
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,160
Proper people--
The kind of people one knows.

134
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
It's so seldom out here
One meets anyone...

135
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,916
From one of the real
County families.

136
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,836
Of course, you've heard
The Eskeths have just arrived?

137
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,671
The Eskeths?

138
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:53,125
Lord Esketh.
Thelord Esketh.

139
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,428
Oh, fern! Fern!

140
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,179
I'm coming.
Oh, there you are.

141
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,182
Fern, Mr. Ransome's here.

142
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,685
Put some powder
On your nose.
It keeps melting off.

143
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,187
If you think he'd marry me,
You're on the wrong track.

144
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,190
Why, how dare you
Insinuate that I--
All right, all right.

145
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,192
Let's not argue.
Okeydoke. I'm ready.

146
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:15,231
"okeydoke."
I don't know where you pick up
All this american slang.

147
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,233
Mr. Ransome.

148
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,986
Mr. Ransome, this is
Our little girl.

149
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,488
Our little daughter,
Fern.
How do you do?

150
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,991
I've wanted so much
For you two to know
Each other.

151
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,993
May I get you a drink?
Oh, you're very kind.

152
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,996
I'll send one of the boys.

153
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,498
You know what mother
Means by a drink,
Don't you?

154
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,500
I beg your pardon?
Lemonade.

155
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,004
Oh.
Wouldn't you like something,
Uh, a little stronger?

156
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,506
I see that my reputation
Has preceded me.

157
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,010
Father keeps a little brandy
In case of snake bites
And things.

158
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,012
Mmm. The snakes
Have been a bit trying
This afternoon.

159
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,014
I'll get some for you.

160
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,483
You think your mother
Would mind very much
If we--

161
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,986
Mother? She wouldn't mind.

162
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,277
Thanks.

163
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,746
A little water, please.

164
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,258
Thank you.

165
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,100
Oh, I hope I'm not
Keeping you from your guests.

166
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,018
Oh, they're not my guests.

167
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,521
That's mother's idea
Of high society.

168
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,306
They're all excited
Because you're here.

169
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,942
Really?
Should I be flattered?

170
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,729
They say dreadful things
About you.
What sort of things?

171
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,699
That you're a drunkard
And a bounder
And a remittance man.

172
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,068
They'll hang around you
Just the same...

173
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,070
Because your father
Was an earl.

174
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,074
I suppose I shouldn't
Be talking like this.

175
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,076
Why not?
I don't mind.

176
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,545
I don't care
What they say about you,

177
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,047
Because I know
What you're really like.

178
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,551
I've watched you from my window
Every time you've come
To the smileys'.

179
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,388
Sometimes I think
You're the only person
In Ranchipur I don't hate.

180
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,224
You see, Mr. Ransome,

181
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
I've wanted to know you
For a long time,

182
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,062
But not this way.

183
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,149
Not with mother throwing me
At your head.

184
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,651
Oh, my dear child--
Oh, I'm not a child.

185
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,403
I'm over 18.
I'm a woman.

186
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,022
I--
I need your help.

187
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,943
I'm-- I'm in trouble.

188
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,948
Trouble?

189
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,450
Yes, I--

190
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,702
Oh, it's so hard
To tell you.

191
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:36,839
Well, it needn't be.
I understand.

192
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,792
That's why
I had to come to you.

193
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,295
You see, I--
Perhaps I can help you.

194
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:47,383
- is there a man mixed up in it?
- no.

195
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,853
Except you.

196
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,774
Oh, Mr. Ransome,
I've got to get away
From here.

197
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,110
I can't stand it
Any longer.
What's the matter?

198
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,479
Well, they want to run
My life for me.

199
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,033
They want me to go on
Living this phony life
They think is so wonderful.

200
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,535
And mother pretending
We're not just missionaries.

201
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,537
You will help me, won't you?

202
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,540
Well, what could I do?

203
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,492
Well, you know
All about the world...

204
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,295
And women
And things like that.

205
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,964
Oh, well, if it's advice
You want--

206
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,750
Oh, no, I--
I need more than advice.

207
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,387
I--
I haven't any money.

208
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,756
Well, I couldn't do that.
Well, I only need
A little--

209
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,259
Just enough to get me
To where I want to go.

210
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,261
I'll pay you back,
Honestly, every cent.

211
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:34,263
Oh, it isn't the money,
My child.

212
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,265
I told you,
I'm not a child.

213
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:39,151
Look here, I can't be
Directly responsible
For what might happen to you.

214
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,655
Don't you realize
The awkward position
You might put me in?

215
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,940
I didn't think you cared
About respectability.

216
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,026
Well, I don't.

217
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,529
Neither do I. I just
Want everything there is
To be had out of life.

218
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,833
That's all very well,
But it's not that easy.

219
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,252
I'm not looking
For things to be easy.

220
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,122
I just can't
Stand it here any longer.
I've got to get away.

221
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:04,793
- where would you go?
- on the stage.

222
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,880
- on the stage?
- well, why not?

223
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,216
I'm not bad-looking.

224
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,385
And I have
Very nice legs.

225
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,388
Oh, yes. Very nice.

226
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,312
Uh, miss Simon and I,
We were just, uh, talking
About the theater.

227
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,314
Oh, yes, of course.

228
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,816
I'm sorry to disturb you,
But there's a messenger here
From the palace.

229
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,069
Oh, yes?

230
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,072
From her highness
To Ransome sahib.

231
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,302
I'm afraid I'll have to
Leave your delightful party
If I'm going to be on time.

232
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,305
Oh, my dear boy,
That's quite all right.
I understand perfectly.

233
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,308
When the palace calls,
We must drop everything
And obey.

234
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,343
Oh, well,
You're very kind.

235
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,600
Charming, isn't he?

236
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,103
I think it was a mistake
Inviting him.

237
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,107
Everyone knows
His reputation with...

238
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,110
Women... And rum.

239
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,113
Don't be provincial.
Do you ever get us
Invited to the palace?

240
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,915
Do you? Huh!

241
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,276
Good evening,
Your highness.

242
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,947
Good evening.
Good evening, Ransome.
I am glad you could come.

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,116
To see you again is one
Of the few thrills left
In life, your highness.

244
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,486
You said that
As if you meant it.
I do mean it.

245
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:59,408
Come along.
I'll introduce to you
Our guests of honor.

246
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,795
Lady Esketh.

247
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,298
- hello, Edwina.
- why, Tom.

248
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,921
We heard of a person
Named Ransome
Living in Ranchipur,

249
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,307
But I never dreamed it was you.

250
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:20,260
How nice
That you know each other.

251
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,313
Oh, yes. We're old friends.

252
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,152
Albert?
Yes?

253
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:32,155
This is Tom Ransome.
You've heard me speak of him.
My husband.

254
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,575
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Ransome, of course.
How do you do?

255
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:38,828
Your highness, I've just
Been telling Mr. "bannager"--
Bannerjee.

256
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,830
Yes, yes.
When I first visited India,
I was amazed to find...

257
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:44,334
That you people had so many
Of the modern conveniences.
Really?

258
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,836
Yes, and the blessings
Of civilization.
Oh, thank you.

259
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:50,340
We flatter ourselves
To be jolly well abreast
Of the times.

260
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,260
Your highness,
Dinner is served.

261
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,264
Shall we go?

262
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,355
Now that you've met
One of your own kind,

263
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,357
I suppose you'll be
Grand for days.

264
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,360
Why do you always make a point
Of criticizing men
Like Tom Ransome?

265
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,362
Because he happens
To be a gentleman?

266
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,364
If he's a gentleman,
Why is he living here
In India?

267
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,366
He's got plenty
Of money.

268
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,368
I don't imagine Tom's
Ever thought of money,

269
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,286
One way or another,
In all his life.

270
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,789
Oh, one of those
Radicals, eh?

271
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,340
How do you like the maharani?
Tough egg, isn't she?

272
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,342
I call her the "last queen."

273
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:45,845
You know, nowadays when queens
Do everything in their power
To look like housewives,

274
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:49,349
She still dresses the queen
And acts it.

275
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:57,407
Here goes one of
The most expensive figures
In the british empire.

276
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:33,143
General, for years
I have been telling you...

277
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:37,113
Never to draw
To an inside straight.

278
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,120
Your highness, would you mind
If I showed lady Esketh
The palace?

279
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,123
Of course not.
Need a guide?

280
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,626
No, thanks.
I know my way about.

281
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,628
Good luck.

282
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:02,388
Your highness,
My apologies
For being late.

283
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,391
You received my message?
Was it cholera?

284
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,310
No, just old-fashioned
Colic.

285
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,312
Good. Get in the game.

286
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:12,682
I need some competition.
Now, look here,
Your highness.

287
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:21,441
Your highness, I'm willing
To pay Ł5,000-Ł10,000-

288
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,160
For that chestnut stallion
And two mares.

289
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,330
It is a generous offer,
But asoka is not for sale.

290
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,165
Oh, come now.

291
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,001
Anything's for sale
If the offer's high enough.

292
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,837
I am afraid
You don't understand.

293
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,507
Your highness
Drives a hard bargain.

294
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,509
I mean to have that stallion.

295
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,011
Name your price
And I'll meet it,
Whatever it is.

296
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:45,014
It is not a question
Of price, lord Esketh.

297
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:49,519
You have seen other
Horses in my stables
Almost as perfect as asoka.

298
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,523
Now, please let me make you
A gift of a stallion
And two mares.

299
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,942
A gift?

300
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,448
Well, if your highness
Really means it, you're--

301
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,450
You're very kind.

302
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,070
You understand, of course,
I cannot ship them
During the heat.

303
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,455
Of course.

304
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:12,875
Thank you.

305
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,254
That's a rembrandt.

306
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,258
And that's a buddhist
Prayer wheel.

307
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,515
And that, I suspect,
Was bought...

308
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:38,017
From a street peddler
In naples.

309
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,019
And this--

310
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,823
This was bagged
By the old lady herself,
And on foot, too,

311
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,692
If that means anything
To you.

312
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,695
Frankly, it doesn't.
No.

313
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:51,331
I'd like some air.

314
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,754
Well, it's beginning
To look like rain
At last.

315
00:20:58,254 --> 00:21:00,256
You haven't told me
What you're doing here.

316
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:03,259
I came out here seven years ago
To paint the maharajah's
Portrait.

317
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,094
Been here ever since.

318
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,263
Not a very exciting life,
Is it?

319
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,766
No. Is yours?

320
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,934
Now and then.

321
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:15,555
Hmm. What brought you
All the way up here
To Ranchipur?

322
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:18,858
The maharajah's horses.

323
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,361
Albert's very fond of horses.

324
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:24,197
The only thing he is fond of,
Except money.

325
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:28,034
- have you become fond
Of money too?
- passionately.

326
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,536
It used to be
Just excitement.

327
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:33,039
You can't live
On excitement alone.

328
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,042
We found that out,
Didn't we?
I didn't mind.

329
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,660
I did.

330
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,079
I minded washing
My own stockings,

331
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,300
Going without breakfast
And only being able to afford
The hairdresser once a week.

332
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,302
Well, perhaps I was selfish.

333
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:48,805
There was a time, mind you--
And I hope you won't blush--

334
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,807
When I seriously thought
Of marrying you.

335
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,259
Why, Tom, how touching.

336
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,645
I never suspected.

337
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:58,648
Well, we've come
A long way since then.

338
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:01,601
- a long way apart.
- what do you mean?

339
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:04,437
You'd know if you'd
Lived here a while.

340
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:08,441
In Ranchipur,
The important things in life
Are the elemental things,

341
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,443
Such as crops,
Starvation and weather.

342
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:13,446
In europe,
When someone says,
"it looks like rain,"

343
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,416
In all probability
He's trying to make
Polite conversation.

344
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,335
But here, where people die
As easily as they're born,

345
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:22,338
They're speaking in terms
Of life and death.

346
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,342
You'll see what I mean
If you're still here
When the rains come.

347
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,344
You'll see them overnight...

348
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:31,547
Turn the fields, the gardens
And the jungles...

349
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:33,549
From a parched
And burning desert
Into a mass of green...

350
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:35,551
That seems to live,
To writhe...

351
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:40,056
And to devour the walls,
The trees and the houses.

352
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:43,860
Well, I hope I'm not
Keeping you up.

353
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:49,949
Tom, you've changed.

354
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:53,119
You didn't used to be
Such a windbag.

355
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,122
You haven't changed.

356
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,991
Haven't I?

357
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,461
No.

358
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,247
You're still a lovely creature.

359
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:13,840
Am I?

360
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,762
It's exciting seeing you again.

361
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,733
May I have a cigarette?

362
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,360
So you've forgotten.

363
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,164
Sorry.

364
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,943
Well, I was right.

365
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,648
Here it comes.

366
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,337
Has your highness any idea
Where they've gone?

367
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm afraid
It's a big palace,

368
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,343
That they might
Be anywhere.

369
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,972
Excuse me.

370
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:32,194
Your husband's been looking
For you, lady Esketh.

371
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:34,196
I think he wants
To go home.

372
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,198
Thank you, your highness.

373
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,742
Brandy?
No, thank you.

374
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:00,139
Who's the pale-copper
Apollo?

375
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:01,841
Major Safti.

376
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:04,727
Not bad.

377
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,896
Not bad at all.

378
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:11,267
Well, don't waste your time.

379
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,269
He's a surgeon
And a scientist.

380
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,022
Any interest he might have
In romance is purely biological.

381
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:21,327
You make him sound
Even more exciting.

382
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,362
There you are.

383
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:25,615
I've been looking
For you everywhere.

384
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:27,617
Are you ready to go?
Whenever you are.

385
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:30,620
I'm ready now.
I think I'm going
To be ill.

386
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,123
It's this confounded
Climate.
I'm sorry, albert.

387
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:36,626
Mr. Ransome tells me
There's a doctor
In Ranchipur...

388
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,628
Who's not at all bad.

389
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:41,631
If you're no better
In the morning,
We'll send for him.

390
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:45,134
Oh, that's very
Kind of you.

391
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:14,664
Hello.

392
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:17,500
Well. What are you doing here?

393
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,336
I've run away from home.
I'm never going back.

394
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,755
Uh-huh.
You can't do that.
Why not?

395
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:25,758
Because I told you--
I can't take
The responsibility.

396
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,760
I know,
But since we talked
This afternoon,

397
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,262
I figured out
Another way
That you can help me.

398
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,765
Yes? What way?

399
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,282
- well?
- I want you to let me
Stay here tonight.

400
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,954
Have you any idea
What you're saying?

401
00:27:54,954 --> 00:27:56,922
Of course I have.
Don't you see?

402
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:58,924
Then everyone
Would think that--

403
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,128
Well, anyway, there'd be
Such a scandal, I'd have
To leave Ranchipur.

404
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,929
They'd send me away.

405
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:07,299
That's all very well,
But why, in the name
Of the million gods of India,

406
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,720
Do you have to choose me?
Well, it shouldn't
Matter a bit to you.

407
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,857
Your reputation
Is already so--
So tarnished.

408
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,979
Please.

409
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:21,981
Don't you dare laugh at me.

410
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:24,400
Oh, listen to me, child.

411
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,402
What's this?
You're soaking wet.

412
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:28,904
What of it?
And I'm not a child.

413
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,290
Well, anyway,
You're going straight home.

414
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:35,127
I'm not going home.
I'm never going home again.

415
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:39,415
- you want me to put you out
By force?
- you won't.

416
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,420
I'd make a scene,

417
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,672
And you're the kind of a man
Who hates scenes.

418
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:49,258
Well, at least I can get you
Some dry clothes.

419
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:52,144
Come with me.

420
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,659
Don't be afraid.
Oh--

421
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,661
I'm not afraid.

422
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:11,664
I'm just cold.
Uh-huh.

423
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,417
Now, change into these.

424
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:17,419
You'll find plenty of towels
In the bathroom.

425
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,421
Give yourself
A good rubdown.

426
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:23,926
Oh, I'll be
In the other room.

427
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,873
That's very becoming.

428
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:57,576
I don't believe
My old school tie ever
Appeared to better advantage.

429
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,795
Well-- I'm so sorry.

430
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:03,632
It looked so old and frayed,
And I couldn't find a belt.

431
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,337
That's quite all right.

432
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,391
It would be easier
If I could call you Tom.

433
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:15,761
There's nothing
I'd like better, fern.

434
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:20,316
Don't you feel anything
At all about me?

435
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:28,274
I'd be a fool if I didn't.

436
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:31,277
You're lovely, fern--

437
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:34,780
Not nearly so much
Of a child as I thought.

438
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,855
There's somebody there,
Behind the blind.

439
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:04,443
John! John!

440
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,953
I suppose you heard
Everything that went on.

441
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:16,956
If you breathe one word of this,
I'll feed you
To the crocodiles.

442
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:19,959
Yes, sahib.
As long as you're up,
You can drive miss Simon home.

443
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,963
Get the car.
Yes, sahib.
Yes, sahib.

444
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:35,174
Who was it?
Have they gone?

445
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:38,010
He's gone, all right,
And you're going too.

446
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:45,017
All right, I'll go now--
Peacefully.
Yes.

447
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,412
May I come and see you
Once in a while?
Why, of course.

448
00:31:56,412 --> 00:32:00,833
You see, that's important,
Because--

449
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,835
Because I guess I love you.

450
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:07,206
If I didn't,
I wouldn't be going home now.

451
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:31,146
Has the doctor come yet?
He's with his lordship now,
Milady.

452
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,148
I want to see him
Before he goes.
Yes, milady.

453
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:36,652
Don't take that.
Bring another cup.
Yes, milady.

454
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:54,136
Good morning.
Oh. Good morning.

455
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:57,056
I'm Edwina Esketh.
Oh.

456
00:32:57,056 --> 00:33:01,060
I hope I did right
Asking especially for you.
Maybe I'm imposing on you.

457
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,563
On the contrary,
Lady Esketh.
It's my duty.

458
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:08,067
There's nothing seriously
Wrong with your husband,
Just a bad congestion.

459
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:11,820
But his blood pressure
Is much too high.
No unpleasant asiatic microbes?

460
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,024
No, just simple
European overindulgence.

461
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:16,909
I prescribed
Some tablets for him,

462
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,279
And he should
Be kept very quiet.
Won't you stay for some tea?

463
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,782
I'll have to get this filled
At the hospital.
Bates can take it.

464
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:32,508
Do sit down, major.

465
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:36,345
You're very kind.

466
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:39,298
Frankly, it's rather
A treat for me to have
Someone to talk to.

467
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:41,300
I expect it will be
Deadly dull...

468
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,303
Now that albert's
Going to be ill.

469
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:46,305
I think this tea is cold.
I'll send for some more.

470
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,307
No, don't bother.
I like it that way.

471
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:50,642
Sugar?
No, thank you.

472
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:55,114
What would you prescribe
For a patient about to die
Of galloping boredom?

473
00:33:55,114 --> 00:33:58,951
I imagine the maharani
Will see to it that you're
Properly entertained.

474
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:03,872
- how?
- well, the usual routine
With guests, I believe,

475
00:34:03,872 --> 00:34:05,991
Is to, uh, show them first
The waterworks,

476
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:07,993
Then, in order,
The narrow-gauge railway,

477
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:11,296
The hospital, the zoo
And the asylum for the insane.

478
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:14,750
- how exciting.
- yes, isn't it?

479
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,170
And the maharajah
Has promised me
My choice of horses.

480
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,641
I wonder if he'd mind
If I also chose my escort.

481
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,060
Ranchipur is famous
For its horsemen.

482
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,896
I'm sure you'll have no trouble
In finding a suitable escort.

483
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,182
Do you ride, major?

484
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:35,687
Whenever I have the time,
Which isn't very often.

485
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,906
Don't you ever take a day off?

486
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:43,245
I'm willing to make
An exception.

487
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:45,697
That's very gallant
Of you, major.
If you don't mind...

488
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:47,699
Waiting until
After working hours.

489
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,704
Besides, it's cooler then.
I wouldn't dream of
Interfering with your work.

490
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:29,708
What's this?
The insane asylum?

491
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,128
No. No, this is
The maharani's music school.

492
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:35,631
Oh.
Major sahib, memsahib.

493
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:38,133
How are you, I hope?

494
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:42,137
Would you care
To look around?
I'd love to.

495
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:44,139
Lady Esketh would like
To see the school.

496
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,926
Oh, yes. Yes.
This way.

497
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,395
Mr. Das, the director
Of the school.

498
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:53,265
Thank you.
Thank you.

499
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:00,239
Do you like music?

500
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,742
Oh, I have a box
At covent garden
As a matter of course.

501
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:09,281
Frankly, I like
This sort better.

502
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,291
Mr. Das, is jemnaz singh
Here today?

503
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,793
Oh, yes. Yes.

504
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:24,796
This way, please.
Good.

505
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:36,358
Jemnaz singh,
The rajput singer.

506
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:46,485
What kind of song
Is it?
Oh, a love song.

507
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,987
Oh, yes.

508
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,849
Do you know the song?

509
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,402
Yes. The words
Are traditional,

510
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:23,906
But the music
Is improvised--
Free variations.

511
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:26,408
How do the words go?

512
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:29,411
Well, it's in
The ancient language--
The ceremonial language.

513
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:32,915
I'm afraid I don't know it
As well as I should.

514
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:34,917
Try.

515
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,419
Well, it's a bit florid.

516
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,713
"that my lyre...

517
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:51,133
"were of purest jade,

518
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,635
"with strings...

519
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:57,606
"of fine spun gold.

520
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,608
"that I...

521
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:01,610
"might sing...

522
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,612
"with merit...

523
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,614
"of your beauty.

524
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,656
"your hands...

525
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:18,160
"hold my life,

526
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,163
"my being.

527
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:23,165
"drop it,

528
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:27,169
"and I perish.

529
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:31,223
"but in your heart,

530
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:34,226
"my love...

531
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:36,728
"has found a home.

532
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:40,232
"and it...

533
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:43,235
Can never die."

534
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:47,522
"but in your heart,

535
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,525
"my love has found a home,

536
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:55,530
And it can never die."

537
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:03,255
It is a lot
Of sentimental nonsense,
Isn't it?

538
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:34,536
- hello, miss macdaid.
- oh, hello.

539
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,042
Where's Rama?

540
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,411
He's busy.

541
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,914
Ahh!
Didn't turn up yesterday.

542
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:48,250
What sort of a woman
Is lady Esketh?

543
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,169
Lady Esketh? Why?

544
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:53,889
The major brought
Her here yesterday
To show her the hospital.

545
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,391
He's out with her
Again today.

546
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:59,728
Well, you met her.
What did you think
Of her?

547
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:01,596
I know her type.

548
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:03,598
Many like her in europe
These days.

549
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:05,600
Too many for its own good.

550
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,103
Oh. Well, I would say
She's the one woman
In Ranchipur...

551
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,605
That Rama shouldn't know.

552
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:22,501
Is lady Esketh
Dining out tonight?

553
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:25,871
Yes, milord.
Her ladyship is dining
At the Bannerjees'.

554
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,373
Mr. Ransome
Is calling for her.

555
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:30,375
Oh.

556
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:33,378
Why should I care
Who's calling for her?

557
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:36,381
Go on, answer it.
Yes, milord.

558
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:39,384
What's this?
Major Safti's orders.

559
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,386
I hope that blasted native
Knows what he's doing.

560
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:44,890
Major Safti is the head
Of the state medical department.

561
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,226
Filth.

562
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:50,946
Her ladyship
Will be ready directly.

563
00:40:50,946 --> 00:40:52,948
May I offer you
A drink, sir?

564
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:54,950
Yes. Brandy and soda--
And make it strong.

565
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,952
Yes, sir.

566
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:03,158
How's the patient
This evening?
Much better, sir, thank you.

567
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,160
Thanks.

568
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:27,816
Hello, Tom.
Oh, hello.

569
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,651
Good of you to come for me.
Are we late?

570
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:32,154
Oh, no, no. There's--
There's plenty of time.

571
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,156
No, Mr. Bannerjee's
Dinners always begin...

572
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,441
At the fashionable
Half-past 8:00.

573
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:39,027
Hear you've been
Having adventures.

574
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:43,165
I am a victim
Of circumstances.

575
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:46,585
If you didn't drink so much,
You wouldn't always be
Getting into trouble.

576
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:49,087
Well, at least my weakness
Is wine.

577
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,923
- what do you mean by that?
- you know what I mean.

578
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:55,293
Listen to who's moralizing.

579
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:58,129
I suppose that comes
From philandering
Around missions.

580
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:02,551
I never philander
Around missions,

581
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:07,439
And I don't philander
Around hospitals either.
Don't be catty, Tom.

582
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:09,274
I do believe you're jealous.

583
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,776
You know perfectly well
I'm not jealous.

584
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,778
If there ever was
Anything between us,

585
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:15,530
We both know it's finished now--
Dead and gone.

586
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:18,400
Then why do you come here
And act drunk
And dictatorial?

587
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,285
Because I see
Something happening
I don't like.

588
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:22,370
Stop talking
Like a copy book.
It's not becoming.

589
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,372
When are you leaving?

590
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:26,374
We planned to go Tomorrow,
But with albert ill--

591
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:28,877
Is he too ill to travel?
No.

592
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:33,665
Then why don't you go?
You are a beast, aren't you?

593
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:40,639
Tom, we've double-crossed
Almost everyone in the world.

594
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,424
Let's not start
On each other.

595
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:45,310
I don't want
To interfere really.

596
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:49,147
But Rama's my friend,
And I don't like it.

597
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:53,568
If you only knew
How wrong you are.

598
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:57,405
He's the one man I've ever met
I haven't been able to make
An impression on.

599
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:07,082
Are you sober enough
To take me
To the party?

600
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:09,084
Almost.

601
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,842
Bates.

602
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:19,844
Bates!

603
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:28,553
Have they gone yet?
Yes, milord.
They've just left.

604
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:30,555
Well, get me
My dispatch case.
Yes, milord.

605
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,274
Go on, get it.
Don't just stand there.

606
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:34,609
And the pen.

607
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:42,617
Why are you standing there
Looking like a fool?

608
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:44,619
Your lordship
Didn't dismiss me.

609
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:47,539
Dismiss you?
You're lucky I didn't
Dismiss you ages ago.

610
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:51,543
I've put up with your
Infernal impertinence
For 15 years.

611
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:55,413
Don't stand there looking at me.
If I want you again, I'll ring.
Now, get out.

612
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,916
Yes, milord.

613
00:43:58,416 --> 00:43:59,918
Come here.

614
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:03,922
Close those.

615
00:44:03,922 --> 00:44:05,807
I suppose you'd like me
To die of malaria.

616
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:07,809
No, milord.

617
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:11,846
Well, get out!

618
00:44:11,846 --> 00:44:13,898
Yes, milord.

619
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,180
Just stand still.
They won't attack
If they're not provoked.

620
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:56,891
Welcome, lady Esketh.
Good evening, Mr. Ransome.

621
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:58,977
Please.

622
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:03,231
Some night, you're going
To fall flat on your face,

623
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:06,735
And people will begin
To suspect that you drink.

624
00:45:06,735 --> 00:45:09,371
Good evening.

625
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:11,373
It's awfully kind of you
To come, lady Esketh.

626
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:13,375
Of course, we are terribly
Upset about lord Esketh--

627
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,377
That he can't
Be with us tonight.

628
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:18,380
Hello, Ransome.
I believe you know almost
Everyone from the palace.

629
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,882
You know raschid ali khan.
Of course.
Yes.

630
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:24,252
And may I present miss macdaid?
Lady Esketh.

631
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,138
- yes, we've met.
- yes, indeed.

632
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:29,089
I hope you're enjoying
Your stay, lady Esketh.

633
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:32,175
- very much.
- how soon do you expect
To be leaving?

634
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:36,096
Oh. I'm in no particular hurry.

635
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:39,099
I find it very pleasant
Here in Ranchipur.

636
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:42,986
There's major Safti.

637
00:45:42,986 --> 00:45:44,988
Excuse me.

638
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,777
Good evening, major.
Good evening. You know
Major remmington? Lady Esketh.

639
00:45:57,951 --> 00:46:00,954
Could I have
A word with you?
Certainly.

640
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:02,922
Forgive us.

641
00:46:03,423 --> 00:46:04,924
Poor lady Esketh.

642
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:07,260
She's so frightfully upset
About her husband.

643
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:14,184
Better have this cocktail.

644
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:16,186
It isn't as bad as it looks.

645
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:19,606
Do you know that your friends
Have been warning me
To leave town?

646
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:21,608
Leave town? Why?

647
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:23,610
Why do you think?

648
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,112
They feel
I'm a bad influence on you.

649
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:29,616
That's ridiculous.
Isn't it?

650
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:32,619
You're not afraid of me,
Are you, major?

651
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,454
Why, of course not.

652
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:37,157
You wouldn't feel relieved
If I left?

653
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:40,160
No. As a matter of fact,
I'd miss you.

654
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,162
I've enjoyed your company
Very much.

655
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,083
- I was afraid
You'd take that attitude.
- what attitude?

656
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:51,554
Lying to me.

657
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:54,557
But I--
I just told you that--
Don't bother to explain.

658
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:57,093
You know perfectly well
What I'm thinking,

659
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:59,679
And I know
What you're thinking.

660
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,598
I've done everything
But fall at your feet,

661
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:05,101
And you haven't even blinked.

662
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:07,437
So I think I will
Leave Tomorrow morning.

663
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:09,689
Please don't leave
On my account.

664
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:14,661
Not because of what might
Happen to you if I stayed,

665
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:16,946
But because
Of what might happen to me.

666
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:19,282
Earthquake!

667
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:21,034
It's an earthquake!

668
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:39,519
Well, it's all over.
Nothing to worry about,
Not a thing.

669
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,472
Just a slight tremor.

670
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:33,740
Where is his highness?
He was in there.

671
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,742
What's the matter with you,
Standing there like dummies?

672
00:48:36,242 --> 00:48:37,744
Clear this away.

673
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:41,197
Get through to that room!

674
00:48:51,174 --> 00:48:54,177
Wire's down, of course.
I'm going to the palace
For orders.

675
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:56,179
Major--
Come along with us,
Miss macdaid.

676
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:58,047
They'll need us
At the hospital.

677
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:20,713
Bates!

678
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:25,218
Fifteen years, it's been
"yes, milord. No, milord.
Yes, milord."

679
00:50:25,218 --> 00:50:28,221
Well, it's too late now.
We're both for it.

680
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:33,192
You're afraid.

681
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,058
Come on with me.

682
00:51:26,446 --> 00:51:29,198
Good morning,
Edwina.
Good morning.

683
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,200
Water's still rising.

684
00:51:32,702 --> 00:51:34,203
Look at queen victoria.

685
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:42,578
What's that frightful row?

686
00:52:09,656 --> 00:52:11,324
Bannerjee.

687
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:25,755
He says I'm an impious
Barbarian.

688
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:28,257
But not in english,
You'll notice.

689
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:31,260
That's India for you.
They've been praying
For the rains all spring.

690
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,514
Now that they're here,
They're praying for them
To go away.

691
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:36,766
Might be just as well
If we joined in.

692
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:41,721
Look. It's a boat.

693
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:45,058
Well, I'm glad someone
Besides ourselves is alive.

694
00:52:46,526 --> 00:52:48,528
Hello!

695
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:54,117
What on earth?
Why, it's the little
Simon girl.

696
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:57,120
Your juvenile light of love?

697
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,406
Come to snatch you
From a watery grave--
How sweet.

698
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:03,042
Come on. Give me a hand.

699
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:18,257
Easy now.

700
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:25,431
Thank heaven you're safe.

701
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,433
I didn't close my eyes
All night.

702
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:29,435
I was afraid
You'd be drowned.

703
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,437
Edwina, this is miss Simon.
Lady Esketh.

704
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,239
How do you do?
We are glad to see you.

705
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,243
If you hadn't come,
We might have died
Of starvation.

706
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:39,362
Or boredom.

707
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:42,749
Where did you find
Thequeen mary?

708
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:50,089
Down the road while we were
Looking for my-- my father.

709
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,042
I'm sorry, fern.

710
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:58,097
I thought, if you were
All right, I'd take you
Back to the mission.

711
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,600
It's safer there.
Yes. It ought to hold
About two--

712
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,602
One to paddle
And one to bail.

713
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:05,104
You two think
You can manage it?

714
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:09,108
There's time
For several trips.
I'll take you first.

715
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:12,111
I'm-- I'm all right.

716
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,614
No more paddling
For you, young lady,
Until you've had some rest.

717
00:54:14,614 --> 00:54:16,616
Now, come on.

718
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:27,493
I don't need
Any rest.
Now.

719
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:30,496
You come over here now
And lie down.

720
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:33,499
Now, we'll fix this
For you. There.

721
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:37,503
Now, don't you worry
About a thing.

722
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:40,506
I'm gonna take lady Esketh,
And then I'm coming back
For you.

723
00:54:40,506 --> 00:54:43,259
In the meantime,
You be a good girl.

724
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:46,596
I'm not in your way
Being here, am I?

725
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:49,432
You're not going to apologize
For saving our lives, are you?

726
00:54:49,432 --> 00:54:52,435
Well, that's only one
Of the reasons I came.

727
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:55,822
I wanted you to know
That you were in no danger.
Well, that's reassuring.

728
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,824
I mean from me.

729
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:02,411
I didn't mean to put you
On the spot,

730
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,748
But when they found out
I'd been to your house,
They wouldn't believe the truth.

731
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:08,034
Well, don't you
Worry about that.

732
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:13,456
Mother pretended to be sore,
But I don't think
She was really sore.

733
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:15,458
Because, you see,
If we got married,

734
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:19,345
She could spend the rest
Of her life hobnobbing
With high society in england.

735
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:21,631
Yes.

736
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:26,936
Well, anyway, I thought
You'd like to know that...

737
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:28,688
You won't have to marry me.

738
00:55:32,608 --> 00:55:35,111
Unless you decide
To change your mind.

739
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,497
That's a bit of luck.
The rain's stopping.

740
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:01,587
Hey, Bannerjee.
Don't get impatient.

741
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:05,091
I'll come back for you later.
Bannerjee.

742
00:56:15,651 --> 00:56:17,737
Says he'd rather die
On this roof...

743
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:20,239
Than suffer
My unclean presence
In the same boat.

744
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,659
Ready?
I suppose so.

745
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:27,163
I'd like to go by the city.
You mean by way
Of the hospital.

746
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:29,665
Don't you care enough
To find out what's become
Of your friends?

747
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:31,667
Don't be a fool.

748
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,170
I'm sick of being british
And pretending I'm not
Frightened and worried.

749
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,173
But we haven't time.
I've got to bring
The boat back for fern.

750
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:40,176
I think it's
Absolutely nauseating the way
You're leading that girl on.

751
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:43,679
I've never seen such
An obvious case of calf-love
In all my life.

752
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,182
Her face
Lights up like fireworks
Every time she looks at you.

753
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,184
That's what you like,
Isn't it?

754
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:50,386
That's why
We didn't get on.
Get in.

755
00:56:50,886 --> 00:56:53,389
You always want the woman
To treat you like a god.

756
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:56,776
I treated you as if you
Were just as bad as myself.

757
00:57:08,237 --> 00:57:11,157
Oh, so it's you.
Well, where's fern?

758
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:14,660
At the Bannerjees'.
I'm going right back
For her.

759
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,663
The lady with the artillery
Is aunt phoebe.
How do you do?

760
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:20,166
Mrs. Smiley,
Lady Esketh.
Pleased to meet ya.

761
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,168
Why don't you go
Right on up the house.

762
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:24,170
Thank you.
Yes.

763
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:27,640
Have you seen homer?
No.

764
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,009
We couldn't get through
To the city.

765
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:31,978
Oh. I suppose you'll be
Wantin' something to eat.

766
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:33,980
No, thanks. I've gotta
Get back for fern.

767
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,483
Don't be a fool.
Ain't she safe where she is?
Not if that water rises again.

768
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:39,485
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.
Good-bye.

769
00:57:51,697 --> 00:57:53,949
Come on in.
I'll get you
Some coffee.

770
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:55,751
Thank you.

771
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:44,667
Steady, old girl.

772
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:03,629
You've come back.

773
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:06,832
I'm sorry. I lost your boat.

774
01:00:49,258 --> 01:00:51,260
I've done all I can.

775
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:56,265
Rama?

776
01:00:57,683 --> 01:01:00,686
I know I can count on you...

777
01:01:01,687 --> 01:01:03,689
To help your queen...

778
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:09,195
Rebuild... Our state.

779
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,874
Close the door.

780
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,765
My good and loyal friends,

781
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:25,020
Ranchipur has been struck
A cruel blow.

782
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,358
The weakness in our
National character has been...

783
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:34,196
That we are inclined to blame
Catastrophe on the gods...

784
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,483
And fail in our duty.

785
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:41,987
I don't propose
To let that happen here.

786
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:45,541
We must call up
All our strength,

787
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:50,496
All our resolution,
All our courage...

788
01:02:50,496 --> 01:02:54,717
If we are to bring
Our people to safety.

789
01:02:55,217 --> 01:02:58,220
Each of you
Must do his part.

790
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:03,676
I have chosen you because
I know you will not fail me.

791
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,320
I proclaim
A state of emergency...

792
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,822
To exist in Ranchipur.

793
01:03:16,822 --> 01:03:19,241
Raschid.

794
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:23,245
Your police will work
With t

795
01:03:24,663 --> 01:03:27,166
What is it, major?

796
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:29,668
It has come sooner
Than I expected.

797
01:03:29,668 --> 01:03:31,870
Several cases of the plague
In the sweepers' quarters.

798
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:36,875
On top of that, half
The water in Ranchipur
Must be polluted.

799
01:03:39,878 --> 01:03:44,016
Do what you can to keep
The plague from spreading.

800
01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:46,518
Burn down the whole quarter
If you must.

801
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:53,275
The rest of you
Know your duty.

802
01:03:55,277 --> 01:03:58,781
Ransome.
I want you to stay.

803
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:07,289
Give me a cigarette.

804
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:18,834
Thank you.

805
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,840
I said I could depend
On this little group.

806
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,842
I meant you too.

807
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:29,061
I don't know why,
Your highness.

808
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:31,730
Because you are one of us.

809
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:35,017
I need a personal
Aide-de-camp--

810
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:39,021
Someone I can depend on
To carry out my orders...

811
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:43,025
And use his own head
Whenever necessary.

812
01:04:43,025 --> 01:04:44,827
Do you think you can do it?

813
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:46,695
If you think I can.

814
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:13,606
Would you mind
Sitting down...

815
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:17,443
Or... Doing anything
But just standing there?

816
01:05:21,313 --> 01:05:23,816
I'm sorry.

817
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:27,319
Don't mind me.
It's just my foul disposition.

818
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:30,823
Come on and play me
A hand of russian bank.

819
01:05:30,823 --> 01:05:32,541
I don't know how.

820
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:37,046
What's the matter?
Nothing really.

821
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:39,548
It's because
I'm so glad.

822
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:41,550
Last night,
He came back for me.

823
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:45,054
Not because he had to,
But-- but because
He wanted to.

824
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:48,891
His face was so tired
And so kind.

825
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:51,427
He was glad too.

826
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:53,429
I could tell.

827
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:56,932
And he tried to smile,
But he was too worn out.

828
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,935
He just fell asleep in my arms
Like a little boy.

829
01:05:59,935 --> 01:06:02,604
I felt he belonged to me.

830
01:06:04,823 --> 01:06:07,526
I never wanted
The night to end.

831
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:10,245
You have got it badly,
Haven't you?

832
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:14,249
I suppose so.

833
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:16,251
What's that?

834
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:18,253
They're dynamiting
Part of the city.

835
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:23,258
You know what you've picked out
For yourself, don't you?

836
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:25,260
Yes.

837
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,514
Then there's no use
Warning you.
No.

838
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:31,684
Look here. You don't
Expect him to marry you?

839
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:34,636
Well, not unless
He wants to.

840
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:37,139
Of course, if he would--

841
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,891
But I'll do
Whatever he wants.

842
01:06:43,612 --> 01:06:46,532
Tom's been a selfish brute
All his life.

843
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:49,318
What would you do
If you were in my place?

844
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:52,738
I wouldn't be in your place.

845
01:06:52,738 --> 01:06:55,240
I'd never let any man
Mean that much to me.

846
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:00,746
Look here.

847
01:07:00,746 --> 01:07:02,998
You're a nice child.

848
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,667
I'll do anything I can
To help you.

849
01:07:11,557 --> 01:07:14,927
If I only had a black eight.

850
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:16,812
Hello!

851
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:20,566
Hey! Come on there.
Hey! Hey!

852
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:26,438
Come on there.
Hey! Hey!

853
01:07:26,438 --> 01:07:28,857
Well, what's this--

854
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:30,859
Barnum & bailey's
Come to town?

855
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:37,699
Well! Oh, my!

856
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,671
You're all right, eh?
What's this, an invasion?

857
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:46,425
I'm afraid we'll have
To turn our place
Into a barracks.

858
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:48,293
So many of the children
Were left homeless.

859
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:50,796
Well, there's always room
For a few more.

860
01:07:50,796 --> 01:07:55,300
Come on in, kids. Come on.
Come on, children.
Right this way.

861
01:08:00,355 --> 01:08:02,858
Come on in.
Hurry up now.

862
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:05,861
My goodness.
Come in, come in.

863
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:08,647
Well, say--

864
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:10,566
You'll have to do
Some foragin' for me.

865
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:12,568
I didn't expect to have
To feed an army.

866
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:14,570
Miss Simon, take 'em out
And show 'em where
To clean up.

867
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:18,073
Out. Out.
Hurry up now.
Go on out there.

868
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:20,325
Well.
That's it.

869
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:22,327
I bet you got
Your feet wet.

870
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:24,580
Ma, don't worry.
I'm all right.
Let me see.

871
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:28,383
Just as I thought. You sit
Right down in that chair
And change your socks.

872
01:08:28,383 --> 01:08:30,886
Eh, all right.
Oh. Wait a minute.

873
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:32,888
I have a message for fern.

874
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:37,676
There.

875
01:08:46,735 --> 01:08:49,238
You're to come back
With me, eh?

876
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:52,991
I'll get my coat.

877
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,752
Worst mess
I've ever heard of.

878
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:06,755
Are you ready? Every bed
In the hospital's filled...

879
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:09,758
And not half enough
Doctors and nurses
To go around.

880
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:13,679
Ah. The maharani's
Sent out a call
For volunteers.

881
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,182
Good-bye, Edwina.
Good-bye, fern.

882
01:09:17,182 --> 01:09:18,967
Did you ever
Ride an elephant?

883
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:38,704
Next, please.

884
01:09:38,704 --> 01:09:40,706
Your name?
Sibabhai.

885
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:44,710
Experience?
High school training
In hospital work.

886
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,712
Report to miss ghose,
Second floor.

887
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:49,047
Next, please.

888
01:09:49,047 --> 01:09:53,168
Your name?
Edwina Esketh.

889
01:09:53,168 --> 01:09:55,504
Oh.
Experience?

890
01:09:56,004 --> 01:09:57,506
No experience.

891
01:09:57,506 --> 01:10:01,727
Assigned to probational duty.
Wait over there, please.

892
01:10:05,564 --> 01:10:07,516
Next, please.

893
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:10,602
Your name?
Tarabai.

894
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,021
Experience?
Yes.

895
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,828
All right.
Take him away.

896
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,169
Thank you, captain.
Yes.

897
01:10:53,228 --> 01:10:55,731
What is she doing here?
She volunteered.

898
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:58,734
Why is she doing
That kind of work?
She's had no experience.

899
01:11:08,076 --> 01:11:11,079
Lady Esketh is a very
Intelligent woman.
She's not stupid.

900
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,082
It might be worth your time
To give her some
Quick training.

901
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:17,085
She ought to be capable
Of ward duty.

902
01:11:17,085 --> 01:11:18,971
Yes, major.

903
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:57,209
Wait.
I'll do that for you.

904
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:01,713
Thank you.
It is heavy.

905
01:12:03,715 --> 01:12:05,717
Get your tray,
And we'll make the rounds.

906
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:41,720
Laying a hand on their head
Doesn't really help much,

907
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,722
Except that
It gives them courage.

908
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:46,725
You see, they know
I'm of high caste.

909
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:48,727
For centuries, they've been
Made to step aside...

910
01:12:48,727 --> 01:12:51,229
So their shadows
Won't fall on us
And pollute us.

911
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:07,245
Call the porters.

912
01:13:38,026 --> 01:13:40,028
They look at you so,

913
01:13:41,029 --> 01:13:43,815
As if they trusted you.

914
01:13:43,815 --> 01:13:45,700
They have no one else
To trust.

915
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,212
You've done a wonderful thing
Coming here like this.

916
01:13:57,212 --> 01:14:00,715
And it isn't easy,
Especially if you've
Never done it before.

917
01:14:01,716 --> 01:14:04,219
It's funny how you
Get used to things.

918
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:06,221
I don't even
Get sick anymore...

919
01:14:06,221 --> 01:14:08,723
As I did 20 times
The first day.

920
01:14:08,723 --> 01:14:10,725
And yet you stayed.

921
01:14:10,725 --> 01:14:14,146
Yes. I stayed.

922
01:14:16,148 --> 01:14:17,649
Why?

923
01:14:43,508 --> 01:14:45,760
You don't have to answer.

924
01:14:50,465 --> 01:14:52,467
Just remember that you're
In constant danger.

925
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:55,971
Don't forget to use
Plenty of disinfectant.

926
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:57,856
We mustn't let anything
Happen to you.

927
01:14:57,856 --> 01:15:00,308
You're too valuable.

928
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:25,083
Mr. Durga.

929
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:29,087
We've had a call from
The hospital for more linen
And 250 pairs of sheets.

930
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:33,091
This will give you authority
To take what you want from
The rajputana textile company.

931
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:36,845
If Mr. Motilal, the manager,
Objects, send him to me.
Yes, sahib.

932
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:39,347
And I shall introduce him
To my pet lions, who will
Feed on his liver.

933
01:15:39,347 --> 01:15:43,068
- yes, sahib.

934
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,692
I bring the brandy, sahib.
Aha. The brandy.

935
01:15:50,692 --> 01:15:53,194
No, no. Take it over
To the hospital.

936
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:55,697
All of it?
Yes, all of it.

937
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:58,033
Yes, sahib.

938
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:00,502
But don't think
I'm reforming.

939
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:03,004
When this is over, I'm going
On the biggest, longest,

940
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:05,340
Most magnificent bat
In the history of civilization.

941
01:16:06,841 --> 01:16:09,844
Make a note of that.
Yes, Mr. Ransome.

942
01:16:38,156 --> 01:16:40,158
It's good to see you,
General.

943
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:42,961
I came as soon as the weather
Was clear enough for flying.

944
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:47,499
Your highness, the viceroy
Has asked me to convey to you
His deepest sympathy,

945
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:51,503
Not only in his official
Capacity, but as an old
And sorrowing friend.

946
01:16:52,003 --> 01:16:53,505
May I add my own.

947
01:17:01,062 --> 01:17:04,065
I am grateful
To the viceroy.

948
01:17:04,065 --> 01:17:07,902
But more than sympathy,
I need cooperation.

949
01:17:07,902 --> 01:17:10,322
His excellency also asked me
To assure you...

950
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:14,109
That the british government
Stands ready to help
In any way it can.

951
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:15,944
Thank you, general.

952
01:17:16,444 --> 01:17:20,081
I knew I could count
On the viceroy
And yourself.

953
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:24,586
I take off in the morning
To make a personal report
To his excellency.

954
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:26,588
Oh, by the way,
I have room
For one passenger,

955
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:28,590
If there's anyone
You care to send.

956
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:33,795
Yes, I think there is.

957
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:37,882
Ransome, I'd like
To speak to you.
Yes, your highness.

958
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:40,385
Thank you, general.
I'll let you know.

959
01:18:00,905 --> 01:18:03,041
Thank you.

960
01:18:06,044 --> 01:18:09,547
What is lady Esketh
Doing at the hospital?

961
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:12,550
Every conceivable filthy
And drudging task.

962
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:15,754
Yes. I suppose miss macdaid
Would have seen to that.

963
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:19,007
But why is she there?
She told me
She wanted to help.

964
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:22,260
But that isn't
The real reason.
No.

965
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,647
The english
Are an odd people.

966
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:28,983
I admire them,
But I don't pretend
To understand them.

967
01:18:28,983 --> 01:18:32,854
The english
Are a sentimental people
And very much ashamed of it.

968
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:46,785
We had plans
For major Safti,
He and I.

969
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:50,171
I won't be here long.

970
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:53,842
I have no children,
Though I always wanted them.

971
01:18:53,842 --> 01:18:57,679
Before he died,
He named his successor--

972
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,299
A man whose blood,
Sympathies and training...

973
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:04,302
Fitted him
For the responsibility...

974
01:19:04,302 --> 01:19:07,305
Of guiding the state
Of Ranchipur.

975
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:09,724
Did you know that?
No.

976
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:13,695
No alien influence
Must enter his life.

977
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:17,198
He must remain dedicated
To his cause.

978
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,487
Would it hurt him so much
To give her up?

979
01:19:23,371 --> 01:19:25,874
For a while, yes.

980
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:29,244
But he's young.
He'll get over it,
I'm sure.

981
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:32,213
I want to do
The right thing.

982
01:19:33,298 --> 01:19:36,417
I'd trample her
Without mercy.

983
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:40,221
But then, of course,
I was brought up
In the hills...

984
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:42,423
Where charity
Is a sign of weakness.

985
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:48,813
I only learned tolerance
And humanity...

986
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:50,815
After I married.

987
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:53,818
I want to do
As he would have done.

988
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:59,240
She is a bad woman,
Isn't she?

989
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,243
Mm, not so much bad
As unhappy.

990
01:20:02,243 --> 01:20:05,246
Once, long ago, Edwina
Took a wrong path.

991
01:20:05,246 --> 01:20:07,749
Ever since, she's either
Been too proud...

992
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:10,251
Or too stubborn
To turn back.

993
01:20:10,251 --> 01:20:13,788
- in many respects,
She's like your highness.
- what do you mean by that?

994
01:20:13,788 --> 01:20:17,759
Well, that she's outspoken,
Intelligent,

995
01:20:18,259 --> 01:20:20,929
Has no particular use
For any other women--

996
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:22,931
Uh, unless they're over 70.

997
01:20:24,432 --> 01:20:26,434
But your highness
Is the younger of the two.

998
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:29,019
Her kind of civilization
Is on its way out.

999
01:20:29,019 --> 01:20:32,806
That's exactly
What makes it impossible.

1000
01:20:32,806 --> 01:20:36,309
Tell her I'm sending her
On the plane Tomorrow.

1001
01:20:38,729 --> 01:20:41,231
How long since you've
Been to bed?

1002
01:20:41,231 --> 01:20:44,067
Oh, perhaps a day or two.
I don't remember.

1003
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:47,320
After you've seen lady Esketh,
Get some sleep.

1004
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,374
You've been a real help.
Believe me.

1005
01:21:01,918 --> 01:21:04,254
Come in.

1006
01:21:06,757 --> 01:21:09,259
Hello, Tom.
Hello.

1007
01:21:09,259 --> 01:21:11,762
Ever try to curl your hair
Without a curling iron?

1008
01:21:12,062 --> 01:21:15,265
No.
Alcohol's a precious
Commodity these days,

1009
01:21:15,265 --> 01:21:18,185
Not to be used
For purposes
Of mere vanity.

1010
01:21:18,185 --> 01:21:20,687
Sit down--
On sataya's bed.

1011
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:22,689
She's my roommate--
A nautch dancer.

1012
01:21:25,108 --> 01:21:27,611
I've been hearing
Dreadful things about you.

1013
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:29,613
It seems you've become
A shockingly useful
Citizen.

1014
01:21:29,613 --> 01:21:32,115
Can't help myself.

1015
01:21:32,115 --> 01:21:34,117
It's a conspiracy.

1016
01:21:34,117 --> 01:21:36,787
Why so glum?
Why so cheerful?

1017
01:21:37,287 --> 01:21:40,290
Mm, I'm young again.
That's why.
Mm.

1018
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:43,794
I feel exactly as I did
The day of my first
Real dancing party,

1019
01:21:43,794 --> 01:21:46,296
When I was 12.

1020
01:21:46,797 --> 01:21:49,800
I remember I had
A pink taffeta dress.

1021
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,303
Hideous thing really,
But I thought
It was a love.

1022
01:21:53,804 --> 01:21:55,305
And that little beast
Of a joe cumberland--

1023
01:21:55,806 --> 01:21:57,524
The one that's in
The cabinet now--

1024
01:21:57,524 --> 01:22:00,527
Mm-hmm.
Spilled strawberry jam
On it.

1025
01:22:00,527 --> 01:22:03,029
I tried
To scratch his eyes out.

1026
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:05,031
The authorities
Intervened.

1027
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:15,292
Edwina?

1028
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:18,578
I'm afraid
I've come to spill jam
On your party dress.

1029
01:22:18,578 --> 01:22:20,630
What do you mean?

1030
01:22:22,465 --> 01:22:24,334
The maharani is sending you
Away in the morning.

1031
01:22:25,635 --> 01:22:28,221
No. I won't go.

1032
01:22:28,221 --> 01:22:30,090
You'd better.
She means it.

1033
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:32,592
No, Tom.

1034
01:22:32,592 --> 01:22:35,846
I've thought it all out,
And this time I know
I'm right.

1035
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,233
I must be right.

1036
01:22:40,233 --> 01:22:42,235
Believe me, Tom.

1037
01:22:42,736 --> 01:22:45,238
I'm in love for the first
Time in my life--

1038
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:47,574
Completely,
Honestly in love.

1039
01:22:47,574 --> 01:22:49,743
I believe you.

1040
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:54,531
So you can tell
The maharani I won't go.

1041
01:22:54,531 --> 01:22:57,033
Yeah. She'll probably
Have you shot.

1042
01:22:57,033 --> 01:22:59,035
She can, you know.
I'll risk it.

1043
01:22:59,035 --> 01:23:01,538
And will you risk
Destroying him?

1044
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:05,041
I won't destroy him.
He loves me.
I'm sure of it.

1045
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:07,544
That's why you must go.

1046
01:23:07,544 --> 01:23:09,930
Let's try to look
At this thing realistically.

1047
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:13,383
The maharani's
Giving Rama his choice.

1048
01:23:13,383 --> 01:23:16,803
He can have Ranchipur or you.
He can't have both.

1049
01:23:16,803 --> 01:23:22,359
You're asking me to give up
The only real chance
For happiness I've ever had.

1050
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:26,062
Don't get me started.
I hate scenes.

1051
01:23:28,281 --> 01:23:31,284
Ah. 6:00.
I'm on duty.

1052
01:23:31,785 --> 01:23:33,286
Cheerio, Tom.

1053
01:23:33,787 --> 01:23:35,789
You've done your duty
Like a good little soldier.

1054
01:25:17,974 --> 01:25:19,726
Coolie. Coolie.

1055
01:26:44,094 --> 01:26:45,895
The glass.

1056
01:27:40,617 --> 01:27:42,619
Good morning.

1057
01:27:44,621 --> 01:27:47,624
I couldn't sleep.
I had to come
And talk to you.

1058
01:27:47,624 --> 01:27:52,128
Listen.

1059
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:56,049
Ah, that's a good sign.

1060
01:27:56,049 --> 01:27:58,885
It means that life
Is going on again.

1061
01:27:58,885 --> 01:28:01,337
It means we're going to win.

1062
01:28:01,838 --> 01:28:05,341
Last night, for the first time,
There were fewer new cases
Instead of more.

1063
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:09,345
You look tired.
I'm not really.

1064
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:14,901
This is the only chance we have
To talk to each other.

1065
01:28:16,903 --> 01:28:19,405
It wasn't true what I said
About not being able to sleep.

1066
01:28:20,406 --> 01:28:22,242
I set the alarm clock.

1067
01:28:22,242 --> 01:28:24,661
You shouldn't.

1068
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:26,746
You get little enough rest.

1069
01:28:27,113 --> 01:28:31,084
There are all kinds of rest.
This is better than sleeping.

1070
01:28:36,756 --> 01:28:38,508
Tom tells me
That you're leaving today.

1071
01:28:38,508 --> 01:28:42,712
Yes. By request.

1072
01:28:44,097 --> 01:28:46,099
It's probably just as well.

1073
01:28:48,101 --> 01:28:49,886
I go through torture
Every moment...

1074
01:28:50,386 --> 01:28:51,888
Because you're in danger here.

1075
01:28:53,389 --> 01:28:55,892
Nothing must happen
To you now.

1076
01:28:55,892 --> 01:28:59,195
Rama.

1077
01:28:59,195 --> 01:29:02,148
What's the matter?

1078
01:29:03,983 --> 01:29:05,485
Nothing.

1079
01:29:07,487 --> 01:29:09,989
It just makes me so happy
To hear you say that.

1080
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:14,494
I never thought,
When I first met you--

1081
01:29:16,496 --> 01:29:18,498
It seems so long ago--

1082
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,920
That you'd ever say
Anything like that to me.

1083
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:28,141
I wouldn't have
Said it then,

1084
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:30,143
Not to the woman
I knew then.

1085
01:29:32,145 --> 01:29:33,930
But now I--

1086
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:35,932
I think
You're someone different.

1087
01:29:37,934 --> 01:29:41,938
Please don't think that I'm just
Being mystical and Indian,
But...

1088
01:29:45,441 --> 01:29:47,827
I can't connect you
With her--

1089
01:29:47,827 --> 01:29:49,612
That woman I met
At the summer palace,

1090
01:29:49,612 --> 01:29:54,033
So shiny and glossy
And so crafty
For what she wanted.

1091
01:29:54,534 --> 01:29:57,870
Oh, yes, I--
I knew what you wanted.

1092
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,290
And I was tempted.

1093
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:05,295
That's why I stayed for a cup
Of lukewarm tea, which I hate.

1094
01:30:06,296 --> 01:30:08,298
And you were trying so hard
To make me believe...

1095
01:30:08,298 --> 01:30:12,135
You were respectable
And inexperienced.

1096
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:15,638
Wait. I-- I don't think
Much of respectability.

1097
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,642
I think a great deal more
Of truth.

1098
01:30:21,144 --> 01:30:22,979
Maybe that's why
I hesitated then.

1099
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,151
And later, when I pretended
I didn't find you exciting.

1100
01:30:28,151 --> 01:30:30,153
Something held me back.

1101
01:30:31,654 --> 01:30:35,325
I must have seen
The other woman within you--

1102
01:30:35,325 --> 01:30:38,328
The one that came here,
Scrubbed floors
And emptied slop pails...

1103
01:30:38,328 --> 01:30:40,797
And fought nausea
And weariness and fear--

1104
01:30:41,297 --> 01:30:43,800
The real woman.

1105
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,254
You see, it would have been
Like taking a counterfeit...

1106
01:30:48,254 --> 01:30:51,057
Instead of waiting
For the real coin.

1107
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:02,485
I wanted you to know
What I felt because I--

1108
01:31:02,485 --> 01:31:05,988
I think so much of you
That I can risk making
A fool of myself.

1109
01:31:08,157 --> 01:31:10,993
Maybe, in your heart,
You're laughing at me.

1110
01:31:10,993 --> 01:31:14,280
No. No.

1111
01:31:18,701 --> 01:31:22,038
Well, now you know my secret.

1112
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,796
We'll let the maharani
Send you away.

1113
01:31:29,796 --> 01:31:31,798
Then when the worst
Is over here,
No matter where you are,

1114
01:31:32,298 --> 01:31:33,800
I'll come after you.

1115
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:36,803
You'd leave Ranchipur?
Yes.

1116
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:39,722
Yes. We'll go to some other city
Where I can set up a practice--

1117
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:41,691
Calcutta, madras
Or the malay states--

1118
01:31:42,191 --> 01:31:44,060
Where we can live
Our own lives together.

1119
01:31:45,812 --> 01:31:49,115
You'd leave all this,
Knowing what it's meant
To you?

1120
01:31:50,616 --> 01:31:52,869
Knowing what you do of me?

1121
01:31:55,238 --> 01:31:57,240
No.

1122
01:31:59,242 --> 01:32:01,244
Just hold me
A little while.

1123
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:13,723
Edwina.

1124
01:32:17,176 --> 01:32:18,978
You're not well. You--

1125
01:32:19,979 --> 01:32:21,981
You have a fever.
No.

1126
01:32:22,982 --> 01:32:24,984
No.

1127
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:29,739
I-- I'm just tired.

1128
01:32:43,085 --> 01:32:45,087
Take over in the ward.

1129
01:33:38,758 --> 01:33:41,644
How is she?
Rama's with her now.

1130
01:33:41,644 --> 01:33:44,146
She sent word
She wanted to see me.
Yes, I know.

1131
01:33:47,517 --> 01:33:50,019
I want to give her
Another injection
In about half an hour.

1132
01:33:50,019 --> 01:33:53,523
Yes, major.
Miss Simon,
You may go in now.

1133
01:34:01,948 --> 01:34:05,952
I don't know what to do, Tom.
I don't know what to do.

1134
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:11,457
She won't fight.
She hasn't any will to live.

1135
01:34:11,457 --> 01:34:13,876
I don't know what to do.
Steady.

1136
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,266
I'm supposed
To be a doctor.

1137
01:34:20,266 --> 01:34:23,769
I'm supposed to help people
To fight for life.

1138
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:26,272
And I want her to live
More than I want
To live myself.

1139
01:34:27,773 --> 01:34:30,443
I tried to tell her
That she must fight.

1140
01:34:30,443 --> 01:34:32,945
I-- I couldn't.

1141
01:34:32,945 --> 01:34:34,947
I couldn't speak.

1142
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:39,452
I'm all gone inside.

1143
01:34:39,452 --> 01:34:41,954
Stay with me, Tom.
I need you.

1144
01:34:42,455 --> 01:34:45,791
Rama, this won't do.
You've got to get
A hold of yourself.

1145
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,743
It's no use.
I-- I can't.

1146
01:34:50,713 --> 01:34:54,216
We're different--
Deep down where it matters.

1147
01:34:55,718 --> 01:35:00,723
I'm an Indian.
I-- I can't be
Calm and unemotional.

1148
01:35:00,723 --> 01:35:04,226
I want to tear my clothes
And wail like a--

1149
01:35:04,226 --> 01:35:07,229
Like Bannerjee.
You're not Bannerjee.

1150
01:35:07,229 --> 01:35:09,148
You're a man.
You're a doctor.

1151
01:35:09,649 --> 01:35:11,484
No. No.

1152
01:35:12,902 --> 01:35:14,904
I've failed.
I can't save her.

1153
01:35:16,405 --> 01:35:19,191
Rama. Rama.

1154
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:22,028
Rama! Listen to me.

1155
01:35:22,028 --> 01:35:24,363
If you lose your way now,
You'll never find it again.

1156
01:35:24,864 --> 01:35:26,866
Think of the maharani
And your duty,

1157
01:35:26,866 --> 01:35:29,368
Of the maharajah
And all he planned for you.

1158
01:35:29,368 --> 01:35:32,371
Think of the people
Who worship and respect you.

1159
01:35:32,371 --> 01:35:35,875
To them, you're a symbol--
Something clean and courageous,

1160
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:38,878
That's been born in the darkness
And filth that was India.

1161
01:35:38,878 --> 01:35:42,015
You are India--
The new India.

1162
01:35:42,015 --> 01:35:44,684
Don't betray all of us
Who have faith in you.

1163
01:35:54,144 --> 01:35:56,146
I'm sorry, Tom.

1164
01:35:56,646 --> 01:35:59,149
I'm all right now.
It won't happen again.

1165
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,452
Thank you.

1166
01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:04,821
But I can't take them.

1167
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:07,991
Don't be an idiot.

1168
01:36:10,493 --> 01:36:12,495
If you and Tom
Have children,

1169
01:36:12,495 --> 01:36:15,298
Your son might be
The earl of nolham.

1170
01:36:15,298 --> 01:36:18,251
He'd have a wife,

1171
01:36:18,251 --> 01:36:21,337
And she could wear them
To boring dinner parties,

1172
01:36:21,838 --> 01:36:23,840
Tell how they'd been
Left to her by...

1173
01:36:24,307 --> 01:36:27,510
A shameless wench
Called lady Esketh...

1174
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:31,731
Who died in Ranchipur
During the great disaster
Of 1938.

1175
01:36:34,234 --> 01:36:37,070
We're such snobs at home.

1176
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:40,356
We like stories like that.

1177
01:36:44,861 --> 01:36:49,866
I suppose this is the way
It feels to repent
And get religion--

1178
01:36:52,368 --> 01:36:55,371
Giving away
My worldly goods.

1179
01:36:59,209 --> 01:37:01,211
Anyway,

1180
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:05,465
It's a nice feeling.

1181
01:37:14,724 --> 01:37:17,026
Hello, Tom.

1182
01:37:18,444 --> 01:37:20,947
Don't look so unhappy.
I'm not.

1183
01:37:20,947 --> 01:37:22,732
Rama says if you'd only fight.

1184
01:37:24,701 --> 01:37:26,286
What's there to fight about?

1185
01:37:28,288 --> 01:37:31,624
Has anything changed since
The last time we talked?

1186
01:37:37,747 --> 01:37:39,549
Would you mind, my dear?

1187
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:56,649
Have you got a ring
For fern?

1188
01:37:59,152 --> 01:38:02,355
Does she like sapphires?

1189
01:38:02,855 --> 01:38:04,857
There's a condition
Attached.

1190
01:38:04,857 --> 01:38:06,859
You'll have to marry her.

1191
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:11,364
You said
You'd do anything.

1192
01:38:11,364 --> 01:38:14,367
Yes, but I'd be
No good for her.
Oh.

1193
01:38:15,368 --> 01:38:17,370
Stop bragging.

1194
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:19,872
She's mad about you.

1195
01:38:19,872 --> 01:38:22,375
She thinks you're a god.

1196
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:24,711
That's what
You've always wanted.

1197
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,356
We have had such foul luck,
You and I.

1198
01:38:38,358 --> 01:38:40,360
But...

1199
01:38:41,361 --> 01:38:43,863
You've picked a winner
At last.

1200
01:38:53,373 --> 01:38:56,159
Ask him to come in.

1201
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:41,454
As soon as you're well,
We'll get away from all this.

1202
01:39:41,454 --> 01:39:43,339
Of course.

1203
01:39:43,339 --> 01:39:45,341
I've thought it all out.

1204
01:39:45,341 --> 01:39:47,877
We won't be running away
From anything,

1205
01:39:47,877 --> 01:39:50,346
Because there won't be
Anybody else in the world
But ourselves.

1206
01:39:50,346 --> 01:39:53,349
We'll have each other.

1207
01:39:53,349 --> 01:39:55,351
Yes.

1208
01:39:55,852 --> 01:39:57,553
Just you and I.

1209
01:39:57,553 --> 01:40:02,225
Up to kashmir,
Down the ganges to bengal.

1210
01:40:02,225 --> 01:40:04,394
And then perhaps
In a little boat
From calcutta...

1211
01:40:04,394 --> 01:40:06,396
Through all the islands
Of the east.

1212
01:40:06,396 --> 01:40:10,316
The spice islands,
The coral islands...

1213
01:40:10,316 --> 01:40:14,320
And all those places with names
Like magic spells.

1214
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,823
Just you and I.

1215
01:40:16,823 --> 01:40:18,825
Nothing else will matter,
Will it?

1216
01:40:19,826 --> 01:40:21,828
Will it?

1217
01:40:25,915 --> 01:40:27,717
Edwina.

1218
01:40:29,719 --> 01:40:31,888
Edwina.

1219
01:40:31,888 --> 01:40:33,890
Edwina.

1220
01:40:50,857 --> 01:40:54,360
This time, it has been
Built to stand--

1221
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,362
As long as you live...

1222
01:40:56,362 --> 01:40:58,998
And your children...

1223
01:40:58,998 --> 01:41:01,000
And your children's children.

1224
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:11,294
The time is here, Rama.

1225
01:41:11,294 --> 01:41:13,796
Your people are waiting.

1226
01:41:17,633 --> 01:41:20,937
What is it, Rama?
What do you hear?

1227
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:25,358
Nothing, your highness.

1228
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:28,945
Only a song.

1229
01:41:28,945 --> 01:41:31,113
They're waiting, Rama.

1230
01:41:32,305 --> 01:42:32,621
