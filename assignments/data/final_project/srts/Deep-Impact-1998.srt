so he resigned.

from outside the government pool,

off women.

installed in his office.

(SCOFFS) Isn't Washington sick?

158
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,696
Hi.

159
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,199
How you doing?

160
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,034
Can I help you?

161
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,704
Well, actually, we're looking
for your mom. Is she around?

162
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,123
My mom's sick. She's not here.

163
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,252
Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

164
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,712
Yeah.

165
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,590
That's exciting. Looks like a...

166
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,967
Like a long trip, huh?

167
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,471
So listen,
do you know where you're going?

168
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,765
RITTENHOUSE: She's going back
to the house.

169
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,892
Hey. You wanna stop that?

170
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,894
Lily, please?

171
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,271
Lily, that's a pretty name.

172
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,191
Lily, do as I say.

173
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,818
Go on. I'll be right there.

174
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,153
If we could just get a minute
of your time.

175
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,780
What do you want from me?

176
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,324
Well, we'd like to talk
about your resignation.

177
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,743
My wife is sick. She's in the hospital.

178
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,329
That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

179
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,416
We could talk about your wife,
or we could just talk about Ellie.

180
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,265
Turn the camera off.

181
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,934
If you wanna talk to me, turn it off.

182
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,227
Cut it.

183
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,815
- We know everything.
- Nobody knows everything.

184
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,527
Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

185
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,321
and the whispered calls
to the President.

186
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,867
And about a secretary of the Treasury
who's kept his entire department

187
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,662
in the dark about what he's really doing,
about a cover story

188
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,539
about his resignation
that just fell through.

189
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,041
I mean, sir, you want me to go on?

190
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,961
And you're just gonna break it?

191
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,881
Well, that's what we do for a living.

192
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,799
Well, congratulations.

193
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,261
You now have the biggest story
in history.

194
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,971
Good luck to you.

195
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,057
Personally, I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

196
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,101
but, hey, what the hell?

197
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,644
Why not?

198
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,982
What difference
does anything make anymore?

199
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,822
Look.

200
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,159
I know you're just a reporter,

201
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,329
but you used to be a person, right?

202
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,712
I wanted to be with my family.

203
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,508
Can you understand that?

204
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,908
Okay, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse resigns

205
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,410
because of a mistress named Ellie.

206
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,704
Biggest story in history?

00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,956
(SCOFFS)

208
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,415
What an ego.

209
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,251
Now, if it was the President...

210
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,336
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

211
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,089
Okay, the President
has a mistress named Ellie,

212
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,007
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

213
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,887
and takes the fall and resigns,
and the President buys him a yacht?

Just step back to my car.

- Got it.

Morton Entrekin, Ms. Lerner.

226
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,311
I'm expected back at MSNBC at 6:00,

227
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,189
and I think I should be there.

228
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,775
People knew about
the Manhattan Project, you know,

229
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,860
and they kept it a secret.

230
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,864
That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

Ms. Lerner? Tom Beck.

235
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,522
I understand
you've come into some information.

236
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,274
Ms. Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

237
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,196
for matters of national security where
journalistic competitiveness is at stake.

238
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,493
Mr. President, I'm not interested
in using Ellie to further my career.

239
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,954
What do you know about E.L.E.?

240
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,210
I know you should have picked
a better cover story than a sick wife.

241
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,212
See? What'd I tell you?

242
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,134
We'd always thought the deadline
for going public

243
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,802
was the publication of the budget,

244
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,471
since we've spent more money
than we can hide.

245
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,141
But the budget comes out in two weeks.

246
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,311
I don't suppose I could convince you
to sit on this for two weeks.

247
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,357
No such thing as two weeks
in the news business.

248
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,903
And I can't appeal to your sense
of what's in the nation's best interest.

249
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,199
Well, I always thought the truth
was in the nation's best interest.

250
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,579
ENTREKIN: You wanna hold her?

251
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,751
BECK: What if we go public in 48 hours?
Now, that's doable, isn't it?

252
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,129
ENTREKIN: That would be very difficult,
Mr. President.

253
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,255
Morton,

254
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,759
if she knows, how long can it be before
CNN or The Post breaks the story?

255
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:44,140
Now, this was never gonna be a secret
as long as you wanted it to be.

256
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,059
Give us two days, Ms. Lerner.

257
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,563
You'll get second-row center
at the White House press conference.

258
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,815
Now, from what I know of your career,
that's a promotion.

259
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,902
- I want exclusivity.
- Now, listen, young lady,

260
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,113
this is a presidential favor.

261
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,366
I'm letting you go because
I don't want another headache,

262
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,704
and I'm trusting you because I know
what this can do for your career.

263
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,874
It might seem that we have each other
over the same barrel, Ms. Lerner,

264
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,126
but it just seems that way.

- I want the...
- "Want"?

and is knocked into a different orbit.

when the crew enters the Messiah,

634
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,482
they will find a payload
of eight nuclear devices

Sometime in the next hour,

The interception of Wolf-Biederman

On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

who only knew a few miles of the river.

you couldn't know the whole trip.

Floods, sandbars, fallen logs.

702

It was all a riverboat pilot could do,

703
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,163
was to know his little piece
of the puzzle.

shortly after completing
his medical training at Duke University.

We have a choice right now.

Ever since the comet was discovered,

881
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,526
we've been hoping
and working for the best,

but we've also been planning
for the worst.

01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,948
Our strategy has been twofold.

884
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,992
First, our Strategic Missile Command

885
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,703
is preparing to coordinate
with the Russians

886
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:51,498
a massive strike of Titan missiles
to intercept the comets.

887
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,960
If we can deflect these comets enough,

888
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,463
they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphere

889
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,425
and head on out into space.

890
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,262
Unfortunately, the Titans
cannot be launched

891
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,597
until the comets
are only a few hours away.

892
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,393
And while we are confident
the missile attack will succeed,

893
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,312
it is only prudent
that we now take cautionary steps

894
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,274
to ensure the continuation
of our way of life,

895
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,402
to guarantee
that there will be enough of us left

that the comets do strike the Earth.

So in the soft limestone of Missouri,

And they're almost finished.

901
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,170
And we can put
a million people in them.

902
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:42,549
And that million people can survive
there, underground, for two years,

until the air clears and the dust settles.

It is our new Noah's Ark.

but I still want to offer a prayer

for our survival,

whomever you hold that to be,

938

hears all prayers,

even if sometimes the answer is no.

940
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,886
So may the Lord bless you.

May the Lord keep you.

his divine countenance upon you

We now have the details
for the national lottery.

Those of you
who have been preselected

within the next few minutes.

have been randomly selected

over 50 years of age
have been preselected for the Ark

beginning on August 12th.

01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,430
During this two-day period,
no unofficial travel will be permitted.

in every town with a population
over 5,000.

can we get back into the cargo bay

980
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,797
to reroute the video functions?

We could go in with the EVAs,

but there's not much left
in the life-support packs.

983
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,640
We should be able to raise Houston
on the low band once we get closer.

984
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,726
And the Orion is still functioning?

System check was okay, but I don't
know about the radiation shielding.

986
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,399
So if we fire it up,
we beat the comet back to Earth,

Okay.

it's liberating knowing

993
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,069
that I'm not going to be called.

994

is saving all of the art?

997
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,293
They're shipping it to the caves.

998
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,047
I've given them my beautiful
18th-century desk from New England

01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:28,093
before the radar tracking stations
can see if they've been pushed

1237
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:30,971
to a safe course that'll bypass the Earth.

1238
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:34,391
So one more time, we have to wait.

1239
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:57,247
- Are we on?
- MAN: We're on, Mr. President.

1240
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,760
Our missiles have failed.

1241
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:14,014
The comets are still headed for Earth,

1242
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,728
and there's nothing we can do
to stop them.

1243
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,107
So this is it.

1244
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,444
If the world does go on,

1245
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,530
it will not go on for everyone.

1246
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,952
ON TV: We have now been able
to calculate the comets' final trajectories,

1247
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,331
and we have determined
where they're going to strike.

1248
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:43,168
The smaller of the two comets,
Biederman, will hit first

1249
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,878
somewhere along the Atlantic seaboard,

1250
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:48,048
probably in the waters
off the coast of Cape Hatteras,

1251
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:51,802
in just under 12 hours,
at 4:35 p. m. Eastern Daylight Time.

1252
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:55,555
The impact of the comet is going to be,

1253
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,266
well, disastrous.

1254
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,395
There will be a very large tidal wave

1255
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,563
moving quickly
through the Atlantic Ocean.

1256
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,734
It'll be 100 feet high,
traveling at 1,100 miles an hour.

1257
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,487
That's faster than the speed of sound.

1258
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,323
As the wave reaches shallow water
it's going to slow down,

1259
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,744
but the wave height, depending
on the depth of the shelf off the coast,

1260
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:21,748
will be anywhere from
1,000 to 3,500 feet high.

1261
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:26,461
Where the land is flat,
the wave will wash inland

1262
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,839
600 to 700 miles.

1263
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,173
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1264
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:34,177
The wave will hit our nation's capital
40 minutes after impact.

1265
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:40,559
New York City, Boston,
Atlanta, Philadelphia,

1266
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,187
all will be destroyed.

1267
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:48,233
If you have any means of getting
away from the path of this wave,

1268
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:49,651
leave now.

1269
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,529
The impact of the larger comet

1270
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,158
will be nothing less
than an extinction-level event.

1271
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,745
It will strike land in western Canada
three hours after Biederman.

1272
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:05,083
Within a week, the skies
will be dark with dust from the impact,

1273
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,794
and they will stay dark for two years.

1274
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:11,256
All plant life will be dead within

1275
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,217
four weeks.

01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:20,515
a few months.

1278
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,479
So that's it.

1279
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,732
Good luck to us all.

1280
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:59,596
Could I bother everyone for a minute?
Now, let's take a look at the big one.

1281
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,141
Now, the out-gassing has created a vent
a half a mile wide

1282
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,186
and at least 2 miles deep.
Comet gets closer to the sun,

1283
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:10,065
sun melts ice, ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole. Okay?

1284
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,986
So, how many nukes
we have left in the back?

1285
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,279
Four.

1286
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:21,826
Okay. If we can get
the remaining bombs in that vent,

1287
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:26,206
there shouldn't be anything left
of that comet bigger than a suitcase.

1288
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:29,334
Now, we can't do anything
about the little one,

1289
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,796
but, you know,
it just might give them a chance.

1290
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,173
Now, without the arming codes,
we're gonna have to wait

1291
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:39,135
to set the bomb timers until
we get closer to Earth to raise Houston.

1292
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,179
We may not have enough
life support left

1293
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:44,182
to get back into the cargo bay
for the nukes,

1294
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,309
much less to work down on the comet.

1295
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,645
And we sure as hell don't have
enough propellant left in the Messiah

1296
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,355
to maneuver with.

1297
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:54,943
How are we supposed to get back
off the surface once we've...

1298
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:57,153
Once we've gone down there?

1299
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:03,326
We don't.

1300

Well, you look at the bright side.

1301

1309
