1
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,980
You never did eat your lunch, did you?

2
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,816
I better get back to the office.

3
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,985
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,487
Why don't you call your boss and tell him

5
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,906
you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,367
Friday anyway, and hot.

7
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,621
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,958
Well, we could laze around here
a while longer.

9
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,670
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,132
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you
when you come in,

11
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,260
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:49,887
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:51,681
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

14
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,932
an occasional night in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,311
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,398
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.

17
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:03,276
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

18
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,112
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,449
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:15,246
You come down here on business trips,
and we steal lunch hours.

21
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,624
I wish you wouldn't even come.

22
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,712
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

23
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,006
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

24
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,136
- I can come down next week.
- No.

25
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:35,141
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

26
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:39,645
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

27
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,189
But respectably.

28
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:45,067
In my house,
with my mother's picture on the mantel

29
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,571
and my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

30
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,573
And after the steak,

31
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,242
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

32
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,410
Sam!

33
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:58,956
All right.

34
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,841
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

35
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:12,178
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

36
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:16,432
You make respectability sound disrespectful.

37
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,100
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

38
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,771
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

39
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:25,107
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

40
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:30,780
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

41
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,868
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,996
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,
and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,289
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

44
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:44,085
and she's living on the other side
of the world somewhere.

45
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,296
I pay, too.

46
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:51,384
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:55,805
A couple of years and my debts
will be paid off.

48
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,474
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

49
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:02,937
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,147
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,573
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,785
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:21,497
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,416
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,176
Marion, you want to cut this off,

56
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,721
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

57
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,597
I'm thinking of it.

58
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:45,187
How could you even think a thing like that?

59
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,733
- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?

60
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:51,777
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.

61
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,918
Is Mr Lowery back from lunch?

62
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,421
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris Street property.

63
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:14,425
You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?

64
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,968
It'll pass.

65
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,636
Headaches are like resolutions,

66
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,680
you forget them as soon as they stop hurting.

67
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:22,850
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

68
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:25,603
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

69
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:29,482
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilisers.

70
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,484
Any calls?

71
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:35,863
Teddy called me.
My mother called to see if Teddy called.

72
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,741
Oh, your sister called to say
she's going to Tucson to do some buying

73
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,034
and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...

74
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,167
It's as hot as fresh milk.

75
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,631
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss
to air condition you up.

76
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,091
He can afford it today.

77
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:58,677
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

78
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:02,223
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

79
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,851
Oh, not you. My daughter.

80
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:07,937
A baby.

81
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:13,692
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self up there
and gets married away from me.

82
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,822
I want you to take a look at my baby.

83
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,618
Eighteen years old

84
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,872
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

85
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,917
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

86
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,837
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?

87
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,297
I buy it off.

88
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,758
Are... Are you unhappy?

89
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:41,137
Not inordinately.

90
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:46,392
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

91
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,895
$40,000 cash.

92
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:56,902
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.

93
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,533
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.

94
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,494
- Count them!
- I declare!

95
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,289
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.

96
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:13,169
Tom, a cash transaction of this size
is most irregular.

97
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,380
So what? It's my private money.

98
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:17,798
Now it's yours.

99
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,133
Suppose we put it in the safe,

100
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:22,720
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

101
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,972
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

102
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,184
where's that bottle you said
was in your desk?

103
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,567
You know, sometimes I can keep
my mouth shut.

104
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,450
Lowery, I am dying of thirst-aroonie.

105
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,664
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

106
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,958
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank,

107
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,127
and we'll get him to give us
a cheque on Monday instead.

108
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,295
Yes.

109
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,552
He was flirting with you.

110
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,472
I guess he must've noticed
my wedding ring.

111
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,320
Come in.

112
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,576
The copies. Mr Lowery, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.

113
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,912
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

114
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,081
Because me and your boss are going out

115
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,708
and get ourselves a little drinking done. Right?

116
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:37,920
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

117
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,341
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

118
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,678
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.

119
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,101
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

120
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,561
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.

121
00:10:55,897 --> 00:11:00,609
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank
and then go home and sleep it off.

122
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,901
<i>Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?</i>

123
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,862
<i>Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.</i>

124
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,739
<i>What is it, Marion?</i>

125
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:51,548
Hold it there.

126
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,264
In quite a hurry.

127
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,434
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.

128
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,437
I almost had an accident last night
from sleepiness,

129
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:09,107
- so I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

130
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,945
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

131
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,698
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

132
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,534
I mean, just to be safe.

133
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:23,455
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?

134
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:26,416
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

135
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,878
Is anything wrong?

136
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,675
Of course not.
Am I acting as if there's something wrong?

137
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,220
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

138
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,974
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

139
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,687
I've told you there's nothing wrong,

140
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,690
except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

141
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,819
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.

142
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,489
May I see your licence?

143
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:02,369
- Why?
- Please.

144
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,956
Be with you in a second!

145
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,938
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

146
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,941
There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

147
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,651
But like I say,
I'm in no mood for it,

148
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:25,030
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

149
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,282
Can I trade my car in and take another?

150
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,495
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?

151
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,872
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.

152
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,458
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

153
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,667
Why don't you have a look around here

154
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,169
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

155
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,254
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

156
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,298
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.

157
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,759
I'm in a hurry and I just
wanna make a change.

158
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,302
One thing people never ought to be

159
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,346
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

160
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,350
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

161
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,833
That's the one I'd have picked
for you myself.

162
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,042
- How much?
- Go ahead.

163
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,628
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

164
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,672
How much would it be with my car?

165
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,843
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

166
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,887
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

167
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,931
Of course not. Please.

168
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:37,727
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

169
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,939
I figure roughly

170
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,652
your car plus $700.

171
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:50,282
- $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?

172
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:52,868
All right.

173
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:00,375
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

174
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,420
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...

175
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,299
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

176
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:09,009
In the building.

177
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,688
Over there.

178
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:21,164
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

179
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,833
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

180
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,920
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...

181
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,547
I might as well be perfectly honest
with you, ma'am.

182
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,342
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?

183
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,260
Is there anything so terribly wrong

184
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:37,305
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

185
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,558
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

186
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,895
All right, let's go inside.

187
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,142
Hey!

188
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,651
Just put it in here, please.

189
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,031
Thank you.

190
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,207
<i>Heck, Officer,</i>

191
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,500
<i>that was the first time
I ever saw the customer</i>

192
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:49,794
<i>high-pressure the salesman.</i>

193
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,755
<i>Somebody chasing her?</i>

194
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,883
<i>I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.</i>

195
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,135
<i>She look like a wrong one to you?</i>

196
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,470
<i>Acted like one.</i>

197
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:02,515
<i>The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.</i>

198
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:16,362
- <i>Yes, Mr Lowery.</i>
- <i>Caroline, Marion still isn't in?</i>

199
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,908
<i>No, Mr Lowery, but then
she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

200
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,534
<i>Buzz me the minute she comes in.</i>

201
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:26,915
<i>And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.</i>

202
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,375
<i>I called her sister, Mr Lowery,
where she works,</i>

203
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,461
<i>the Music Makers Music Store, you know,</i>

204
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,172
<i>and she doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.</i>

205
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:35,423
<i>You better run out to the house.</i>

206
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,051
<i>She may be, well,
unable to answer the phone.</i>

207
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:41,012
<i>Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.</i>

208
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,435
<i>No, I haven't the faintest idea.</i>

209
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,438
<i>As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.</i>

210
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:54,067
<i>She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.</i>

211
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:57,153
<i>That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.</i>

212
00:24:57,238 --> 00:25:00,073
<i>I did see her some time later, driving...</i>

213
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,536
<i>I think you'd better come over here
to my office, quick.</i>

214
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:07,205
<i>Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.</i>

215
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,503
<i>After all, Cassidy, I told you,
all that cash!</i>

216
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:16,172
<i>I'm not taking the responsibility.</i>

217
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:17,799
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake.</i>

218
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,844
<i>A girl works for you for 10 years,
you trust her.</i>

219
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,887
<i>All right, yes, you better come over.</i>

220
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:28,351
<i>Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!</i>

221
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:32,480
<i>I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!</i>

222
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,483
- <i>I'll track her, never you doubt it.</i>
- <i>Hold on, Cassidy.</i>

223
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:40,989
<i>I still can't believe...
It must be some kind of a mystery. I can't...</i>

224
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,284
<i>You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?</i>

225
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:48,371
<i>You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!</i>

226
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:52,917
<i>Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!</i>

227
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,065
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain.

228
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,942
Go ahead in, please.

229
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,075
- Dirty night.
- You have a vacancy?

230
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,079
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

231
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:38,082
They... They moved away the highway.

232
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,753
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

233
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,005
I knew you must have.

234
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,633
Nobody ever stops here any more
unless they've done that.

235
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,013
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

236
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:56,267
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

237
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:03,274
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

238
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:08,988
Los Angeles.

239
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,873
Cabin One. It's closer
in case you want anything.

240
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,166
Right next to the office.

241
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,211
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

242
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:27,048
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

243
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:31,302
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

244
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:52,490
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

245
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,748
Well, the mattress is soft

246
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:05,461
and there's hangers in the closet
and stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

247
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:08,923
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious.

248
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,508
And the...

249
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:15,263
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

250
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:16,889
Yeah.

251
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:21,978
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

252
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:24,355
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

253
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,023
Norman Bates.

254
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,947
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

255
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,282
No.

256
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,285
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?

257
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,828
I was just about to myself.

258
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,247
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

259
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:45,001
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

260
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,881
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

261
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:52,383
- I'd like to.
- All right.

262
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:55,136
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

263
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,971
and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

264
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,264
Okay.

265
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,641
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

266
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,393
No! I tell you no!

267
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:28,771
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper!

268
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:32,191
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

269
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,610
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

270
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,320
Mother, please.

271
00:32:36,572 --> 00:32:39,574
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

272
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,952
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

273
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:48,416
"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...

274
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,712
I refuse to speak of disgusting things,
because they disgust me!

275
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,089
You understand, boy? Go on.

276
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,342
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite

277
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:00,845
with my food or my son!

278
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:04,265
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

279
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,935
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

280
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:52,897
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.

281
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,400
Mother... My mother...

282
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,903
What is the phrase?

283
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,073
She isn't quite herself today.

284
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:06,702
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.

285
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,878
I wish you could apologise for other people.

287
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,214
Don't worry about it.

288
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:21,884
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

289
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:36,941
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

290
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,082
Well, it stopped raining.

291
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,710
Eating in an office is just too officious.

292
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,672
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

293
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:17,815
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

294
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,987
You're very kind.

295
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,324
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

296
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,167
You... You eat like a bird.

297
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:39,754
And you'd know, of course.

298
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,047
No, not really.

299
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:45,509
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

300
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:49,680
is really a false... Falsity.

301
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,476
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

302
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:59,648
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

303
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,567
My hobby is stuffing things.

304
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,486
You know, taxidermy.

305
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:07,531
And I guess I'd just
rather stuff birds because

306
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:10,785
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

307
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,828
You know, foxes and chimps.

308
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:16,832
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

309
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:19,835
I think only birds look well stuffed because...

310
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,380
Well, because they're kind of passive
to begin with.

311
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,842
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

312
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,304
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

313
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:34,391
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

314
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:37,019
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

315
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:39,855
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

316
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,024
A man should have a hobby.

317
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:46,612
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.

318
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,992
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

319
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,703
Is your time so empty?

320
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:55,913
No.

321
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:59,875
Well, I run the office

322
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,378
and tend the cabins and grounds

323
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:05,172
and do little errands for my mother.

324
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:08,592
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

325
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:11,303
Do you go out with friends?

326
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,184
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

327
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:23,399
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

328
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,612
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

329
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,492
I didn't mean to pry.

330
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:35,995
I'm looking for a private island.

331
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:39,748
What are you running away from?

332
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,336
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.

333
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,924
People never run away from anything.

334
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,264
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

335
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,058
I think that

336
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,771
we're all in our private traps,

337
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,817
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

338
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,405
We scratch and claw,

339
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:15,034
but only at the air, only at each other.

340
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:19,496
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

341
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,876
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

342
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:29,298
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.

343
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:32,051
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

344
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:34,345
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

345
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:41,518
You know, if anyone ever talked to me
the way I heard,

346
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,355
the way she spoke to you...

347
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:49,151
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

348
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:54,198
I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

349
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,700
Or at least defy her.

350
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,123
But I know I can't.

351
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,210
She's ill.

352
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,545
She sounded strong.

353
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:11,382
No, I mean ill.

354
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:17,304
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

355
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,975
I was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

356
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,519
I mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

357
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,729
He left her a little money.

358
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:30,067
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

359
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:33,904
And he talked her into building this motel.

360
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,323
He could have talked her into anything.

361
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:40,661
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

362
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,998
And the way he died...

363
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:50,671
I guess it's nothing to talk about
while you're eating.

364
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:55,217
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.

365
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,387
Except you.

366
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:02,933
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

367
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:05,769
Why don't you go away?

368
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:09,606
To a private island, like you?

369
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,612
No, not like me.

370
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:19,783
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

371
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:23,412
She'd be alone up there.

372
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,206
Her fire would go out.

373
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,460
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

374
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,796
If you love someone,

375
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:36,133
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

376
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,678
You understand, I don't hate her.

377
00:40:41,556 --> 00:40:43,599
I hate what she's become.

378
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:46,393
I hate the illness.

379
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,522
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

380
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,817
someplace...

381
00:40:57,113 --> 00:41:00,199
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

382
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,831
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

383
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:10,000
Put her in someplace.

384
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:14,546
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

385
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,883
What do you know about caring?

386
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:21,095
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

387
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,430
The laughing and the tears

388
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,975
and the cruel eyes studying you.

389
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,769
My mother there?

390
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,856
But she's harmless.

391
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:38,695
She's as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds.

392
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,198
I am sorry.

393
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,994
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.

394
00:41:47,664 --> 00:41:50,624
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

395
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,169
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

396
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:56,880
and suggest, oh, so very delicately.

397
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,890
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

398
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,019
But I hate to even think about it.

399
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:13,272
She needs me.

400
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:19,653
It's not as if she were

401
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,531
a maniac, a raving thing.

402
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,995
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

403
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,458
We all go a little mad sometimes.

404
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,588
Haven't you?

405
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:40,799
Yes.

406
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:44,803
Sometimes just one time can be enough.

407
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:47,931
Thank you.

408
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,101
Thank you, Norman.

409
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:52,436
Norman.

410
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,566
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

411
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,526
I'm very tired.

412
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:03,447
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

413
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:05,115
Really?

414
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:08,952
I stepped into a private trap back there

415
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:13,415
and I'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it

416
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,710
before it's too late for me, too.

417
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,588
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay just a little while longer?

418
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:21,590
Just for talk?

419
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,884
Oh, I'd like to, but...

420
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,219
All right.

421
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,931
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

422
00:43:29,015 --> 00:43:31,808
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

423
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,852
All right, Miss...

424
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:36,230
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

425
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,773
Good night.

426
00:47:50,396 --> 00:47:51,646
No!

427
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,317
No!

428
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,567
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

429
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:02,527
Blood! Blood!

430
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:34,956
I've tried many brands.

431
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:39,627
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.

432
01:00:39,712 --> 01:00:42,047
Let's see what they say about this one.

433
01:00:42,131 --> 01:00:44,424
They tell you what its ingredients are

434
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:48,595
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

435
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:51,723
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

436
01:00:51,807 --> 01:00:55,518
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

437
01:00:56,312 --> 01:01:01,483
I suppose, this one seems to claim more
and better qualities than lots of the others.

438
01:01:12,328 --> 01:01:13,495
Sam?

439
01:01:13,996 --> 01:01:16,498
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

440
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:25,256
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

441
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:28,384
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

442
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:31,513
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.

443
01:01:31,597 --> 01:01:33,348
Something wrong?

444
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,353
She left home on Friday.

445
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:42,107
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

446
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:44,067
Not even a phone call.

447
01:01:44,693 --> 01:01:47,779
Look, if you two are in this thing together,
I don't care, it's none of my business,

448
01:01:47,863 --> 01:01:49,948
but I want to talk to Marion
and I want her to tell me

449
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:51,616
it's none of my business
and then I'll go...

450
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,994
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will you?

451
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,040
- That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

452
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:06,756
Now, what thing could we be in together?

453
01:02:07,174 --> 01:02:09,092
Sorry about the tears.

454
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:12,554
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

455
01:02:12,972 --> 01:02:15,723
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?

456
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:21,354
Who are you, friend?

457
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,648
My name is Arbogast, friend.

458
01:02:23,732 --> 01:02:25,859
I'm a private investigator.

459
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:29,779
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

460
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,159
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

461
01:02:34,243 --> 01:02:36,452
What's your interest in this?

462
01:02:36,996 --> 01:02:39,497
Well, $40,000.

463
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,168
- $40,000?
- That's right.

464
01:02:46,922 --> 01:02:49,299
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

465
01:02:49,383 --> 01:02:51,593
- I can take just so much of this...
- Now, take it easy, friend.

466
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:56,264
Take it easy.
It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.

467
01:02:56,348 --> 01:02:58,725
What are you talking about?
What is this?

468
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:02,979
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss and she didn't.

469
01:03:03,355 --> 01:03:06,691
- And no one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

470
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:09,819
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

471
01:03:09,904 --> 01:03:12,655
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

472
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,700
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

473
01:03:15,784 --> 01:03:17,452
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

474
01:03:17,536 --> 01:03:20,288
Did you come up here on just a hunch
and nothing more?

475
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:22,582
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

476
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:26,252
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

477
01:03:26,629 --> 01:03:29,130
I don't care if you believe me or not.

478
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:32,550
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

479
01:03:32,635 --> 01:03:36,095
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

480
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,056
No, she was seen leaving town
in her own car,

481
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,433
by her employer, I might add.

482
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:43,144
I can't believe it. Can you?

483
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,357
Well, you know, we're always quickest
to doubt people

484
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:49,901
who have a reputation for being honest.

485
01:03:49,985 --> 01:03:52,278
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

486
01:03:52,363 --> 01:03:54,530
Where there's a boyfriend...

487
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,824
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

488
01:03:56,909 --> 01:03:59,661
but she's here, in this town somewhere.

489
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,622
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.

490
01:04:39,827 --> 01:04:41,703
- Evening.
- Evening.

491
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:43,538
I almost drove right past.

492
01:04:43,622 --> 01:04:46,666
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on,
but we do have a vacancy.

493
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,752
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?

494
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:51,379
No, thanks.

495
01:04:51,463 --> 01:04:54,507
Last two days, I've been to so many motels
my eyes are bleary with neon,

496
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:58,136
but, you know, this is the first place
that looks like it's hiding from the world.

497
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,097
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.

498
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:04,434
Just doesn't seem like any use
any more, you know.

499
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:08,313
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

500
01:05:08,397 --> 01:05:09,647
Well, wanna come in and register?

501
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:11,190
No, no, sit down.
I don't wanna trouble you.

502
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:14,485
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.

503
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,155
I always change the beds here once a week
whether they've been used or not.

504
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:19,657
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a...

505
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:22,493
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.

506
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,747
You out to buy a motel?

507
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,583
No.

508
01:05:29,084 --> 01:05:30,585
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many

509
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:33,838
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...

510
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:36,549
What... What was it you wanted to ask?

511
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,427
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.

512
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:42,764
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

513
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:44,682
I've been trying to trace a girl

514
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:48,519
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

515
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:51,147
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

516
01:05:51,231 --> 01:05:53,358
She's not in any trouble.

517
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,611
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

518
01:05:56,695 --> 01:05:58,821
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

519
01:05:58,906 --> 01:06:00,740
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

520
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:03,284
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

521
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:05,953
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

522
01:06:06,038 --> 01:06:08,373
Would you mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

523
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:09,707
Commit myself?

524
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:13,669
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

525
01:06:15,464 --> 01:06:17,173
- Sure?
- Yeah.

526
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:20,385
Well, she may have used an alias.

527
01:06:20,469 --> 01:06:21,928
Marion Crane's her real name,

528
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:25,264
but she could've registered
under a different one.

529
01:06:25,808 --> 01:06:29,852
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

530
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:32,605
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

531
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:35,066
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

532
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,402
but old habits die hard.

533
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:39,278
Which reminds me...

534
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,157
- What's that?
- It's the light. The sign.

535
01:06:43,617 --> 01:06:46,411
We had a couple last week,
said if the thing hadn't been on,

536
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,579
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

537
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:50,957
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

538
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,917
You said that nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

539
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:55,795
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

540
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,879
Yeah.

541
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:59,257
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

542
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:02,260
It's possible, this girl could've registered
under another name.

543
01:07:02,344 --> 01:07:03,970
Do you mind if I look at your book?

544
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:06,013
- No.
- Thank you.

545
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,268
All right.

546
01:07:10,352 --> 01:07:12,603
I'll get the date somewhere.

547
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,690
See, there's nobody.

548
01:07:15,774 --> 01:07:19,527
Let's see now, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

549
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:22,655
Oh, yes.

550
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:24,991
Here we are.

551
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:28,286
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.

552
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:31,747
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

553
01:07:31,832 --> 01:07:33,833
Marie, Marion.

554
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:36,586
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

555
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:40,590
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

556
01:07:42,134 --> 01:07:45,511
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...

557
01:07:45,596 --> 01:07:47,638
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

558
01:07:47,723 --> 01:07:49,599
You know, it's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

559
01:07:49,683 --> 01:07:51,434
Oh, I know, I know.

560
01:07:52,227 --> 01:07:53,811
Oh, yeah.

561
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:56,063
Well, it was raining

562
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:59,108
and her hair was all wet.

563
01:07:59,193 --> 01:08:01,903
I tell you, it's not really
a very good picture of her either.

564
01:08:01,987 --> 01:08:03,613
No, I guess not.

565
01:08:03,697 --> 01:08:05,198
Tell me all about her.

566
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:06,574
Well,

567
01:08:07,034 --> 01:08:11,287
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

568
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:13,998
and left early the next morning.

569
01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:17,210
- How early?
- Oh, very early.

570
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,505
Which morning was that?

571
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:21,839
The...

572
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,261
- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.

573
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:30,264
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

574
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:33,267
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

575
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:35,853
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

576
01:08:35,938 --> 01:08:37,271
Locally?

577
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,608
Did you spend the night with her?

578
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:42,109
No.

579
01:08:42,194 --> 01:08:45,988
Well then, how would you know
that she didn't make any phone calls?

580
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:51,661
Well, she was very tired and...

581
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:55,039
See, now I'm starting to remember.

582
01:08:55,123 --> 01:08:56,707
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.

583
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,668
You know, if you make
a mental picturisation of something...

584
01:08:58,752 --> 01:09:01,379
That's right. That's right.
Take your time.

585
01:09:01,463 --> 01:09:03,798
She was... She was sitting back there...

586
01:09:03,882 --> 01:09:06,801
No, no, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand

587
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:08,553
and she said she had to go to sleep early

588
01:09:08,637 --> 01:09:13,641
because she had a long drive ahead of her.

589
01:09:14,268 --> 01:09:16,227
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.

590
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:19,105
No, you said before that she was
sitting back there... Standing back there...

591
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,649
Yes, back in my parlour there.

592
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:23,859
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

593
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:29,365
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

594
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:31,617
I see. How did she pay you?

595
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:33,035
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

596
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,453
Cash, huh?

597
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:39,208
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?

598
01:09:39,293 --> 01:09:40,293
Yeah.

599
01:09:44,923 --> 01:09:48,009
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.

600
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,345
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.

601
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,431
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.

602
01:09:53,515 --> 01:09:57,643
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic,
and this ain't jelling.

603
01:09:57,728 --> 01:10:00,813
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

604
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:04,734
Well, I don't know
what you could expect me to know.

605
01:10:04,818 --> 01:10:06,277
People just come and go, you know.

606
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:09,989
- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.

607
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:14,994
If I wanted to check the cabins,
all 12 of them,

608
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:16,329
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

609
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:19,290
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on with me.
You can help me change beds.

610
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:21,959
- Okay?
- No, thanks.

611
01:10:39,728 --> 01:10:41,395
Change your mind?

612
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:48,736
You know, I... I think I must have
one of those faces you just can't help believing.

613
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,613
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

614
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:52,990
Oh? There's somebody sitting up in the window.

615
01:10:53,075 --> 01:10:55,451
- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

616
01:10:55,535 --> 01:10:57,495
Oh, that must be my mother.

617
01:10:57,579 --> 01:11:00,039
She's an invalid.

618
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:02,124
It's practically like living alone.

619
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:03,709
Oh, I see.

620
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,340
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

621
01:11:09,424 --> 01:11:11,759
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

622
01:11:11,843 --> 01:11:12,927
No.

623
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:18,683
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

624
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,643
You'd know that you were being used.

625
01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:22,019
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

626
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:23,688
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

627
01:11:23,772 --> 01:11:26,816
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

628
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,318
- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

629
01:11:29,403 --> 01:11:33,280
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

630
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,282
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

631
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:38,035
No. As I told you, she's confined.

632
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,370
Yes, but just for a few minutes.
That's all.

633
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:41,539
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

634
01:11:41,623 --> 01:11:43,958
You know, sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

635
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:47,712
- Mr Arbogast... I think I've...
- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

636
01:11:47,796 --> 01:11:50,631
- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...

637
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:53,008
I think it'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

638
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:55,845
Well, all right.

639
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:59,890
You sure would save me a lot of leg work
if you'd let me talk to her.

640
01:11:59,975 --> 01:12:01,392
- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.

641
01:12:03,437 --> 01:12:05,646
All right. Thanks anyway.

642
01:12:59,826 --> 01:13:02,912
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?

643
01:13:03,288 --> 01:13:05,456
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

644
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,250
Hello, Lila.

645
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:11,712
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

646
01:13:12,714 --> 01:13:15,424
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

647
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:17,301
It's right out here on the old highway.

648
01:13:17,385 --> 01:13:20,846
I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.

649
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:25,643
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

650
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:28,229
left the next day and that was it.

651
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:32,399
No, not exactly.

652
01:13:33,568 --> 01:13:37,988
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

653
01:13:38,073 --> 01:13:41,242
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.

654
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:45,287
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied...

655
01:13:45,372 --> 01:13:47,706
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

656
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:50,709
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.

657
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:54,046
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

658
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:58,259
Well, I was, but I think
I'll go back to the motel first.

659
01:13:59,261 --> 01:14:02,805
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

660
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:04,974
All right, fine. Listen, I...

661
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:07,518
You'll be happy to know what I think.

662
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:11,605
I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

663
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:16,485
Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.

664
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,611
All right, bye-bye.

665
01:15:14,294 --> 01:15:15,502
Bates?

666
01:17:51,524 --> 01:17:54,109
Sometimes Saturday night
has a lonely sound.

667
01:17:54,193 --> 01:17:56,278
Ever notice that, Lila?

668
01:17:57,697 --> 01:17:59,990
Sam, he said an hour or less.

669
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:01,866
Yeah.

670
01:18:03,986 --> 01:18:07,163
- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?

671
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:08,832
He'll be back.

672
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:11,710
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

673
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:20,468
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

674
01:18:20,553 --> 01:18:22,053
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.

675
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:23,805
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

676
01:18:23,889 --> 01:18:27,309
- That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
- Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.

677
01:18:27,393 --> 01:18:29,019
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...

678
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:31,021
An hour, or less.

679
01:18:35,735 --> 01:18:38,903
- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.

680
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:45,160
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

681
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:49,039
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

682
01:18:49,123 --> 01:18:51,291
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

683
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,209
Yeah. Stay here.

684
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:15,231
Arbogast?

685
01:19:16,609 --> 01:19:17,942
Arbogast!

686
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:22,697
Arbogast!

687
01:19:52,812 --> 01:19:55,230
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

688
01:19:55,314 --> 01:19:58,858
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

689
01:19:58,943 --> 01:20:01,903
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

690
01:20:01,987 --> 01:20:03,905
Where could he have gone?

691
01:20:03,989 --> 01:20:06,157
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.

692
01:20:06,283 --> 01:20:08,535
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

693
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:11,663
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

694
01:20:11,747 --> 01:20:15,458
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

695
01:20:16,085 --> 01:20:18,086
Yes, I think he would've.

696
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:20,296
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

697
01:20:20,381 --> 01:20:24,092
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- All right. Let me get my coat.

698
01:20:32,143 --> 01:20:33,601
Good evening.

699
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:38,148
Well, I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

700
01:20:38,232 --> 01:20:39,357
Yes.

701
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:43,361
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

702
01:20:43,446 --> 01:20:48,408
She's been here searching for her sister.
There's this private detective helping and...

703
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:50,535
Well, we got a call from this detective

704
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:52,996
saying that he'd traced her to that motel
out on the old highway.

705
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,039
That must be the Bates Motel.

706
01:20:55,124 --> 01:20:58,042
He traced her there and called us
to say he was going to question Mrs Bates.

707
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,711
Norman took a wife?

708
01:20:59,795 --> 01:21:03,131
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

709
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:06,634
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

710
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,221
Now, your sister's missing how long?

711
01:21:10,306 --> 01:21:13,475
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

712
01:21:13,559 --> 01:21:17,061
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

713
01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:19,314
They thought she'd be coming to me.

714
01:21:19,398 --> 01:21:21,733
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

715
01:21:21,817 --> 01:21:24,402
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

716
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:26,738
- That's right.
- From what?

717
01:21:29,742 --> 01:21:32,285
- She stole some money.
- A lot?

718
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:35,663
$40,000.

719
01:21:36,248 --> 01:21:37,832
And the police haven't been able to...

720
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:41,753
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

721
01:21:41,837 --> 01:21:44,297
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

722
01:21:44,381 --> 01:21:48,301
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

723
01:21:48,385 --> 01:21:50,845
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

724
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:54,724
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

725
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:56,518
With the $40,000?

726
01:21:57,228 --> 01:21:59,354
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

727
01:21:59,438 --> 01:22:01,856
It isn't important what he said
on the phone, is it?

728
01:22:01,941 --> 01:22:03,525
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

729
01:22:03,609 --> 01:22:05,693
after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

730
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:07,987
That's what I want you
to do something about.

731
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:09,572
Like what?

732
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:12,075
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

733
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,870
It's just that I'm sure there's something wrong
out there and I have to know what.

734
01:22:15,955 --> 01:22:19,415
Well, I think there's something wrong too,
miss, but not the same thing.

735
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,669
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

736
01:22:22,753 --> 01:22:26,714
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

737
01:22:26,799 --> 01:22:28,883
probably from Norman Bates,

738
01:22:28,968 --> 01:22:33,179
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

739
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:37,100
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

740
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,561
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

741
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:41,020
At this hour?

742
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:43,314
Well, he was out when I was there
just a while ago.

743
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:45,441
If he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

744
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:47,068
He wasn't out when you were there,

745
01:22:47,152 --> 01:22:50,488
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

746
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:52,824
This fellow lives like a hermit.

747
01:22:52,908 --> 01:22:56,035
You must remember that bad business out there
about 10 years ago.

748
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,745
Please. Call.

749
01:23:04,003 --> 01:23:08,172
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

750
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,848
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

751
01:23:18,517 --> 01:23:20,268
I've been just fine, thanks.

752
01:23:20,352 --> 01:23:22,520
Listen, we got worries here.

753
01:23:23,105 --> 01:23:26,524
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

754
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:29,986
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway.

755
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:33,031
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

756
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:34,699
Arbogast.

757
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:40,204
And after he left?

758
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,083
No, that's okay, Norman.

759
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:49,797
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

760
01:23:49,882 --> 01:23:52,759
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

761
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:56,763
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

762
01:23:56,847 --> 01:23:59,098
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

763
01:23:59,183 --> 01:24:03,061
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

764
01:24:03,145 --> 01:24:04,270
Yes.

765
01:24:04,897 --> 01:24:07,690
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried

766
01:24:07,775 --> 01:24:10,860
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

767
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:16,074
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

768
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:17,825
It ain't only local history, Sam.

769
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:21,704
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on Fairvale ledgers.

770
01:24:21,789 --> 01:24:26,250
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

771
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:28,586
when she found out he was married.

772
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:31,756
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

773
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,759
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

774
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:38,012
Norman found them dead together.

775
01:24:38,097 --> 01:24:39,305
In bed.

776
01:24:40,891 --> 01:24:43,935
You mean that old woman I saw sitting
in the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

777
01:24:44,019 --> 01:24:48,064
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

778
01:24:48,148 --> 01:24:50,608
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

779
01:24:50,693 --> 01:24:52,985
I called and pounded but she just ignored me!

780
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,822
You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

781
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:59,117
But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

782
01:24:59,743 --> 01:25:02,870
And the young man wouldn't let him see her
because she was too ill.

783
01:25:02,955 --> 01:25:05,832
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates,

784
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:10,461
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

785
01:25:53,839 --> 01:25:57,216
Now, Mother, I'm gonna bring something up...

786
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:00,136
I am sorry, boy,

787
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,890
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

788
01:26:03,974 --> 01:26:05,600
Please, Mother.

789
01:26:05,684 --> 01:26:08,603
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

790
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:12,148
You think I'm fruity, huh?

791
01:26:12,232 --> 01:26:14,317
I'm staying right here.

792
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:17,236
This is my room
and no one will drag me out of it,

793
01:26:17,362 --> 01:26:20,448
least of all my big, bold son.

794
01:26:20,532 --> 01:26:21,616
They'll come now, Mother.

795
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,620
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

796
01:26:25,704 --> 01:26:27,455
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.

797
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:29,957
Just for a few days
so they won't find you.

798
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:31,834
Just for a few days?

799
01:26:32,336 --> 01:26:35,588
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

800
01:26:36,215 --> 01:26:39,592
You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again, not ever again!

801
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:41,219
Now get out!

802
01:26:42,763 --> 01:26:46,224
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

803
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,519
Norman, what do you think you're doing?

804
01:26:49,603 --> 01:26:52,897
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

805
01:26:58,362 --> 01:27:01,531
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

806
01:27:09,915 --> 01:27:11,123
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

807
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,667
Good morning.

808
01:27:12,751 --> 01:27:15,044
We thought if you didn't mind,
we'd drive out to that motel with you.

809
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:17,421
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

810
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:20,007
- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?

811
01:27:20,092 --> 01:27:23,052
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

812
01:27:23,887 --> 01:27:26,264
Well, what did he say about my sister?

813
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:29,517
Just what he told your detective,
she used a fake name.

814
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,852
Saw the register myself.

815
01:27:30,936 --> 01:27:33,855
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

816
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:36,941
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

817
01:27:37,025 --> 01:27:39,902
I know you're not the seeing-illusions type,

818
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:42,488
but no woman was there
and I don't believe in ghosts,

819
01:27:42,573 --> 01:27:44,407
- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

820
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:48,119
Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.

821
01:27:48,203 --> 01:27:49,912
You want to come around
to my office this afternoon

822
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:53,082
and report a missing person and a theft,
that's what you want to do.

823
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,209
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

824
01:27:55,294 --> 01:27:59,130
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

825
01:27:59,214 --> 01:28:00,798
How about that?

826
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,759
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

827
01:28:04,511 --> 01:28:07,013
Come on over to the house
and do your reporting around dinnertime.

828
01:28:07,097 --> 01:28:08,890
It'll make it nicer.

829
01:28:09,474 --> 01:28:11,809
- You too, Sam.
- Thank you.

830
01:28:14,187 --> 01:28:18,024
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

831
01:28:19,151 --> 01:28:20,902
Well, you want me to drop you
at the hotel or...

832
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:22,028
Sam.

833
01:28:22,112 --> 01:28:25,448
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

834
01:28:26,658 --> 01:28:28,743
Neither will I. Come on.

835
01:28:29,995 --> 01:28:34,206
We better decide what we're gonna say or do
when we walk in there.

836
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,584
We're going to register as man and wife.

837
01:28:36,668 --> 01:28:39,253
We're going to get shown to a cabin,

838
01:28:39,755 --> 01:28:43,674
and then we're going to search
every inch of the place, inside and out.

839
01:29:07,574 --> 01:29:09,367
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

840
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:11,953
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

841
01:29:12,037 --> 01:29:13,329
Come on.

842
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:18,584
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

843
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:21,212
Suppose you want a room.

844
01:29:21,296 --> 01:29:23,047
We were gonna try to make it
straight to San Francisco,

845
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:25,257
but we don't like the look of that sky.

846
01:29:25,342 --> 01:29:28,511
- Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
- Okay.

847
01:29:35,352 --> 01:29:37,895
- I'll take you to Cabin 10.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

848
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,855
No. That's not necessary.

849
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:43,985
My boss is paying for this trip and,
well, it's 90% business.

850
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:46,821
He wants practically notarised receipts.

851
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:49,532
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

852
01:30:07,259 --> 01:30:08,634
Thank you.

853
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:14,932
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

854
01:30:17,436 --> 01:30:20,604
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

855
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:22,648
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

856
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,775
and you have to pay in advance.

857
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,110
$10.

858
01:30:33,618 --> 01:30:35,161
That receipt.

859
01:30:41,126 --> 01:30:42,835
I'll go on ahead.

860
01:30:48,467 --> 01:30:51,552
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

861
01:30:51,636 --> 01:30:54,346
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

862
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:14,742
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

863
01:31:14,826 --> 01:31:18,329
no matter what we're afraid of finding
or how much it may hurt.

864
01:31:18,413 --> 01:31:19,663
I know.

865
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:21,957
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?

866
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,542
I don't know.

867
01:31:23,877 --> 01:31:26,378
But if you had a useless business
like this motel,

868
01:31:26,463 --> 01:31:27,630
what would you need to get out?

869
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:29,757
To get a new business somewhere else?

870
01:31:29,841 --> 01:31:31,217
$40,000?

871
01:31:33,929 --> 01:31:36,055
How could we prove that...

872
01:31:36,139 --> 01:31:38,724
Well, if he opens a motel
on the new highway in, say, a year...

873
01:31:38,809 --> 01:31:41,310
There must be some proof that exists now,

874
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:44,939
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

875
01:31:45,023 --> 01:31:49,193
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

876
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:53,197
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

877
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:55,991
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

878
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:57,409
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

879
01:31:57,494 --> 01:32:00,204
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

880
01:32:00,288 --> 01:32:04,125
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

881
01:32:06,336 --> 01:32:08,504
We'll start with Cabin One.

882
01:32:10,882 --> 01:32:13,884
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.

883
01:32:45,876 --> 01:32:47,084
Bates.

884
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:39,762
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!

885
01:33:39,846 --> 01:33:40,971
- Look!
- What is it?

886
01:33:41,056 --> 01:33:43,390
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.

887
01:33:43,475 --> 01:33:47,311
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

888
01:33:47,395 --> 01:33:48,604
That proves Marion was here.

889
01:33:48,688 --> 01:33:51,982
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.

890
01:33:53,109 --> 01:33:55,069
Well, doesn't that prove
that he found out about the money?

891
01:33:55,153 --> 01:33:56,862
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

892
01:33:56,947 --> 01:33:57,947
No.

893
01:33:58,031 --> 01:34:01,533
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

894
01:34:01,618 --> 01:34:04,286
I want her to tell us the same thing.

895
01:34:04,746 --> 01:34:07,414
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

896
01:34:07,499 --> 01:34:09,416
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

897
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:12,211
One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

898
01:34:12,295 --> 01:34:15,339
You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.

899
01:34:15,423 --> 01:34:20,344
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.

900
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:24,014
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

901
01:34:24,557 --> 01:34:26,100
Wait a minute.

902
01:34:26,685 --> 01:34:29,311
If you get anything out of the mother,

903
01:34:30,021 --> 01:34:32,189
can you find your way back to town?

904
01:34:32,274 --> 01:34:33,857
Yes, of course.

905
01:34:34,609 --> 01:34:37,820
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

906
01:35:00,885 --> 01:35:03,929
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

907
01:35:04,014 --> 01:35:05,639
Wife's taking a nap

908
01:35:05,724 --> 01:35:09,643
and I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.

909
01:35:09,728 --> 01:35:13,105
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

910
01:36:27,806 --> 01:36:30,391
I've been doing all the talking so far,
haven't I?

911
01:36:30,475 --> 01:36:32,559
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time

912
01:36:32,644 --> 01:36:34,895
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

913
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:37,147
Here you are doing all the listening.

914
01:36:37,232 --> 01:36:38,566
You are alone here, aren't you?

915
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:41,235
Drive me crazy.

916
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,280
I think that would be
a rather extreme reaction, don't you?

917
01:36:45,365 --> 01:36:46,907
Just an expression.

918
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:50,494
What I meant was I'd do
just about anything to get away.

919
01:36:50,578 --> 01:36:52,329
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

920
01:36:58,503 --> 01:36:59,878
Mrs Bates?

921
01:38:16,873 --> 01:38:19,249
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here,

922
01:38:19,334 --> 01:38:21,210
I'm just doubting that you are.

923
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:24,963
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under,
you'd unload this place.

924
01:38:25,048 --> 01:38:28,383
This place?
This place happens to be my only world.

925
01:38:29,427 --> 01:38:32,804
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.

926
01:38:32,889 --> 01:38:34,515
My mother and I were more than happy.

927
01:39:36,494 --> 01:39:38,912
You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?

928
01:39:38,997 --> 01:39:40,497
I don't know what you've been saying.

929
01:39:40,582 --> 01:39:44,042
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

930
01:39:44,127 --> 01:39:46,211
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

931
01:39:46,296 --> 01:39:49,214
Buy a new one in a new town
where you won't have to hide your mother.

932
01:39:49,299 --> 01:39:52,050
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

933
01:39:52,135 --> 01:39:54,094
Where will you get the money
to do that, Bates?

934
01:39:54,178 --> 01:39:56,096
Or do you already have it socked away?

935
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:59,016
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. $40,000.

936
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:06,273
I bet your mother knows where the money is
and what you did to get it.

937
01:40:06,357 --> 01:40:08,358
I think she'll tell us.

938
01:40:10,194 --> 01:40:13,697
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

939
01:41:18,596 --> 01:41:20,180
Mrs Bates...

940
01:41:40,326 --> 01:41:42,035
I'm Norma Bates!

941
01:42:13,192 --> 01:42:16,486
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

942
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:19,239
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

943
01:42:19,323 --> 01:42:21,616
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

944
01:42:22,618 --> 01:42:24,494
Did he talk to you?

945
01:42:25,329 --> 01:42:26,496
No.

946
01:42:28,332 --> 01:42:33,628
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

947
01:42:34,839 --> 01:42:37,340
Norman Bates no longer exists.

948
01:42:38,301 --> 01:42:40,969
He only half-existed to begin with.

949
01:42:41,053 --> 01:42:43,972
And now the other half has taken over,

950
01:42:45,475 --> 01:42:47,559
probably for all time.

951
01:42:49,687 --> 01:42:51,480
Did he kill my sister?

952
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:54,608
Yes. And no.

953
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:58,278
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork

954
01:42:58,362 --> 01:43:00,614
for some sort of plea,
this fellow would like to cop...

955
01:43:00,698 --> 01:43:03,575
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

956
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:05,994
He merely tries to explain it.

957
01:43:06,579 --> 01:43:08,830
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

958
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,752
Yes, I'm sorry.

959
01:43:14,837 --> 01:43:16,546
The private investigator, too.

960
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:21,176
If you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

961
01:43:24,722 --> 01:43:27,808
Have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

962
01:43:27,892 --> 01:43:30,519
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

963
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:34,564
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.

964
01:43:37,068 --> 01:43:40,821
Now, to understand it the way I understood it,
hearing it from the mother,

965
01:43:41,405 --> 01:43:44,658
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

966
01:43:45,243 --> 01:43:47,661
you have to go back 10 years

967
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,498
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

968
01:43:51,582 --> 01:43:56,461
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

969
01:43:57,505 --> 01:44:01,132
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

970
01:44:02,635 --> 01:44:07,347
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

971
01:44:07,765 --> 01:44:09,558
Then she met a man,

972
01:44:10,059 --> 01:44:13,895
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

973
01:44:14,647 --> 01:44:18,358
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

974
01:44:18,943 --> 01:44:22,696
Matricide is probably
the most unbearable crime of all,

975
01:44:24,156 --> 01:44:27,117
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

976
01:44:28,119 --> 01:44:32,914
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

977
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,752
He stole her corpse.

978
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:42,632
A weighted coffin was buried.

979
01:44:43,384 --> 01:44:45,969
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

980
01:44:46,429 --> 01:44:49,306
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

981
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:51,600
And that still wasn't enough.

982
01:44:52,393 --> 01:44:56,021
She was there, but she was a corpse.

983
01:44:58,566 --> 01:45:01,359
So he began to think and speak for her,

984
01:45:01,444 --> 01:45:03,987
give her half his life, so to speak.

985
01:45:04,614 --> 01:45:08,658
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

986
01:45:09,744 --> 01:45:13,246
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

987
01:45:13,706 --> 01:45:18,501
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

988
01:45:19,921 --> 01:45:23,298
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

989
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:26,217
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

990
01:45:26,302 --> 01:45:30,847
Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction
to any other woman,

991
01:45:31,849 --> 01:45:34,601
the mother side of him would go wild.

992
01:45:37,897 --> 01:45:39,940
When he met your sister,

993
01:45:41,317 --> 01:45:43,610
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

994
01:45:43,694 --> 01:45:45,195
He wanted her.

995
01:45:47,365 --> 01:45:51,493
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

996
01:45:53,037 --> 01:45:56,748
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

997
01:45:57,333 --> 01:46:01,252
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

998
01:46:01,337 --> 01:46:03,964
he was convinced his mother had committed!

999
01:46:04,048 --> 01:46:06,383
Why was he dressed like that?

1000
01:46:06,842 --> 01:46:08,718
He's a transvestite.

1001
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,221
Not exactly.

1002
01:46:11,847 --> 01:46:15,266
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1003
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:17,811
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1004
01:46:17,895 --> 01:46:22,399
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

1005
01:46:22,483 --> 01:46:25,986
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1006
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:29,823
And when reality came too close,

1007
01:46:29,907 --> 01:46:33,451
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1008
01:46:35,788 --> 01:46:38,915
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

1009
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,128
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1010
01:46:43,212 --> 01:46:45,422
He tried to be his mother.

1011
01:46:47,341 --> 01:46:50,010
And now he is.

1012
01:46:51,929 --> 01:46:55,181
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.

1013
01:46:55,266 --> 01:46:58,518
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1014
01:46:59,103 --> 01:47:01,771
there's always a conflict, a battle.

1015
01:47:02,732 --> 01:47:05,525
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

1016
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,778
and the dominant personality has won.

1017
01:47:08,863 --> 01:47:11,656
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1018
01:47:12,825 --> 01:47:16,494
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1019
01:47:18,748 --> 01:47:22,459
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

1020
01:47:22,543 --> 01:47:24,502
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

1021
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:38,266
Thank you.

1022
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:49,152
<i>It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words</i>

1023
01:47:49,236 --> 01:47:51,237
<i>that condemn her own son,</i>

1024
01:47:51,322 --> 01:47:55,158
<i>but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.</i>

1025
01:47:55,242 --> 01:47:59,079
<i>They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.</i>

1026
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:01,915
<i>He was always bad,</i>

1027
01:48:01,999 --> 01:48:07,045
<i>and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,</i>

1028
01:48:07,129 --> 01:48:10,840
<i>as if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,</i>

1029
01:48:10,925 --> 01:48:13,343
<i>like one of his stuffed birds.</i>

1030
01:48:14,095 --> 01:48:17,597
<i>They know I can't even move a finger,
and I won't.</i>

1031
01:48:17,681 --> 01:48:23,311
<i>I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.</i>

1032
01:48:26,315 --> 01:48:29,567
<i>They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.</i>

1033
01:48:30,152 --> 01:48:32,987
<i>Let them see what kind of a person I am.</i>

1034
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:36,616
<i>I'm not even gonna swat that fly.</i>

1035
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:39,452
<i>I hope they are watching. They'll see.</i>

1036
01:48:39,954 --> 01:48:41,621
<i>They'll see and they'll know,</i>

1037
01:48:41,705 --> 01:48:46,209
<i>and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."</i>
