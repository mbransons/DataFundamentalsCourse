1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:40,721
You saw the fight last night?
I was reading about it. Says it was great.

3
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,716
- It was rotten.
- What was the matter with it?

4
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:46,718
I expected a fight to the finish. But in
the 77th round the guy got yellow and quit.

5
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,841
That certainly is a bird of a picture.

6
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,995
So help me,
I never saw a woman more beautiful.

7
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:52,279
It's just come this morning.

8
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,437
Gus didn't wait for his breakfast
before he had it stuck up there.

9
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,198
A guy don't need any breakfast
when he can look at her.

10
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,923
She is beautiful.

11
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,314
<i>I wish she'd take a shine to me.</i>

12
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,395
You better not let Gus Jordan
hear you say that...

13
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,476
or you'll be picking lead out of your pants.

14
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,796
When did that crawl in here?

15
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,479
Hit him on the back
before he chokes to death.

16
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:21,758
This ought to learn you
that free lunch is meant to be ate.

17
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,324
And not stored for the winter.

18
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,844
Hello, where've you been?

19
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,439
Ain't seen you
since Sweeney Carson croaked your girl.

20
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:31,562
Been away on important business.
I'll be around a lot from now on.

21
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,636
- How are you, boys?
- Fine.

22
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:36,114
Hi, boys, drinks are on me.

23
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,239
- Been waiting long?
- About 15 minutes.

24
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,078
- When did the painting go up there?
- This morning.

25
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,439
I think I got the dope
on how to get Jordan this time...

26
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:47,594
and get him right.

27
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,880
Gus seems to be sitting as tight as ever, Dan.

28
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,114
Don't you believe it.

29
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:54,959
Just because he's running for sheriff
and stands in good with the higher-ups...

30
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,115
don't mean he can't be showed up.

31
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:01,761
Pretty soon, I'll be standing in his shoes
as boss of this here district. And then...

32
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,996
And you figure she goes
along with that honour, Dan?

33
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,753
I always thought you were warm for her.

34
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:11,155
Yes, I got to admit it.
This is my first big chance.

35
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:15,918
Jordan's playing a crooked game.
So far he's kept under cover.

36
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,315
But once I get hold of something I can take
to the district attorney...

37
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,600
Gus'll be out and I'll be in.

38
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,961
Then it'll all be over but the celebrating.

39
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,400
She ain't no easy gal to handle, Flynn.

40
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,283
I know that. She's a pretty slick article.

41
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:32,482
When Chick was sent up the river,
she blowed into Jordan's arms...

42
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,760
just for protection,
and he's too blind to see it.

43
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,439
Sure, he's all puffed up over himself.

44
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:41,074
Do you believe it?
He actually thinks she's in love with him.

45
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,635
Ever since I sang that song,
it's been haunting me.

46
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,841
It should haunt you. You murdered it.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,922

48
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:54,403
- You play that like it'll hurt you.
- It does.

49
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:57,035
No, I'm moody that way, see.

50
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,279
Say, boss, I got a brand new tune, just out.

51
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,684
Yeah? What is it?

52
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,801
It's called <i>After The Ball Is Over.</i>

53
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,364
Play it.

54
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,834

55
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:17,444
Kelly, that'll be a great song for Lou.
She's getting famous.

56
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,562
Tony Pastor himself offered to sign her up
for his music hall.

57
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,239
You don't mean Tony Pastor
way uptown on 14th Street?

58
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,474
Yes, that's the one.

59
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,033
Pastor says that Lou's got it
all over Della Fox.

60
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,283
Hello, Mrs. Meg.

61
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:37,834
- Mrs. Flaherty, I'm disappointed in you.
- Disappointed in me?

62
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,598
Just because I come here with me little can.

63
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:43,563
Sure, a pint of beer will hurt nobody no time.

64
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,955
It's not only that. I'm disappointed
at not seeing you at the mission.

65
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,479
- At the mission?
- See here, Cummings.

66
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,561
What is it, Jordan?

67
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,675
I thought you'd given up the idea
of trying to reform my place.

68
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,596
- No, I'm still hopeful.
- Hopeful?

69
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:00,563
I'm not going to have you people
interfering in my business.

70
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:04,524
Before you started that mission next door,
we never had any trouble around here.

71
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,402
I've heard differently.

72
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:10,239
But if what you say is true,
I'd only be too glad to be mistaken.

73
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,475
Now, see here, Cummings,
I'm telling you again.

74
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,635
I'm not going to have my customers
driven away.

75
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,285
Why, I wouldn't think
of doing such a thing, Jordan.

76
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,083
- Hey, Jordan.
- Yeah.

77
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,154

78
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:28,680
- How are you, Gus?

79
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:30,840
- Hello, Flynn.

80
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,324
- How are you?
- Great.

81
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,157
- Have a drink?
- Sure.

82
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,236
- Set up over there.
- Right, boss.

83
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:39,362
Haven't seen you here for more
than a month. Where have you been?

84
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,515
Here, there, and everywhere.

85
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,598
City's getting so big,
it takes time to get around it.

86
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:48,200
One of these days, we'll be walking
across a bridge to Long Island City.

87
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:52,198
Walking? We'll be riding over
in one of them horseless buggies.

88
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:55,482
I'm thinking of buying one of them
for me and Lou.

89
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:59,002
- By the way, Gus, how is she?
- She's in demand, I tell you, Flynn.

90
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,155
The Bowery Savings Bank
and Rupert's Brewery...

91
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,760
are fighting to use her pictures exclusive
on their New Year's calendars.

92
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:07,154
She sure is a handsome girl, Gus.

93
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:11,397
I wonder you don't get jealous,
all the men are so crazy about her.

94
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:15,154
I do get kind of mad at the attention
some of them show her.

95
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:18,874
But it ain't bad,
having a girl that all the men are after.

96
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:21,399
Shows I must be pretty good, eh, Flynn?

97
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,043
Take a look at that.

98
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,923
Just bought it for her. Ain't that a pip?

99
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,357
Big as a nickel.

100
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,519
What would you do if somebody tried
to take her away from you?

101
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,437
Probably, nothing...

102
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:41,639
to her.

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,514

104
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,518
Say, the flies here are terrible.

105
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:53,518
You pick out the ones you don't like
and I'll kill them for you.

106
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,881
- Someone wants to talk to you in the office.
- All right, Spider.

107
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,603
- Excuse me, Dan.
- Sure.

108
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,961
Lou is the swellest girl
that ever came down the Bowery.

109
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:10,242
You fellas don't know nothing about Lou.
But I do.

110
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:13,599
<i>Just before the battle, Mother</i>

111
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,880
- When did you get in, Rita?
- Two days ago.

112
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,923
But I did not come here direct,
you understand.

113
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:22,474
Good girl, Rita. Take no chances.

114
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,033
We are very discreet, Serge and me.

115
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:29,638
Gus, you must like Serge.
He's been a most valuable assistant.

116
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,680
- Sure you can trust him?
- You know Rita.

117
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,517
We've got to be especially careful.

118
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,881
I can't take chances of having headquarters
watching around this way.

119
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:41,196
- They will find nothing.
- No, not if we stay awake.

120
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,958
But don't forget. No talking to anyone.

121
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:45,963
Rita never talks.

122
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:48,764
- But are you sure about Lou?
- She doesn't know a thing.

123
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,837
Say, she's out of this. Understand? Out of it.

124
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,475
Of course, Gus, if you say so.

125
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:58,121
Serge, we were talking
about Gus' friend, Lou.

126
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:00,356
Yes, I have heard of her.

127
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,841
She's very beautiful, yes?

128
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,841
More beautiful than these?

129
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,798
She makes them look
like a bunch of dishwashers.

130
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,274

131
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:49,834
Hello, Mickey.

132
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:52,803
Lady Lou, you're a fine girl, a fine woman.

133
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,797
One of the finest women
ever walked the streets.

134
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,638
- How are the girls today?
- Just fine, Miss Lou.

135
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:09,755
- Hello, Rita.
- Why, Lou, I'm so very happy to see you.

136
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,483
- Glad to see you back.
- Yes.

137
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,715
Lou, this is Serge Stanieff.

138
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,923
Pleased to meet you.

139
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:19,480
Take a look at this, Gus,
and learn something.

140
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,601
I am delighted.
I have heard so much about you.

141
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah, but you can't prove it.

142
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,081
Serge is my new assistant, Lou.

143
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:29,680
Day or night work, Rita?
He should be a big help.

144
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,600
- You got the pictures, Lou?
- Yeah, I had them taken with all my rocks.

145
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:37,199
Wait till you take a look at these.

146
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:40,357
- I kind of like that one.
- Yes, this one is beautiful.

147
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:43,755
- And this gives me a lot of style and dignity.
- Sure is a pip, Lou.

148
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:45,164
Wait till you see this.

149
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:49,796
For the bedroom. A little bit spicy,
but not too raw, you know what I mean?

150
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,714
- Want to see the pictures?
- Yes, I would like very much to see them.

151
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,435
Don't be backward. I'm not.

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,477
They're wonderful. But I like best
that marvellous painting of you in the bar.

153
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah, I got to admit that is a flash,
but I do wish Gus hadn't hung it up...

154
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:08,758
over the free lunch.

155
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,676
Mike, you sure took long enough.
What've you been doing up there?

156
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,598
I was looking at all the beautiful things.
Looks like heaven.

157
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,721
That's why you gotta climb stairs
to get there.

158
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,363
- Is that all, Miss Lou?
- You can go.

159
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,514
Thank you.

160
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,960
Mike and his horses
are as famous as this dance hall.

161
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,081
The only difference, the horses are sober.

162
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,360
Yeah, you're sure a pip, Lou.

163
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,879
I suppose I'll be seeing you around, Rita?

164
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,478
Oh, yes.

165
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,836
And you Mr...

166
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,119

167
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,754
Come, Rita, let's get this business over with.

168
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:00,394
- Spider, see that I'm not disturbed
by anyone. Come, Rita.

169
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,077
All right, boss.

170
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,564
Serge, come.

171
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,203
Pearl?

172
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,435
- Here I come.
- Come on, honey.

173
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,716

174
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,962
- I just loves to work for you, Miss Lou.
- Yeah?

175
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,555
You buy such pretty things.
And all them diamonds.

176
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,318
- You're so rich.
- Yes. I wasn't always rich.

177
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:26,394
No?

178
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,761
There was a time I didn't know
where my next husband was coming from.

179
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:33,121
Yeah, but I means is you ain't never been
in the circumstances...

180
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,036
where the wolf came to your door.

181
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,274
The wolf at my door?

182
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:40,153
Why, I remember when he came
right into my room and had pups.

183
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,762
- Well?
- A pint, Kelly.

184
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,761
- Did you fix it like I told you, Mrs. Cassidy?
- No.

185
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:53,400
Always take a bit of butter
and rub it at the bottom of the can.

186
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:56,158
- That kills the suds.
- Is that so?

187
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,321
<i>I never thought of that at all.</i>

188
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,680
- Why didn't you
tell me that before?

189
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,198
- I don't know.

190
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,434

191
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,244
Spider?

192
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:31,317
- Yeah, what's the matter?
- Look at that.

193
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,441
I got it. Get out of the way.

194
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,719
- Get out of the way.
Give her some air, will you?

195
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,313
What's the trouble?

196
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:43,795
This girl tried to croak herself,
but they stopped her before she could.

197
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:47,241
All right, Spider, bring her up.
Bill, fix up something for her.

198
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,519
Right away, Lou.

199
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:52,518
Think of trying to bump herself off in here,
of all places.

200
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,835
She come to the right place, all right.

201
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:58,998
- What do I do with the kid, Lou?
- Put her right over here, Spider.

202
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,480
- Where's Gus?

203
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,921
He's down in his office. He left word
not to be disturbed for anything.

204
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:06,803
Thanks. You go downstairs
and shut that crowd up, will you?

205
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,434
You can go, Spider. I'll look after her.
Poor kid looks like she is all in.

206
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,959
She must have been up against it
to want to croak herself.

207
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,637
Come on, take this. Here.

208
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,600
Come on. This will fix you up.

209
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:33,044
- What's the matter? Committed murder?
- No, not that. I never will.

210
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,515
Then you have nothing to worry about.
At least the guy is alive.

211
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,323
How did you know there was a man?

212
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:41,442
There always is.
It takes two to get one in trouble.

213
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,322
You know everything about me.

214
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:47,284
I wouldn't say that, but I am observant.
Come on, move over here.

215
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:49,958
Sit down there.

216
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:55,162
What was he? Married?

217
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,964
Yes, but I didn't know.

218
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,605
Makes no difference to me
whether you did or not.

219
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:04,041
Men's all alike, married or single.
It's their game.

220
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:07,356
I happen to be smart enough
to play it their way.

221
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:09,237
You'll come to it.

222
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:11,640
Where've you been?

223
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,114
Just when I need you most of all,
you ain't around.

224
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,036
I ain't been no place, Miss Lou.

225
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,355
You ain't been no place,
you've just been lost.

226
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,039
Get my little friend here fixed up
with some new clothes.

227
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,002
Get these rags off her.

228
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:25,600
- What's your name, dear?
- Sally.

229
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:28,074
- Sally, what?
- Sally Glynn.

230
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:33,320
Always remember to smile.
You'll never have anything to worry about.

231
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,398
Forget about this guy.
See that you get a good one the next time.

232
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:39,283
Who'd want me after what I've done?

233
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:42,721
Listen, when women go wrong,
men go right after them.

234
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,041
You want to put more petticoats on her?

235
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,763
No, she's got enough on.

236
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:52,043
Wouldn't need any of them if they didn't stuff
this furniture with horsehair.

237
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,439
If you was to go out
and something were to happen...

238
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:58,756
I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me
without no petticoat.

239
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,439
No policeman? How about a nice fireman?

240
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,043
That's the spirit, sister.

241
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,639
- Lou, I'm just bringing the folks in.
- All right.

242
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,795
Such a gorgeous place, Gus.

243
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:11,479
I didn't think such a room existed
in this house.

244
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,954
Everything here imported special from Paris.

245
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,637
- Hello, Rita.
- Hello, Lou.

246
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,193
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

247
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,874
- You're here, too? How nice.
- Lou?

248
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,403
What's become of the girl
who caused the excitement downstairs?

249
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,045
She's inside. Pearl's fixing her up.
She'll be all right.

250
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,401
You gotta do something about people
using your joint for a morgue.

251
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,761
- What about this poor creature, Lou?
- Some guy done her wrong.

252
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:37,076
The story's so old
it should have been set to music long ago.

253
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,520
I would like to see this girl, Lou.

254
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:42,165
I think, perhaps,
I could do something for her.

255
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:44,475
That'll be great. I'll send her in.

256
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:47,921
- You look after her, Gus. I gotta dress.
- All right.

257
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:53,360
- I think she would be very useful to us.
- Don't mention it.

258
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:59,241
How charming. How lovely.

259
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,475
Come, sit over here with us.

260
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,641
What a sweet, innocent face.

261
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,920
Can't you do something for her, Rita?

262
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,605
Can you sing and dance, perhaps?

263
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:17,921
Not very well, I'm afraid.

264
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:22,238
- But you'd be willing to learn?
- Yes, I guess so.

265
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:27,363
Then, I think I can find you
a very nice position.

266
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,481
Have you heard, perhaps,
of the Barbary Coast?

267
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:35,998
No, I don't think so.
But it wouldn't make any difference.

268
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:39,604
Your people? Your parents?

269
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,404
I don't want them to know
anything about me.

270
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:44,760
I don't want them to know where I am.

271
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,803
You just leave everything to your friend, Rita.

272
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:52,402
There you are. Come with us now, little girl.
We'll take good care of you.

273
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,004
Thank you so much.

274
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,804
Lou, we're going to help this little girl.

275
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:58,876
All right, Gus. She's a nice kid.

276
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:02,435
- Are you busy?
- Yeah, I'm a little late getting dressed.

277
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,560
Come, Serge.

278
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,601
- See you later.
- All right, Lou.

279
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,560
Come up again, any time.

280
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:12,554
I shall. Then I hope you will be alone.

281
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:13,873
So do I.

282
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,796
Warm, dark, and handsome.

283
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:25,079
- Your bath is ready, Miss Lou.
- You take it. I'm indisposed.

284
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,524
Serge, come.

285
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,875
All right, Spider, just a minute. Here you are.

286
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,160
You go with Rita,
she'll take good care of you.

287
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:42,204
Sally, you come with me, dear.
I will take very good care of you.

288
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,639
Pearl.

289
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,879
- Pearl?
- I is coming.

290
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,525
Yeah, you is coming,
your head is bending low.

291
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,675
Now, get here before winter.

292
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,074
- Here I is.
- Here you is.

293
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,282
Eight Ball, what're you doing?
Working for me or sleeping for me?

294
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:08,721
I ain't sleeping so much that I don't see
what's going on around here.

295
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,079
What've you been seeing?

296
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,315
That fellow from the mission.

297
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,355
Mr... What's his name?

298
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,164
Y'all know what's his name, Miss Lou.

299
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,443
I'm surprised at you, with all
your experience, casting eyes on a preacher.

300
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,483
Now, Pearl, you know I've never been
interested in a man's job.

301
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,396
Besides, he ain't a preacher.

302
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:31,194
Anyhow, he ain't like the other men
you done made history of.

303
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,845
No, that's what makes him
kind of interesting.

304
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:37,884
Wouldn't hurt me any to have a new kind
of man added to my record, would it?

305
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:38,954
Goodness me, Miss Lou.

306
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:41,321
You ain't thinking of reforming, is you?

307
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:44,203
You know,
preachers don't give away no diamonds.

308
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,322
I told you he ain't a preacher,
he just runs the mission next door.

309
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,441
I hear he ain't gonna run that long.

310
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,834
I hear they're gonna take the mission
away from him.

311
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,995
Fella named Jacobson
that owns the building...

312
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:55,803
I hear they can't pay the rent.

313
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,603
Seems to me you've been hearing things.

314
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:58,674

315
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,642
- Who's that?
- Spider Kane.

316
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,477
In a minute, Spider.

317
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:06,203
- Miss Lou'll be here in a minute.
- Thanks, Pearl.

318
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,321
Come in, Spider, sit down.

319
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,723
What's on your mind?

320
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,001
I want to talk to you about something.

321
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:16,282
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- Not exactly, Lou.

322
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,955
Well, yeah, maybe in a way, it is.

323
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:22,754
Spill it. I ain't afraid. My conscience is clear.

324
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,403
Leastwise, I think it is.

325
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,716
What I've got to say
is about Chick Clark.

326
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:29,884
Chick Clark?

327
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:32,604
I'm wondering if you ain't sort of forgetting
about him.

328
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:36,234
I've gotta admit it's been a long time
since I've seen Chick...

329
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:38,839
but I ain't never completely forgot about him.

330
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:41,917
- He's been in a year now, Lou.
- Yeah, I know.

331
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:45,754
You know how he took his rap, quiet like.
Same as we all would.

332
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:49,475
It was tough he got caught,
but it wasn't my fault.

333
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:53,203
I ain't the sentimental kind, Spider.

334
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,278
Sure, but remember,
you said you'd be, well...

335
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:59,515
waiting around for him whenever he gets out.

336
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,563
Gets out? That's gonna be a long time.

337
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,795
What I want to say is...

338
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:08,321
supposing he found out
you ain't exactly been waiting.

339
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,955
I gotta do something while I'm waiting,
don't I?

340
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:14,799
Chick wouldn't figure it that way.
Suppose he found out about Jordan?

341
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:18,436
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Go up and see him, Lou.

342
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:21,279
What for? And antagonise Gus?

343
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,915
If I start going up there,
Gus'll think I'm still caring for Chick.

344
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,600
Not that I don't like him a lot.
I ain't got no complaint.

345
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:32,321
- Chick was a good man. In his way.
- He's in love with you, Lou.

346
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:36,034
And being in the clink a year without the girl
what makes you feel that way...

347
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,683
ain't no picnic.

348
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,243
I wish he'd forget me,
but the guy is a memory expert.

349
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:44,840
Go up to pacify him, Lou.
Make him think everything is all right.

350
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,122
Chick is pretty bad when he wants to be.

351
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:50,636
You don't want him feeding you bullets.

352
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:54,115
I don't exactly want to be dodging around
in tin corsets.

353
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:56,196
How's about it us going up
to see him tomorrow?

354
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:57,718
Why tomorrow?

355
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,273
Me laundry will be back then.

356
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,842
- Make it Sunday. It'll be nice and quiet.
- That's fine, Lou.

357
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,519
It'll be a swell trip.
We can take the boat up the Hudson.

358
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,596
I'll take the train. Water and me don't agree.

359
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:09,720
All right.

360
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:18,634
- Wait a minute.
- Please don't tell them I'm here, Captain.

361
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:21,285
- Captain, will you help me?
- What's the matter, Pete?

362
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:23,959
There was a window broken
down at Flaherty's drug store.

363
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:26,161
- I didn't mean to do it.
- Where is he?

364
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,281
- Which way did he go?
- That's Doheney.

365
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:31,596
- Don't let him get me, Captain.
- Get up there and stay quiet.

366
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,244
- Where is he?
- Who?

367
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't try to fool me. I know you're
always trying to help these dirty crooks.

368
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:45,679
Now where did he go?
Where did you put him?

369
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:49,441
- Who do you mean?
- Pete the Duke, you know who I mean.

370
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:52,483
You must be mistaken.
Pete's been helping me all afternoon.

371
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,521
- Who says so?
- I do.

372
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:57,599
Two against one, Doheney,
so flap your heels.

373
00:22:57,685 --> 00:23:00,074
What's the matter here?
You're in again?

374
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:03,475
Listen, Jordan, I'm after Pete the Duke,
I saw him come in the door...

375
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,955
Just a minute, Doheney. I thought I told you
you weren't welcome here.

376
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:10,833
What's the use of stalling me?
I saw him come in the door...

377
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,119
Thanks.

378
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:17,522
Ain't having much luck, are you?

379
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,881
I'd have a great deal more
if Doheney and the others would cooperate.

380
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,717
Ain't none of them worth saving.

381
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,877
If you hang around them long enough,
you'll get that way yourself.

382
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,683
Thanks for the kind interest.

383
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:31,075
I always did like a man in a uniform.

384
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,121
That one fits you grand.

385
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,874
Why don't you come up sometime
and see me?

386
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:39,924
- I'm home every evening.
- Yeah, but I'm busy every evening.

387
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:42,997
Busy? Say, what are you trying to do,
insult me?

388
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:46,077
Why, no, not at all. I'm just busy, that's all.

389
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,441
You see, we're holding meetings
in Jacobson's hall every evening.

390
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,756
When you have a moment to spare, drop in.
You're more than welcome.

391
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,723
I heard you. But you ain't kidding me any.

392
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,403
You know, I met your kind before.
Why don't you come up sometime?

393
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:01,554
Well, I...

394
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:04,398
- Don't be afraid. I won't tell.
- But...

395
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,794
Come up. I'll tell your fortune.

396
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,043
You can be had.

397
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,685
Remember, Lou.
Chick's probably pretty sore.

398
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:19,642
I'll make him think he's on a vacation.

399
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,319
- Yeah, he'll listen to you.
- Who won't?

400
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,600
Once I get them, they're branded.

401
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,043
Hello, Shorty, what are you doing here?

402
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,877
- Five years.
- What for?

403
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:36,919
I forgot what me mother told me.

404
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,565
Should have tied a string around your finger.

405
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,318
- Hello, Lou.
- Bobo, I didn't expect to see you here.

406
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:45,158
If you hadn't turned me down
I'd have never landed in here.

407
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:48,157
Say, Lou, how about giving me
another chance when I get out?

408
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,440
- When do you get out?
- 15 years.

409
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,004
That's a date.

410
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,964
Hello, Lou.

411
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:56,480
Cherry sisters.

412
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,795
Lou, you gotta help me
get out of this.

413
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:01,035
- Who, me?
- You've gotta. I've been framed.

414
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,401
You got a lot of pull. You can get me out,
It's a frame, I tell you.

415
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:06,123
You're the right picture for it.

416
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,436
One of the fastest guys in the business,
but he's taking his time now.

417
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:10,799
Hello, Lou.

418
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,035
What is this? Old Home Week?

419
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,114
Chick.

420
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:23,205
Why didn't you come to see me sooner?

421
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:27,201
- 'Cause you were glad to get rid of me?
- Chick.

422
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:30,721
You know what I mean and you know me.
What am I in here for?

423
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:34,320
You know why I copped them stones?
Sure, and you know who's got them now.

424
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:37,643
You'd sell your heart and lungs
for a handful of diamonds.

425
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:40,683
And I'm doing a stretch with rats and bugs
so you can have them.

426
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,198
It's all right.

427
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:45,796
As long as you're on the level.
But if you ain't, I can find out.

428
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,353
Don't forget that. I can find out.

429
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,084
And I can get out.

430
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:53,884
If you've been double-crossing me,
you'll pay for it.

431
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:57,958
Every day, every minute
of this stretch, you're gonna pay for.

432
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:01,524
Don't talk like that, Chick. I've been working.

433
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,994
Working? Working who?

434
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:06,796
Singing at Gus Jordan's.

435
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:10,838
- Gus Jordan's?
- It ain't what you think.

436
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:14,523
You haven't been seeing
anything of Dan Flynn, have you?

437
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:16,800
No, why do you ask about him?

438
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:19,797
Nothing. Just got a score...

439
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:22,483
to settle up with him when I get out.

440
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:26,114
What I want to know is are you
playing me on the square or ain't you...

441
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:29,277
- because if you ain't...
- There'll be a death in my family?

442
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,117
- No.
- Is that it?

443
00:26:31,845 --> 00:26:34,040
Then I'll be back in here again.

444
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:37,363
But you won't be coming around to see me.

445
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,362
What's the use of making
a lot of trouble for yourself, Chick?

446
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:44,676
If I can wait a year, you can wait a year.

447
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,636
You mean that you'll wait for me?

448
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:51,240
Why, that ain't nothing
when you got willpower like me.

449
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,159
- Time's up.
- Have a heart.

450
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,203
They ain't seen each other in a year.
Give them time.

451
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:58,877
What for? Ready?

452
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,602
Goodbye, Chick.
It's been good to see you again.

453
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:04,716
I can't let you go, Lou.

454
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:06,837
I hate to leave you.

455
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:10,034
Don't worry. I'll be true to you.

456
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,794
I trust you. I trust you because I love you.
You're mine.

457
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,485
I'm telling you again,
if you ever double-cross me...

458
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,874
if you ever let another man
come between us...

459
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:20,398
I'll kill you.

460
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:24,115
Goodbye, Chick.
I'll remember to be good for you.

461
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:33,562
I can't wait.

462
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,355
I wonder what Chick's got
against Dan Flynn?

463
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:45,844
I ain't never told you, Lou...

464
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,519
but Flynn is the main guy
what helped send Chick up here.

465
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,324
I ain't never had no use
for that mug ever since.

466
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,965
- So Flynn did that?
- Yeah.

467
00:27:55,965 --> 00:28:00,880

00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,116
- Bravo.

489
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,116

490
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,878
- You took long enough.
- I couldn't help it.

491
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:29,923
Jacobson wasn't at the mission,
so I had to go to the hock shop.

492
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,155
- What about it?
- He'll be right over.

493
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:35,681
- Was that Cummings guy there?
- I didn't see him.

494
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:39,242
- Say, Lou, you falling for that bloke?
- It ain't nothing serious...

495
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:41,361
there was something
just wonderful about him.

496
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:43,003
That's the way it always starts.

497
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,919
He wouldn't look at me.
Only out of curiosity. He's different.

498
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,203
You've got it bad.

499
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,038
Say, Lou, you sent for a guy
named lke Jacobson?

500
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,003
Yeah, send him in.
I want to see this guy alone, Frances.

501
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,438
- All right, then.

502
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:58,800
- Hello, Lou.
- Hello, Jacobson.

503
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,682
What can I do for you?

504
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,357
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

505
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,803
I hear the rescue mission
rents your building.

506
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:13,082
Rents, that's right.
But they ain't got no money.

507
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:16,282
- So, how can I keep them there?
- You ain't gonna put them out?

508
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:19,516
Put them out, me? No.

509
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:24,123
- I'll just tell them they'll have to move.
- But Mr. Cummings is in charge.

510
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:27,283
Yes. Nice, smartish-looking fellow.

511
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,882
Why did you send for me, Lou?

512
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:34,162
You want me to buy
some of your famous diamonds or...

513
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:36,554
No. What do you want for that building?

514
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:41,514
You mean, how much if I'm selling,
or how much if I'm paying taxes?

515
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,283
I mean how much for cash?

516
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:48,443
Now stop multiplying.
I don't want to buy the Bowery.

517
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:51,757
I was going to ask $25,000 for that building.

518
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:55,477
My own brother couldn't buy it for $20,000.

519
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:59,236
- But for you, I'll make it $15,000.
- Well, I'll give you $12,000.

520
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,917
<i>Oy, gevalt!</i>

521
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:04,237
- $12,000. Never.
- All right.

522
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:06,395
- All right.
- Goodbye.

523
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,319
Goodbye.

524
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:13,957
Wait. Is that all cash?
No mortgage goes with it?

525
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,642
Here's your $12,000.

526
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:19,238
How do I know it is?

527
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:22,283
Because I say so. You never heard of me
cheating anyone, did you?

528
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,999
No. Not about money.

529
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:27,724
Now, listen, that sounds like a slam.

530
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,524
But coming from you, I'll let it pass.

531
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,594
Handle them with care.
They're only my heart.

532
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,916
And what a heart you've got, Miss Lou.

533
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:40,042
I'll tell you what I want you to do.
Come and make up the papers.

534
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,322
And make it appear like the mission
bought the building themselves.

535
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,077
- I don't want to be mixed up in it.

536
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,678
- We want Lou!

537
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:52,754

538
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:57,834
- Lou.

539
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,719
Hurry up, the place is jammed
with all the society folks.

540
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:02,682
I hope they tuned that piano.

541
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:05,156

542
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:32,554
<i>Our Lady Lou is here</i>

543
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,036

544
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,916

545
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:50,482
<i>Ever since Miss Susan Johnson</i>
<i>She lost her jockey, Lee</i>

546
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:54,194
<i>There's been much excitement</i>
<i>and more to be</i>

547
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:59,117
<i>You can hear her moaning from early morn</i>

548
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:03,756
<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

549
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:09,441
<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

550
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:18,839
<i>If he was here he'd win the race</i>

551
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:21,598
<i>If not first he'd get a place</i>

552
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:25,963
<i>I never saw that jockey</i>
<i>trailing anyone before</i>

553
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:31,074
<i>I'm losing all my money</i>
<i>that's why I'm blue</i>

554
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:37,243
<i>If that boy was here</i>
<i>he'd sure know what to do</i>

555
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,754
<i>I'd put all my junk in pawn</i>

556
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,643
<i>To bet on any horse that jockey's on</i>

557
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:48,355
<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

559
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:03,314
<i>He went and put my brand new bunch</i>
<i>in pawn</i>

560
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:09,163
<i>I see him coming round that turn</i>
<i>What a trail that man can burn</i>

561
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:12,555
<i>He's gotta win</i>
<i>because my dough is on the nose</i>

562
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:16,555
<i>Just watch my jockey easy ride in style</i>

563
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,755
<i>He'll hit that home stretch winner by a mile</i>

564
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:25,284
<i>I want him to win this spree</i>
<i>And keep on going till he comes to me</i>

565
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:28,482
<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

566
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:34,755
<i>I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone</i>

567
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,997
- You were great, Lou.

568
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,521
I'd like to have a word with you
when it's convenient.

569
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,598
I've been saving a little time for you.
Come up in a few minutes.

570
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,442
What are you doing here, Flynn?

571
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:14,039
- Just getting used to the place.
- Yeah?

572
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:17,800
- You're thinking about moving in?
- Yeah, I thought I might.

573
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,843
- When?
- When Gus moves out.

574
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:25,595
- Flynn, you're an optimist.
- No.

575
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:27,798
You may as well know it.

576
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,480
Gus is in the hole. And you'd be, too,
if it wasn't for me.

577
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:37,035
So, you're gonna protect me? From what?

578
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:40,637
There's a new dick in town called the Hawk.

579
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,196
He's been tipped off to Gus,
and he's got the goods on him.

580
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:47,240
Gus ain't done anything.
What's he got on him?

581
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:50,681
Don't be so innocent, Lou.
You're talking to a man who knows you...

582
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:53,643
and is willing to protect you
if you play along with him.

583
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:56,159
I don't know what you're talking about.

584
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,884
You don't know anything
about that Sally girl?

585
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,239
What Sally?

586
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:03,237
The one you roped in
and turned over to Gus.

587
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:06,481
Why, he only got the poor kid a job.

588
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:08,601
Depends on what kind of a job.

589
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,240
That's where Gus put his foot in it.

590
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:14,124
Where do you think he gets the money
to buy you them rocks?

591
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,878
From this place here? Don't be a fool.

592
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,602
If Gus goes up the river,
you'll go along with him.

593
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:22,277
I'm tipping you off privately.

594
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,879
What are you trying to do, scare me, Dan?

595
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:29,154
When I need protection, I'll write you a letter.

596
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,519
That ain't no way to talk to me, Lou.

597
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:38,681
You said you liked me once.

598
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:42,394
When I said I was crazy about you,
I didn't say how crazy.

599
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:45,074
I never gave up and I never will.

600
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,084
You can't expect to go around
getting men all on fire...

601
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,360
and think they're gonna forget all about it.

602
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:53,960
Now, Gus has had you long enough.
He's going away.

603
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:58,238
I'll see about that.
And you're coming to me or nobody else.

604
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:02,163
You love me that much
that you'd frame Gus to get me?

605
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,681
To get you I'd even
frame my own mother.

606
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,483
And I believe you.

607
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:11,358
I'm beginning to understand you, Flynn.

608
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:15,675
Tell me.
Who is this here guy they call the Hawk?

609
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:18,279
He's the slickest bird in the business.

610
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:22,358
Even the men from headquarters
wouldn't know him if they fell over him.

611
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:26,483
You know, I never did appreciate you before.

612
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,604
But I do, now.

613
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,357
- You mean that, Lou?
- Why, of course I do.

614
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,837

615
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:46,715
I'll see about that little matter another time.

616
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:47,954
- All right.

617
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:52,240
- Lou, it looks like Chick's done it.
- Done what?

618
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:54,475
I ain't sure, but word's around he broke jail.

619
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,796
- Made a getaway?
- I'm just telling you. I'll be standing by.

620
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:01,195
Thanks, Spider. Keep your eyes open
and don't tell anyone.

621
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,718
I won't, Lou.

622
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:08,396

623
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:10,559
Come in.

624
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,757
I came to inquire about Sally Glynn.

625
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:19,518
I'm told she came here
after she left the mission that day.

626
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:21,436
- Where is she?
- How should I know?

627
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,595
You know where she is. I want you to tell me.

628
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:26,518
So you've come to me
to find another woman.

629
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:33,318
I don't know and I wouldn't tell you if I did.

630
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,078
You see, her father's over at the mission
looking for her.

631
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,918
- That's the only reason you want to know?
- Yeah.

632
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:41,475
Gus and his friends got her a job.

633
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,237
You don't know where?

634
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:46,044
No. I got other things to think about.

635
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:49,325
Would you give me your word
that you know nothing more?

636
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:51,680
- Would you believe me if I did?
- Yes, of course.

637
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,802
- That's all I know.
- I'm glad to hear that.

638
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,444
Say it like you mean it.

639
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:59,323
I do. I'm anxious not to see you
mixed up in it.

640
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:02,075
But I guess I'm taking your time.

641
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,554
What do you suppose my time's for?

642
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,679
Sit down.

643
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:11,956

644
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:19,235
That's it, loosen up.
Unbend. You'll feel better.

645
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:31,196
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

646
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:37,919
Yes, I guess smoking is gonna make a man
look effeminate before long.

647
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:43,635
So, all this is your famous collection?

648
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:47,638
No. This is just my summer jewellery.
You ought to see my winter stuff.

649
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,794
I see.

650
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:52,844
It was a tossup whether I'd go in
for diamonds or sing in the choir.

651
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,558
The choir lost.

652
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,323
They're wonderful.

653
00:40:56,925 --> 00:41:00,474
But they always seem so cold to me.
They have no warmth, no soul.

654
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:03,637
<i>I'm sorry you think more of your diamonds</i>
<i>than you do of your soul.</i>

655
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:07,638
I'm sorry you think more of my soul
than you do of my diamonds.

656
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:10,241
Maybe I ain't got no soul.

657
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:14,002
Yes, you have,
but you keep it hidden under a mask.

658
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:16,603
You'll wake up and find it some time.

659
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,835
Haven't you met a man
that could make you happy?

660
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:21,120
Sure, lots of times.

661
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:25,797

662
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,476

663
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:38,202
You can't go out in this.

664
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:42,603
I gotta be getting back to the mission.
Sally's father is waiting for me.

665
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,676
That ought to be interesting.

666
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:48,002
Yeah, but it's one of the things
I have to do.

667
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,597
Good night.

668
00:41:58,085 --> 00:41:59,404
Good night.

669
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:10,354
Come up again. Any time.

670
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,158
Thanks, I will.

671
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:20,915
It won't be long now.

672
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:28,562
Now, this is all we have
on hand at present.

673
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:31,763
One of the plates got busted
and sort of held us up.

674
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:33,437
These are beautiful, Gus.

675
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:36,801
One way to get rich is to make
one's own money, isn't it, Jordan?

676
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:38,682
Now, you have your instructions.

677
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,074
I won't say anything more.
You know what to do.

678
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:44,237
- Get rid of them quickly but safely.
- Not a word, Gus.

679
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:47,681
They say money talks,
but this can only whisper.

680
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:50,965
Stow these on you.
I'll take care of the rest.

681
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:53,605
- Soon we will be very rich, eh?
- I hope so.

682
00:42:53,685 --> 00:42:55,482
- I need money.
- Don't we all?

683
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:56,714
One thing more...

684
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:57,794

685
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:00,116
- Who's there?
- Doheney.

686
00:43:00,605 --> 00:43:02,516
- Just a minute, Doheney.

687
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,683
Come in, Doheney.

688
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:13,154
- What's up?
- Excuse me for butting in, Mr. Jordan...

689
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:15,999
- but have you seen anyone around here?
- No. Who?

690
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:17,643
- Chick Clark.
- Chick Clark?

691
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:21,201
- You'll find him up the river.
- He made a getaway. I thought you knew.

692
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,162
Collins here says he spotted him out back.

693
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,679
I'm sure it was him.
He was headed this way.

694
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:27,164
What would he come here for?

695
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:29,634
No telling, sir.
Maybe looking for trouble.

696
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:32,678
Better take a look. Excuse us, will you?

697
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:39,080
<i>On life's stormy path,</i>
<i>ill-advised</i>

698
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:44,242
<i>Do not scorn her with words</i>

699
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:47,795
<i>fierce and bitter</i>

700
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:50,242
<i>Do not laugh</i>

701
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:55,840
<i>at her shame and downfall</i>

702
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:59,801
<i>For a moment, just stop</i>

703
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:03,554
<i>and consider</i>

704
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:04,760
Wait a minute.

705
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,915
<i>that a man was the cause</i>

706
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,484
Sir, he might have gone that...

707
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:13,080
<i>of it all</i>

708
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:17,034
You can go home now, Pearl.
I won't need you anymore.

709
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,355
- You sure you won't, Miss Lou?
- No, you can go.

710
00:44:19,445 --> 00:44:20,924
- Good night.
- Good night.

711
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,638
Just a minute.

712
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,361
- Chick, what do you want?
- I want you to pack up and come with me.

713
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:37,023
You don't suppose I'd be fool enough
to go anyplace with you.

714
00:44:37,105 --> 00:44:41,144
Listen. I had to croak a guard to get out.
I'm here, now you're going with me.

715
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:43,534
I ain't going, Chick, I'm staying here.

716
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,695
- Don't you love me anymore?
- Anymore?

717
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,618
You mean to say you never loved me?
Why, you...

718
00:44:48,705 --> 00:44:53,221
What? All I gotta do is call Gus,
and your trip will be back up the river.

719
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:57,343
- You'll never live to see me go.
- None of them cheap threats.

720
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:01,134
You ought to know me better.
I tell you, Chick, you're through. Get out.

721
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:04,501
You've got a nerve to stand there
and tell me to get out.

722
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:08,381
Me jumping freights
and crawling through the mud to get to you.

723
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:11,104
- Why, you...
- Chick!

724
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:14,943
I can't. I can't do it.

725
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:17,583
God, I can't.

726
00:45:18,985 --> 00:45:23,297
Don't you know what I feel for you?
Ain't you got a heart left in you for me?

727
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,776

728
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,023
I gotta have you.

729
00:45:43,105 --> 00:45:45,096

730
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:48,176
Chick, I never knew anything like that.

731
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,138
Just a minute.

732
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,862
I'll meet you tonight, at Callahan's.
Right after my turn.

733
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,583
- You'll come to me?
- I swear.

734
00:45:56,665 --> 00:45:58,417
I'll be waiting for you.

735
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:07,538
Thought it was Gus.

736
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:09,981
I could not stay away.

737
00:46:10,065 --> 00:46:11,942
I was kind of expecting that.

738
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:18,057

739
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:19,578
- Hello, Rita.
- Hello, Flynn.

740
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:21,257
- Looking for your assistant?
- Yes.

741
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,654
Last time I saw him, he was headed that way.

742
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:27,055
- So...
- That's her. She's the one.

743
00:46:27,145 --> 00:46:29,454
She's the woman that done it.
That woman there.

744
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:32,457
- Sit down.
- That was the one I told you about...

745
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:35,298
She can't get away
with anything like that again...

746
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:37,580
Let me alone! That woman...

747
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:40,420
- Is she talking about you, Rita?
- Me?

748
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:43,941
I never saw the woman before.
I've never been so insulted in all my life.

749
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:45,856
She must be mad, that woman.

750
00:46:49,065 --> 00:46:50,384
Now, I'll talk to her.

751
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:52,703
I bring you a gift.

752
00:46:55,465 --> 00:46:57,899
Diamonds. I know you love them so.

753
00:46:58,305 --> 00:46:59,818
Ain't it grand.

754
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:05,383
See, they make your eyes sparkle,
and your teeth gleam like pearls.

755
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,059
You are beautiful. I love you so.

756
00:47:10,225 --> 00:47:13,262
The men of my country go wild
about women with yellow hair.

757
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:17,020
I'm glad you told me.
I want to keep straight on my geography.

758
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:23,696
I love you. You were made for love.
And for love only should you care.

759
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:27,583
And now, surely,
you have enough diamonds.

760
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,142
Diamonds is my career.

761
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:34,055
I swear I shall make you happy.
I shall die to make you happy.

762
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:36,898
But you wouldn't be much use to me dead.

763
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:38,374

764
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:41,780
So, this is where I find you.

765
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,541
- Hello, Rita.
- Don't you "hello" me.

766
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:48,180
So, the minute my back is turned,
I find you making love to another woman.

767
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:52,019
What did you expect? A boy
with a gift like that should be working at it.

768
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:53,618
What have you to say for yourself?

769
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:57,334
I have nothing to say.
You saw. What can I say?

770
00:47:57,425 --> 00:48:00,861
How dare you so insult me when I gave you
the very clothes on your back.

771
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:03,937
- He's gotta have more than clothes.
- I'll attend to you later.

772
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:07,984
Have you no apology? Are you not sorry?
Do you not wish me to forgive you?

773
00:48:10,945 --> 00:48:13,937
- I love you, I swear it.
- You love her?

774
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:17,779
She loves only money and diamonds.
And let me tell you more about her. She...

775
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:20,982
Just a minute. You get out of here
and leave her to me.

776
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:25,976
My pin! What do you mean by taking my pin?

777
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:30,581
- I didn't take your pin, he gave it to me.
- I want it back, right now.

778
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:32,144
You try and get it.

779
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:34,864
I wouldn't give you
this here thing now for spite.

780
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,743
If you asked me for it the right way,
you could have had it.

781
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:39,543
I get all the rocks I want...

782
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,015
but I'll keep this here thing now
to remember you by.

783
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:48,055
You're so very clever, Lou. So wise.
And so very smart.

784
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,254
But in my country,
we know how to deal with you wise ones.

785
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:55,576
- Sneaky, underhanded...
- I'll kill you, you hear me?

786
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:59,340
- Open that hand. Give me that knife.
- You think you're clever?

787
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:00,824

788
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,575
- Give me that knife.

789
00:49:05,665 --> 00:49:07,656

790
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:19,778
Rita.

791
00:49:25,385 --> 00:49:28,263
Here. I don't want your pin.

792
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,097
Lou?

793
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,823
He must've come over that shed.

794
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:42,214
Lou, did you see anyone
out on the shed?

795
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:43,784
No.

796
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:48,017
No, there's nobody there.
Sorry to have bothered you.

797
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:49,823
All right, Doheney.

798
00:49:51,585 --> 00:49:53,894
I want to have a little
talk with you afterwards, Lou.

799
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:56,783
- Better hurry, they're waiting for you.
- I'll be right down.

800
00:49:56,865 --> 00:49:59,379
I'm just doing a job I never did before.

801
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:08,293
Spider.

802
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:22,461
- Lou, I found...
- Don't bother me.

803
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,422
- Are you nervous, Lou?
- No.

804
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:27,099
- You are nervous, ain't you, Lou?
- No, I ain't nervous.

805
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:28,618
'Cause if you're nervous I got...

806
00:50:28,705 --> 00:50:31,139
I ain't nervous,
but if you keep asking me, I will be.

807
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:33,216

808
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:41,177
<i>A guy what takes his time</i>
<i>I'll go for any time</i>

809
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:45,941
<i>I'm a fast-moving girl</i>
<i>That likes them slow</i>

810
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:51,094
<i>Got no use for fancy driving</i>
<i>Wanna see a guy arrive a little low</i>

811
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:57,737
<i>There isn't any fun</i>
<i>In getting something done</i>

812
00:50:57,825 --> 00:51:02,262
<i>If you're rushed</i>
<i>when you have to make the grade</i>

813
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:06,657
<i>I can spot an amateur</i>
<i>appreciate a connoisseur</i>

814
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:09,418
<i>at his trade</i>

815
00:51:11,265 --> 00:51:15,019
<i>Who would qualify, no alibi</i>
<i>to be the guy</i>

816
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,654
<i>what takes his time</i>

817
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:27,543
Since I've been in office,
I've never heard anything so appalling.

818
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,024
Every word of it is true.

819
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:31,221
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir, that's all.

820
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:33,660
What this young lady says
is a serious accusation...

821
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:38,261
and means the end of that gang,
and coincides with Dan Flynn's report.

822
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:42,016
- Let me hear the next witness.
- That's all, Miss.

823
00:51:42,905 --> 00:51:44,816
Come, Sally.

824
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:51,904
Now, Sally, tell the District Attorney
exactly what you told me.

825
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:57,821
Lou, what did Cummings want?
I seen him go upstairs to your room.

826
00:51:57,905 --> 00:52:01,295
He wanted to know about that Sally girl
you sent to the coast.

827
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,296
He did? Wonder what for.

828
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:06,457
The father was over at the mission
and wanted them to find her.

829
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:09,059
All I told him was that you got her a job.

830
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:11,979
I'm sorry I ever bothered with that girl.

831
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:13,737
Why are you so funny-acting, Gus?

832
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:16,293
Funny-acting? What do you mean?

833
00:52:17,305 --> 00:52:21,218
You're acting kind of funny.
Have I done anything you don't like?

834
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:23,979
No. Not exactly.

835
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:28,978
I tell you, Lou. I don't like this bird Stanieff
always hanging around you.

836
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:32,614
He's too sleek, too slippery.
Too polite to suit me.

837
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:37,383
So that's what's biting you.
Why, he don't mean nothing to me.

838
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:40,423
He's Rita's friend.
I wanted to make him feel at home.

839
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:42,143
Yeah? All right.

840
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:45,216
I guess I'm a jealous old fool.

841
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:48,255
They are valuable, ain't they, Gus?

842
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,695
Worth pretty nearly half a million.

843
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,939
Gonna get you a lot more of them soon.

844
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:57,376
He said they had no soul.

845
00:52:58,225 --> 00:52:59,499
Who said?

846
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:05,378
That guy, Cummings.

847
00:53:06,905 --> 00:53:09,214
So, you met a man who wouldn't fall for you?

848
00:53:09,305 --> 00:53:11,102
Who wants him to fall?

849
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:14,541
Why, he'd be the kind
a woman'd have to marry to get rid of.

850
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:17,454
That sounds more like Dan Flynn.

851
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:21,820
You ain't heard anything about this copper
they call the Hawk, have you?

852
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:23,463
Just talk, why?

853
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:26,460
Flynn says he's spotting the place
day and night.

854
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,696
Flynn said that? What does he know?

855
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:32,254
I hope you ain't sending them girls
to the coast...

856
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,701
to become classy dips and burglars,
like Flynn thinks.

857
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:38,862
He can't knife me and get away with it.

858
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:41,175
Lou, I wanted to tell you...

859
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,616
- You do that, Spider?
- What?

860
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:48,334
Something I had to do,
and didn't have the time to do it...

861
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:51,056
and Spider did it for me.

862
00:53:53,865 --> 00:53:58,017
Boss, there's a guy out here named McNeil,
he wants to cash a cheque.

863
00:53:58,345 --> 00:54:00,905
McNeil? I don't know him.

864
00:54:01,745 --> 00:54:03,975
By the way, have you seen Rita around?

865
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:06,335
Rita? Why, no.

866
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:09,141
I guess she'll come in later.

867
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:15,178
- I want to thank you Spider. It was great.
- I know.

868
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:18,337
- Lou, I'd do anything for you...
- I went through enough tonight.

869
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,302
- I gotta tell you...
- I gotta do my number.

870
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,057
Chick Clark is in the alley.

871
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,897
- Chick Clark?
- Yeah.

872
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:29,264
What do you want me to do with him, Lou?

873
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:32,701
Take him up the back way to my room.
I don't want the cops to get him.

874
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:34,980
- All right, Lou.
- I'll figure something out later.

875
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:36,339
All right, Lou.

876
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:49,493

877
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:53,985
<i>Frankie and Johnny</i>
<i>were sweethearts</i>

878
00:54:54,745 --> 00:54:56,975
<i>Oh, how they could love</i>

879
00:54:57,705 --> 00:55:00,094
<i>Swore they'd be true to each other</i>

880
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:04,737
<i>True as the stars up above</i>
<i>He was her man</i>

881
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,263
<i>And he was doing her wrong</i>

882
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:12,055
<i>Frankie went down to the corner</i>

883
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,619
<i>To get a bucket of beer</i>

884
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:18,779
<i>Said to the man called the bartender</i>

885
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:21,174
<i>Have you seen my Johnny here?</i>

886
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:23,062
<i>He's my man</i>

887
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:26,213
<i>And he's doing me wrong</i>

888
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:30,739
<i>Ain't gonna tell you no stories</i>

889
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:33,665
<i>Ain't gonna tell you no lies</i>

890
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:36,739
<i>Saw your man Johnny leave</i>
<i>about an hour ago</i>

891
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:39,783
<i>With that girl named Nellie Bly</i>

892
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:44,461
<i>He's your man and he's doing you wrong</i>

893
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:49,337
<i>Frankie went round to that hot spot</i>

894
00:55:49,425 --> 00:55:52,258
<i>Brought along a great big.44</i>

895
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:55,583
<i>She went inside and then she smiled</i>

896
00:55:55,705 --> 00:55:58,981
<i>At Johnny on the floor</i>
<i>He was her man</i>

897
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:01,219
<i>And he was doing...</i>

898
00:56:01,305 --> 00:56:02,499

899
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,295
Stay back, you hear?
I'll plug the first one that moves.

900
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:12,735

901
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,740
Come on, men.

902
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,858
Come on, Lou. We've got to get out of here.
No time to talk now, come on.

903
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:30,942
- You get off me!
- Go on!

904
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:32,054
Through the tunnel.

905
00:56:32,145 --> 00:56:33,339
Wait a minute.

906
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:34,494
- You.
- Why, what'd you...

907
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:35,574
Hold it!

908
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:39,494
I've waited a long time for this moment,
Jordan, and now I got you good.

909
00:56:39,585 --> 00:56:42,497
- I am boss of this district.
- You're smart, but not smart enough.

910
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:44,496
That's the trouble with ward heelers like you.

911
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:46,780
Get a little political power,
you think you're king.

912
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:49,584
With bribes, petty favours
you think you're above the law.

913
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:52,384
It's not the mission talking now,
it's the U.S. Government.

914
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:55,616
- So, you're the Hawk.
- Yeah, that's what they call me.

915
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:59,143
Making and passing counterfeit money
is a federal offence.

916
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:02,740
Yeah, you and your crowd are due
for about 20 years in Atlanta.

917
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:04,498
Go on, boys, take him out of here.

918
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:06,780
- I thought something...
- Come on.

919
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,537
- Lay off me.
- Come on.

920
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:11,738
Wait a minute.
Say, what's going to happen to her?

921
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:14,783
Never mind, she'll be well taken care of.

922
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:16,133
Come on.

923
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:21,902
You, the Hawk.
A night bird working in the dark.

924
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,255
Stealing the confidence of people.

925
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:27,377
- The lowest kind of a thief.
- I'm sorry you think so.

926
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:31,460
Chief, I've got that other fellow out here,
you wanna look at him?

927
00:57:34,905 --> 00:57:36,258
Come here.

928
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,456
- Is that the man?
- Yes, that's the man.

929
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:39,660
Thank you.

930
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:45,817
- Take him to headquarters.
- Come on.

931
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:48,465
Take care of the young lady till I get back.

932
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,582
- Where is she?
- Went out that way, sir.

933
00:57:51,665 --> 00:57:52,939
Why did you let her?

934
00:57:55,665 --> 00:57:57,656
- You double-crossed me.
- What do you mean?

935
00:57:57,745 --> 00:57:59,701
- You planted me up here...
- You got me wrong.

936
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,458
...and sent that rat, Flynn, to get me,
but I got him first.

937
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,183
- Now I'm gonna get you.
- Wait.

938
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:06,495
Say your prayers, if you know any.
I'll meet you in...

939
00:58:06,585 --> 00:58:07,574

940
00:58:08,705 --> 00:58:10,582
Come on, get him out of here.

941
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:22,137
Those absolutely necessary?
You know, I wasn't born with them.

942
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:24,455
No, a lot of men would have been safer
if you had.

943
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:27,105
I don't know, hands ain't everything.

944
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:30,060
All right. Come on.

945
00:58:31,665 --> 00:58:32,893
My wrap.

946
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,093
If you wanna help me, pick up my train.

947
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:57,734
- Come on, get back.
- Keep back.

948
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:02,583
Here she comes now.

949
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:06,497
Get back. Come on.

950
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:13,498
Sure, they got me, but they got you, too.

951
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:17,896
Chief, we got them all.

952
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:20,180
Yeah, all but the brass band.

953
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:24,659

954
00:59:26,305 --> 00:59:28,057
Wait a minute, you forgot me.

955
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:33,215
Break it up, come on.

956
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,380
Clear out. Move along.

957
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:47,375
I think I'd have liked the wagon better.

958
00:59:47,465 --> 00:59:51,378
I suppose you'd rather have the company
of your friends, such as they are.

959
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:53,740
You ain't exactly a pal.

960
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:01,544
Surely you don't mind my holding your hand.

961
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:04,298
It ain't heavy. I can hold it myself.

962
01:00:07,185 --> 01:00:10,495
This is a dirty trick. I could get real sore.

963
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:12,541
If I didn't have a lot of self-control.

964
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,662
So have I, but I'm beginning to lose it.

965
01:00:17,945 --> 01:00:20,823
You know, you remind me
of a glittering palace of ice.

966
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:22,304
I ain't ice.

967
01:00:22,545 --> 01:00:24,422
I didn't say you were.

968
01:00:25,545 --> 01:00:28,013
But your diamonds are all going
to the storehouse.

969
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:31,780
You said I had a soul.
I looked for it, but I didn't find it.

970
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,935
- You will.
- Where, in jail?

971
01:00:34,905 --> 01:00:38,534
- No, that's not the place for you.
- You got me, ain't you?

972
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:42,216
Yeah, I got you. You're my prisoner.

973
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:47,223
And I'm gonna be your jailor for a long time.

974
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:49,577
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

975
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:53,417
And you can start doing that stretch
right now.

976
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,457
Where did you get that...

977
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:00,382
dark and handsome?

978
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,375
You bad girl.

979
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:05,457
You'll find out.

980
01:01:06,305 --> 01:02:06,207
