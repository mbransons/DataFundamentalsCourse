1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,831
Roberto!

3
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,719
You promised.

4
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,713
Adios, Kashkin.
- Adios, Roberto.

5
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,637
BUNKER

6
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,110
Hola, Americano.

7
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,391
Hola. Hola.

8
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,439
Help yourself, Jordan.
- General Golz?

9
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,194
What an accent!
He even knows me in the dark!

10
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,275
That's all we have
in Spain now... accents.

11
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,069
Eh, Jordan?
- I was looking for you.

12
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,109
I saw you.
How did it go with the train?

13
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,635
Alright.

14
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,998
And Kashkin?
- He caught one.

15
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,360
He didn't want to be taken alive.

16
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,636
Oh, so it was like that?
- Yes. Murder.

17
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,669
Orders are orders.
- I still call it murder. - Well...

18
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,471
in this business, Jordan, remember
nothing. Nothing except the next job.

19
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,111
What's next? - A bridge.
- Oh, a bridge. - Right.

20
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,640
To blow the bridge is nothing. But
to blow it at the time of the attack,

21
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,318
that's a horse of another color,
as you Americans say. - Attack?

22
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,872
Yes. At last we take the offensive.
Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.

23
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,511
On paper it looks wonderful,
and if it succeeds...

24
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,311
No, I will not say "if."
This time it must succeed and it will.

25
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,551
What I've told you, Jordan,
is known only to the general staff.

26
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,669
Our only chance to succeed
is by a surprise attack.

27
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,390
Now, here is the bridge,
over a deep gorge.

28
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,598
It's the only way
the enemy can bring up reinforcements.

29
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,834
Tanks, artillery, troops,
all must come over this bridge.

30
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,233
I must know it is gone. Not before
the attack, they'd rebuild it.

31
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,270
It must go the minute the attack
starts, no sooner, no later.

32
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,232
So the bridge is nothing. But suppose
their soldiers are sitting on it.

33
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,632
You know, sentries on both ends.
What do you do then?

34
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,193
In my country, they say, "Never blow
a bridge till you come to it." - Good.

35
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,479
That's good, you joke. In this
business, one should joke a little.

36
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,952
I am so serious.
It's why I can joke.

37
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,592
You think you can get through
enemy lines tomorrow night? - Sure.

38
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,310
Good. That will give you 3 days
to prepare for the dynamiting.

39
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,918
Wait for the attack at dawn,
after the third night.

40
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,232
How will I know the exact time?
- Well, use these.

41
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,790
Listen. First we attack from the air.

42
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,397
When you hear the explosions,
that's your time.

43
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,157
I've got a good guide for you,
an old man named Anselmo.

44
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,997
Knows the country like a fox,
and the people to help you.

45
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,073
Now, go
and find yourself a pretty girl.

46
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,353
But first get a haircut.
- Is that an order, General?

47
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,799
Why not?
- I don't like your barber.

48
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,791
Up the gorge to the left
is the bridge.

49
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,119
Sentry boxes, huh?
- At each end, Roberto.

50
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,034
Always two sentries on guard.

51
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,390
Where do the sentries live? - At the
road-mender's hut, across the bridge.

52
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,075
You can't see it from here.

53
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,950
The other post is on this side,
in that old sawmill.

54
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,478
How many men in the sawmill?
- Eight, and a corporal.

55
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,350
The other post, how many men?
- Maybe more.

56
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,876
We'll find out. Look!

57
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,514
They always spit in the gorge.

58
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,797
It brings luck.

59
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,398
I wish I could spit that far.

60
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,789
Roberto!

61
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,197
That sentry, he looks
like a man from my village.

62
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,228
He's very young.

63
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,911
He must die?
- You couldn't do it, Anselmo?

64
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,992
I would kill the sentry, considering
the necessity of the bridge.

65
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,791
But if I live later,
I'll try to live in such a way,

66
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,194
doing no harm to anyone,
that it will be forgiven.

67
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,754
Come on, let's get this dynamite
somewhere safe.

68
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,476
You wait here, Roberto.
- Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.

69
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,793
You want to be shot at,
carrying these?

70
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,475
No, not even in a joke.

71
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,391
Go ahead.

72
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,275
Roberto!

73
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,157
He's the boss here, Roberto.
Very strong man. - I can see.

74
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,996
Foreigner? - And a friend.
Didn’t the old man tell you?

75
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,391
I'm asking you.

76
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,794
I'm here for the Republic.

77
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,430
You know those seals, don't you?
SIM, Service of Military Intelligence.

78
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,718
The General Staff
commands for the Republic.

79
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,759
In these mountains, I command.
No one else.

80
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,558
What's that?
- Dynamite.

81
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,032
Good. I can use dynamite.
How much you bring me?

82
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,908
None. What's your name?

83
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,516
What's that to you?
- Pablo. He's Pablo.

84
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,037
What for?
- A bridge.

85
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,829
What bridge?
- That's my business.

86
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,392
In this country, it's my business.
- Don’t talk so! - You want to die?

87
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,157
No! - Shut your mouth.
- This comrade comes for the Republic!

88
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,788
Anselmo!

89
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,273
Help us get this stuff
up to your camp. The old man's tired.

90
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,798
Hola! What is this that comes?

91
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,351
The old man and a dynamiter.

92
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,595
Hey, that stuff! Not in the cave.

93
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,519
What're you making?
- A trap for foxes.

94
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,993
See? Very practical.
- He catches rabbits.

95
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,398
If a Gypsy catches rabbits,
he says it's foxes.

96
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,918
If he catches a fox, it's an elephant.
- And if I catch an elephant?

97
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,073
You'd say it was a tank.

98
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,313
I'll get me a tank, old man!

99
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,349
Some day I'll get me one
and you can call it what you please.

100
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,752
Gypsies talk much, kill little.

101
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,038
I'm going for wine.
- Bring a cup for me.

102
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
You have wine, huh?
- And plenty of it.

103
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,996
We eat like generals here.
- Yeah, he eats like ten generals.

104
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,995
And what do Gypsies do in the war?
- They keep on being Gypsies.

105
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,358
That's a good job.
- The best.

106
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,877
How do they call you?
- Roberto. And you?

107
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,515
Rafael. Oh, wine!
- There will be food soon.

108
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,319
Food!

109
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,595
Oh, you have tobacco!

110
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,632
Yeah, I know these.

111
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,632
Much air and little tobacco.

112
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,392
Ah, we eat!

113
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,355
Hola!

114
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,789
Hola!

115
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,513
That's how I comb it.

116
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,069
Go ahead and eat.

117
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,356
Hey, bread!

118
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,798
How are you called?

119
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,668
María. And you?

120
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,795
Roberto.

121
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,035
Been here long?

122
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,998
This long.

123
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,470
Three months.
They shaved my head in Valladolid.

124
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,158
I was on the train heading south.
- The train Pablo blew at Arévalo.

125
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,711
Many of the prisoners were caught
again, but they saved me.

126
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,958
They and Pilar. - We found her hiding
in the rocks where she'd run off.

127
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,920
You should have seen her!

128
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,478
No hair at all.
Cried all the time.

129
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,431
And if anyone touched her,
she'd shiver like a wet dog.

130
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,230
Man, but she was ugly.
- God's truth, Roberto.

131
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,998
Though Gypsies usually lie.
She looked like a half-drowned kitten.

132
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,319
You blow trains?
- I have.

133
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,471
Here?
- No, in Extremadura.

134
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,436
In another six months it'll grow out.

135
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,190
Are you his woman?
- Pablo's?

136
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,353
You've seen Pablo!

137
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,517
I've seen Rafael too.
- No. No, not the Gypsy.

138
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,072
This is a very strange woman.
Is of no one.

139
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,630
But she cooks well.

140
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,996
Really of no one?

141
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,239
No one.

142
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,153
Nor of you, either.

143
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,909
No.

144
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,353
No. I have no time for women.

145
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,588
No?

146
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,592
María!

147
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,392
Who's that?

148
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,995
Pablo's woman, Pilar.

149
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,870
She's something barbarous!
But brave!

150
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,238
A hundred times braver than Pablo.
- Pablo was brave in the beginning.

151
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,915
He killed more people than cholera.

152
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,869
Yes, at the start he kill more people
than the bubonic plague.

153
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,989
But, Pilar,
she is something barbarous!

154
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,758
The Gypsy's afraid of her.
- Why not? She hates me.

155
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,913
Why?
- She treats me as a time waster.

156
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,993
She doesn't like Gypsies.
- What an injustice!

157
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,269
She has Gypsy blood herself.
She knows of what she speaks.

158
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,959
But she has a tongue.
It bites like a bull whip.

159
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,990
What are you saying now, you lazy son
of an unmentionable Gypsy?

160
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,674
Answer me, Gypsy!

161
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,108
I was telling this comrade
what a kind woman you are, Pilar.

162
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,593
Liar! - This one comes as a dynamiter.
- I know that.

163
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,798
Go and relieve Andrés.
He's on guard at the top.

164
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,714
I go, Pilar.
I'll see you, Roberto,

165
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,715
when we eat. - Not even in a joke!
3 times today you've eaten.

166
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,399
But I can eat twice more.
- Get out of here! And send me Andrés!

167
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,393
Hola, Inglés.

168
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,109
How are you and the Republic?
- Good.

169
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,671
Both good.
- I'm happy.

170
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,232
What did that Gypsy say about me?
- He said you were much woman.

171
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,835
And I'd say he's right.

172
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,070
And what did you say to the girl,
before I came out? - Nothing.

173
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,110
I saw how she was from seeing you.
- I only joked with her. - Jokes?

174
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,718
Listen to me, Inglés.
She's young, not hardened as we are.

175
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,908
And she's had a bad time.
You understand?

176
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,790
Yes, I guess so.
- I'm worried about her.

177
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,113
When do you leave here?
- In three days. If I'm still alive.

178
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,479
What made you say that?
That never brings luck.

179
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,996
Let me see your hand.

180
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,911
Well?
- Nothing.

181
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,677
I saw nothing. What do you come for?
Blow another train?

182
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,355
No, a bridge.
- All the better.

183
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,513
Now we have horses.
Let's blow all the bridges and go!

184
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,595
I'm sick of this place. We are rotting
here because there's no fighting.

185
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,790
Only watching Pablo get drunk.
This life is ruining him.

186
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,192
What did you see in my hand?
- I saw nothing.

187
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,999
Yes, you did.

188
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,790
I'm only curious. I don't believe
in it. - In what do you believe?

189
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,431
In my work.
- I saw that. - What else?

190
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,989
Nothing else.

191
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,197
The bridge is very difficult?
- No. It is important.

192
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,750
But it can be very difficult?
- Yes.

193
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,592
I'm going to look it over again.
How many men have you got here?

194
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,073
Five. The Gypsy is worthless,
although his intentions are good.

195
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,552
Pablo, I no longer trust.

196
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,198
Thanks. I like your way of speaking.
- I try to speak frankly.

197
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,672
Then tell me what you saw in my hand.
- No.

198
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,955
I saw nothing else.

199
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,398
Go now to the bridge.
I look after your equipment.

200
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,759
Let me tell you again, Inglés.
I'm glad you've come.

201
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,674
We will understand each other.

202
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,394
Can they not dwell outside?

203
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,118
I don't want dynamite in here.
We have fire.

204
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,990
It's far from the fire.

205
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,109
Smoke?

206
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,475
How goes the Gypsy?

207
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,269
Is she going to let you eat again?
- Why not?

208
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,830
Is there wine?
- Not much left.

209
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,559
Then I'll have some water.

210
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,154
María, is there any water left?

211
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,758
It's too strong,
or I'd give you some.

212
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,435
I'd offer it to you, Pablo,
but there's not much left.

213
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,238
I have wine.
- What drink is it?

214
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,359
Medicine, you wanna taste it?

215
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,637
What's it for?

216
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,998
It changes your ideas.
- Yeah?

217
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,959
Bitter as gall! I'd rather be sick
than have the medicine.

218
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,239
That's the wormwood.
I'm glad you don't like it.

219
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,910
What are you saying there?

220
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,908
I was explaining the medicine.
- María!

221
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,673
What's that?
- The bridge showing the construction.

222
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,957
Look how it seems.

223
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,357
Why, it's the bridge itself!

224
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,112
How do you blow a bridge?
- That's what I'm figuring out.

225
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,589
No!

226
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,915
I don't go for the bridge.
Neither me nor my people.

227
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,312
Then we'll do it alone. Old one?
- Yes.

228
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,599
Without this coward.
- Hey, you! What did you say?

229
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,878
Nothing for you. I spoke to Roberto.

230
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,194
My orders are to blow the bridge.
- And I say no!

231
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,636
In these mountains we hide.

232
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,878
I take care of my people.
Live one place, fight somewhere else.

233
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,511
Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,
but way off.

234
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,436
Not here where they will hunt us.
- You'll clear out. You've got horses.

235
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,392
I have 5 horses and 8 people.

236
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,588
You and the old man
with the loud mouth make ten.

237
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,111
Now if this bridge is blown,
we will be hunted.

238
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,990
Hunted from the earth, from the air.

239
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,274
The explosions will fall
from the sky on my horses.

240
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,990
Until you had horses,
you were one of us.

241
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,073
Now you're rich with horses,
you want to retire.

242
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,950
A lie! You know
I expose the horses for the cause.

243
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,477
To eat well, yes.
To steal, yes.

244
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,350
To murder, yes.
To fight for the Republic, no!

245
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,399
You are an old man
who will make trouble with his mouth.

246
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,669
I am an old man not afraid to fight.
I'm an old man without horses.

247
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,435
You might not live long.

248
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,037
I'm an old man
who will live until I die.

249
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,911
You will blow no bridge here!

250
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,711
No?
- No.

251
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,712
No bridge.

252
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,069
Pilar!

253
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,632
What do you say?
- I am for the bridge.

254
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,716
And for the Republic.
- What's that, woman?

255
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,998
I am for the bridge and against you.
Nothing more.

256
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,352
What do you say, Primitivo?
- I am also for the bridge.

257
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,949
Fernando?

258
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,956
To me the bridge means nothing.
I'm for the woman of Pablo.

259
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,150
Andrés!
- Yes, equally!

260
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,715
The same, Pilar.

261
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,989
Then we blow the bridge
and retreat to the Gredos afterwards.

262
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,710
You with your head of a bull
and heart of a hawk!

263
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,032
You think there'll be
any "afterwards", from this bridge?

264
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,034
I am for the Republic
and the Republic is the bridge!

265
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,955
It means nothing
to be hunted like a beast

266
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,636
after this thing
which brings no profit?

267
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,035
Nor even to die for it?

268
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,477
Don’t try to frighten us, coward!

269
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,228
Coward?
Is it cowardly to know what's foolish?

270
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,395
Or am I a leader for nothing?
Haven't I gotten you this far alive?

271
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,193
This foreigner comes to do a thing
for the good of the foreigners.

272
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,716
For his goal you want to sacrifice us!

273
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,671
I'm for the good and safety of all.
- Safety!

274
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,798
There is no such thing.

275
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,275
Did I spend 9 years with matadors
not to learn about fear and safety?

276
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,797
Speak to me of anything but safety!

277
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,590
Look at him.
How I believed in him once.

278
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,199
And look what he is now.
From a year of war you've become lazy,

279
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,909
a drunkard and a coward.
- Woman!

280
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,996
You have no right to speak like that.
Not before my people and a stranger.

281
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,154
Do you still believe
you command here?

282
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,394
Yes.

283
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,993
Here I command!
- Here I command!

284
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,474
Haven't you heard them?
Here no one commands but me now.

285
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,790
I should shoot you
and the foreigner both.

286
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,153
Try it and see what happens.

287
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,156
Listen to me, drunkard!
You understand now who commands?

288
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,394
Why, I command!
- No! Listen!

289
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,234
Take the wax from your ears.

290
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,631
Listen well.

291
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,793
I command.

292
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,033
Alright.

293
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,190
You command.

294
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,835
And if you want,
he can command too.

295
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,950
Maybe I am lazy
and drink too much.

296
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,911
Maybe you think I'm a coward,
though you know better.

297
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,833
Maybe.

298
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,959
But I'm not stupid.

299
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,949
Now if you're a woman as well as
a commander, show us something to eat.

300
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,188
María!

301
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,068
Take the food.

302
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,119
You must be careful.
- Pablo? - If you sleep, yes.

303
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,395
I'll watch out. What's he doing?

304
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,713
Only drinking. There will be danger
if he begins to hide the sadness.

305
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,232
If he pretends to be friendly,
then he's made a decision.

306
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,677
I heard Pilar say it.
- What kind of decision?

307
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,675
Who knows? After what's happened,
it'd mean danger for you.

308
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,834
I'll look after myself.
I'm thinking about the bridge.

309
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,268
I'm thinking about you, Roberto.

310
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,469
Why, María?

311
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, I don't know.

312
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,195
Did I muss it?

313
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,798
All day I wanted you to do that.

314
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,591
I too, María.

315
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,998
Where's Pablo?

316
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,394
Ah, he's gone to the horses.
Now you have to kill him.

317
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,315
Kill him before he kills you.
- He won't kill me.

318
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,996
We waited for you to kill him.
Why didn't you?

319
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,949
And turn Pilar against me?
She's in control here.

320
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,148
So, he takes the horses and goes.
What about your bridge then?

321
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,350
You don't know Pablo.

322
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,156
Now men,
you have tightened your garters.

323
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,319
You, my friend,

324
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,633
you know I'm not a coward.

325
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,476
You are no woman, no fool.

326
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,156
Nor any colt of a girl either

327
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,597
that makes a man crazy with hunger.

328
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,279
You don't lie, make insults,
and leave me, like my people.

329
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,876
Yes, eat, my friend.

330
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,356
Pay no attention to the woman.
You know who commands.

331
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,509
You and me,

332
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,189
we'll show them who's stupid.
Not me, not you, my friend.

333
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,073
Get out of sight!

334
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,192
Ours?
- German and Italian.

335
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,760
Can they see the horses?
- They're not looking for horses.

336
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,039
Man! I could see their faces!
- I spit in their faces!

337
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
I spit in the milk of their mothers!

338
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,235
I tell you they could see the horses.
- Wipe the sweat from your face.

339
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,757
They could see the cigarette butts.
- Huh?

340
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,436
Hey, wait! They may be back!
- Coward!

341
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,637
Go to your horses!

342
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,989
Have you seen planes like this before?
- Never, Inglés. - Get inside.

343
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,398
I'm going with Pilar to El Sordo.
We've got to have more horses.

344
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,031
You know your sentry posts.
Keep a close watch.

345
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,719
Anselmo, write down everything
that passes along the road.

346
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,078
I can't write, Roberto.
- I'll show you how to write.

347
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,358
Look how Roberto can make pictures.

348
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,714
That's a truck, see?

349
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,271
And here's a soldier on a horse.

350
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,834
Look! Tank!

351
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,711
I will catch me
a tank like that, old man.

352
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,188
Whatever passes, make a mark.
The man on the horse is for cavalry.

353
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,275
Each mark means a troop
of twenty mounted men. Understand?

354
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,277
Each troop a mark.
- In this way I can write, yes.

355
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,433
That's an educated pencil.

356
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,397
Use one paper for each direction.

357
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,553
Tonight I'll know then
what they're moving up to the front.

358
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,157
Better get along,
and take some food with you.

359
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,636
Can I write too?

360
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,637
Watch the bridge and sentry posts.
See if more soldiers are brought,

361
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,237
and at what intervals
the guard is changed.

362
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,552
What is "intervals"?

363
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,158
How many hours
the sentries stay on and when they go.

364
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,913
Without a watch?
- Take mine.

365
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,309
What a watch!
Look at what a complication.

366
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,518
It should be able to read and write.
- Don’t fool with it.

367
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,516
Can you tell time?
- Why not? 12 o'clock day... hunger.

368
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,310
6 o'clock night... drunk.
With luck.

369
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,231
Ten o'clock now.
- You don't need to be a clown.

370
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,757
Do what I tell you
and keep out of sight.

371
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,829
Salud, Gypsy. Did you see
the air machines? - See them?

372
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,038
We ate them for breakfast!

373
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,750
Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.

374
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,993
It's a long walk from La Granja.

375
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,234
La Granja?
- Yes, Roberto. You wish tobacco?

376
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,473
You?
- Didn’t you sleep here last night?

377
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,793
For a while, yes. Then I thought
of my woman and children in La Granja.

378
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,033
Then I went there.
- Wasn't that dangerous?

379
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,876
You have to get past their sentries.
That's why I only go at night.

380
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,589
Oh, María!

381
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,996
See much movement on the road?
- Nothing.

382
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,393
A few trucks as usual. Cars.
A few guns, as usual.

383
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,792
No troops.
- Pick up any news in town?

384
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,156
But nothing.

385
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,639
Still goes battle in the north.
That's not news.

386
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,397
Oh, yes... there is talk
of the Republic preparing an attack.

387
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,437
What?
- That we are preparing an offensive.

388
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,949
Where?

389
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,874
Perhaps here or near Navacerrada.

390
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,033
Have you heard of it?
- Who told you that?

391
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,035
Who?
Surely you know how rumors fly?

392
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,911
The officers talks in the cafes
and the waiters listen.

393
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,832
They say this is
an offensive of some size, but...

394
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,151
it's only a rumor.

395
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,119
What else did you hear?

396
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,798
Nothing, man.

397
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,992
There is some talk of the Republicans
wanting to blow the bridges, but...

398
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,919
Are you joking?
- This one doesn't joke, Inglés.

399
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,550
Bad luck he doesn't.

400
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,516
A man like me
is never alarmed by rumors, Pilar.

401
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,309
Remember anything more?
- No.

402
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,871
They talk as usual of soldiers to be
sent to clear us out of the mountains.

403
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,317
There is some talk troops are
on the way. But it's always like that.

404
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,555
It's not important.
Only rumors as usual.

405
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,474
Rumors! Everything as usual!

406
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,996
Things are bad in the north,
as usual!

407
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,676
That troops come
to hunt us out, as usual!

408
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,389
An offensive here, as usual!

409
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,236
Man, you are a monument
to "as usual".

410
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,995
But the last two, Pilar,
are only rumors.

411
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,358
My mother!
- Let's go, Pilar.

412
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,997
Who'll look after my things?
- The man of rumors.

413
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,790
Fernando, guard the explosives.
- Very well, Pilar.

414
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,910
Calm yourself. There is nothing
to worry about. Only rumors.

415
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,395
Wait!

416
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,632
Hello, María.

417
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,712
Hello, Roberto.

418
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,514
Inglés!

419
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,638
Hola, Pilar!
- Hola!

420
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,709
Joaquín! - María! - Tell Sordo
I'm coming with Inglés!

421
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,075
A good boy, Inglés.
El Sordo saved him

422
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,270
when his family was killed,
and now they are like father and son.

423
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,592
Inglés, tell me,
have you known many women?

424
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,797
They meant nothing.
- I think you lie.

425
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,671
Well, maybe... a little.
- And for this one, for María,

426
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,197
you care much?
- Let's get on.

427
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,870
What is the reason for the bridge,
Inglés? Will there be an attack?

428
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,549
And the airplanes this morning?
Does that mean the enemy's found out?

429
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,190
They're preparing a counterattack?

430
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,070
I only know one thing for certain.
- What? - You have to shout.

431
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,473
One thing is certain. The bridge
must go when the attack starts.

432
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,316
And to do that we've got to have
more horses and more men.

433
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,312
When do we blow it?

434
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,639
Day after tomorrow!

435
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,474
Why not tonight?

436
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,995
Orders.

437
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,118
How do you get whiskey?
- Make it!

438
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,034
No, I joke.

439
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,274
This is good whiskey,
we got it on a raid.

440
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,593
No ice. Plenty ice up there.

441
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,113
Too far.

442
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,236
Easier blow the bridge tonight.
- I'd be shot for it.

443
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,392
Do it in daylight, we'll all be shot.

444
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,634
Not if we have horses.
- Hmm? - Not if we have enough horses.

445
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,349
We'll be out of here before they come.

446
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,196
I have five horses and four men.

447
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,152
Five men, Sordo.
- So it is. Five with the boy.

448
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,630
Five men and five horses.

449
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,591
That's ten horses for 15 people.
We've got to have five more horses.

450
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,912
For the retreat, yes.
Otherwise we won't make it.

451
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,710
How can you get horses?
- Steal 'em.

452
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,399
Only soldiers have horses now.
Soldiers and thieves like us.

453
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,430
Can you get five more tonight?
- What? - Tonight!

454
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,991
We can try.
- Good.

455
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,119
Maybe not so good.
Not good if it snows.

456
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,193
Horses make tracks
and soldiers follow tracks.

457
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,354
It is too late for snow, Sordo.
- Hmm? - It's the month of May!

458
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,115
And the sun is shining.

459
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,152
Look at the young general.
Already he's stealing horses.

460
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,473
He's always talking, Pilar, how
he carried the girl from the train.

461
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,792
Let's see
you carry her down the hill, my boy.

462
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,713
Now you make fun of me.

463
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,276
Wait, Joaquín!
I'll carry you on my shoulders.

464
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,519
Look, Inglés!

465
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,117
Look at the bullfighter.
He's crying.

466
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,394
Don’t mock, Pilar.
He was telling me about his sister.

467
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,315
She was a prisoner as I was,
and he just heard that she's dead.

468
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,038
I'm your sister now, Joaquín.

469
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,069
We all love you.
We are your family. - Yes.

470
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,234
Including the Inglés. Is that right?
- Of course.

471
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,712
You hear that, boy?
The Inglés is your brother.

472
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,396
We're all brothers, Joaquín.
- Thank you, Inglés.

473
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,598
Don’t worry.
I'll get you a horse tonight.

474
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,436
One for María too.
- What about me?

475
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,994
Do I have to kiss you too? It's been
years since I kissed a bullfighter.

476
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,995
Hold this, Inglés,
till I get a good kiss at him.

477
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,390
Look at him! He's afraid of a kiss
as he was afraid of the bulls!

478
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,552
No need to joke.

479
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,112
When I kiss, it won't be as a sister.
This trick of kissing as a sister!

480
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,715
Don’t be so brutal, Pilar!

481
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,634
I love you very much,
but why do you speak so brutally?

482
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,349
Why do you think, girl?

483
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,390
Rest, Pilar! You are tired.
- Shut up! Nobody asked your advice!

484
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,314
You think I'm an old woman.

485
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,478
Sit down.

486
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,990
Many things tire me.

487
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,995
And one of them
is to be old and ugly.

488
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,198
And another is to see a boy panic
when I joke that I might kiss him.

489
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:22,596
It's not true. You didn't see that.
- What d' you know, with your face?

490
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,037
I have an evil temper today,
and I'm jealous.

491
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,590
How foolish.

492
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,910
I'm an ugly old woman,
and I love you very much, child.

493
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,677
I love you too. You're not ugly.

494
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,993
Go on, I'm not ugly!
I was born ugly.

495
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,234
Do you know how an ugly woman feels?

496
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,438
Do you know what it is
to be ugly all your life

497
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,832
and feel beautiful in here?
- You are beautiful.

498
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,676
Try to use your head
and not your heart, and listen.

499
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,709
I'm telling you things of much
interest. Does it interest you?

500
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,956
María's right.
- Two of a kind!

501
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,275
You are a prize for any woman.
If you'd ever let go of yourself.

502
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,511
And this one...

503
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,315
this one is a gift to any man,
if she could cook a little better.

504
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,668
Give me a cigarette and listen.

505
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,674
Life is very curious.

506
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:31,315
I would have made a good man,
but I'm all woman and all ugly.

507
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,236
Yet many men have loved me.
Is that strange?

508
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,677
I don't think you're ugly.

509
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,310
Don’t lie to me.
Or has it begun to work with you too?

510
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,312
No, no, no. Look, I am ugly.

511
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,791
Yet one can have a feeling here
that blinds a man while he loves you.

512
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,032
He thinks you are beautiful,
and one day, for no reason at all,

513
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,958
he sees you ugly, as you really are.
And he's not blind any more.

514
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,312
Then you see yourself
as ugly as he sees you.

515
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,712
And you lose your man
and your feeling.

516
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,194
Then one day the feeling,

517
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,720
that idiotic feeling that you are
beautiful, grows inside of you again.

518
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,952
And another man sees you
and thinks you're beautiful.

519
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,272
And it's all to do over again.

520
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,993
Now I am past it.
But it still might come again.

521
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,315
Lift your head,
this silliness is over.

522
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,475
I was only jealous of your 19 years.
It isn't a jealously that lasts.

523
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,189
You won't be 19 always.

524
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,995
You see,
I have evil thoughts, Inglés.

525
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,634
If I were 19, I'd take you away
from this cropped head,

526
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,759
even with my ugly face.

527
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,394
No, no, sit there. I have a surprise
for you. Close your eyes.

528
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,715
You too, Inglés.
No, tightly, both of you.

529
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,998
Pilar, wait!
- Shut up, Inglés!

530
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,995
I'm bored with both of you!
- Pilar!

531
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,751
Let her go, Roberto.

532
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,471
Don’t you want to be alone with me?
- Of course.

533
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,999
And I want to be with you, Roberto.

534
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,153
Pilar knows it. She knows everything.
- I'm beginning to believe it.

535
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,996
Will she be alright?
- You don't have to worry about her.

536
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,035
It's a wonderful day, Roberto.

537
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,634
What are you worrying about?
- About you.

538
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,999
Me? Why?
Because I'm so happy?

539
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,992
I wish you weren't here, María.

540
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,515
I mean it.

541
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,473
I'm thinking about what will
happen to you after the bridge.

542
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,908
Can't I go with you?

543
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,348
El Sordo will get us horses for sure.
I know we need them for the escape.

544
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,514
You've got to understand, María.
I'm in this war to the finish.

545
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,514
I can't have
anything serious in my life.

546
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,992
A man doing what I'm doing
never knows what's going to happen.

547
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,073
Whatever happens to you
will happen to me.

548
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,989
Haven't you anyone in the Republic?

549
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,039
No relatives all?
You must have people somewhere.

550
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,479
My father and my mother,
I saw them killed.

551
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,790
My father was the mayor of our town
and a Republican.

552
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,796
When the Nationalists came, they lined
up the Republicans against the wall.

553
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,349
My father cried out very loud,
"Long live the Republic!"

554
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,193
And then they shot him.

555
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,515
But my mother was not a Republican.
She had no politics.

556
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,397
But she loved my father
and she couldn't say that.

557
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:57,909
So she just looked at my father
who lay there at her feet, and said,

558
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,790
"Long live my husband
who was the mayor of this town."

559
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,350
She said it very loud,
like a shriek,

560
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,639
and then they shot and she fell,
and I wanted to got to her,

561
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,398
but we were all tied by the wrists
in a long line of girls and women.

562
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,314
And I wanted to be shot too
and say, "Long live the Republic

563
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,154
and my mother and my father."

564
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,314
Instead, there was no more shooting.

565
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,758
They herded us up the hill
and through the streets

566
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,196
to the square.

567
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,518
My father's office
was in the city hall,

568
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,596
but they took us
across the street to the barber shop.

569
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,558
I want to tell you.
- No. Don’t.

570
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,148
Roberto...

571
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,039
are you angry about something?

572
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,992
Of course not.

573
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,712
I'm glad.

574
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,668
I won't cry any more.

575
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,512
Oh Roberto...

576
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,199
I like...

577
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,990
I don't know how to kiss
or I would kiss you.

578
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,234
Where do the noses go?

579
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,351
Always I've wondered
where the noses would go.

580
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,349
They're not in the way, are they?

581
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,990
I always thought they would be.

582
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,276
Look, I can do it myself.
- María.

583
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,595
Did I do it wrong?

584
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,031
Look, Pilar!

585
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,159
Roberto fell in the brook.

586
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,274
Already she makes you blind, Inglés?

587
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,754
Can't even see where you're going.

588
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,632
Hola, Inglés.
Come sit down here where it's warm.

589
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,388
I'll take your shoes and put them
in the smoke of the fire to dry.

590
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,995
Hey, don't burn them. I don't want
to stand around here barefooted.

591
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,669
María, fetch me some dry socks.
- The lord and master.

592
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,072
Here's the key.
The pack is locked.

593
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,994
Who's on guard at the top?
- Agustín.

594
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,548
Put these on. Dry your feet well.

595
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,997
You can't dry them with your hair?

596
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,834
What a swine.

597
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,708
Hit him with a chunk of wood, María.

598
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,312
I'm joking because I'm happy.
- You are happy?

599
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,439
Yes. I think everything goes well.

600
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,597
Keep this under your feet
until your shoes are dry.

601
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,233
Must you care for him as a child?
- No. As a man who's cold and wet.

602
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,791
And a man
who has just come home to his house.

603
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,633
Take the coffee, worthless one.

604
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,232
Does it always grow dark this early?
- No, Inglés. It's the weather.

605
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,155
The wind is very disorderly.
- Getting colder out.

606
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,917
Yes, Inglés. It is not correct
to be so cold in the month of May.

607
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,198
Any movement on the road, Anselmo?
- Not much.

608
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,196
It's all marked on the papers.
- Gypsy, what about the bridge?

609
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,309
Six hour interval.

610
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,596
I stayed till they changed the watch,
at noon and at six.

611
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,152
It was a long watch, Inglés. And cold!

612
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,677
My... my bones brea...

613
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,799
How about the sawmill post?
- Eight men and a corporal.

614
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,557
No more arrived.
- What about the road-mender's hut?

615
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,795
I didn't get that far. I remembered
what you said. To be careful.

616
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,354
Only ten cars?
- All written down, Roberto.

617
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,512
Inglés!

618
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,110
How do you like it, Pilar?

619
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,875
Very beautiful, the snow, huh?

620
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,794
Get out of my sight!

621
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,355
God help El Sordo.

622
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,112
If it snows all night,
it may cover his tracks. - Lf, if!

623
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,268
How do you like it, woman?

624
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,390
How do you like to command
when it snows? - Shut up, drunkard!

625
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,070
I know why you went to see El Sordo.

626
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,515
Horses make tracks in the snow,
hey, Inglés? Yeah.

627
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:15,157
Now there will be no offensive.
No bridge. No. Just snow.

628
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,675
Yeah.

629
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,910
And no making love in the heather!

630
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,800
Watch your mouth!

631
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,712
No. Let me.

632
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,869
María!

633
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,158
Wipe the table clean, María!

634
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,199
Wipe your own spillings!

635
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,514
Wipe first your chin, drunkard,
and then the table!

636
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,151
Pay no attention to him. He's drunk.

637
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,433
Fix my shoes, María.

638
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,391
Are you really drunk?
- Why not?

639
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,030
But not too drunk to watch your mouth!

640
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,472
No one on guard at the top?
- In this storm?

641
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,599
What for? No soldiers will move
in these mountains tonight.

642
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,958
Pilar, bring me something hot to eat!

643
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,309
Wine, Inglés?

644
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,997
I thought I was Roberto.
- I call you Inglés before the others.

645
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,719
Roberto?

646
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,676
Don Roberto!

647
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:06,792
How is Don Roberto?
- Fine, Don Pablo. How's Bacchus?

648
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,836
Who is Bacchus?

649
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,595
You know. Your constant companion.

650
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,036
I don't know such a man.

651
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:21,434
You say funny things, Inglés.
- Sure, I do. I'm a laugh a minute.

652
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,515
Pay no attention. He's drunk.
- Tell us, Inglés,

653
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,037
why have you come so far
to fight for our Republic?

654
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,440
A man fights for what he believes in,
Fernando. - In his own country.

655
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,312
Maybe you feel I'm sticking my nose
into other people's business,

656
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,111
but I don't feel that way.
It's not only Spain fighting here.

657
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,237
It's Germany and Italy
fighting Russia.

658
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,713
And the Spanish are right in the
middle of it. The Nazis and fascists

659
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,874
are against democracy
and against the communists.

660
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,078
They're using your country
to test their new war machinery.

661
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:09,316
Their tanks and dive-bombers. So they
can destroy democracies like England,

662
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,837
France and my country before
we get armed and ready to fight.

663
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,117
Were you always a Republican?

664
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,316
And your father?
- Sure. He always voted Republican.

665
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,591
Did they shoot him for it?

666
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,788
No. They don't shoot you
for being a Republican in America.

667
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,351
Roberto was a professor.
He told me this afternoon.

668
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,399
Not a professor, María. An instructor.

669
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,872
That's the same thing.
He was a teacher in a college.

670
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,354
The professor has no beard.
He's a false professor.

671
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,196
Shut up!
What did you teach, Inglés?

672
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,388
Spanish.
That's how I got to know Spain.

673
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,598
No beard. He has no beard.
He's a false professor.

674
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,118
Stop it! - Wouldn't it
be easier to teach English?

675
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,910
Why shouldn't he teach Spanish?
Doesn’t he speak it?

676
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,519
Yes, but in a way it is undignified
for a foreigner to teach Spanish.

677
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,717
I mean nothing against you, Inglés.

678
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,396
He doesn't teach it to Spaniards!
- I should hope not...

679
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,112
Let me finish, you mule!
He teaches Spanish to Americans.

680
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,795
Can't they speak Spanish?
- Mule! North Americans speak English!

681
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,829
No beard, no beard.
- Enough!

682
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,312
But he's got no beard. Beard...

683
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,359
No beard.
- He does have a beard.

684
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,557
You should know, girl.

685
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,430
Pay no attention, Inglés. He's drunk.
- I don't think he's so drunk.

686
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,469
Yes. Yes, I am drunk.

687
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,039
I doubt it.

688
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,510
Cowardly, yes!

689
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,713
You try to provoke me, Inglés?

690
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,434
No, you won't get rid of me that way.

691
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,550
I said cowardly, not drunk!

692
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,074
See? See, I don't provoke.

693
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,199
Signal to the woman
that you've failed.

694
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,196
Pilar had nothing to do with it.
You spoke to the girl as a coward.

695
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,636
I don't provoke.

696
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,960
See, woman? I teach the professor
I don't provoke.

697
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,479
I'll still be alive,
when you're all dead!

698
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,999
I'm not stupid.

699
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,595
I don't provoke.

700
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,760
I don't provoke.

701
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,909
To the Professor,
to the Seńora commander,

702
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,151
and to all the illusioned ones.

703
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,552
That's silly.
It's a waste of good wine.

704
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,393
I don't provoke.

705
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,238
I am drunk.

706
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,519
The wise man gets drunk
to spend his time with fools.

707
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,029
Get out!

708
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,429
Yeah.

709
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,910
Yeah, I go.

710
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,392
I'll go to the horses.
They have more sense than men.

711
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,912
Tell them about the bridge, Professor,
and how to escape afterwards.

712
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,799
Who will lead your patriots
in the retreat? - Get out!

713
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,270
It's still falling, Inglés.

714
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,552
Let me go! I'll kill him!
- Give me that rifle!

715
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,277
Why didn't you kill him last night?

716
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,309
What do you think he'll do now?
- He will toss a bomb in here.

717
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,156
Give me your pistol. I'll shoot him.
- You want to blow us up?

718
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,394
What fools we are!
- Why didn't you kill him last night?

719
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,995
He's got to die now!

720
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,433
Pilar?

721
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,557
What do you say, Pilar?

722
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,788
Yes.

723
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,231
Whatever you will,

724
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,992
I'm for it now.

725
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,750
Then let all speak.
Andrés, what do you say?

726
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,152
Yes, kill him!
- Kill him.

727
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,398
Primitivo?
- Kill him.

728
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,633
Agustín?
- Do you need to ask? Kill him!

729
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,998
Fernando? - Don’t forget, Inglés,
he's smart and he knows the mountains.

730
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,756
Who will lead our retreat
after the bridge? - El Sordo!

731
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,597
He knows the way. Pilar, tell him
that El Sordo will lead us.

732
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,549
Couldn't we hold him as a prisoner?
- Who would look after him?

733
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,952
He is right, Fernando.
It would take us all to watch him.

734
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,518
Why not sell him to the enemy?
- Shut up, Gypsy.

735
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,992
That's filthy!
- No worse than Pablo.

736
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,069
If you'd blind him,
he will be easy to handle.

737
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,869
Watch your tongue, Gypsy!

738
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,999
Didn’t Pablo blind the civil guard
who was wounded?

739
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,914
Speak of blinding again
and you go with Pablo.

740
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,713
Pilar,
I haven't been allowed to finish yet.

741
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,997
Finish, then, finish!

742
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,073
I still maintain we need Pablo.

743
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:55,031
We should reason with him and point
out that his conduct... - Stop it!

744
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,955
Even here one man can make
a bureaucracy with his mouth!

745
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,675
You've voted to kill him.
Now have done with it!

746
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,514
Kill him when he returns.
- He must make the first move.

747
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,994
Why wait? Kill him! - In cold blood?
- You Ingleses are all cold.

748
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,595
Give me your gun! I'm burning!

749
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,072
Not in here. No shooting in here.

750
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,393
You'll see how cold my blood is
when that coward comes back!

751
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,398
Ugly. All of it's ugly!

752
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:53,036
Remember one thing, Inglés.
He wasn't always like this.

753
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,718
When the war broke out,
he wasn't the man you see now.

754
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,749
Brutal, yes,
but a leader without fear.

755
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,950
Without Pablo's help, the Nationalists
would have taken our town

756
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,148
the day the revolution began,
for many Nationalists lived there.

757
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,791
But Pablo organized the people,
and in the night

758
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,354
all suspects were dragged from their
beds and locked up in the city hall.

759
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,116
In the dark,
he surrounded the police barracks,

760
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,310
cut the telephone wires
and placed dynamite under the wall.

761
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,076
When morning came, he called on
the civil guards to surrender,

762
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,950
but they wouldn't.
So he blew the wall open.

763
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,277
But then there was a shout
for us to stop firing

764
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,877
and four civil guards
walked out with their hands up.

765
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,910
Pablo said, "Show us how to die,
you who have always done the killing."

766
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,710
"What are you going to do?",
the officer asked. "Shoot you."

767
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,588
Pablo passed behind them.

768
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,996
I can hear the pistol even now
and see the head of each man fall.

769
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,233
One held his head still
when the pistol touched it.

770
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,996
One shivered in his whole body
and his head was shaking.

771
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,313
Only one put his hands in front of his
eyes and he was the last one.

772
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:24,238
The hat fell from his head
and Pablo said, "Pilar, he's polite.

773
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,473
He takes off his hat
for a woman like you!"

774
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,913
A crowd was gathering
in the plaza before the city hall.

775
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,836
"Why is it done this way?",
they asked Pablo.

776
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:43,153
"To save bullets," he said,
"and to make all of you share in it."

777
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,597
I had picked up that hat
and a man said,

778
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,279
"Pilar, that's bad taste.
We're done with civil guards now."

779
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,719
Drunkards yelled,
as if at a bullfight,

780
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,588
"Let the bull out!
Pablo, let the bull out!"

781
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,197
And then everyone shouted,
"Here comes the first one!"

782
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,717
It was Don Perito García, the mayor.

783
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,113
He walked between the lines
and nothing happened.

784
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,830
He passed two men, four men,

785
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,152
eight men, and nothing happened.

786
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:27,553
From the roof someone shouted,
"What's the matter, coward?"

787
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,632
But nothing happened.

788
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,235
I was watching one man
who had a dispute with the mayor

789
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,791
about a piece of land,
and who hated him.

790
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,998
And it was this man
who first raised his flail.

791
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,997
Don Faustino Rivera
was known as an annoyer of girls.

792
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,518
He wanted to be known as a bullfighter
and went much with them and Gypsies.

793
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,354
But he was a coward
and was considered a joke.

794
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,435
But he was inspired by the example
of Don García and he stood there

795
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,594
looking handsome and brave,
and he made his face scornful.

796
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,912
Now the lines began to shout,
"Listen Don Faustino,

797
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,996
there are beautiful girls over
the cliff, why don't you chase them?"

798
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,752
It was then I knew
that the lines had become savage,

799
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:59,792
caused by the insult of Don García
and the cowardice of Don Faustino.

800
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:04,478
Don Guillermo wasn't a bad man. He was
only in politics because of his wife.

801
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,633
I heard her screaming, "Guillermo,

802
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,713
husband, wait. I'll go with you!"

803
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,435
He couldn't see her without his
glasses, but he looked up and waved.

804
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,400
And no one would hit him.

805
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,473
Then a drunkard yelled,
"Guillermo!"

806
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,190
"What bothers Pilar?", they asked me.
"I'm sick," I told them.

807
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,230
And they said, "Us too.
We'll take no further part in it."

808
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,995
But the worst was yet to come, Inglés,

809
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:53,155
when Pablo opened the city hall door
and let the mob in to kill the rest.

810
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,518
For yes, it was now a mob,
lacking any organization.

811
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,391
The snow has stopped, Inglés.

812
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,075
Now we'll have
good weather for the bridge.

813
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,994
Yes, I've come back to help you.

814
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,960
I cannot desert Pilar and my people.

815
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,679
Wait, man!

816
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,439
What trick is this, drunkard?
- No trick, Pilar.

817
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,149
I've changed my mind, that's all.

818
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,758
You're right about the bridge
and I'm with you now.

819
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,676
You'll need me for the retreat.
- Just what I said.

820
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,593
You were listening!

821
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,595
You're afraid of being killed.
That's why you've changed.

822
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,074
Do you think I like to hear
how we killed those men?

823
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,790
If I could bring them back to life,
I'd do it. - Liar!

824
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,909
No, I mean it. I wish
I could bring them back to life,

825
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,993
even Don Ricardo who cursed me.
- Stop it!

826
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,439
Yes, I would restore them all to life.
That's God's truth.

827
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,879
And it's also true
that I'm with you now.

828
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,516
I was drunk.

829
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,469
Now I'm not drunk
and I've changed my mind.

830
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,989
Either trust me or not, but no one
can get you to the Gredos as I can.

831
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,995
I believe you.
But take an oath.

832
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,598
Are you with us and for the bridge?
- Yes, man.

833
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:45,951
You think it can be successful despite
the snow? - There will be no snow.

834
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,510
You have confidence?

835
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,112
Why not?

836
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,839
Fools! Lunatics!

837
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,391
You're all crazy if you believe him!

838
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,399
What, Roberto?
- A trooper.

839
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,790
What does it mean?
- I don't know.

840
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,593
See anything?
- No.

841
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,793
Are you sure it was a trooper?
- Yes.

842
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,634
Where's Pablo?
- In the cave.

843
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,594
Man, what a horse!
- Never mind, get in the saddle.

844
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:39,028
This horse must make tracks out again.
- You have much sense, Inglés.

845
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,319
I'll ride him in the hills
until the snow's melted.

846
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,598
Keep your eyes open.
There's bound to be more cavalry.

847
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,595
Get the machine gun and my binoculars.
We've got to cover the pass.

848
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,958
Both of you give him a hand.
Go back to that soldier

849
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,749
and see if you can find more clips.

850
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,879
And leave his pockets alone!

851
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,197
Roberto! Roberto, I'm coming with you!

852
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,398
Go back. Tell Pilar to pack.
We may have to run for it. - No.

853
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,997
Go back, María. There may be a fight.
- I'll help you. - No!

854
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,153
Let me help you.
- Go back!

855
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,996
Let me go with you. I want to help.
- Then go back!

856
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,392
Kiss me.

857
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,234
You're shameless.
- Yes.

858
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,112
What's happened to that Gypsy?
- I saw him coming down.

859
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,034
Then he saw a rabbit
and went after it.

860
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:10,597
Fine time to go hunting. Primitivo,
climb up that rock as high as you can.

861
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,037
If you see soldiers,
throw a stone for a signal. Wait.

862
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,273
If you see one soldier, raise
your rifle like this. - Like this?

863
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:21,719
If more than one, pump it like this.
One for each soldier. Understand?

864
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,189
Yes.

865
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:29,751
Anselmo, go to Agustín and hold
the gun's legs, if I have to shoot.

866
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,828
Here, hold this for me. - For what?
- I'm liable to shoot me a Gypsy.

867
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,276
Look! Now we'll have fresh meat.

868
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,036
See?
Does something annoy Roberto?

869
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,228
If you weren't a Gypsy, I'd shoot you!
- But why?

870
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,791
Look at how fat they are!

871
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,315
Get down!

872
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,233
Rifles!
- Now the soldiers are hunting.

873
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,799
Wait here.

874
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,637
Is it Pablo?
- El Sordo.

875
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,598
Come, Inglés, now they need us.
- Where? - To join in with El Sordo.

876
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,798
To die there?
Don't you realize they're lost?

877
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,510
It's too risky.
We have to think about the bridge.

878
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,117
Why that's our friend El Sordo!
- Listen... - I listen to that!

879
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,159
Are you afraid
to fight for our friends?

880
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,272
Roberto!

881
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,272
We could hear the firing at the cave.
I was afraid...

882
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,275
You shouldn't have come here.
- I let her. She was half crazy.

883
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,319
She thought you were fighting.
- Why aren't we fighting?

884
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:38,713
They want to go to El Sordo.
- Have you lost your minds?

885
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,270
What kind of locos are you?

886
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,831
Men, not women!
- Then act like men!

887
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,915
You'll die soon enough.
- Swallow your tongue and choke!

888
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,514
Silence!

889
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,878
What use is courage
if you have no head?

890
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,273
El Sordo has both.
He'll understand.

891
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,076
Was he coming with the horses?

892
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:07,600
Looks like he did his best
to lead them away from us.

893
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,475
Did you hit him?
- Pot full of grease-backed bat.

894
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,314
I'll tell you
who's a pot full of grease:

895
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:22,792
Pilar. She knows we are dying here.

896
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,113
What could Pilar do?
- Take them from the rear. - How?

897
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,594
They're all around the hill.
100, 200... maybe more now.

898
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,549
Bandidos, cobardes! Can you hear me?

899
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,235
You sons of four-legged devils!

900
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,834
Surrender now, you bandits,
before our planes blow you to bits!

901
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,398
Will they send planes?

902
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,879
With bombs or machine guns?
- Both, my son.

903
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,190
I'm giving you a chance to surrender
before the planes come.

904
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,750
You hear what I am saying, bandidos?

905
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:12,038
Let's insult him.
Maybe he'll show his head.

906
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:17,514
Do you surrender?
- Who has a big pistol? - Here.

907
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:22,713
The planes are coming!
Do you surrender?

908
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,957
He can't wait for the planes.
He wants to be a hero,

909
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,874
to lead us back
with a rope around our necks.

910
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,430
Have you seen any movement since the
shots? - No sir.

911
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,991
What do you think?
- I don't believe it.

912
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,392
Why shouldn't they do it?
They knew they had to die.

913
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,030
It's better than being bombed
or captured, isn't it?

914
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,159
I think it's a trick.
What about the planes?

915
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,075
They should have come a long time ago.

916
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,870
How many shots did you count?
- Five. - It's ridiculous

917
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:37,149
if they are dead! Ridiculous
to hide down here from dead men!

918
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,677
I think we should wait
for the planes, sir.

919
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,438
Fire, cowards, if you are alive!

920
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,071
Fire on a man
who has no fear of you!

921
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,597
Shoot, you saffron-bellied swine!

922
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,078
Now do you believe me?
No one's alive up there.

923
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,597
You! Go up and see.

924
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:14,510
Don't you hear me?
- Yes, my captain. - Then go!

925
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:18,754
Do you hear me? - Yes, my captain.
- Why don't you go then?

926
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:22,675
I don't want to, my captain.
- You don't want to?

927
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,992
I'm afraid, my captain.
- Captain Mora! - Lieutenant Berrendo!

928
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,597
It is possible the soldier is right.
- Right to say he's afraid?

929
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,152
Right to say he wants to disobey?
- No sir. Right that it's a trick!

930
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,997
Don't you hear me, they're all dead.
- You mean our comrades on the slope?

931
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:43,871
I agree, sir.
- Very well, the sniper stays here.

932
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,795
I'll take care of him later.
You and I will go to the top.

933
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:52,432
Not me. - What? - I will go
if you order me. But under protest.

934
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:59,234
No, I'll go alone. The smell
of cowardice is too strong here.

935
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,035
Assassins! Cowards!

936
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,829
Shoot me! Kill me!

937
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,319
Can you hear me coming?
No, you can't hear me coming.

938
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:15,713
You think I'm a coward
like the others? Shoot me!

939
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,351
Kill me!
- "Shoot me! Kill me!"

940
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,149
Cowards!
- Look at him coming.

941
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,597
Scum of the earth! - What an animal!
- Shoot me if you are alive!

942
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,675
Look at him stride.
- Bandidos! - This one is for me.

943
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,993
Do you hear me? - This one
we take with us. - No, you don't hear.

944
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,960
Keep walking.
- Cowards!

945
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,239
Look at the stars. He's a captain.
Stick out your chest, little captain.

946
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,792
I will kill you with a bullet!
- Don't stop. Don't be late, captain.

947
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,998
You vermin!
- A long voyage...

948
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,119
Fire! Cowards!
If you are alive! Come on.

949
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,789
Now comrade voyager, close enough.
Come on, voyager.

950
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,679
Can you hear me coming?

951
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,196
No, you can't hear me coming.

952
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,477
I am coming.

953
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,275
"Kill me! Shoot me!"

954
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,393
Joaquín!

955
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,395
Quick!

956
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,713
A little higher!

957
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,589
Pilar!

958
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,119
Pilar!

959
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,638
Hola, Pilar.
- Hola.

960
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,996
Salud, Roberto.
- Salud.

961
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,598
Salud, Pilar.

962
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,232
Look at him. Already at the wine!

963
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,598
Did you come back for us, or the wine?
- Both.

964
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,309
He came back for his horses.

965
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:15,514
Much riding, Inglés. I couldn't turn
back till the snow has melted.

966
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,510
Didn't you run into the cavalry?
- A good horse, the new one.

967
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,595
I took to high ground
and came back through the hills.

968
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,592
No food, Pilar? Where have you been?
- Guarding the pass below.

969
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,072
We had to wait
until there was no more cavalry.

970
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,709
Inglés!

971
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:41,431
Inglés! I was with El Sordo.

972
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,713
You were in the fight?
- No.

973
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,275
On my way back here...

974
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:57,196
It was dark and I went up the hill.

975
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,676
Five dead at the top.
They'd taken their heads.

976
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,232
Joaquín too?

977
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,360
No heads...
- Now let the fighting come.

978
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,830
No heads.
- Inglés!

979
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:19,152
Anselmo says there is
much movement across the bridge.

980
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:23,118
I was just leaving the lookout
when it started. - What?

981
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:28,196
Guns, trucks, armored cars,
even tanks. - Tanks?

982
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:33,515
Everything moving up toward the front.
I marked it all down.

983
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,990
I waited till the second column had
crossed. - Anything more coming?

984
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,951
Yes, I could hear another column
as I came up through the pass.

985
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,591
Should I go back? - Not now.
Were these trucks full of soldiers?

986
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,230
Yes. What does it mean?

987
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:54,395
They know the Republic is going
to attack when the sun rises.

988
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,429
Yes, now they know.
They move up to meet our offensive.

989
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,709
Who knows the way through to the
Republicans? - I do.

990
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:05,635
I need you at the bridge. Who else?
- I know it.

991
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:09,589
Have you been through before? - Twice.
- 8 hours, nearly 9 hours.

992
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,833
Can you make it to Navacerrada?
- I can try.

993
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:17,711
I could do it in less time, with luck
and no pack. - I need you here.

994
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,829
Our route was longer because
we carried explosive. It was safer.

995
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:27,394
I will get there as well as another.
And something could happen to anyone.

996
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:43,510
This dispatch is for General Golz.
Remember the name, "Golz".

997
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,117
Where will I find him?
- Ask when you get to our lines.

998
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,514
This seal ought to get you through.
If you have problems, show this here.

999
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,311
You've got seven hours at the most.
The attack is set for sunrise.

1000
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:02,475
I prefer to be with you at the bridge.
- Get this to General Golz

1001
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,599
and we won't have to blow the bridge.
We'll all escape to the Gredos safely.

1002
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,834
Remember, the bridge's got to go
if the attack starts.

1003
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,152
Pablo! Pablo, come back!

1004
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,754
Pilar!

1005
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,151
Pablo has gone!

1006
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:21,230
Didn't I tell you he was a coward?
You and your confidence!

1007
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:24,757
If it wasn't for you,
I would have killed him last night!

1008
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:29,676
I have been betrayed.
- Betrayed! Listen to him!

1009
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,039
He has been betrayed! You fool!

1010
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:39,118
No slanders, please!
- Forget it! I'm the one to blame.

1011
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,877
Andrés, you better get going.
And good luck.

1012
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,479
Should I go back
and guard the horses?

1013
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,519
Fool!
- No. I'll look after them.

1014
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,593
Who will lead the retreat now?
- Shut up, Gypsy!

1015
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,390
Andrés will get to the general.
- Get back in the cave. Pilar,

1016
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,678
get everything ready for the bridge.
And get some sleep.

1017
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:08,153
I'll look after the horses.
Look after my things.

1018
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,109
Salud!

1019
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:27,190
Don't shoot, comrades.
- Who are you?

1020
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,158
A comrade, Andrés Lopez,
with a dispatch for General Golz.

1021
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,997
Say the password, if you're a comrade!
- I don't know any password.

1022
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,437
Toss a bomb at him.
- No, that would be a great mistake.

1023
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,990
He's not alone, Pedro. Toss a bomb!
- No. Please.

1024
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,710
I'm completely by myself.
Allow me to show you my papers.

1025
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:51,069
Sure you're alone?
- How many times must I to tell you?

1026
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,515
Stand up!

1027
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,033
Put your hands above your head!

1028
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,793
Come on!

1029
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:07,753
I'm in a big hurry. I have a dispatch
for General Golz at Navacerrada.

1030
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:11,755
Where? - Inside my shirt. How can I
show it to you with my hands up?

1031
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:16,995
You're a long way from Navacerrada.
I will take you to Captain Gómez.

1032
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,999
Spy!

1033
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,792
I brought your robe.
I'll fix it for you.

1034
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:55,238
Was this your idea or Pilar's?

1035
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:59,189
Mine.
But Pilar told me to come.

1036
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,949
Even if she'd told me not to come,
I would have come.

1037
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:18,791
Will there be fighting tomorrow?
- Are you afraid?

1038
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:24,079
I'm afraid for you so much
I do not think of me.

1039
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:28,237
Pilar told me that
I'm to go with you, after the bridge.

1040
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,474
That you'll take me to the Republic.
- You and Pilar will have horses.

1041
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,997
You'll be safe with Pilar.
That leaves 3 horses for the others.

1042
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,868
But I go with you, not Pilar.

1043
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,397
I came on foot with the old man
and shall go the same way. - No!

1044
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,076
Pilar says no one
will get out alive without a horse.

1045
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:51,235
But if Andrés gets through,
there will be no bridge, will there?

1046
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,317
Will there, Roberto?

1047
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:57,838
No.

1048
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:03,996
Maybe I should've sent word sooner
about the movements here.

1049
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,357
How much time have we left?

1050
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,392
A lifetime, María.

1051
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,876
I mean until daylight.

1052
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,795
Five, six hours.

1053
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:34,551
Pilar told me
that time is not important.

1054
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,996
Maybe Pilar's right.

1055
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:41,632
Three days and three nights.
Yet they're everything.

1056
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:46,591
Longer than the months in prison.
Longer than the years I've lived.

1057
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,232
She told me something else
when I left the cave:

1058
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,110
"We must live all our life
in the time that remains."

1059
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,229
She said...
- What?

1060
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,275
What did she tell you?
- We would all die tomorrow.

1061
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:15,797
And that you know it too.
- She's crazy.

1062
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,192
Nothing more than Gypsy superstition.

1063
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,668
You don't believe it?
- Of course not.

1064
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:29,279
She had a reason for telling me.
She said I must tell you all

1065
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:32,319
that happened to me
when they shot my mother and father.

1066
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,473
You've told me.
- No.

1067
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,792
No, I didn't tell you what happened
when they herded us up the hill

1068
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,794
and to the barber shop.
- I don't want to hear it.

1069
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,430
Two men looked at me and one said,

1070
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,274
"That's the daughter of the mayor."

1071
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:53,433
The other said, "Commence with her."
They took me to the barber shop

1072
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:57,196
and put me in the chair and held me.

1073
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,793
In the mirror I could only see
my mother and my father

1074
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,998
at the moment of the shooting.

1075
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:10,155
My mother's words were in my head
like a scream that went on and on.

1076
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,994
And I could fell a pain.

1077
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,551
They were pulling at my hair
and cutting it off with a razor.

1078
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:21,191
And then they put the braids
in my mouth...

1079
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:24,592
and tied them around my neck
to make a gag.

1080
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,788
Then they ran clippers across my head.

1081
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:36,389
I commenced to cry, because until then
I'd been too frozen to feel anything.

1082
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,831
In the mirror,
I could see the men laugh.

1083
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:47,592
I couldn't look away from the horror
my face made with braids in my mouth.

1084
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:56,590
When they took me out,
I stumbled over the dead barber.

1085
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,833
They had shot him
because he belonged to a union.

1086
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:04,995
Then I saw my best friend
being dragged in by two more men.

1087
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:08,836
When she saw me, she screamed.
She screamed the whole time

1088
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,390
they were shoving me
across the square

1089
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:16,430
and into the doorway
and up the stairs of the city hall,

1090
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:21,550
to the office of my father, where they
put me on the couch. - María.

1091
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,994
The worst things were done there.
- Quiet. Don't think about it.

1092
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,598
I was going to tell you
on the way back from El Sordo,

1093
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,595
but I was glad
when you wouldn't let me.

1094
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,276
Then I was happy,
as if it had never happened.

1095
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,390
No. Tonight, Pilar said
I must tell you everything.

1096
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,233
And now you won't love me.

1097
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:59,390
Tomorrow you'll take me through the
lines and I'll never see you again.

1098
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,997
Never. You won't want me.

1099
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,992
No, Roberto,
we can't change things.

1100
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:16,071
But it's true
I never kissed any man until you.

1101
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:21,395
When it happened I fought until they
tied my arms. - No one's touched you!

1102
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,792
You believe that?
- I know that.

1103
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,395
And you can love me?

1104
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:34,509
I can love you more.

1105
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,395
I could see your headlight from afar.
You want to bring down a shelling?

1106
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,156
Where is the lieutenant colonel?
- He's asleep. Who is the bandit?

1107
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,233
He bears a dispatch for General Golz
who commands the attack.

1108
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:11,918
You're crazy. I know no General Golz,
nor no attack.

1109
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:15,869
Get back to your battalion.
- Call the lieutenant colonel.

1110
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,918
Away!

1111
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,833
Call him!

1112
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:26,148
All you barbers are emotional.
Orderly!

1113
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:33,870
Call the lieutenant colonel. Don't
forget, I'm your superior officer.

1114
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:38,193
I'm not afraid of your threats. Cynics
like you would be eliminated...

1115
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:42,752
"First" is the word you want.
- As long as they liquidate you.

1116
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:46,789
"Liquidated" is a word foreign
to Spain. - Shot, then!

1117
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:52,194
That's Spanish, can you understand it?
- Yes, but don't talk so loud!

1118
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,875
Your emotions bore me.

1119
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:58,714
Hello, Gómez.
- Colonel.

1120
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,190
What brings you?

1121
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,873
Why didn't this get here sooner?
- Stupidity.

1122
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:16,431
I'm not sure
you can get through now.

1123
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,118
Write them a very strong safe-conduct.
You'll need something strong tonight.

1124
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,670
We're careful before an offensive.

1125
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,036
You know
what I've been thinking about?

1126
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,394
What I should do
to take care of you well.

1127
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:35,396
I'll learn from Pilar
and other things you can tell me.

1128
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,110
What about me taking care of myself?
- But you don't.

1129
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,832
You should have hung out your
sleeping robe in the sun this morning.

1130
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:48,995
Before the dew comes,
it should have been taken in. - Go on.

1131
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,998
Your socks should be washed.
I would see that you have two pairs.

1132
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,799
What else?

1133
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,270
This. I would learn how to fire it.

1134
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:05,310
That's easy. I'll teach you.
- Then if you're wounded,

1135
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,950
I could kill you and then myself.

1136
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:11,994
Do you have many ideas like that?

1137
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:17,394
No, not many.
But it's a good one in this war.

1138
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:21,597
Pilar gave me this one
and showed me how to use it.

1139
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,798
I always keep it with me.
- Razor blade?

1140
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:29,239
She says there's no pain
if you press quickly and firmly.

1141
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,756
And they can't stop it if it's done.

1142
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:36,312
Not if you cut the artery.
How long have you had it?

1143
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,995
Ever since I was rescued.

1144
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,515
But I'd rather have you shoot me.

1145
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,435
Promise me if there's ever any need
that you will shoot me.

1146
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,790
Sure. I promise.

1147
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:59,790
Thank you very much.
I know it's not easy to do.

1148
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:08,550
But there are other things
I can do for you.

1149
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:12,272
Besides shoot me?
- Yes. I can roll cigarettes

1150
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:17,515
when your box is empty.
- Without spilling tobacco? - Yes.

1151
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,596
And if you're wounded, I'll take care
of you, wash you and feed you.

1152
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,834
Maybe I won't be wounded.
- If you're sick,

1153
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:31,791
I'll make soup and read to you.
- Maybe I won't get sick.

1154
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:35,112
Then I'll bring you coffee.
- Maybe I don't like coffee.

1155
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,354
This morning you had two cups.
- Suppose I get tired of coffee,

1156
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:44,117
I'm not wounded or sick, I give up
smoking, have only one pair of socks,

1157
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,988
and roll up my robe myself.
What then?

1158
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:51,996
Then I'll cut your hair with Pilar's
scissors. - I don't like that.

1159
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:56,473
Neither do I.
I like your hair the way it is.

1160
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:04,714
So if there's nothing to do for you,
I'll sit by you and watch you.

1161
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:07,759
And in the nights we'll make love.

1162
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:13,278
You are shameless.

1163
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:18,390
If you don't love me,
I love you enough for both.

1164
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,990
I was asleep.

1165
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,391
I'm sorry I woke up.
I didn't know I was sleeping.

1166
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:09,590
It was so beautiful in your house.
- My house? - Yes.

1167
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:14,673
In America. The one you told me about.
Where you were a little boy.

1168
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,992
Does the stairway turn at the top,
like this?

1169
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,313
And there is the door to your mother's
room? Yes, that's how it was.

1170
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:25,109
Your mother was there,
and your grandfather

1171
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,512
who fought in the American Civil War.
- He's dead.

1172
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:32,993
He was there, just as you described
him. I liked him very much.

1173
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,868
And I loved your mother.

1174
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:41,354
She was holding a child
who looked exactly like my Roberto.

1175
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:46,993
When I asked her whose son it was,
she said, "Why, it's yours, María."

1176
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:56,588
That's why I had to look at you.
- Maybe you weren't dreaming.

1177
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,834
No, I was there,
just as real as I'm here now.

1178
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:04,596
Can't you wait till I take you there?
- Oh Roberto,

1179
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,788
that, too, is like a dream,
like a wonderful dream.

1180
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:16,111
My hair amuses you because it's odd.
But every day it's growing.

1181
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:20,195
And it will be long
and I will not look ugly.

1182
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,591
Perhaps you will love me very much.

1183
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:30,919
All the things you've told me tonight,
it's... it's as if

1184
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:34,596
you'd already taken me to Madrid
and to America.

1185
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,878
That's just the beginning.
Wait till this war is over.

1186
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:41,397
Do I please you?
Will you always take me with you?

1187
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:46,351
Unless you run away from me.
- No, I'll never go away from you.

1188
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:49,797
I loved you when I first saw you,

1189
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:53,237
I always have,
though I never saw you before.

1190
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:56,473
Now I'm your woman.
I'll always be your woman.

1191
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:57,995
Always!

1192
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:06,997
Where is the headquarters
of General Golz of the 35th division?

1193
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:10,198
Not here. - I was told
he was in the vicinity. What is here?

1194
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,876
The comandancia.
- Of what? - Who are you?

1195
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:18,751
Captain Gómez of the 65th brigade
and I ask where is General Golz.

1196
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,876
I can hear the wind in the trees.

1197
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,988
Now it will soon be light.

1198
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:38,270
Will we ever come back?

1199
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,638
Some day, María.

1200
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,788
And stay here again?
- Some day.

1201
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:54,396
Do you think Andrés got through?

1202
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,598
We can't tell until sunrise.

1203
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:02,392
Are you afraid?

1204
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:04,913
Not now.

1205
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:09,712
I love you, Roberto.
Always remember.

1206
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:13,671
I love you
as I love my father and mother,

1207
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,152
as I love our unborn children,

1208
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:21,314
as I love what I love most
in the world, and I love you more.

1209
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,597
Always remember.

1210
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,991
I'll remember.

1211
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,711
Nothing can ever part us now, can it?

1212
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,951
Nothing, María.

1213
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,792
Inglés!

1214
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:39,759
Inglés!

1215
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:42,833
What is it, Pilar? What's wrong?

1216
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:45,993
It must have been Pablo!
- Pablo's gone. What do you mean?

1217
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:49,790
Your exploder!
The box that explodes the dynamite.

1218
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:53,590
When I stirred up the fire for coffee,
I found it.

1219
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,276
What? - It was under the ashes.
- I thought you were guarding it.

1220
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:59,796
I slept with your things!
- You slept well!

1221
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:03,272
He must have done it last night
before we got back.

1222
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:06,433
Maybe it will work again.

1223
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:12,870
Is there no other way to explode
the charges? - Yes, sure.

1224
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:16,113
A bad way, but I can do it.
That swine!

1225
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:20,399
What is the way, Inglés?
- Get me your hand grenades.

1226
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:43,669
Do they always explode?
- Yes, but not strong enough.

1227
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:47,755
I didn't ask that.
Have they always exploded? - Always.

1228
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:59,593
I've brought 3 more men from the band
of Elias. - Traitor.

1229
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:06,238
I've come back, Pilar, and I've
brought more men for the bridge.

1230
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,678
Did you do that?
- I had a moment of weakness.

1231
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:12,991
Kill him, Inglés!

1232
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,311
Yes, I meant to leave.

1233
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:22,999
Having seen what happened to El Sordo,
I was afraid to die.

1234
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:27,996
But having done such a thing,
I was lonely.

1235
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:32,598
Do you understand loneliness?
- I understand cowardice!

1236
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,073
Don't mock me, woman.
Don't you see I've come back?

1237
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:43,034
I've thought of a way
to explode the dynamite.

1238
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,078
So have I.

1239
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:49,393
The only reason I don't
shoot you is because we need you.

1240
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:55,588
I've brought more men
for the bridge, Inglés.

1241
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:03,033
They think I'm still the leader here.
Or they wouldn't have followed me.

1242
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:12,273
You are if you wish. For the fighting.

1243
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,989
I suppose when a man has something
once, always something remains.

1244
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,356
Our men are waiting below.
Tell them we're coming.

1245
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:26,833
Don't worry about the retreat.
Now we have three more horses.

1246
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:31,791
And three more men!
- Maybe they won't need their horses.

1247
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,710
You have much control, Inglés.

1248
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,792
I'm glad he's back.
No matter what he is, we need him.

1249
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:56,719
One last thing I must tell you.
In that thing of the hand...

1250
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:00,795
What thing of the hand?
- No, listen. Don't be angry.

1251
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,998
When I looked in your hand,
it was just Gypsy humbug.

1252
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:08,075
Gypsies do that to make themselves
important. - Sure, sure. Forget it.

1253
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,950
I don't want you to worry.
- Who's worrying?

1254
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:16,956
The truth is, I saw only happiness
for you and the cropped head.

1255
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:21,797
I know that.
And I don't need a nurse.

1256
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:27,433
I care for you very much, Inglés.
Remember that and don't worry.

1257
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:31,389
Everything will go well at the bridge.
- Sure. Let's go.

1258
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,756
Get your things together.

1259
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:14,392
Are the orders clear now?
- Yes. Take the road-mender's hut,

1260
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:18,475
destroy the post and stop anything
from getting through to the bridge.

1261
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:22,475
Right. But not a move unless you hear
the falling of bombs. - Yeah. Clear?

1262
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:31,400
You, Pilar, the same with the sawmill.
Don't shoot unless we hear the bombs.

1263
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:34,997
Don't alarm the sentries
unless you hear the bombs.

1264
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:39,393
Don't worry about the retreat, Inglés.
We'll have plenty of horses.

1265
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,268
Get along before he steals
the rest of your things.

1266
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:45,797
You don't understand me, woman.
We understand each other.

1267
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:50,079
Nobody understands you.
Neither God, nor your mother, nor I.

1268
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,596
Nor you, either.

1269
02:13:58,960 --> 02:13:59,995
Come.

1270
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:08,198
Goodbye. See you soon.

1271
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,990
Goodbye, Roberto. Take much care.
- Of course.

1272
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,033
Don't cry.

1273
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,989
No, I don't. But come back to me.
- I will.

1274
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,868
Don't worry if you hear firing.

1275
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:25,714
Only come back quickly.

1276
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,597
Bye, María.

1277
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:31,477
Salud, Roberto.

1278
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:55,152
Get across the gorge
and don't fire unless I do.

1279
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:58,632
When the sentry is eliminated,
come to the middle of the bridge.

1280
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,996
It is all clear to me.

1281
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:05,398
I will do as you order.

1282
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:12,989
When you fire, don't think of it
as a man, but as a target.

1283
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,790
And if anything happens to me,
you'll have to finish the job

1284
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:19,998
as I showed you.
Go now.

1285
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:24,679
Until soon, Roberto.
- Until soon, Anselmo.

1286
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,398
Captain Gómez, 65th brigade.
An urgent dispatch for General Golz.

1287
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:24,794
Why didn't this get here sooner?
- Stupidity and crazy suspicion.

1288
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:29,557
General Golz! Urgent!
But I just spoke to him.

1289
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:32,997
Segovia? I'll try there.

1290
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:41,596
No, no, no!
Get me position Ávila!

1291
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,631
Where's General Golz?

1292
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:47,198
Planes 1?

1293
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,150
Get me Planes 1!
- Can't you call the airfield?

1294
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:53,710
General Golz! Not there?

1295
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:57,195
I called Segovia!

1296
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:03,313
Get me Segovia again! Quick, man!
- Stop the bombardment!

1297
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,597
You think I want to get shot?

1298
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:36,313
Yes, Golz. Golz! General Golz?

1299
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,873
From Jordan? Yes, read it.

1300
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,069
What?

1301
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:54,079
Too late, Duval!

1302
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:58,951
That means we're done for.
This time we fail.

1303
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:00,759
Too bad.

1304
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:04,516
Yes, too bad.

1305
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:18,594
Rope!

1306
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,792
Hand grenade.

1307
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:10,192
Other side!

1308
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:27,348
Please have him be all right
because all my heart is at the bridge.

1309
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:34,070
Please bring him back to me,
and I'll do anything you say, ever.

1310
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:40,029
Because there isn't any me.
I'm only with him.

1311
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:45,514
Please take care of him for me.
Take care of him!

1312
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:52,154
Forgive me, for I'm very confused...

1313
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:55,393
but if you take care of him,
I'll do whatever is right.

1314
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:58,951
But this not knowing,
I cannot endure it.

1315
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,595
Pablo, I got me a... a tank!

1316
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,470
One.
- Two. - Three.

1317
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:35,989
Four!

1318
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:04,317
Alright. Now take the wire back
as far as it will reach

1319
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:06,517
before I connect it.

1320
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:52,989
Roberto!

1321
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:01,197
Hurry, Roberto!

1322
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:12,598
Hurry!

1323
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:21,948
Blow it, Anselmo!
- No, I can't! You'll be...

1324
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:25,591
Pull it, I tell you!
- No, Roberto!

1325
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,868
María! María!

1326
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,350
Your Inglés is alright.

1327
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:22,593
Hear me? He's alright.

1328
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,878
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

1329
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:30,149
Thank you very much.

1330
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:42,032
Roberto!

1331
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:08,797
The old one?
- Dad.

1332
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:14,035
We lost Fernando.
- If I'd had only had the exploder.

1333
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:18,035
What's with Pablo?
- Maybe he can't leave.

1334
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:22,752
Then let us leave! The devil with him!
- Wait! He'll be back if he's able.

1335
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,589
Machine gun.

1336
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:39,435
Here comes the...

1337
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,674
Plenty of horses now, Inglés!

1338
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,996
Where's Fernando?

1339
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:55,391
And the old man?

1340
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:58,796
Where are the three men of Elias?

1341
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:05,149
What were you shooting in the gorge?

1342
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:10,119
Why don't you say you shot them?
- Shut up! - Answer me!

1343
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,351
I look after my own people.

1344
02:31:12,760 --> 02:31:16,196
And the men of Elias?
- They were not our people.

1345
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:19,831
I provide horses for my people!
- We have horses to spare.

1346
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:23,994
Yeah? How did I know
we would have three killed!

1347
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:28,837
Now, shut up!
I lead the retreat.

1348
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,672
No!
- Don't be stubborn, woman.

1349
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:55,277
Watch the María.
- Watch yourself.

1350
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:02,511
Look! There they are!

1351
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:45,671
Wait for the next shot, then go hard
before they can reload. - No.

1352
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,437
Now!
- No!

1353
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:23,748
Roberto!

1354
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:30,558
Roberto! Let me go!

1355
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:37,679
Roberto!

1356
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:44,594
What is it? Is it...
- It's broken. - Can you ride?

1357
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:50,559
Get me a strip of canvas. Tear it
from one of the packs. - Yes.

1358
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:57,397
Get me the machine gun.
You can make it if I hold 'em here.

1359
02:33:57,800 --> 02:33:59,392
No, Inglés. We'll carry you.

1360
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,349
Don't argue. I can't ride. I couldn't
even sit on a horse. I'd...

1361
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:06,479
I'd pass out.
Pablo know I'm right.

1362
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:12,228
I want to talk to María alone.
But when I tell you to take her, do it.

1363
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:16,428
Talk fast, Inglés.
The soldiers will soon be coming.

1364
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:27,915
María, listen, don't say anything.

1365
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:30,629
We won't be going
to America this time.

1366
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:35,113
But always I go with you
wherever you go. Understand?

1367
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:38,478
You go now, María.
- No, I stay with you, Roberto.

1368
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:42,793
No, María.
What I do now, I do alone.

1369
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:48,320
No. - If you go, then I go too.
Whichever one there is, is both.

1370
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:52,395
No. No, I stay with you.
- No,

1371
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,360
each of us must do this thing alone.

1372
02:34:56,400 --> 02:35:00,075
Do it for each other.
But if you go, then I go with you.

1373
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:04,632
That way I go too. I know you'll go
now, María, for both of us,

1374
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:08,112
because we love each other always.

1375
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:12,229
It's easier for me
to stay with you, Roberto.

1376
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:17,191
I know it's harder for you.
But now I am you also.

1377
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:21,798
If you go, I go too.
That's the only way I can go.

1378
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,397
You're me now.
Surely you must feel that, María.

1379
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:30,996
Remember last night? Our time is "now"
and it'll never end.

1380
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:34,792
No.
- You're me now and I am you.

1381
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:39,796
Now you understand. Now you're going.

1382
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,316
You're going well and fast and far.

1383
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,439
We'll go to America
another time, María.

1384
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,876
Stand up now and go. And we both go.

1385
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:50,919
Stand up.
Remember, you're me too.

1386
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:54,437
You're all there will be ever be of me
now. Stand up.

1387
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:00,190
No. Stand up.

1388
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:11,589
There's no goodbye, María,
because we're not apart.

1389
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,035
Pilar!

1390
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,399
Don't turn around.

1391
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:22,791
Go now. Be strong.

1392
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:25,316
Take care of our life.

1393
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,596
No, Pilar, I can't go!

1394
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,230
No! Oh Roberto!

1395
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:41,997
Roberto, let me stay, please!
Please don't make me go!

1396
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:48,399
No, Roberto, no!

1397
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:04,280
God,
that was lucky I could make her go.

1398
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:08,556
I don't mind this at all now.
They're away.

1399
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:14,716
Think how it would be
if they'd got María instead of you.

1400
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:18,189
Don't pass out, Jordan.

1401
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:21,471
Think about America.

1402
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,438
I can't.

1403
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,910
Think about Madrid.

1404
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,548
I can't.

1405
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:30,315
Think about María.

1406
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:34,269
I can do that.

1407
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:54,394
No, you fool! You weren't kidding
María about that talk of "now"!

1408
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:59,874
Now they can't stop us, ever!
She's going on with me! Yes! Right!

1409
02:38:00,305 --> 02:39:00,710
