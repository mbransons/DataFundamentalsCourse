1
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:22,125


2
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,208


3
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,750
Who's in your urn?

4
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,542
Baili.

5
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,125
Wu Wanli,

6
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,458
you little bastard!

7
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,583
I'll tell your Dad to kick your ass!

8
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,792
Liu Shaoazi,

9
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,542
This one's for ratting me out to my Dad!

10
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:17,792
Wu Wanli,

11
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,583
get over here.

12
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,208
You have a gun?

13
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
I'm so scared.

14
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,583
You're quite heavy-handed.

15
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,333
Does it ring any bells?

16
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,417
Let go of me!

17
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:43,875
Little Bun,

18
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,333
who am I?

19
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,708
Qianli.

20
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,792
Dad!

21
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,625
Mom!

22
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,583
Dad!

23
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,333
Mom!

24
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,375
Dad!

25
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,958
Mom!

26
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,417
Qianli...

27
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,417
Qianli came back!

28
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,042
Dad,

29
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:33,625
Mom.

30
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,667
Baili... is gone.

31
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,292
Baili.

32
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,333
Eat.

33
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,583
Qianli,

34
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,958
you eat too.

35
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,750
What are you doing

36
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
Mom.

37
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,625
In the army?

38
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,083
I'm the company commander.

39
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,667
How many people do you command?

40
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,375
About 150.

41
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,500
You're a high official!

42
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,458
Yeah, a high official.

43
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,417
I heard from Limpy Chen down the river

44
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,625
that the government
allotted us 0.39 acres of land.

45
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,500
In 1947

46
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,417
when we fought in Mengyin County,

47
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
I saw a house with a front and back yard there

48
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,542
with flush gable roof

49
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,208
and purlins.

50
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,792
The eave can accommodate

51
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,000
five nests of swallows.

52
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,250
Our family has been floating on the water

53
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,917
for generations.

54
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,042
When we build a house there,

55
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,250
the villagers would certainly
see us in a new light.

56
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,583
Mom,

57
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,167
here's my subsidy.

58
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,000
If we start building on February 2 next year,

59
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,917
we can finish by the beginning of winter.

60
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,125
When I come back again,

61
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,750
we can find

62
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,708
a good wife for Wanli.

63
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
You're leaving again?

64
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,167
You're still going into battle?

65
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:15,917
Mom,

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,125
the war is already over.

67
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,917
There aren't any battles anymore.

68
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,292
No more battles.

69
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,500
Show me your gun.

70
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,542
Let me see it.

71
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,875
Don't point the gun at anyone.

72
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,542
I told you not to point the gun at anyone!

73
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,000
Order from the Corps Headquarters!

74
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,917
Order from the Corps Headquarters!

75
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
Attention all!

76
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,083
Who's Wu Qianli?

77
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,042
Present!

78
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,417
Emergency!

79
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,667
Your leave is canceled.

80
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,667
Report for duty first thing in the morning.

81
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,625
Roger that!

82
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,667
Qianli.

83
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:20,750
Qianli.

84
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,250
I'll come back by the beginning of spring.

85
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,208
Okay.

86
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,958
I'll build the house when I come back.

87
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,958
I want to go into battle with you.

88
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,583
Baili said

89
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
he and I fought enough for our family.

90
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,708
You don't have to join the army.

91
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,458
Little Bun,

92
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,625
wait till I come home.

93
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,167
Go back now.

94
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,917
"September 15, 1950"

95
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,375
"Incheon, Korea"

96
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,208
Since July 7 this year,

97
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,667
U.S. General MacArthur,

98
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,708
leading Marine forces,
announced war on North Korea.

99
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,167
In sweeping speed, U.S. Air Force

100
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,417
carpet-bombed the total terrain of the enemy.

101
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,958
Victory is estimated in the
brief span of a few weeks.

102
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,750
This is AFNK.

103
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,125
Bring in the latest news from the front.

104
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:07,375
We're close to the Yalu River
southwest factory zone.

105
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:09,792
In position,

106
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,875
target locked,

107
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,083
ready to drop.

108
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,958
Proceed with the mission.

109
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,375
Copy.

110
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,000
Base control, this is Blade Team.

111
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,125
We are over the shooting zone

112
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,667
crossing the Chinese border.

113
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,125
All targets are open,

114
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,958
request action to be confirmed.

115
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:35,833
Over.

116
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,583
Blade Team.

117
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,750
Just take 8 wings to the second location

118
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,667
Our mission is to cut off their supply line

119
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,958
by any means necessary.

120
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,750
Over.

121
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
Blade Team, copy that.

122
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,542
"Antung Chinese Border"

123
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,500

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,250
Enemy plane!

"Wolmido Island, Incheon"

126
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,375
Perfect photo op for the press.

127
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,250
Is this a part of
MacArthur's next presidential campaign?

128
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,417
You think he'll become president after this war?

129
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,958
He's already tried twice.

130
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,958
Not a chance.

131
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,000
Look, it's the puking bears.

132
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,542
How are you gonna get on the boat back home?

133
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,208
If you're gonna barf, do it out of sight.

134
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,125
Don't embarrass the regiment.

135
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,125
You remember what our regiment
did in Siberia, World War 1?

136
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,208
And when we helped stop the Japs
in the Philippines in World War [1?

137
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,375
Our legacy, man!

138
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,208
Don't worry, boys,

139
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,375
this place ain't no Normandy.

140
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,167
This was a cakewalk.

141
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,583
Let the 1st Marine Division
prance around for the reporters

142
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,375
and we'll show these leathernecks
what a real battle looks like.

143
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,292
We will take Seoul back

144
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,792
and make Korea whole!

145
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,042
And I guarantee you,

146
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,292
this will be a fast war.

147
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:28,000
God willing, it will be over by Thanksgiving.

148
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,417
General,

149
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,875
does making Korea whole

150
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,958
mean that American forces
will cross the 38th Parallel?

151
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:38,042
If this is the best thing for Korea and the world,

152
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,083
then God will lead our path!

153
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,875
Are you confident about this operation, General?

154
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,417
Have you underestimated Kim [I-Sung?

155
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,083
He has Stalin and Mao behind him.

156
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:52,042
I never underestimate my foes.

157
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,875
I have my track record.

158
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,250
A stellar 1st Marine Division

159
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,375
and the best damn generals and soldiers

160
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,333
on the face of God's green earth.

161
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,500
I believe we will succeed.

162
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,500
I reckon we will have this
wrapped up well before Thanksgiving.

163
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,458
General,

164
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,375
you read my mind.

165
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:43,708
"BEIJING October 4, 1950"

166
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,125
September 15 to 19,

167
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,000
over 70,000 well-equipped U.S. soldiers

168
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,667
landed on Incheon.

169
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,333
By September 28,

170
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,375
the Korean People's Army

171
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,917
retreated to the North of the 38th Parallel.

172
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,417
The more serious matter is,

173
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,167
MacArthur visited Taiwan

174
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,125
as early as July 31.

175
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,625
According to our reports,

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,292
the 13th U.S. Air Force

177
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,375
will enter and be stationed in Taiwan.

178
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,125
This is the biggest
move of the U.S. in that aspect

179
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,167
since the 7th Marine Fleet
put a lockdown on Taiwan

180
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,208
on June 26 this year.

181
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,542
This is a complete violation of

182
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,917
the statement that the U.S. government issued

183
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,833
on January 5 this year.

184
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,375
On October 3,

185
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,125
which was yesterday,

186
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,250
the 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Division

187
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,583
of U.S. Ground Forces

188
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,167
were completely assembled

189
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:26,875
and ready to head north

190
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,375
across the 38th Parallel at any time.

191
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,583
This completely crossed our bottom line.

192
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,542
Did you all hear that?

193
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
If they cross the 38th Parallel,

194
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,542
are they going to cross the Yalu River too?

195
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,000
In fact, by being stationed in Taiwan,

196
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,792
the U.S. army has already invaded our territory.

197
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,542
They are now assembling forces
on the Korean Peninsula

198
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,208
and threatening our national security.

199
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,208
"October 5, 1950"

200
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,292
<i>"3.00 AM"</i>

201
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,250
Uncle Peng.

202
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,750
Anying,

203
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:19,750
is the Chairman asleep?

204
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,833
Not yet.

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,208
Dad guessed you would be here

206
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,667
and told me to wait for you at the door.

207
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,042
"Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance”

208
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,458
Come in.

209
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,625
A number of battleships will be deployed

210
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,125
to join the United States Seventh Fleet.

211
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,458
Chairman.

212
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:43,875
Meanwhile, America will strengthen its
military power in Taiwan.

213
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,708
Peng,

214
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,708
you're still awake?

215
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:53,583
What do you think about this situation?

216
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,958
I want to hear your thoughts first, Chairman.

217
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,167
The country is newly established

218
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,583
and thousands of things are waiting to be done.

219
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,375
If it's for our current situation,

220
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,500
I really don't want to fight this war.

221
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,417
But if it's for the future

222
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,625
and the peaceful development

223
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,375
of our country over a few decades or a century,

224
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,958
we must fight this war.

225
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,875
The foreigners look down upon us.

226
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,375
Pride

227
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,292
can only be earned on the battlefield.

228
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:43,750
I agree.

229
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,250
I support your decision to aid Korea.

230
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,333
I'm relieved.

231
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,375
Chairman,

232
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,625
I'm thinking,

233
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,667
we should have an army
on the eastern front as well.

234
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,167
It can be stationed at the Lake Changjin

235
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,625
to fight against the U.S. army.

236
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:08,750
Uncle Peng.

237
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:11,833
Uncle Peng.

238
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,667
Let me guess.

239
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,417
I know what you want to say.

240
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,750
Let me be your first soldier,

241
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,375
Chief Commander Peng.

242
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,167
You have two brothers.

243
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,625
One of them is lost

244
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,542
and still yet to be found

245
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,208
in Shanghai,

246
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,833
right?

247
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,167
Yes,

248
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:32,625
in Shanghai.

249
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,792
The other one is sick.

250
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,042
You are the only one

251
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,167
who can stay by your father's side now.

252
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:37,625
Uncle Peng.

253
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,583
That's why you really shouldn't go, son!

254
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,500
Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children

255
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,917
are going off to war on one command.

256
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,875
Why shouldn't I go?

257
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,583
Peng,

258
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,625
let him

259
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,958
go with you.

260
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,708
Right now, the most important thing

261
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,458
is that on our western flank,

262
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,875
I Corps with the 1st Cavalry and 24th Divisions

263
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,667
will cross the 38th and take Pyongyang.

264
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,375
Mother, this is Fortune 7 Squadron Leader,

265
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,333
heading 359-er.

266
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:33,875
We've reached our IP.

267
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,375
Beginning bomb run at Target "Cast Iron".

268
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,958
Time over the target, estimated one minute.

269
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,458
In the meantime, the current plan

270
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,083
calls for us to take the port city of Hungnam

271
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,667
and drive north-west to the Yalu River.

272
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,708
Keep in mind

273
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,375
we'll be separated from our forces
at the Lake Changjin.

274
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,583
The U.S. Army marched north

275
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,208
and crossed the 38th Parallel.

276
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,292
The Yalu River is right in front of them.

277
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,542
If we ignore them,

278
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,583
our domestic and foreign enemies

279
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,500
would think we are weak and gullible.

280
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,500
We are in the same boat.

281
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,792
The comrades of Korea are asking for our help.

282
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,000
Thus,

283
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,250
throw out one punch now

284
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,708
to avoid a hundred punches in the future.

285
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,917
I declare

286
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,750
to appoint Comrade Peng Dehuai

287
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,292
as the Chief Commander of the
Chinese People's Volunteer Army

288
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,708
as well as the Political Commissar

289
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,875
to lead the army on this operation abroad.

290
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,250
"Eastern Front U.S. Temporary HQ"

291
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,292
Gentlemen,

292
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,917
our tanks have crossed the 38th

293
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,667
and our enemies have been overwhelmed.

294
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:54,042
Seems to me that victory has been set in stone.

295
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,792
It's time for us to plan our next move.

296
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:58,958
General,

297
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,167
the Air Force has taken control of the air space.

298
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:04,792
The 10th Corps has taken Hungnam Harbor

299
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,792
and we're ready to advance the Yalu River.

300
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,792
Sir, did the president really order us to
proceed to the Yalu?

301
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,083
Mr. Truman doesn't send orders,

302
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,667
only suggestions.

303
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,583
So what about Communist China?

304
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,292
They've deployed their soldiers

305
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,042
and they're attacking our boys.

306
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,917
How should we respond to this preemptive warning

307
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,292
and their actions?

308
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,583
General Walker,

309
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,833
we command well-trained soldiers,

310
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,083
not peasants.

311
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,333
If we're to end this war,

312
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,792
we must strike while the iron is hot.

313
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,500
"Volunteer Army HQ Taeyu-dong, Korea"

314
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,917
Commander,

315
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,375
we received a telegram.

316
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,042
The U.S. mechanized forces continued to
head north at a rapid pace.

317
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,958
If this carries on,

318
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,958
the enemies will soon be right at our doorstep.

319
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,625
Commander Peng,

320
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,250
the U.S. 1st Marine Division has already

321
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,333
landed at Wonsan.

322
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,208
Their division commander Major General Smith

323
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,000
is leading their 25,000 heavily-armed soldiers

324
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,167
to assemble from the eastern front
toward the Lake Changjin.

325
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,458
They want to form a pincer attack

326
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,833
with their forces on the western front

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,125
to achieve their goal of
fully occupying Korea.

328
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,833
Report to the Chairman immediately.

329
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,667
I intend to gather our forces on
the western front first

330
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,625
to defend against the U.S. army.

331
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,042
At the same time,
request the Central Military Commission

332
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,917
to send the strategic forces to Korea immediately

333
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,542
and block the enemy

334
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,417
at the Lake Changjin on the eastern front.

335
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:43,875
Yes.

336
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,208
Send a telegram to Commander Peng

337
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,292
explaining that Kanggye and the Lake Changjin

338
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,208
should be taken care of by

339
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:56,125
Song Shilun's 9th Corps.

340
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,708
Their mission is to lure the enemy in

341
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,042
and seize the chance to annihilate them.

342
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,958
How many Type 38 Rifles do we have?

343
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,042
Sixteen.

344
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:07,958
What about Sten 99s?

345
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,333
We got them all.

346
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,625
Bring them all back.

347
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,292
Yes.

348
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,625
Company Commander,

349
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,208
Yu Congrong is brawling with some people.

350
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:14,833
With whom?

351
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,375
People from the Artillery Battalion.

352
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,208
Don't move.

353
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,125
Speak louder!

354
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,667
I can't hear anything.

355
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,708
You just do not capable.

356
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,583
Get down.

357
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,042
Yu Congrong!

358
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,333
Yang,

359
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:30,917
what's going on?

360
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:31,833
Battalion Commander Yang said...

361
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,417
Be quiet!

362
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:33,500
Company Commander.

363
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:34,958
Battalion Commander Yang said

364
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,875
the battle in Chenguan Village

365
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,708
caused the 7th Company

366
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,542
to have too many casualties.

367
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,750
It's no big deal even if we won.

368
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,292
If it wasn't for the Artillery Battalion,

369
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,958
we couldn't even enter the battlefield.

370
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,000
They should be

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,417
taking the credit for the victory.

372
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,583
Battalion Commander Yang,

373
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,125
our 7th Company seized

374
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,250
8 out of the 11 cannons
for your Artillery Battalion.

375
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,542
We supported you,

376
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:51,500
didn't we?

377
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,333
You are really something.

378
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,083
What a great honor to end up with
SO many casualties!

379
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:56,958
What did you say?

380
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:57,833
Wu Qianli!

381
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,750
What are you doing?

382
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,792
Attention!

383
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,292
Division Commander,

384
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,917
we are planning a party
with the Artillery Battalion.

385
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,292
Stop fooling around,

386
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,000
the Commander is here.

387
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,333
Attention!

388
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,583
Commander,

389
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,708
I'm Wu Qianli,

390
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,500
Company Commander of the 7th Company.

391
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,250
I've heard of you.

392
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,500
The hero of our 9th Corps.

393
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,042
Your 7th Company is quite famous.

394
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,458
People call you the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

395
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,458
The Corps' Party Committee

396
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,500
was supposed to issue a pennant to you,

397
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,083
but now it'll have to wait
until the end of the war.

398
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,167
Yes!

399
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,500
Salute!

400
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:42,417
At ease!

401
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,542
Comrades,

402
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,125
I met a boy

403
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,333
here today.

404
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,000
He insisted that your Division Commander

405
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,125
allow him to enlist in the army.

406
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,833
The Division Commander asked him,

407
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,958
"Why do you want to be a soldier?”

408
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,208
He said,

409
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,125
"My Dad said

410
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,458
the Communist Party

411
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,333
and Chairman Mao

412
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,792
allotted land to our family.

413
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,333
But someone is here

414
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,167
to take the land away from them.

415
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,667
We can't let that happen.”

416
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,583
That's how it is.

417
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,250
We just triumphed over the entire nation.

418
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,125
Before we even had time to rest,

419
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,125
the imperialist U.S.

420
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,875
started a war with Korea

421
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,792
at our northern border.

422
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,917
They intend to spread the heat of war

423
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,833
to our newly established China.

424
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,417
What should we do?

425
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,583
Fight!

426
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's right!

427
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,583
Chairman Mao and Chief Commander Zhu

428
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,458
ordered our 9th Corps

429
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,500
to head north,

430
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,708
resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea,

431
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,458
and defend our country!

432
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,417
Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

433
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,042
Defend our country!

434
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,458
Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

435
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,958
Defend our country!

436
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,667
Go, go, go!

437
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,708
Our troops will run toward the sun.

438
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:15,375
Standing on our motherland's ground,

439
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:19,042
we are the hope the people long for.

440
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:22,625
Nobody can shoot us down.

441
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:27,500
Wu Qianli!

442
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,375
Present!

443
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,375
Bring the 7th Company back.

444
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,208
Yes!

445
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,667
He's the boy the Commander just mentioned.

446
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,042
He said he's Wu Qianli's little brother.

447
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,917
I'll hand him to you.

448
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:42,708
Yes!

449
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,208
Get in there!

450
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,625
How did you find this place?

451
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,417
I secretly followed you.

452
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,917
How did you find the Division Commander?

453
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,750
He must be a high official if he's in a car.

454
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,417
You stopped the Division Commander's car?

455
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:57,917
I want to be a soldier.

456
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,042
Do Mom and Dad know?

457
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,667
No.

458
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,292
Get out of here!

459
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:13,208
Go.

460
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,833
All companies to the designated location!

461
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,417
Load the supplies!

462
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:32,917
One, two, three, four!

463
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,167
Mark time!

464
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,333
141 soldiers should have
reported to the 3rd Company.

465
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,792
130 soldiers actually reported for duty.

466
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,333
The rest are on their way back.

467
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,208
258 soldiers should have
reported to the Artillery Battalion.

468
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,833
221 soldiers actually reported for duty.

469
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,083
157 soldiers should have reported

470
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,500
to the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

471
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,542
Commander!

472
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,917
Mei Sheng from the 7th Company reports for duty.

473
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,458
157 soldiers should have reported

474
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,917
to the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

475
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,708
157 soldiers actually reported for duty.

476
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:05,875
Fall in!

477
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:06,958
Yes!

478
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,000
Company Commander,

479
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:13,750
I need to pee.

480
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:16,292
Report before you speak.

481
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:17,792
If you need to pee,

482
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:18,750
do it here.

483
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:22,917
Qianli.

484
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,000
Company Commander,

485
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,125
I can do it now!

486
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:30,750
Don't touch me.

487
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:31,667
Go away.

488
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:32,708
Go away.

489
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,833
You already left the army. Why are you back?

490
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,458
Someone might feel uneasy without me.

491
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:39,875
You mean me?

492
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,583
I read the newspaper as soon as I got home.

493
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Luckily,

494
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,875
I haven't filed the paperwork for my discharge.

495
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,000
I rode the bike for 12 hours

496
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,417
to get back here.

497
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,375
You should give me a massage when we're aboard.

498
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,083
Sure.

499
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:56,750
What are you doing?

500
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,250
Wait!

501
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,833
Someone seize him!

502
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,875
Order!

503
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,833
All units on board!

504
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,833
All units on board!

505
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:10,667
Yes!

506
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,292
On board!

507
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:25,750
Wu Wanli,

508
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:27,875
get down!

509
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,833
This way!

510
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,292
Hurry!

511
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,083
Over there.

512
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,375
Company Commander.

513
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,333
Here.

514
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,250
Get up there.

515
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:50,625
Come on,

516
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:56,542
Everyone here?

517
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,375
Yes!

518
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,333
"The 9th Corps will head to China-Korea Border"

519
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,583
"after training and consolidation in Shandong.”

520
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,833
That new recruit will be listed
under the Artillery Platoon.

521
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,292
Make an entry and register him later.

522
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,083
No.

523
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,000
We are not short of soldiers.

524
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,042
His name is Wu Wanli.

525
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,167
Please instruct him.

526
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,792
We are about to go into battle.

527
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,917
How am I supposed to teach him?

528
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:08,917
Teach him the same way

529
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,292
as you taught me.

530
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,083
Teach him how to survive.

531
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,167
Lei.

532
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,875
You stay with Platoon Leader Lei.

533
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,083
What are you looking at?

534
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,292
Why?

535
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:40,542
Are you shy?

536
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,917
Why do you want to be a soldier?

537
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,208
So my brother will take me seriously.

538
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,708
What are you talking about?

539
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,583
You're only tough enough

540
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,917
when your enemies take you seriously.

541
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,792
When will I get my gun?

542
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:56,833
You want a gun?

543
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,833
Seize one for yourself on the battlefield.

544
00:33:58,833 --> 00:33:59,625
Isn't that right?

545
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,042
Yes.

546
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,917
Congrong.

547
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,625
Ping He, take this.

548
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:15,708
Your daughter?

549
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,000
Eight years old.

550
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,125
Four plus four equals seven to her.

551
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,875
Why did you bring back all your medals?

552
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,958
You're afraid of losing them?

553
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,292
If I leave these in Shanghai,

554
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,708
my family will miss me so much.

555
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,917
My wife rode her bike for
over 100 li to send me off.

556
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,208
She cried all the way.

557
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,625
She asked me when I would come home.

558
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,917
My parents

559
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,583
didn't persuade me to stay at all.

560
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,292
I promised them I would go home by Spring

561
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,542
to build a house for them.

562
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,417
He's too serious. Stop teasing him.

563
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,625
Come on,

564
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:03,708
little brat.

565
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,583
Let me introduce everyone to you.

566
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,708
My name is Yu Congrong,

567
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,292
The 1st Platoon Leader of the
7th Interpenetrating Company.

568
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,875
The enemies are usually ahead
when other people charges.

569
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,667
When I charge,

570
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:16,292
the enemies are ahead,

571
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:17,042
behind,

572
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,417
and all around me.

573
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,583
How's that?

574
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,333
Don't grab for a weapon.

575
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,583
You must regain the respect you lost on your own.

576
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,250
The person I'm introducing next is

577
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:34,875
the Artillery Platoon Leader.

578
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,042
I'm Lei.

579
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:37,042
Baili and Qianli

580
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,792
are all trained under him.

581
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,167
Remember,

582
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,250
in the 7th Company,

583
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,292
he's the daddy.

584
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,417
He's Daddy Lei.

585
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,500
Call him Daddy Lei.

586
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,708
We're going to battle again.

587
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:56,750
What are you thinking?

588
00:35:58,417 --> 00:35:59,292
What about you?

589
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,583
The reoccurring fear of the battlefield

590
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,875
is just like what's written in the books,

591
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,583
the fear you feel as a new recruit.

592
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,208
It feels

593
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,583
just like that.

594
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:26,917
Stop fighting

595
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:27,625
if you can't win.

596
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,417
Let go of me!

597
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,625
I'll Kill him!

598
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,125
The one behind you is

599
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,542
our sharpshooter, Ping He.

600
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,583
Attention!

601
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,250
Get back here!

602
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:43,958
Where are we?

603
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,208
The 7th Interpenetrating Company!

604
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,208
The 7th Company

605
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:47,917
isn't supposed to be like this.

606
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,000
Am I in the wrong carriage?

607
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,542
I asked Yu Congrong

608
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,917
to test his character.

609
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,292
Qianli.

610
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,500
They are bullying me.

611
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,708
Bullying you?

612
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,750
Fight back then!

613
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,250
They outnumber me.

614
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,458
All the enemies the 7th Company comes across

615
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,417
outnumber us by a few times.

616
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,667
Can you go tell the enemies

617
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,792
that they outnumber us?

618
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:23,625
We're now holding an enlistment ceremony

619
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,000
for Comrade Wu Wanli.

620
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,292
Salute!

621
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,542
At ease!

622
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:37,250
Yu Congrong.

623
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,958
Here!

624
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,250
You're a seasoned comrade.

625
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,708
Tell Wu Wanli

626
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,250
how Company Commander Wu Baili passed away.

627
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes.

628
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,042
Company Commander Wu Baili

629
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,417
actively attacked the enemy

630
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,417
with a small group of soldiers at Huaihai.

631
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,625
After overtaking the enemy bunkers,

632
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,458
he passed away

633
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,333
while protecting his comrades-in-arms.

634
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,833
What did the 7th Company do

635
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,333
after he died?

636
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,583
The 7th Interpenetrating Company

637
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,333
annihilated

638
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,167
and took captive

639
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,500
the enemy soldiers that
outnumbered them by six times.

640
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,292
The enemy bunkers that were supposed to

641
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,958
hold up our troops for over a year

642
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,208
only held up the 7th Company

643
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,292
for half a day.

644
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,833
Our frontline lies

645
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,000
behind enemy lines.

646
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,125
We may lose many, but because of that sacrifice,

647
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,375
the entire army's casualties are minimized.

648
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,083
We shouldn't brag about this.

649
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,042
The most important thing is to hang on.

650
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,000
We cannot be careless.

651
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,208
The U.S. army we are going to face

652
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,583
has the best equipment in the world.

653
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,583
This battle

654
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:39,708
will be extremely arduous.

655
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,625
But we need to strive for victory.

656
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,417
Do you understand,

657
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,583
Wu Wanli?

658
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,083
Wu Wanli,

659
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,833
you are now

660
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,375
the 677th soldier

661
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,333
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

662
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,250
You might say,

663
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,708
"There aren't so many people.

664
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,375
There are only over 100 here."

665
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,458
We are counting every soldier

666
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,333
since the establishment of the 7th Company,

667
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,125
including those who have died

668
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,875
or been discharged from injuries.

669
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,458
And now you are one of us.

670
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,833
I'm the 135th soldier

671
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,833
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company,

672
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:17,792
Mei Sheng.

673
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,500
The 221st soldier,

674
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,625
Yu Congrong.

675
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,083
The 280th soldier,

676
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:22,958
Ping He.

677
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,917
The 335th soldier,

678
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:25,875
He Changgui.

679
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,917
The 572nd soldier,

680
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:28,750
Li Chizheng.

681
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,125
The 657th soldier,

682
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:30,708
Liu Zhiyi.

683
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:31,958
The 533rd soldier,

684
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:32,542
Ba Long.

685
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,292
The 565 rd soldier,

686
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,000
Xuan Qiang.

687
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,125
The 162nd soldier,

688
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,125
Wu Qianli.

689
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,250
The 161st soldier,

690
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,583
Wu Baili.

691
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,458
The 17th soldier,

692
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,250
Lei Suisheng.

693
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:45,167
What about you?

694
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:47,542
Let me tell you again.

695
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,500
There is no need.

696
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,875
He will remember when it's time.

697
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:51,833
I just wish he would...

698
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,208
I don't wish anything from him.

699
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,125
Wu Wanli,

700
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,458
you're afraid the seasoned soldiers
won't accept you.

701
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:58,583
let me tell you.

702
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,500
You will only know whether they accept you

703
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,000
when you get on the battlefield.

704
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,833
An egg that's been cracked from the outside

705
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,500
is destined to be eaten.

706
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,000
If you can crack the egg from the inside,

707
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,333
you might be an eagle.

708
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,542
I have an announcement:

709
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,500
due to Comrade Wu Wanli's violation of discipline

710
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,208
and the disturbance he caused,

711
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,500
the original plan
for the weapon presenting ceremony

712
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,542
has been canceled.

713
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,500
Dismissed!

714
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,000
I quit!

715
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,375
You never wanted me to be a soldier.

716
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,125
Fine,

717
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,583
I'll leave!

718
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:37,833
Wu Wanli

719
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,375
Stop moving!

720
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,167
Don't stop me!

721
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,333
Do you want to die?

722
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:41,667
Stop moving!

723
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,917
You will stand right here as your punishment

724
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,333
until the morning.

725
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:37,875
Take this.

726
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,708
Your brother agreed.

727
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:45,875
Remember,

728
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:49,125
never point the gun at your own people.

729
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,750
You'll take the bunk on top of mine.

730
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:54,875
Let's go.

731
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,125
The Company Commander told me
to stand until the morning.

732
00:41:58,417 --> 00:41:59,667
It's not time yet.

733
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,042
You and your two brothers

734
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,792
are all so stubborn!

735
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,667
Bun...

736
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:30,500
Bun...

737
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,250
So good.

738
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:36,125
So good.

739
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,375
Time to eat!

740
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,042
Hey, what are you doing?

741
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,542
Bullets.

742
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:51,875
Go away!

743
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,667
You didn't give me any bullets yet.

744
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,167
Where are the bullet heads?

745
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,917
I'll give them to you when we get to Korea.

746
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,625
Don't forget.

747
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:33,208
"Ji'an East Station Chinese Border"

748
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:33,917
Station Master,

749
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,167
where did you lose your arm?

750
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,333
Jinzhou.

751
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,583
Squad Leader!

752
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,083
Cut that out.

753
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,625
What do you want? Out with it.

754
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,333
I heard it's extremely cold across the river.

755
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,167
That's all you're wearing?

756
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,125
Why didn't you change into
padded uniforms in Shenyang?

757
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,250
There weren't enough.

758
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:51,792
Otherwise, we wouldn't need to bother you.

759
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,667
This is all of the insignias and badges

760
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,167
for all the officials and soldiers

761
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,833
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

762
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,958
We are turning them in by order.

763
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,125
If you can stay for two more days,

764
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,875
the 50,000 padded uniforms will arrive.

765
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,042
Let me, let me.

766
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:19,667
The 7th Interpenetrating Company is ordered

767
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:22,208
to transport 20 radio transmitters to Korea

768
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,500
and wait for orders there.

769
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,583
We guarantee that we'll complete the mission!

770
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,125
Wu Wanli,

771
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,417
look.

772
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,792
U.S. aircraft!

773
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,292
It's a U.S. aircraft!

774
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:50,417
A scout aircraft.

775
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,000
Get on board!

776
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,042
Thanks, bro!

777
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:04,583
The padded uniforms!

778
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,625
Take the padded uniforms!

779
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,750
Yu!

780
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:07,583
Take the padded uniforms!

781
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:08,708
Let's go!

782
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:09,833
Hurry!

783
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,667
The padded uniforms!

784
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,458
Let's go now!

785
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:12,750
Hurry!

786
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,625
7th Company, get on board!

787
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:14,417
Get on board now!

788
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:18,750
Hurry, hurry!

789
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,333
- Where's Wu Wanli?
- Wu Wanli!

790
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,042
- Where's Wu Wanli?
- Hurry!

791
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:22,000
- Get on board!
- Is everybody present?

792
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,792
The 2nd Platoon present!

793
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,375
The 3rd Platoon present!

794
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,667
Company commander, look!

795
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,250
Take the Padded uniforms!

796
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,750
Hold on!

797
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,542
Padded uniforms!

798
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,750
Get back!

799
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,750
Don't come anymore!

800
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:34,458
It's dangerous!

801
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:35,542
Catch them!

802
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,667
Watch your step!

803
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,125
That's enough! Don't throw any more.

804
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:43,917
Caution!

805
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,208
Caution!

806
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,375
Padded uniforms!

807
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,750
Catch them!

808
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,083
Thank you!

809
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:54,625
Take care.

810
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:55,917
Get back!

811
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,042
Thank you!

812
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,833
Qianli,

813
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,667
I saw someone who was killed by a bomb.

814
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,667
Without the radio transmitters,

815
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:13,542
we can't communicate with the central government

816
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,208
or the frontline troops.

817
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,042
Just like if we don't have maps,

818
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,500
there's no way to fight a war.

819
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,292
Commander Peng,

820
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,125
the additional military radios

821
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,750
have been loaded onto the train at Ji'an.

822
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,167
The 9th Corps is responsible
for escorting them to the volunteer army.

823
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,333
What about the cipher clerks?

824
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,500
They will arrive at the same time.

825
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,083
"China-Korea Border Yalu River Bridge"

826
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:46,708
Why did the train stop?

827
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,625
Track repairing ahead.

828
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:04,000
Rest on the spot for 30 minutes!

829
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,000
Take a 30 minutes break. Alright.

830
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,167
Comrades, time is valuable!

831
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,167
Come on!

832
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:20,125
Speed up.

833
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,292
Who is that?

834
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,917
Tan Ziwei, the 3rd Battalion's commander.

835
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,333
He's from our company.

836
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:42,667
He's the 160th soldier.

837
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,208
He enlisted at the same time as Baili.

838
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,125
Baili?

839
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:45,792
Yes.

840
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,875
He used to be the sharpshooter of our company.

841
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,958
An undefeatable hero.

842
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:51,875
Battalion Commander,

843
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:53,458
the Division Commander wants to see you.

844
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:57,167
Platoon Leader,

845
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,208
are we there?

846
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,458
Yes, we just passed the Yalu River.

847
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:03,792
What?

848
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,208
The bullet heads.

849
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,917
Oh, that.

850
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,042
I'll give them to you when
we get on the battlefield.

851
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,375
Come on, come to the back with me.

852
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,750
They are all sharpshooters.

853
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,292
Who's better, Ping He or him?

854
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,208
Who's better, your brother or him?

855
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,375
Nonsense, I have two brothers.

856
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,167
Two against one.

857
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,292
What's that?

858
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:44,625
Not gonna tell you.

859
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,833
I've just spotted a troop train.

860
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,542
Wheelhouse, this is Summer 19.

861
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:54,250
We spotted a train loaded
with North Korea troops

862
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,833
stopping in the valley.

863
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,500
Get inside now!

864
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,875
All units get on board
and get equipped!

865
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,000
All companies grab supplies
and get off the train!

866
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,625
Decentralize and spread out in battalions!

867
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,292
Take cover and cut through Nangnim Mountains

868
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,208
and reassemble at the Lake Changjin!

869
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:10,417
Take the radio transmitters first,

870
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,667
cipher soldiers get off the train now!

871
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,667
How are you on ordnance?

872
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:16,167
I've still got a few GPs left over.

873
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,000
Drop them on the train,
eliminate that target.

874
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,583
The other two twenty-sixes can return to K-2.

875
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:46,750
Wanli,

876
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,042
go grab the food rations!

877
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:58,708
Retreat!

878
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,167
Retreat from the train!

879
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,375
Retreat from the train!

880
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:03,000
Stop unloading! Retreat!

881
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,042
Hurry! Hurry!

882
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,292
Shan, take some more!

883
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:15,708
Okay.

884
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:16,917
Wanli,

885
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,667
stop taking supplies, go!

886
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:20,208
Wanli!

887
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,083
Qianli!

888
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,625
How can you run
while carrying this much?

889
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:25,333
Toss them!

890
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,708
Toss them now!

891
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,083
You want to be the target?

892
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:37,292
Heading 185, altitude 350.

893
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:38,875
Maries are armed.

894
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,625
Check the gears.

895
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:47,583
Instructor,

896
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,375
our radio transmitters and
cipher soldiers are fine.

897
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,292
Great.

898
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,458
The enemy planes
will patrol this area for sure.

899
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,208
There are few plants and
no shelters nearby.

900
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,875
The most urgent thing is
to find a place to hide first

901
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:02,750
and then continue marching in the dark.

902
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,250
After crossing this river,
there should be places to hide.

903
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,667
To make it fast,
this is the only route we can take.

904
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,125
On guard, 1st Squad.

905
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,375
The rest take a break.

906
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,250
Wanli,

907
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:20,042
why are you keeping so many shell cases?

908
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:23,583
Platoon Leader said he'll give me the bullet heads
when we get to the battlefield.

909
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,500
He lied to you.

910
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,167
This is just a bunch of useless shells.

911
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,542
Really?

912
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:28,750
Why would I lie to you?

913
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:50,625
Great marksmanship!

914
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:52,417
That's nothing.

915
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,083
You haven't seen me skipping stones.

916
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,917
Did Platoon Leader bully you again?

917
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,083
When I first join the Company,
he bullied me a lot.

918
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,375
Let me tell you,

919
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,667
his right ear is nearly deaf
because of explosions.

920
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:04,875
I always scold him near it.

921
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,750
You should try.

922
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,625
Such a liar,

923
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:18,500
hope you get burnt by the cigarette.

924
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,750
You bastard!

925
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,500
Platoon Leader.

926
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,042
Company Commander is looking for you.

927
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,250
Wait for me here.

928
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:32,708
Apologies.

929
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,250
My mistake.

930
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:35,625
It's the left ear.

931
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:43,667
Don't be mad anymore.

932
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:49,708
You're really something.

933
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:50,625
Of course.

934
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,958
Each platoon shall
proceed in the 466 battle formation.

935
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,667
Protect the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers
in between the 2nd and the 3rd platoons.

936
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,833
Fighter planes!

937
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,333
In which direction?

938
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,167
Right ahead of us.

939
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,208
We don't have time!

940
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,042
Take cover!

941
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:19,667
Get down!

942
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:49,333
Don't move

943
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,125
or we'll all die!

944
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,500
They're back.

945
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:31,792
Did they notice us?

946
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,417
500 meters.

947
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:38,583
350 meters.

948
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,333
200 meters.

949
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:44,083
We can't shoot!

950
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,417
With an altitude of 30 m and north wind,

951
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:48,625
I can hit it.

952
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:49,417
I believe you.

953
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,583
But the other one will call for more fighter planes.

954
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,250
Damn it Dutch, let's call it.

955
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,750
I'm not seeing anything moving down there.

956
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,458
I'm starting to worry about
ice forming around my cannons.

957
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:06,917
Hey,

958
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,125
you see those stiffs?

959
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,625
How about a gun run?

960
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,250
Haha,

961
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,125
10 bucks says I strafe"em better!

962
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,125
Alright!

963
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,958
They made a turn.

964
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,958
You owe me 10, Dutch!

965
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:57,625
Damn it!

966
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,167
Again, make it 50!

967
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,542
How far have we gone?

968
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,125
We can't die here!

969
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,333
Come on,

970
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,667
let's kill those bastards!

971
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:43,542
I'm gonna Kill you!

972
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:44,417
Come on!

973
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:45,708
The 1st and the 2nd Platoons, take the right.

974
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,833
The 3rd and the 4th Platoons, take the left.

975
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,625
Follow my orders!

976
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,333
Escort the radio transmitters
and cipher soldiers away first!

977
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:49,958
Roger!

978
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:29,417
Groundhog 2, Groundhog 4, this is Groundhog Leader.

979
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,583
Form on me.

980
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:35,917
7th Marines TAC-P reported troop
concentrations South of the 25-Northing.

981
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,583
Solid copy.

982
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,292
Live targets this time!

983
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:41,750
Let's tear them up!

984
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,875
You got it!

985
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:28,167
How are the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers?

986
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,375
8 damaged and 12 still usable.

987
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,875
Luckily, the cipher soldiers are all fine.

988
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,042
A soldier should never put his gun on the ground.

989
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,458
What is this?

990
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:07,708
I'm not telling you.

991
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,042
Qianli,

992
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:16,250
Zhang Xiaoshan has died.

993
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:27,542
You'll experience things like this

994
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,042
very often in the future.

995
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,250
Where's his hometown?

996
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,000
Yimeng Mountain in Shandong Province,

997
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:42,875
Linyi City,

998
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:44,500
Gu Town.

999
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:47,583
He is two months younger than you.

1000
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:06,125
Let's go.

1001
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:21,292
We might encounter enemies ahead.

1002
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,542
Don't be a show-off.

1003
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:32,583
"Nangnim Mountains"

1004
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:36,375
Sir, I am not detecting any
radio transmission activity here.

1005
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,458
Impossible!

1006
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,625
With that many Chinese soldiers on the move,

1007
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:42,083
they have to be communicating with each other.

1008
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:43,542
I know they're down there.

1009
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:46,125
This is the last grid square we haven't covered.

1010
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,667
One o'clock. Fly lower to take a look.

1011
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,250
Wing 2, you take the east side of the valley.

1012
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,083
Open the door.

1013
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,292
Sir,

1014
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,667
the wind is too strong out there.

1015
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,167
Open the door!

1016
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,458
Lieutenant, take us lower!

1017
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,208
Negative, sir!

1018
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,750
It's too dangerous!

1019
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,500
Lower!

1020
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,333
Give me the camera.

1021
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:29,167
Lieutenant, take us to the next zone!

1022
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:53,792
Stop!

1023
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,333
Company Commander,

1024
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,667
there's gunfire on the other side of the mountain.

1025
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:06,083
Notify the Political Instructor.

1026
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:06,833
Roger.

1027
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:27,708
Looks like it's our comrades.

1028
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:34,875
It's our comrades indeed.

1029
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,667
They are pinned down by the Americans.

1030
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,042
The enemies are so powerful.

1031
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,083
If we don't help,

1032
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,000
they won't survive for more than 20 minutes.

1033
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:58,917
You two keep going with the radio transmitters

1034
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,250
to Taeyu-dong.

1035
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,542
Make sure you arrive on time.

1036
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:04,083
Yu Congrong, Ping He,
and the 1st Squad stay with me here.

1037
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,917
Give me one of your Artillery Squads.

1038
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,750
I will have 3rd Artillery Squad follow you.

1039
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:09,958
Let me join the fight.

1040
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:14,292
This is the first time we fight
head-to-head with the U.S. Army.

1041
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:15,917
I should be here.

1042
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,625
Plus, I've studied English for
two years by myself.

1043
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:23,833
Request approved.

1044
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:50,917
Fire!

1045
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,292
Move back! Move back!

1046
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,333
Attack!

1047
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:24,875
Cover them!

1048
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,292
Where's my M20, goddammit!

1049
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,042
Fire!

1050
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,792
Move! Move back!

1051
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:47,875
Move back!

1052
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,458
Go get the higher point
and take out the mortars!

1053
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,250
Attack!

1054
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,542
Ji Chungeng from the 6th Company
of the 172nd Regiment!

1055
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,250
This is Wu Qianli from the 7th Company,
the 1st Storming Regiment.

1056
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:14,875
Our mission is to blow up the U.S. signal tower,

1057
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:18,375
cut off the connection between U.S. frontline
and headquarters in Lake Changjin!

1058
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,250
The enemy firepower is too fierce

1059
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,042
and we are suffering heavy casualties!

1060
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:25,833
Our dynamiter was Killed right
by the cowshed in front of the tower.

1061
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:34,125
Platoon Leader,

1062
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,250
Wu Wanli disappeared!

1063
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,083
Tell them to stop ahead.

1064
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:38,667
Yes.

1065
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,125
Everyone stop!

1066
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:41,958
Is he falling behind?

1067
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:43,833
Like hell he's falling behind!

1068
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:45,167
That little bastard!

1069
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:51,333
Lei,

1070
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:52,417
listen.

1071
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,000
These are reinforcement troops.

1072
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:15,500
What should we do?

1073
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,375
We can't let them pass.

1074
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,042
Stop them right here.

1075
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:24,000
Arrange for one team to escort the
radio transmitters and cipher soldiers ahead.

1076
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,667
Tanks have limited sight.

1077
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,333
We'll occupy the commanding heights.

1078
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:28,958
The tanks can't touch us there.

1079
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,500
The mortars need to concentrate firepower

1080
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,167
and take out their troop carriers first.

1081
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,458
Why are you here?

1082
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,375
Don't come up here!

1083
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,500
- There's another one, get him!
- Where?

1084
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,917
Two o'clock, keep shooting!

1085
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,792
Who told you to come up here?

1086
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,250
Get inside, now!

1087
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,000
Yu Congrong!

1088
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,542
Yes, sir!

1089
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,542
Let's go get the dynamite pack!

1090
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:02,333
Roger!

1091
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,375
Ask the rest to set the defense
and save the wounded!

1092
01:15:09,042 --> 01:15:10,042
Hurry! Go there!

1093
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:41,958
Ye, the knife!

1094
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:43,500
Platoon Leader.

1095
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,292
Take cover!

1096
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:12,250
Fire!

1097
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:16,667
Ambush from the hill!

1098
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:17,792
Strike!

1099
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,083
Fire!

1100
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:44,208
Find some cover,
get me the positions of those gook mortars!

1101
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,083
Move! Move!

1102
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,042
Retreat! Retreat!

1103
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:52,125
Lure them up the hill!

1104
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,417
Grenade! Hurry!

1105
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:07,875
Go!

1106
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:11,667
Yu Congrong!

1107
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:13,375
I'm okay!

1108
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:16,542
Ah!

1109
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:21,167
Don't come over!

1110
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:41,958
Go!

1111
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,333
I'll go divert them!

1112
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:55,333
Listen for my gunfire!

1113
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:55,833
Roger!

1114
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,500
Watch your back!

1115
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:11,208
Instructor, problem solved.

1116
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:34,375
Stab him!

1117
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:40,833
Stab!

1118
01:19:43,292 --> 01:19:44,042
Stab him!

1119
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,042
Yu Congrong!

1120
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,542
Cover me, I am going after him.

1121
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:10,417
Grenade!

1122
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:22,208
Come here!

1123
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:36,917
Crouch down and don't move!

1124
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:42,083
Hurry up!

1125
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:43,875
Over here!

1126
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,208
Stay low.

1127
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:52,083
Stevens!

1128
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:53,458
Nine o'clock, take them out!

1129
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:54,250
Got it!

1130
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,000
Company Commander!

1131
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,542
You stay right here and don't go out there.

1132
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,208
Remember!

1133
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:42,750
Here's the grenade.

1134
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,708
Count to five and release it.

1135
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:47,250
Okay.

1136
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,958
Keep up the rate of fire!

1137
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:18,083
Get ready.

1138
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:21,458
One, two, three!

1139
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,333
In the air?

1140
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:05,292
One more time!

1141
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:41,375
Yu, take your man and go blow up the signal tower!

1142
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:07,875
Yu Congrong!

1143
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,083
Hey Third, push up the embankment!

1144
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:16,167
Push up, push up the embankment!

1145
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:17,333
Move! Move!

1146
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:20,708
Chaos Company,

1147
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:22,375
assault through the ambush!

1148
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,292
Tank 1-1 and 1-2

1149
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:25,750
push to the tower!

1150
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:13,833
Go to hell!

1151
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:21,417
Go to hell!

1152
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:27,375
Goddamnit!

1153
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,708
My bow gun is jammed!

1154
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:44,417
Company Commander!

1155
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,458
Company Commander Wu, two U.S. tanks

1156
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,833
and a dozen infantry soldiers
are heading this way!

1157
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:29,292
Yu Congrong, the U.S. tank we seized from
the Battle of Southern Shandong,

1158
01:28:29,417 --> 01:28:30,500
do you still remember how to use it?

1159
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:31,208
Yes!

1160
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,375
Shit, I can't see anything!

1161
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:48,333
Me neither, what was that?

1162
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:23,458
Stop!

1163
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,708
Hang on tight!

1164
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:49,167
I can't stop it.

1165
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,583
Ah!

1166
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:09,167
You okay?

1167
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,333
I am fine.

1168
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:14,583
Let's get out.

1169
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:44,458
36,

1170
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:45,750
37,

1171
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:47,375
38,

1172
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:48,708
39,

1173
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,375
40,

1174
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:51,542
41,

1175
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:53,083
42,

1176
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,667
43...

1177
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:29,917
26,

1178
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,833
27...

1179
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:38,625
36,

1180
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:39,667
37,

1181
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,000
38,

1182
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,042
39...

1183
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,208
Attack!

1184
01:32:58,083 --> 01:32:59,208
Watch out!

1185
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,250
Run!

1186
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:22,333
Shit, we gotta get out of here!

1187
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:24,125
Go! Go! Go!

1188
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,333
It's Daddy's fault.

1189
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,458
I hope our next generation

1190
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,333
no longer has to live through war.

1191
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,583
Why didn't you abide by orders?

1192
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,083
How can you come here on your own?

1193
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,375
I want to be with you.

1194
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:18,500
That's your reason?

1195
01:36:21,458 --> 01:36:23,000
Because you're my brother.

1196
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,542
Are you hungry?

1197
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:49,625
In the army,

1198
01:36:49,917 --> 01:36:51,167
you must abide by orders.

1199
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,208
Your comrades-in-arms might die

1200
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,250
for your mistake if you act on your own.

1201
01:36:57,708 --> 01:36:58,958
Do you understand?

1202
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:10,333
Go write a self-criticism.

1203
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:14,750
What's self-criticism?

1204
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:30,208
"U.S. Airport Hagaru-ri, Eastern Front”

1205
01:37:30,792 --> 01:37:33,292
Hagaru-ri HQ,

1206
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,750
Whirlybird 1, over.

1207
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:36,583
Go ahead, Whirlybird 1.

1208
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:39,167
Where do you want us to set down? Over.

1209
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:41,375
Go to Pan 1, over.

1210
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,708
Received, out.

1211
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:52,000
Attention!

1212
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:52,958
At ease.

1213
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:54,833
Sir, here is the report.

1214
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:55,458
Sir,

1215
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,083
General Almond is here.

1216
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:11,750
Attention!

1217
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,208
General Oliver Smith,

1218
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:17,583
what the hell is that airstrip out there?

1219
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,417
I'm building an airport.

1220
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,542
Because it's essential if I'm gonna be responsible

1221
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:23,042
for all the lives here.

1222
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:23,708
One coffee.

1223
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,042
It's a fatal mistake to fight a war

1224
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:28,167
without the will to win it, period!

1225
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:31,208
Take a look outside, General.

1226
01:38:31,917 --> 01:38:34,667
Our soldiers are trapped between
hellish mountain ranges

1227
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,125
and freezing temperatures.

1228
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:38,083
And now, we have reports

1229
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,167
of hostile Chinese in the Yunshan.

1230
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:42,792
Your orders were to move forward!

1231
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,708
This is not gonna be the fast war

1232
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,167
that MacArthur expected.

1233
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:48,167
This war is on a schedule!

1234
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,167
And your task is to keep it,

1235
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,250
Smith!

1236
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,125
On the subject of tasks,

1237
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,833
I'm the chief of this task force,

1238
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,042
Edward.

1239
01:38:57,917 --> 01:38:59,125
Where's the coffee?

1240
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:02,625
When this all ends,

1241
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:06,250
you are going to face the consequences.

1242
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:09,792
Yes,

1243
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,542
we all will, Edward.

1244
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:13,833
We all will.

1245
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:17,458
November 25,

1246
01:39:17,667 --> 01:39:20,125
my men will be up on the western line.

1247
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:22,250
And if you don't show up,

1248
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:24,208
I will have you scalped!

1249
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:27,000
I will scalp you with my own hands!

1250
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,458
One lump of sugar, sir?

1251
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:53,625
Ping He, Changgui.

1252
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,458
Standby.

1253
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,167
Standby.

1254
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:58,167
Are you guys hungry?

1255
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:00,708
Of course.

1256
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,292
Bear with it.

1257
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:15,375
Our own people.

1258
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:16,750
I see that.

1259
01:40:21,542 --> 01:40:22,167
Senior Officer,

1260
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:23,500
the 7th Interpenetrating Company is here

1261
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,792
to deliver 12 radio transmitters

1262
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,000
and 4 cipher clerks by order,
please check them.

1263
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,458
Li, show the cipher clerks in first.

1264
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,000
Yes.

1265
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,500
Comrades, bring the radios in.

1266
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,042
Yes!

1267
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:34,542
Guys, come with me.

1268
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,333
Liu, take them to get some rest.

1269
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:46,000
Yes.

1270
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:47,542
Thank you, Senior Officer.

1271
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,875
Wu, please come with me.

1272
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:51,792
Thank you.

1273
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:52,625
Let's go.

1274
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:56,833
Ouch!

1275
01:40:58,167 --> 01:40:59,000
You won't die.

1276
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:08,333
What are you writing?

1277
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:10,167
Yu, Yu!

1278
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:26,417
Comrades,

1279
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,917
let me read it for you all.

1280
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:30,583
It's Comrade Wu Wanli's self-criticism report.

1281
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:32,458
No, no,

1282
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,000
it's a self-O report.

1283
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:40,500
I didn't listen to Leader Lei's O.

1284
01:41:41,917 --> 01:41:43,125
I went to O my brother.

1285
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:46,167
I O. I won't do it again.

1286
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,083
Political Instructor,

1287
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:51,708
our little comrade is growing up.

1288
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,000
Nice attitude,

1289
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:54,708
but there's no sign and it doesn't count.

1290
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,042
Sign it then.

1291
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:01,833
If you peck and crack the egg from the inside,

1292
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:03,792
you may have a chance to lay more eggs.

1293
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:06,417
Get out of here!

1294
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,875
And you.

1295
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,333
You little bastard,

1296
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:13,583
who are you to make fun of someone else?

1297
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:15,333
Comrades,

1298
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,208
Comrade Yu Congrong

1299
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,875
was so afraid that he peed his pants

1300
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:20,458
the first time he went into battle.

1301
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,125
It was me who washed his pants for him.

1302
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,125
I can testify to that.

1303
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,958
Everyone, leave your ripped

1304
01:42:28,958 --> 01:42:30,917
or dirty clothes here.

1305
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,083
Change into these clean clothes.

1306
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,042
Thank you for your concern, comrades.

1307
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,208
You've worked hard.

1308
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:35,958
Dachuan,

1309
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,708
pick out three clean uniforms

1310
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:38,292
and take the cotton out
to make first-aid pads.

1311
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:39,792
Share the rest with our comrades.

1312
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,417
Wounded soldiers have priority.

1313
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:43,750
Yes, wounded soldiers have priority.

1314
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,708
Working on that little house of yours again?

1315
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:53,167
If I can't come back,

1316
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,667
hand this to my parents.

1317
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:57,917
They can't read.

1318
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:01,542
Ask the teachers in the village
to read it for them.

1319
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:03,875
This is taboo.

1320
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:05,708
Change it. Cross it out.

1321
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,250
You didn't have that little triangle

1322
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,292
on the diagram before.

1323
01:43:10,292 --> 01:43:11,250
What is it?

1324
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:17,000
I buried Baili there.

1325
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:27,625
Let me see it.

1326
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:32,208
This is nice. This is nice.

1327
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:37,042
Comrade, do you have enough to eat?

1328
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:37,792
Yes.

1329
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:40,667
We have more here if you want.

1330
01:43:58,542 --> 01:43:59,625
Yu,

1331
01:44:00,417 --> 01:44:02,875
how many Americans does one
have to kill to be a hero?

1332
01:44:04,542 --> 01:44:06,042
Just two?

1333
01:44:06,417 --> 01:44:07,625
Add a 0 behind it.

1334
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:10,667
I have to kill 20 to be a hero?

1335
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:13,167
You are already a hero

1336
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:14,542
if you've been on the battlefield.

1337
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,125
Who is he?

1338
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:26,250
Are you staying at my house or not?

1339
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:27,417
No.

1340
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,875
You have no one at your hometown
in Yimeng Mountain anyway.

1341
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:31,958
If you live with me,

1342
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,292
you can take Baili's room.

1343
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,333
You can get married

1344
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:36,625
and have two kids there

1345
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,458
with your future wife.

1346
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:42,292
It looks like a pigsty.

1347
01:44:42,292 --> 01:44:43,208
I'm not going.

1348
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:44,208
It's good if it's a pigsty.

1349
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:45,167
Lei,

1350
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,750
if you raise pigs,

1351
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:48,000
you can live a good life.

1352
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Plus,

1353
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,583
there's food and accommodation.

1354
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,208
You'll live a happy life.

1355
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,375
Fine, I can go.

1356
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:00,042
Political Instructor,

1357
01:45:00,042 --> 01:45:01,667
which one is Company Commander Wu?

1358
01:45:03,792 --> 01:45:04,667
Come on.

1359
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:06,875
Commander Wu,

1360
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,042
he is looking for you.

1361
01:45:09,875 --> 01:45:11,500
Hi, Commander Wu.

1362
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,000
Hi.

1363
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,250
I'm Secretary Liu from HQ.

1364
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,708
Hello.

1365
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:14,250
It's been tough for you.

1366
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,125
It's my duty.

1367
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,000
But your company is departing again.

1368
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:21,458
We received a telegram from our superiors.

1369
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:23,625
The eastern and western fronts will start
a general assault together.

1370
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:25,000
The superiors ask the 7th Company

1371
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,292
to arrive at the 1100 highland in
Sinhung-ni of the Lake Changjin.

1372
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,125
When should we leave?

1373
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:47,667
Attention, all.

1374
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:48,958
In 5 minutes, we will be leaving.

1375
01:45:48,958 --> 01:45:50,000
Get ready for departure.

1376
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:51,125
Yes!

1377
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:03,250
Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children

1378
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:04,708
are going off to war on one command.

1379
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,542
Why shouldn't I go?

1380
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,042
Peng,

1381
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:11,500
let him

1382
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,833
go with you.

1383
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:30,625
"The 9th Corps heads to Lake Changjin"

1384
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:04,083
"The 9th Corps Frontline HQ Chengfang-dong, Korea"

1385
01:47:10,917 --> 01:47:13,083
" -31 ° c "

1386
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:22,167
Order from HQ,

1387
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,375
before we arrived at the designated location,

1388
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:26,167
Execute standard radio silence procedures.

1389
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:33,833
Did we send the padded uniforms
to the combat units yet?

1390
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
No.

1391
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:37,708
Without air supremacy,

1392
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:39,625
it's very difficult to guarantee logistic support.

1393
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:42,042
Plus, our fleet suffered a bomb attack again.

1394
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:43,375
Tao Yong,

1395
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,333
we must find any means possible

1396
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:48,958
to send the padded uniforms
to our frontline units ASAP!

1397
01:47:52,292 --> 01:47:55,542
We can't let our soldiers freeze to death
on the battlefield.

1398
01:47:57,417 --> 01:48:00,000
How many days will our food ration last?

1399
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,583
If we eat one potato a day,

1400
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:03,333
it would last us to Sinhung-ni at the most.

1401
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:05,958
We should find a way to save some

1402
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:07,500
for the wounded soldiers.

1403
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,125
Take these potatoes.

1404
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:10,917
Okay.

1405
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:11,917
Take them.

1406
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,625
"November 23, 1950"

1407
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:27,208
No cutting, wait your turn.

1408
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:40,083
Get out of here.

1409
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:41,875
Come on... I just want bacon.

1410
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:54,417
Pass them.

1411
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,208
Here's a soft one.

1412
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:30,583
So much for Donald Duck home by Thanksgiving.

1413
01:49:30,667 --> 01:49:32,833
He sent his Christmas wish list instead.

1414
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:37,083
I don't have a goddamn thing
to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

1415
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:40,125
That's some list,

1416
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:42,667
but all I want to do is go home.

1417
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,083
Qianli,

1418
01:50:04,792 --> 01:50:07,500
can I ask why you always bullied me
when I was little?

1419
01:50:09,417 --> 01:50:10,500
Did 1?

1420
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,500
Yeah.

1421
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,000
Mom used to give me

1422
01:50:17,042 --> 01:50:18,292
all the good things to eat.

1423
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:20,667
Once you were born,

1424
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:22,958
that wasn't for me.

1425
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:42,500
Ping He,

1426
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:44,875
do you still want to tell the truth about Baili?

1427
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:51,958
Keep it in your heart.

1428
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:08,792
Watch it, old man.

1429
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:26,792
Sir, we have news from the Air Force.

1430
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:33,292
My family makes cheese broccoli for Thanksgiving,

1431
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,292
you want to come and join us next year at home?

1432
01:51:35,792 --> 01:51:37,000
I will, man.

1433
01:51:37,333 --> 01:51:38,917
If we make it home.

1434
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:40,542
Attention!

1435
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:41,625
At ease.

1436
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,625
Sir.

1437
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,333
With no signs of our enemy,

1438
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:52,958
our pilots reported there
was signal interference

1439
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:55,042
every time they flew over this area.

1440
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:57,667
Here?

1441
01:51:57,917 --> 01:51:58,750
Yes, sir.

1442
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,333
"November 25, 1950"

1443
01:52:17,042 --> 01:52:18,000
I don't believe it!

1444
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,750
You have to leave!

1445
01:52:18,875 --> 01:52:19,708
Deng Hua!

1446
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:22,417
Shut off the radios!

1447
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:22,917
Yes!

1448
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,000
Shut off all the radios!

1449
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:25,792
Gao Ruixin!

1450
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:26,292
Here!

1451
01:52:26,292 --> 01:52:27,125
Did you bring the map?

1452
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:27,750
Yes.

1453
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:28,333
Let's go.

1454
01:52:28,458 --> 01:52:29,500
The enemy planes are here!

1455
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,833
- Retreat immediately!
- Hurry!

1456
01:52:34,292 --> 01:52:35,625
Get into the air-raid shelter!

1457
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:37,125
Hurry!

1458
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:37,792
Hurry!

1459
01:52:38,542 --> 01:52:39,625
- Boy.
- Hurry!

1460
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:40,458
Those in the back, keep up!

1461
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:41,083
Coming!

1462
01:52:43,083 --> 01:52:45,583
Hurry, keep up!

1463
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:47,458
What's wrong?

1464
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:48,500
Hurry, hurry!

1465
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,917
There's still a map on the wall.

1466
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:51,500
We don't have a lot of large-scale maps.

1467
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,458
Take this!

1468
01:52:59,542 --> 01:53:00,417
Second Squad,

1469
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:02,542
proceed with the mission.

1470
01:54:15,708 --> 01:54:16,667
Commander,

1471
01:54:16,792 --> 01:54:18,958
we lost communication with Taeyu-dong.

1472
01:54:33,917 --> 01:54:35,042
Chief Commander Peng,

1473
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:37,333
these were left behind by the martyr,

1474
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,958
Secretary Liu.

1475
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:22,833
Deputy Commander Deng,

1476
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:25,375
we don't have any info about Secretary Liu.

1477
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:27,083
Who was he?

1478
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:28,417
What was his full name?

1479
01:55:33,417 --> 01:55:34,500
Deng Hua.

1480
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:36,792
The day after tomorrow,

1481
01:55:36,958 --> 01:55:40,167
which is November 27, 1950,

1482
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:43,167
the 9th Corps will begin their general assault
at the Lake Changjin.

1483
01:55:43,167 --> 01:55:44,417
Do they...

1484
01:55:45,042 --> 01:55:46,958
Do they know what to do?

1485
01:55:48,375 --> 01:55:49,458
Yes.

1486
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:52,833
Give me a new command post!

1487
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,417
Yes!

1488
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:20,708
Currently... the 38th, 39th, and 40th Corps

1489
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:23,167
have already assembled at the Chongchon River.

1490
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:27,500
You must complete deployment at the
Lake Changjin war zone quickly.

1491
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,583
In two days,
the eastern and western fronts will begin

1492
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:31,458
their general assault at the same time.

1493
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:34,333
Song Shilun, remember.

1494
01:56:34,333 --> 01:56:35,417
Remember!

1495
01:56:35,417 --> 01:56:37,333
Strike them as hard as you can!

1496
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:43,250
The 20th Corps shall separate
and surround the enemies

1497
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:45,708
in Koto-ri, Yudam-ni, and Hagaru-ri.

1498
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:47,667
Make sure the 27th Corps focuses their firepower

1499
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:49,458
to annihilate the U.S. army in Sinhung-ni.

1500
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:49,958
Yes!

1501
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:52,458
After the 27th Corps destroys
two large clusters of enemies,

1502
01:56:52,542 --> 01:56:54,250
immediately destroy the airport in Hagaru-ri

1503
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,333
and cut off the enemy's aerial communication.

1504
01:56:55,333 --> 01:56:56,000
Yes.

1505
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,792
Meanwhile, stop the enemies
from reinforcing the north.

1506
01:56:58,792 --> 01:56:59,333
Yes.

1507
01:56:59,333 --> 01:57:01,458
Where is the 27th Corps right now?

1508
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:02,875
They've already reached the designated location.

1509
01:57:03,333 --> 01:57:06,458
Command the 27th Corps to take cover and stand by

1510
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:08,750
so that we can prevent the enemy
from escaping south

1511
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,208
Where is the 26th Corps now?

1512
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,542
According to the original plan,

1513
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:13,333
they are 100 kilometers outside of Koto-ri.

1514
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:14,417
Command the 26th Corps to

1515
01:57:14,417 --> 01:57:16,542
immediately march 50 kilometers
towards Lake Changjin.

1516
01:57:16,542 --> 01:57:17,375
Yes.

1517
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:21,208
The 20th and 27th Corps
immediately get ready for the battle

1518
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:23,042
and act simultaneously with the western front.

1519
01:57:23,042 --> 01:57:25,667
Begin the general assault

1520
01:57:25,667 --> 01:57:26,708
at 4:30 pm on the 27th!

1521
01:57:27,292 --> 01:57:28,250
Yes!

1522
01:57:42,292 --> 01:57:44,458
What is the lowest temperature tonight?

1523
01:57:45,125 --> 01:57:46,625
40°c below zero.

1524
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:55,208
We are not only fighting against the Americans.

1525
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:59,125
We are also fighting against God.

1526
01:58:02,917 --> 01:58:06,167
General, we have reports of
Chinese attacking in division strength

1527
01:58:06,167 --> 01:58:08,000
in both Tokchon and Nyongwon.

1528
01:58:09,208 --> 01:58:11,917
That's far more than G2 has estimated.

1529
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:14,875
Four other outfits are
also being decisively engaged.

1530
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,500
The entire front is under heavy attack, sir.

1531
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:20,625
Where do they come from?

1532
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:23,417
Do they fall out of the goddamn sky?

1533
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:26,583
We don't know sir, but the reports are pouring in.

1534
01:58:30,875 --> 01:58:35,125
"Lake Changjin, Eastern Front"

1535
01:58:59,125 --> 01:59:00,708
Move, move, move!

1536
01:59:02,708 --> 01:59:04,792
Hey, get more light in there!

1537
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:13,792
"The 9th Company of the Volunteer Army"

1538
01:59:17,292 --> 01:59:18,667
Did we receive a command?

1539
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:28,083
You there

1540
01:59:28,167 --> 01:59:28,750
Pick up your feet

1541
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:29,583
Hustle up!

1542
01:59:30,792 --> 01:59:32,833
Get those crates over here!

1543
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:33,458
Move faster!

1544
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:34,417
Get some more!

1545
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:35,542
Right there!

1546
01:59:35,542 --> 01:59:36,875
Stack them up boys!

1547
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:39,000
Come on, pick it up!

1548
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Hurry up!

1549
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:42,458
No, I don't see any sign of enemy.

1550
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:45,583
Damn soldier, this ain't North Korea.

1551
01:59:45,583 --> 01:59:47,083
This is the North Pole.

1552
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:59,792
"The 7th Company of the Volunteer Army"

1553
02:00:11,917 --> 02:00:13,250
Let me hold that for a while.

1554
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:19,833
What are they singing?

1555
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,458
Don't fall asleep.

1556
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:26,417
Wake up.

1557
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:39,917
Merry Christmas.

1558
02:00:40,292 --> 02:00:41,125
What does that mean?

1559
02:00:41,458 --> 02:00:43,667
It's an American holiday
that happens before the New Year.

1560
02:00:43,667 --> 02:00:44,542
It's called Christmas.

1561
02:00:46,042 --> 02:00:47,208
What is it?

1562
02:00:47,542 --> 02:00:49,167
To be so happy.

1563
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:51,542
Their lives aren't so merry after all.

1564
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:54,333
That MacArthur even said they were going to

1565
02:00:54,667 --> 02:00:56,375
cross the Yalu River before the New Year

1566
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,583
so their soldiers could go home for the holiday.

1567
02:00:58,583 --> 02:00:59,917
Bullshit,

1568
02:01:00,125 --> 02:01:01,833
they want to go home for the holiday?

1569
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:03,792
I'll give them a reason to go home.

1570
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,167
Do you miss mom?

1571
02:01:20,333 --> 02:01:21,208
Qianli,

1572
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,708
when Baili died,

1573
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,333
were you by his side?

1574
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:38,333
He lost the bottom half of his body

1575
02:01:40,417 --> 02:01:41,750
from the explosion.

1576
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:44,458
I couldn't even

1577
02:01:44,458 --> 02:01:45,792
stuff his intestines back inside,

1578
02:01:47,667 --> 02:01:49,208
no matter how I tried.

1579
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,333
He said

1580
02:01:54,875 --> 02:01:56,208
he was cold.

1581
02:01:57,458 --> 02:01:59,000
I held him in my arms.

1582
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:04,208
His lips

1583
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:10,042
were purple.

1584
02:02:11,917 --> 02:02:13,500
I couldn't stop

1585
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:16,292
his bleeding.

1586
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:19,083
He asked me

1587
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:22,083
to help him take his life.

1588
02:02:38,708 --> 02:02:40,250
Qianli,

1589
02:02:41,625 --> 02:02:43,708
let me stay by your side.

1590
02:02:46,167 --> 02:02:47,625
If...

1591
02:02:48,917 --> 02:02:50,875
I end up like Baili,

1592
02:02:53,417 --> 02:02:55,042
you can help me too.

1593
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:08,292
Okay.

1594
02:03:24,792 --> 02:03:29,375
"November 26, 1950"

1595
02:04:29,667 --> 02:04:30,750
How's it going?

1596
02:04:31,667 --> 02:04:32,750
Tanks,

1597
02:04:34,292 --> 02:04:35,750
Half-tracks,

1598
02:04:39,167 --> 02:04:40,375
and HQ.

1599
02:04:44,083 --> 02:04:46,875
From the marching direction and speed

1600
02:04:46,917 --> 02:04:49,333
of the 31st Corps led by the U.S. army

1601
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:50,667
we can predict that

1602
02:04:50,667 --> 02:04:52,042
the enemy's HQ

1603
02:04:52,042 --> 02:04:53,708
will be established around

1604
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,208
the 1100 Highland.

1605
02:04:57,875 --> 02:05:00,792
They are known as the Polar Bears.

1606
02:05:01,042 --> 02:05:03,000
They fought in Siberia in WWI

1607
02:05:03,125 --> 02:05:05,583
and in the Pacific in WWII.

1608
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:07,833
This is their trump card.

1609
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:09,833
We'll show them

1610
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:12,042
how tough our fists are then.

1611
02:05:37,417 --> 02:05:39,375
Why hasn't anything happened?

1612
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:43,500
Do you think something went wrong?

1613
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:56,917
The 59th, 79th,
and 89th Divisions arrived in Yudam-ni on time.

1614
02:05:56,917 --> 02:05:59,625
The 80th and 81st Divisions
are in position in Sinhung-ni.

1615
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:02,000
What's the speed of Smith's corps?

1616
02:06:02,417 --> 02:06:03,708
3 kilometers per day.

1617
02:06:03,708 --> 02:06:05,292
They are moving at a snail's pace.

1618
02:06:08,667 --> 02:06:10,958
According to their line of march and geography,

1619
02:06:11,208 --> 02:06:13,375
Smith's corps will surely be stretched out.

1620
02:06:13,917 --> 02:06:16,292
Then we can break their lineup
into a few sections.

1621
02:06:16,292 --> 02:06:17,750
We must annihilate Smith

1622
02:06:18,125 --> 02:06:20,333
at the Lake Changjin.

1623
02:06:23,708 --> 02:06:24,958
Let's wait.

1624
02:06:39,625 --> 02:06:41,458
The 1100 Highland is right ahead of us.

1625
02:06:41,458 --> 02:06:42,917
If we make it there before sunrise,

1626
02:06:43,333 --> 02:06:45,458
we can block the U.S. army's route.

1627
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:49,500
Let's not waste our time here.

1628
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,708
Notify all units. Get ready to head out.

1629
02:06:51,917 --> 02:06:52,417
Yes.

1630
02:06:52,417 --> 02:06:54,042
Gather your gear and get ready for departure.

1631
02:06:54,042 --> 02:06:55,667
Attention all! Get ready to depart.

1632
02:06:59,042 --> 02:06:59,667
Lei.

1633
02:07:00,708 --> 02:07:03,208
I saved this just for you.

1634
02:07:05,917 --> 02:07:07,000
What do you want for it?

1635
02:07:07,708 --> 02:07:10,083
Why do you have such a nasty mind?

1636
02:07:11,917 --> 02:07:13,000
The situation with the Polar Bears is...

1637
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,708
a tough battle.

1638
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:16,917
Can you let me have Wanli?

1639
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:19,750
You're the one who handed him over to me.

1640
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:21,167
Now you want him back.

1641
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:22,167
What are you up to?

1642
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:27,833
He throws with unerring aim.

1643
02:07:27,833 --> 02:07:28,750
That's useful to me.

1644
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,708
Take good care of him.

1645
02:07:32,417 --> 02:07:33,375
When this war is over,

1646
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:35,667
he will become my godson.

1647
02:07:35,792 --> 02:07:37,333
I'm expecting him to take care of me
when I get old.

1648
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:39,292
You old bastard,

1649
02:07:39,917 --> 02:07:41,292
if he's your godson,

1650
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,708
what should I call you?

1651
02:07:45,917 --> 02:07:46,833
Call me Dad.

1652
02:07:49,083 --> 02:07:50,667
I'll break those aged teeth of yours.

1653
02:07:57,917 --> 02:07:58,875
Remember,

1654
02:07:59,333 --> 02:08:00,875
as soon as the battle begins,

1655
02:08:01,083 --> 02:08:03,542
you stick by your brother's side.

1656
02:08:04,042 --> 02:08:06,125
He's more witty and canny than a rabbit.

1657
02:08:06,333 --> 02:08:08,542
Bullets don't tend to get him.

1658
02:08:09,833 --> 02:08:11,208
Don't be a show-off.

1659
02:08:11,833 --> 02:08:12,458
Okay.

1660
02:08:12,542 --> 02:08:15,125
Let's all try to fight this war nicely.

1661
02:08:15,375 --> 02:08:15,917
Okay.

1662
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:27,583
Those in the back, speed up!

1663
02:08:43,292 --> 02:08:49,500
"November 27, 1950"

1664
02:08:55,542 --> 02:08:56,333
Commander,

1665
02:08:56,417 --> 02:08:58,083
Smith's corps haven't arrived yet.

1666
02:09:02,333 --> 02:09:03,167
No more waiting.

1667
02:09:06,125 --> 02:09:07,250
Begin the general assault

1668
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:08,333
in 5 minutes.

1669
02:09:10,542 --> 02:09:13,500
"Sinhung-ni, Lake Changjin"

1670
02:09:25,667 --> 02:09:26,250
What?

1671
02:09:30,333 --> 02:09:31,542
Have we been discovered?

1672
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:32,583
No.

1673
02:09:32,792 --> 02:09:33,958
We're about to initiate the attack.

1674
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,083
Attack!

1675
02:09:49,625 --> 02:09:52,875
Attack!

1676
02:09:55,667 --> 02:09:57,000
Get on the truck!

1677
02:10:28,917 --> 02:10:30,875
Enemy attack, code Red!

1678
02:10:31,625 --> 02:10:33,458
Lock enemy assault position.

1679
02:10:35,625 --> 02:10:38,125
Sir, they are coming from everywhere!

1680
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:43,875
Dinner is served!

1681
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,125
Load the cannons!

1682
02:10:45,208 --> 02:10:45,917
Load the cannons!

1683
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,250
Ready,

1684
02:10:47,542 --> 02:10:48,292
fire!

1685
02:10:58,042 --> 02:11:01,333
Attack!

1686
02:11:48,958 --> 02:11:54,042
Attack!

1687
02:12:24,583 --> 02:12:25,833
Ammo supply!

1688
02:12:26,208 --> 02:12:27,167
Move, move, move!

1689
02:12:28,292 --> 02:12:29,417
Need more ammo!

1690
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,958
Never see ammo go this fast like before!

1691
02:12:35,042 --> 02:12:36,292
Ammo supply!

1692
02:12:43,125 --> 02:12:44,875
You gonna pick that up, Glover?

1693
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,583
Yeah, I got it, I got it!

1694
02:12:48,083 --> 02:12:49,333
All right, we gotta move!

1695
02:12:49,583 --> 02:12:51,042
Prepare the second load!

1696
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:52,375
They are coming!

1697
02:12:58,417 --> 02:13:00,875
You guys think we're gonna make it for chow time?

1698
02:13:00,875 --> 02:13:02,083
Shut up, Costello!

1699
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:04,875
We're gonna be lucky if they
don't roast our turkeys for dinner.

1700
02:13:13,833 --> 02:13:14,667
Hurry!

1701
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:17,958
Hurry! Right here!

1702
02:13:17,958 --> 02:13:19,542
Two in the front and three in the back. Hurry!

1703
02:13:35,042 --> 02:13:36,792
Take cover! Take cover now!

1704
02:13:37,667 --> 02:13:39,625
Target the center watchtower!

1705
02:13:39,792 --> 02:13:40,500
Copy!

1706
02:13:40,917 --> 02:13:42,875
Ready, fire!

1707
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,708
Lei, where are your mortars?

1708
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:12,792
Hang on. Hang on.

1709
02:14:15,625 --> 02:14:16,708
Hang on.

1710
02:14:27,667 --> 02:14:30,375
Lei, great job!

1711
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:33,917
Who called me?

1712
02:14:34,208 --> 02:14:35,083
I didn't.

1713
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:37,667
Hurry!

1714
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:50,292
All tanks defend the headquarters!

1715
02:15:04,208 --> 02:15:05,542
Jesus, Sunny.

1716
02:15:12,792 --> 02:15:14,542
Go! find the American flag!

1717
02:15:14,542 --> 02:15:15,500
Destroy their HQ.

1718
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,333
Yes.

1719
02:15:17,292 --> 02:15:19,125
Sir, the Air Force is on its way!

1720
02:15:19,125 --> 02:15:20,500
The enemy is closing in!

1721
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,708
Emergency orders are required, sir!

1722
02:15:23,667 --> 02:15:25,250
Aim right at them!

1723
02:15:35,833 --> 02:15:36,667
Hurry!

1724
02:15:37,125 --> 02:15:38,417
Send the ammunition to them!

1725
02:15:38,417 --> 02:15:39,125
Hurry up!

1726
02:15:39,125 --> 02:15:40,000
Yes.

1727
02:16:00,583 --> 02:16:01,292
The tank is coming!

1728
02:16:01,292 --> 02:16:02,000
Go that way!

1729
02:16:03,167 --> 02:16:04,167
Find cover!

1730
02:16:04,917 --> 02:16:06,625
Hurry, take cover!

1731
02:16:12,333 --> 02:16:13,125
Go!

1732
02:16:20,667 --> 02:16:21,750
Bazooka!

1733
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:22,542
Here!

1734
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:57,083
Run!

1735
02:17:08,667 --> 02:17:09,542
Leave me!

1736
02:17:09,583 --> 02:17:10,792
Hang on!

1737
02:17:11,333 --> 02:17:12,125
Go!

1738
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,375
Go!

1739
02:17:37,542 --> 02:17:40,500
Don't fall asleep, bro. Wait for me.

1740
02:18:04,083 --> 02:18:09,833
Dachuan! Dachuan!

1741
02:18:10,167 --> 02:18:11,250
Attack!

1742
02:18:11,458 --> 02:18:12,917
Charge!

1743
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:19,292
Watch out!

1744
02:18:19,292 --> 02:18:20,667
Up there!

1745
02:18:24,292 --> 02:18:25,458
Spread out!

1746
02:18:29,417 --> 02:18:31,167
Spread out!

1747
02:20:50,167 --> 02:20:51,083
Grenade!

1748
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:58,083
1, 2, 3! Go!

1749
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:08,875
Rush forward!

1750
02:21:08,875 --> 02:21:09,958
Fight!

1751
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:01,292
Bro!

1752
02:22:13,625 --> 02:22:15,708
Spread out!

1753
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:18,042
Get down!

1754
02:22:18,042 --> 02:22:19,167
Hurry!

1755
02:22:26,083 --> 02:22:26,958
Grenade!

1756
02:22:38,583 --> 02:22:39,333
Get back!

1757
02:22:39,333 --> 02:22:40,208
Take cover!

1758
02:22:40,208 --> 02:22:41,250
Get on! Hurry!

1759
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,125
Get in the truck!

1760
02:22:42,125 --> 02:22:43,333
Stop them!

1761
02:22:44,792 --> 02:22:46,458
A fool who risks his neck

1762
02:22:46,458 --> 02:22:48,042
will never be a hero!

1763
02:22:48,042 --> 02:22:49,750
Stay calm!

1764
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:51,625
You must stay calm on the battlefield!

1765
02:23:25,833 --> 02:23:27,250
I order a full retreat!

1766
02:23:27,708 --> 02:23:28,792
Give the order!

1767
02:23:29,042 --> 02:23:30,250
All units fall back!

1768
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:31,458
Burn everything!

1769
02:23:36,333 --> 02:23:37,708
Let's get out of here!

1770
02:23:37,833 --> 02:23:38,958
Go!

1771
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,708
They are going to retreat!

1772
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:40,625
Stop them!

1773
02:23:40,708 --> 02:23:42,833
Fall back!

1774
02:24:21,875 --> 02:24:23,083
Sir, the vehicle is ready!

1775
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:28,583
Go!

1776
02:24:34,875 --> 02:24:35,958
Back up!

1777
02:24:36,583 --> 02:24:37,667
Back up!

1778
02:25:15,708 --> 02:25:16,625
What are you doing?

1779
02:25:17,667 --> 02:25:19,750
Only 8 more! I'm about to reach 20!

1780
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:28,000
Some shots must be fired.

1781
02:25:28,042 --> 02:25:29,583
Some shots can be saved.

1782
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,875
All units, move it to the position.

1783
02:26:13,917 --> 02:26:15,250
Wait for the order.

1784
02:26:15,292 --> 02:26:16,208
I repeat.

1785
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:17,917
Wait for the order.

1786
02:26:17,958 --> 02:26:19,417
Move! Move! Move!

1787
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:23,042
All units, move it to position.

1788
02:26:23,083 --> 02:26:24,417
Wait for the order.

1789
02:26:24,458 --> 02:26:25,375
I repeat.

1790
02:26:25,417 --> 02:26:27,125
Wait for the order.

1791
02:26:30,333 --> 02:26:32,250
Sir, calling from Sinhung-ni

1792
02:26:32,292 --> 02:26:33,958
demanding immediate reinforcements.

1793
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,125
They are in urgent retreat.

1794
02:26:36,208 --> 02:26:36,792
Landman,

1795
02:26:37,042 --> 02:26:39,292
get reinforcements to Sinhung-ni. Move!

1796
02:26:47,708 --> 02:26:50,708
"Hagaru-ri"

1797
02:26:51,125 --> 02:26:53,458
All units consolidate immediately
and count inventory.

1798
02:26:53,667 --> 02:26:55,250
The 2nd Company of the 3rd Battalion,
stay on guard.

1799
02:26:55,292 --> 02:26:56,583
Stay alert in all directions!

1800
02:26:56,875 --> 02:26:57,667
The 3rd Platoon and the 6th Platoon,

1801
02:26:57,708 --> 02:26:59,250
defend the southwest direction.

1802
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:10,458
Call him Old Company Commander.

1803
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,917
Old Company Commander.

1804
02:27:14,792 --> 02:27:15,750
Not you.

1805
02:27:19,833 --> 02:27:21,375
Didn't I tell you?

1806
02:27:21,958 --> 02:27:22,833
I got it,

1807
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:25,750
the undefeatable hero.

1808
02:27:31,875 --> 02:27:33,083
Wanli.

1809
02:27:37,667 --> 02:27:38,500
How old are you?

1810
02:27:41,417 --> 02:27:42,625
Nineteen.

1811
02:28:03,917 --> 02:28:05,125
Little brat,

1812
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:06,833
have you seen any enemy aircraft?

1813
02:28:08,333 --> 02:28:10,167
The plane opens its butt end

1814
02:28:10,167 --> 02:28:12,042
and pours down bullets and bombs.

1815
02:28:12,333 --> 02:28:15,000
After that, our men in yellow uniforms

1816
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,875
will drop one after another.

1817
02:28:16,875 --> 02:28:18,500
What should we call those brothers

1818
02:28:19,083 --> 02:28:20,667
who were Killed in action?

1819
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:24,167
What should we call those
who froze to death

1820
02:28:24,208 --> 02:28:26,000
after marching for 6 days and nights

1821
02:28:26,375 --> 02:28:28,000
without any food or sleep?

1822
02:28:31,167 --> 02:28:33,083
What about those who ran to 10 meters
in front of the enemy

1823
02:28:33,125 --> 02:28:34,542
just to toss their hand grenades?

1824
02:28:34,958 --> 02:28:36,458
They were killed.

1825
02:28:36,625 --> 02:28:37,875
What should we call them?

1826
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:45,500
There aren't any heroes
who will never freeze to death,

1827
02:28:45,542 --> 02:28:47,125
let alone ones who will never be killed.

1828
02:28:47,167 --> 02:28:49,167
A soldier only lives for honor and glory.

1829
02:28:52,792 --> 02:28:54,000
What should I call you?

1830
02:28:59,042 --> 02:29:00,750
The 677th Soldier,

1831
02:29:01,458 --> 02:29:02,583
Wu Wanli.

1832
02:29:05,792 --> 02:29:07,417
"Wan" means ten-thousand.

1833
02:29:18,375 --> 02:29:19,583
Watch out.

1834
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:30,792
Sophisticated.

1835
02:29:40,792 --> 02:29:42,167
U.S. Aircraft are here!

1836
02:29:42,250 --> 02:29:43,333
Bazooka!

1837
02:29:45,333 --> 02:29:46,458
U.S. Aircrafts!

1838
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:47,875
U.S. Aircrafts!

1839
02:29:48,333 --> 02:29:49,667
Find cover!

1840
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,500
God save us!

1841
02:30:41,292 --> 02:30:42,042
Spread out!

1842
02:30:42,833 --> 02:30:44,542
U.S. bomb!

1843
02:30:49,292 --> 02:30:50,042
Are you alright?

1844
02:31:03,417 --> 02:31:04,125
What's your name?

1845
02:31:05,125 --> 02:31:05,958
Officer,

1846
02:31:06,208 --> 02:31:08,583
I'm the 280th soldier of the 7th Company, Ping He.

1847
02:31:12,583 --> 02:31:13,708
FX Bomb!

1848
02:31:13,708 --> 02:31:14,833
Spread out!

1849
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,958
Spread out!

1850
02:31:15,958 --> 02:31:16,792
FX Bomb!

1851
02:31:16,792 --> 02:31:18,000
They're going to bombard us!

1852
02:31:21,167 --> 02:31:22,250
FX Bomb!

1853
02:31:22,250 --> 02:31:23,125
Spread out!

1854
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:24,375
Spread out!

1855
02:31:25,083 --> 02:31:26,875
IS sighted, vision clear.

1856
02:31:26,917 --> 02:31:28,500
Ready to drop. Over.

1857
02:31:48,292 --> 02:31:51,375
Enemy planes! Spread out!

1858
02:32:23,208 --> 02:32:25,833
I'll send their FX bomb back to them!

1859
02:33:00,375 --> 02:33:02,083
Bastards.

1860
02:33:54,583 --> 02:34:00,375
Everybody says that...

1861
02:34:06,667 --> 02:34:13,917
Everybody says that

1862
02:34:13,917 --> 02:34:20,792
Yimeng Mountain is the best.

1863
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:27,250
The scenery is beautiful

1864
02:34:27,458 --> 02:34:33,708
on Yimeng Mountain.

1865
02:34:34,667 --> 02:34:35,917
Lei!

1866
02:34:35,917 --> 02:34:38,042
Lift the car.

1867
02:35:15,792 --> 02:35:16,792
It hurts.

1868
02:35:18,167 --> 02:35:20,042
It so hurts.

1869
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:46,250
Don't...

1870
02:35:50,833 --> 02:35:53,500
Don't...

1871
02:35:55,375 --> 02:35:58,208
Don't leave me alone here.

1872
02:36:37,333 --> 02:36:38,667
Why do you want to be a soldier?

1873
02:36:39,333 --> 02:36:41,208
So Qianli will take me seriously.

1874
02:36:42,708 --> 02:36:44,000
What are you talking about?

1875
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:46,917
You're only tough enough

1876
02:36:46,958 --> 02:36:48,167
when your enemies take you seriously.

1877
02:37:41,458 --> 02:37:44,083
"Lei Suisheng.”

1878
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:35,667
Lei,

1879
02:38:36,292 --> 02:38:38,208
It won't hurt anymore.

1880
02:38:42,875 --> 02:38:45,167
It won't hurt anymore.

1881
02:38:54,750 --> 02:38:56,583
You've done well, Lei.

1882
02:39:06,792 --> 02:39:07,583
Let me.

1883
02:39:14,708 --> 02:39:16,292
When I was back home last time,

1884
02:39:16,458 --> 02:39:18,292
every time I went out on the street,

1885
02:39:19,083 --> 02:39:21,917
people would nod and smile at me.

1886
02:39:26,542 --> 02:39:28,000
I didn't know them,

1887
02:39:32,125 --> 02:39:34,833
but they recognized my army uniform.

1888
02:39:38,125 --> 02:39:39,750
Before I left home,

1889
02:39:39,792 --> 02:39:41,167
my daughter asked me,

1890
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:45,458
"Daddy, why must you fight this war?"

1891
02:39:46,042 --> 02:39:48,292
If we don't fight this war,

1892
02:39:48,833 --> 02:39:51,500
our next generation will have to fight it.

1893
02:39:54,125 --> 02:39:55,833
We are risking our lives

1894
02:39:59,333 --> 02:40:01,792
to win them a peaceful life.

1895
02:40:03,958 --> 02:40:05,792
My mom kept gazing at me

1896
02:40:06,875 --> 02:40:08,833
without saying a word

1897
02:40:10,042 --> 02:40:12,042
when I left home.

1898
02:40:13,958 --> 02:40:15,292
I know

1899
02:40:17,083 --> 02:40:18,833
she didn't want me to leave.

1900
02:40:20,375 --> 02:40:22,000
My wife said

1901
02:40:22,167 --> 02:40:23,875
when I came home again,

1902
02:40:25,042 --> 02:40:28,500
I had to teach our daughter how to do the math.

1903
02:40:43,083 --> 02:40:44,167
We have to win the war

1904
02:40:44,958 --> 02:40:46,750
and bring them home.

You can leave anytime.

The supplies are on board now.

1912

Okay, get ready.

1913

You send that chopper to evacuate the wounded.
