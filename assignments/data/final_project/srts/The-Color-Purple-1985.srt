0
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,710
"Keep my sister away from me

1
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
"Me and you, us never part"

2
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,555
Celie! Nettie!
Come back to the house now.

3
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,310
Girls, your mama got supper.

4
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,632
Celie, you got the ugliest smile
this side of Creation.

5
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,072
Ain't you done yet?

6
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,393
A girl!

7
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,673
I want it.

8
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
You better not tell nobody but God.

9
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,992
IØd kill your mama.

10
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,594
Dear God...

11
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,990
...l'm fourteen years old.

12
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,030
I've always been a good girl.

13
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
Maybe you can give me a sign.

14
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,996
Let me know whaØs happening to me.

15
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,671
One day, my daddy come and say,
"You gonna do what your mama wouldn't."

16
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,317
Now, I got two children by my daddy.

17
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,593
A baby boy called Adam,
he took while I was sleeping...

18
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,836
...and a baby girl called Olivia...

19
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,630
...that he took right out of my arms.

20
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,472
Then my mama died...

21
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,231
...cursing and screaming...

22
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,311
...because her heart been broke.

23
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,954
Dear God, he act like
he can't stand me no more.

24
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,480
I don't think he kilt my baby boy.

25
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,559
I heard he sold it
to a preacher and his wife.

26
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,878
I keep hoping he'll find somebody to marry.

27
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,670
I seen him looking at my little sister.

28
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,193
She's scared.

29
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,035
But I say, "I'll take care of you,
with Go’s help."

30
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,230
Dear God, he come home with a girl
from around the town called Gray.

31
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,874
She be almost my age,
but they getting married now.

32
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,834
My little sister, Nettie, has got
a man always looking at her.

33
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,631
His wife dead. She was killed by
her boyfriend, coming home from church.

34
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,871
He got three children.

35
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,032
He seen Nettie in church.

36
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,955
Now every Sunday evening,
here come Mister.

37
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,991
I want to marry your Nettie.

38
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,590
I got to have somebody right now.

39
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,920
I got nobody to watch over my young'uns.

40
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,711
They be fighting and bleeding
and throwing up on the floor...

41
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,151
...while I got a farm to run.

42
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,280
I'll take right good care of your Nettie.

43
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,951
I can't let you have Nettie.

44
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,714
She too young.

45
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,838
But I tell you what.
I can let you have Celie.

46
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,390
She oldest and should marry first.

47
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,078
She ain't fresh, but I expect you know that.

48
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,311
She's spoiled... twice.

49
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,989
Celie is ugly...

50
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,469
...but she works hard, and she can learn.

51
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,113
And God fixed her.

52
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,234
You can do what you like.
She won't make you feed or clothe it.

53
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,352
But Nettie, you flat out can't have.
Not now, not never.

54
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,434
Well, I ain't never looked
at the other one before.

55
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,992
Let me see her again.

56
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
Celie, Mister want another look at you.

57
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,311
Move up. He won't bite.

58
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,475
Turn around.

59
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,391
What you doing that for?

60
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,955
Your sister's thinking about marriage.

61
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
Why y'all standing out here waiting?

62
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,552
This here's your new mammy.

63
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,312
She ain't my mammy.

64
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,352
I don't cry.

65
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,311
I laid there thinking about Nettie,
while he on top of me.

66
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,871
Wonder if she's safe.

67
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,676
Then I think about
that pretty woman in the picture.

68
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,517
I know what he doing to me,
he done to her.

69
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,391
And maybe she like it.

70
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,833
Jesus!

71
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,839
Harpo, didn't I tell you to clean my saddle?

72
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,752
I did do it, Pa.

73
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,470
Look at the mold on the side.

74
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,315
Look at the dirt on it.
This don't look like iØs clean.

75
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,996
The new mule, Joey, had it.
I couldn't get it from him.

76
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,992
He was biting and kicking on it.

77
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,548
When's the last time
their hair was combed?

78
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,677
Not since their mammy did it.

79
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,878
I'll have to shave it off.

80
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,078
No! IØs bad luck to cut a woman's hair.

81
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,152
This'll take all day.

82
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,713
Shut up!

83
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,111
I can't. It hurts her.

84
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,232
Don't talk back to me.

85
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,192
You do what I tell you.

86
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,078
Dear God, I seen my baby girl.

87
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,313
I know it was her.

88
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,870
She looked just like me and my daddy.

89
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,589
Like more us than us is ourself.

90
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,912
My little girl looks like
she fretting over something.

91
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,157
She got my eyes, just like they is today.

92
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,678
Like everything I see, she's seeing.

93
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,592
ThaØs real pretty.

94
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,799
I'm making me and my
little girl a new dress.

95
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,036
Her daddy will be so pleased.

96
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,793
Who her daddy?

97
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,235
Mr. Samuel.

98
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,115
Mr. Samuel... who he?

99
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,558
The Reverend Mr. Samuel.

100
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,877
You want that cloth or not?
We got other customers.

101
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,919
Yes, sir. I want five yards, sir.

102
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,593
You want something?

103
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,670
How long you had your little girl?

104
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,389
She be seven months on the 15th.

105
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,192
Can I hold her?

106
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,753
If you like.

107
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,392
I think she mine.

108
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,472
My heart say she mine.

109
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,711
But I don't know she mine.

110
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,919
If she my baby, her name Olivia.

111
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,956
I stitch "Olivia"
on all the seat of her diapers.

112
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,756
I stitch a lot of little flowers
and stars, too.

113
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,915
He took all the diapers when he took her.

114
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,274
WhaØs her name?

115
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,154
Pauline.

116
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,311
But I calls her Olivia.

117
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,836
Whys you call her Olivia
when that ain't her name?

118
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,029
Don't she look like an Olivia to you?

119
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,230
Just look at those eyes.

120
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Only somebody old would
have eyes like that.

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,512
So I call her Ole Livia.

122
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,272
Nice talking to you.

123
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,512
My husban’s waiting.

124
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,150
You gonna buy anything or not, gal?

125
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,190
Give these to Mr. Johnson.

126
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,272
I'm so glad to see you!

127
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,434
I just couldn't keep him off me.
Could I stay here with you?

128
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,559
Can Nettie stay with us for a spell?

129
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,278
Sure. She be kin now.

130
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,591
What happened with you and Pa?

131
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,751
I just couldn't keep him off me.

132
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,356
He'd try everything. You know how he is.

133
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,591
I ain't never going back there!

134
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,276
You hear what I say? I'd die first Celie.

135
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,995
Don't let them run over you.
Show them who's got the upper hand.

136
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,355
They got it.

137
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,829
You got to fight, Celie. You got to.

138
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,390
I don't know how to fight.

139
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,918
All I know how to do is stay alive.

140
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,190
You sure look pretty today, Nettie.

141
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,718
Celie, my boy be needing his supper.

142
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,400
Sure is a pretty dress you have on.

143
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,035
"Oh, Nettie, you have such nice skin...

144
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,920
"...and such soft, beautiful hair.

145
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,393
"And you smell so good
when I sit close to you. And your teeth..."

146
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,952
He talk about your teeth?

147
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,669
Yeah, about how bright they shine.

148
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,152
"My boy wants supper. The kitchen
needs cleaning. The cow needs milking.

149
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,916
"My shirt needs mending. My pants
need fixing. My shoes need shining.

150
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,752
"My children need feeding.

151
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,638
"And when you're tired...

152
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,832
"...l'm gonna climb on top of you
and do my business...

153
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,110
"...before you can say, 'Amen."'

154
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,640
You're gonna have to leave here soon...

155
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,479
...before he makes his move on you.

156
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,069
What would I do if I couldn't talk to you?

157
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,434
We could write.

158
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,240
- Can you read good?
- I can't say that I do.

159
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,630
I'll go to school for both of us.

160
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,395
We'll both learn real hard
before he breaks us apart.

161
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,275

Is it on the shelf?

255
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,797
Is it the right side or the left side?

256

The left.

257
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,749
Is this the right vest for my suit?

258

She said she write, but she never write.

265
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
She said only death
could keep her from me.

266
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,872
Maybe she dead.

Looks like you got yourself in trouble.

278

I ain't in no trouble.

279
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,519

Harpo.

282
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,918
How does he know that?

283
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,318
He knows because he the only one!

284
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,752
Get me some lemonade.

285
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,271
Young women no good these days.

286
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,478
Got their legs open
for every Tom, Dick and Harpo.

287
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,158
Don't think I'll let
my boy marry you 'cause...

288
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,998
...you in the family way.

289
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,399
Not cold enough.

290
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,150
He young and limited. Pretty gal like
you could put anything over on him.

291
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,713
Why I need to marry Harpo?
He living here with you.

292
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,759
What food and clothes he get, you buy.

293
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,032
I know your daddy throwed you out.
Ready to live in the street.

294
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,357
No, sir, I ain't living in no streets.

295
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm living with my sister and her husband.

296
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,916
I can live with them
the rest of my life if I want.

297
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,596
Don't tell me how to take care
of me and my baby.

298
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,151
I can take care of it myself.

299
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,873
Nice visiting.

300
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,272
You stay right here, Harpo.

301
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,830
When you free,
me and the baby will be waiting.

302
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,435
At least somebody here know
how to treat a visitor.

303
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,751
Harpo, don't you move...

304
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,032
...one step.

305
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,990
Don't make me wait too long.

306
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,069
I won't!

307
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,231
I will!

308
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,275
I do.

309
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,515
I do!

310
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,995
I do.

311
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,598
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

312
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,310
To love, honor and cherish?
Forsaking all others for him alone...

313
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,837
...you will perform unto him
all duties owed a husband...

314
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,230
...until death shall separate you.

315
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,396
I do!

316
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,510
You may now salute the bride.

317
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,670
Amen!

318
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,398
I's married now! I's a married woman!

319
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,912
I been needing so many curtains,
but I ain't had time.

320
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,316
You children go on home!

321
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,438
Harpo, come on down.
I need you to hold this baby.

322
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,875
I'm busy!

323
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,679
Busy making a racket.
Now come on down here!

324
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,515
Damn, I'll come down
when I'm good and ready!

325
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,759
Child, we're going to get you a little milk.

326
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,958
A little milk for the baby, yes, indeed.

327
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,032
Here. Go to your daddy.

328
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,032
What should I do with it?

329
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,596
Feed her, then fix up the mess you done.

330
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,631
I can smell the rain coming.

331
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,350
Miss Celie, we got ourselves some new
curtains I want to put in the bedroom.

332
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,039
What you looking at?

333
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,190
IØs gonna rain on your head!

334
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,593
You ever hit her?

335
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,474
No, sir.

336
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,670
How do you expect her to mind?

337
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,231
Wives is like children.

338
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,113
You have to let them know
who got the upper hand.

339
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,118
Nothing can do it better
than a good beating.

340
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,269
Sofia thinks too much of herself.

341
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,950
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.

342
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,160
Got a new baby and it cry all night long.

343
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,199
Kept him up so he said
he wasn't going to work.

344
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,557
She got all upset but I said,
leave the man alone.

345
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,189
Sometimes a man just needs
to be left alone.

346
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,633
I want some food!

347
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,996
Pie's in the pantry. Women need
to be left alone sometimes, too.

348
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,117
I tell Harpo, when I'm fussing,
"leave me alone!"

349
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,674
Get it for me!

350
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,632
WhaØs the matter with you?

351
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,030
ThaØs my own baby crying.

352
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,071
Make yourself useful.

353
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,111
What should I do about Sofia?

354
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,995
Beat her.

355
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,672
You told Harpo to beat me!

356
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,276
It was that mule, Old Joey.
Old Joey, the mule.

357
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,956
I was plowing the north field
and the mule went crazy.

358
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,636
He started kicking.
Busted my eye and my lip.

359
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,520
All my life I had to fight.

360
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,356
I had to fight my daddy,
I had to fight my uncles.

361
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,591
I had to fight my brothers.

362
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,959
Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.

363
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,317
But I never thought I had
to fight in my own house!

364
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,471
I loves Harpo.

365
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,030
God knows I do.

366
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,356
But I'll kill him dead
before I let him beat me!

367
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,432
ThaØs a hoof print.

368
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,113
IØs a fist print.

369
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,919
No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face.

370
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,959
You want a dead son-in-law, Miss Celie?

371
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,999
You keep on advising him like you're doing.

372
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,274
This life be over soon.
Heaven lasts always.

373
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,434
You should bash Mister's head open
and think about Heaven later.

374
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,990
Sofia beat on Harpo.

375
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,550
Then Harpo beat on Sofia.

376
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
And then, Sofia beat on Harpo some more.

377
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,957
In between the beatings,
the children keep coming.

378
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,879
And then one day,
Sofia can't take it no more.

379
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,992
Good riddance!

380
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,834
Nettie.

381
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,234
I brung you some fresh-baked cookies,
made in my stove!

382
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,352
Have a fine day, Mr. Huntley!
And keep the plate!

383
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,392
Anything come for me?

384
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,756
Dear God, today was a peculiar day.

385
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,077
I was sitting on the porch
reading to the kids...

386
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,119
...when suddenly, something struck me.

387
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,000
I got up and looked at the sky.

388
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,880
It was dark and there
wasn't nothing moving.

389
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,111
I got down off the porch...

390
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,796
...to see what was coming.
It felt like twister weather.

391
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,954
I didn't see nothing.
But I know something's there.

392
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,277
Yes, indeed, Lord.
I know something's coming.

393
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,149
Who that, Pa? Who this?

394
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,072
Pa, who this?

395
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,355
The woman that should have been
your mammy.

396
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,555
Shug Avery?

397
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,559
Give me a hand and get her in the house.

398
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,120
Celie! Help me get her in the house.

399
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,672
Celie! Get here!

400
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,275
This Shug Avery, a friend of the family.
Fix up the spare room.

401
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,874
I can't move.

402
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,238
I can't move! I need to see her eyes.

403
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,916
I feel that once I see her eyes,
my feet can let go...

404
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,958
...of where they're stuck.

405
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,870
You sure is ugly!

406
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,310
Turn loose my goddamn hand!

407
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,359
WhaØs the matter with you? You crazy?

408
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,720
I don't need no weak little boy...

409
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,237
...can't say no to his daddy, hanging on me!

410
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,439
I need me a man! You hear!

411
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,993
A man!

412
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,350
And I don't want to smell
no goddamn stinking pipe, Albert!

413
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,875
Get that thing to make me
something to eat.

414
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,590
No, I'll make it myself.

415
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,634
Albert?

416
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,916
Shit!

417
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,754
Eggs. Skillet. Why are the pots up here?

418
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,558
Nobody can get to them.

419
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,360
Butter, butter, butter.

420
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,910
IØs in the cooler, on the shelf.

421
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,551
Butter? Butter!

422
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,269
In the cooler, on the shelf.

423
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,794
Albert.

424
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,872
How do you work this stove?

425
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,913
Ain't hot enough.

426
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,677
Can't even keep a stove
burning good all day.

427
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,189
She can't even keep her oven hot!

428
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,512
You're useless sometimes!

429
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,912
Wood. Wood.

430
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,110
Did you ever cook on this?

431
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,830
It still ain't hot enough!

432
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,354
I'll get it hot.
I'll show you how to make it... hot.

433
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,317
Baby, look what I brought you.

434
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,355
Have I got a surprise for you.
This'll make you all well.

435
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,911
This looks burnt, but the eggs
are the way you like them.

436
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,270
Are you trying to kill me?

437
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,991
Now, baby, don't be that way!

438
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,680
I told you, I don't want nothing!

439
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,713
I just stand back, and wait to see
what the wall will look like.

440
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,396
See what kind of colors
Shug'll put on there now.

441
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,832
What you staring at?
Never seen a naked woman before?

442
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,391
You got any children?

443
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,034
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,391
"Yes, ma'am"? I ain't that old.

445
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,795
Two.

446
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,714
Where they at?

447
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,794
I don't know.

448
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,514
Who are you?

449
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,233
Celie, ma'am.

450
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,592
You ain't well.

451
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,914
Mind your own business. I feel fine.
Just had to eat.

452
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,118
Now, put some more bubbling oil
in this tub.

453
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,792
You got kids?

454
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,714
Yeah.

455
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,710
They with my ma and pa.

456
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,716
Never knowed a child to come out right
unless there's a man around.

457
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,794
Children...

458
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,510
...got to have a pa.

459
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,792
Your pa love you?

460
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,432
My pa loved me.

461
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,471
My pa still loves me...

462
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,558
...except he don't know it.

463
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,993
He don't know it.

464
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,309
Hey, boy! Here, boy!

465
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,597
Nobody here to greet your pa?

466
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,869
Sure ain't nobody in the fields.

467
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,594
Just couldn't rest till you got her
in your house, could you?

468
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,755
Cool drink?

469
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,313
Take your hat?

470
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,118
What is it with this Shug Avery?

471
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,991
She black as tar...

472
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,913
...nappy-headed...

473
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,920
She got legs like baseball bats.

474
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,597
Her own daddy won't have
nothing to do with her.

475
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,640
Old Mister talking trash about Shug.

476
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,752
Folks don't like nobody
being too proud or too free.

477
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,877
She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel.

478
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,071
She ain't even clean.

479
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,234
I hear she's got
that nasty women's disease.

480
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,559
You ain't got it in you to understand.

481
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,272
I love Shug Avery.

482
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,990
Always have, always will.

483
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,039
Shoul’ve married her when I had a chance.

484
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,790
And throwed your life away. And a right
smart amount of my money with it.

485
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,876
I hear all her children's
got different daddies.

486
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,998
IØs all too trifling and confused.

487
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,315
All Shug's children got the same daddy.
I can vouch...

488
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,238
You can vouch for nothing!

489
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,991
Shug Avery done set the population
of Hartwell County a new high.

490
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,959
You just one of the roosters, boy.

491
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,351
You has my sympathy.

492
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,270
Ain't many women's allow their
husban’s whore to lay up in their house.

493
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,238
Hand Pa his hat.

494
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,794
Next time, I'll put a little Shug Avery pee
in his glass...

495
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,871
...and see how he like that.

496
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,875
I ain't heard so much racket
since before Sofia left.

497
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,669
Every evening after he leave the field...

498
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,350
...he knocking down and piling things up.

499
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,160
Sometime his friend, Swain,
come by to help.

500
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,835
Harpo!

501
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,440
Two of them worked long way past supper.

502
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,116
Mister have to call and tell them
to shut up the racket.

503
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,272
What you doing?

504
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,158
Building a jook joint!

505
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,793
Way back here?

506
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,393
Jook joinØs supposed to
be way back in the woods.

507
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,551
You never seen this before.

508
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,312
I know what a cow looks like.

509
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,630
You ain't never seen a cow like this.

510
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,830
Ready... one... two... three!

511
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,390
Welcome to Harpo's! I'm Harpo.

512
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,550
Girl, I'd drink your bath water!

513
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,869
Oh, sugar dumpling, let me taste some!

514
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,159
You can catch a fish without a hook, girl.

515
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,759
Looks like Albert brought his maid.

516
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,914
Last time I saw that kind of hat
was at my mama's funeral.

517
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,598
There are only two kinds of children
in this world...

518
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,990
...Go’s children and Satan's!

519
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,880
Babylon ain't no far-off place in the desert.

520
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,510
IØs right here! Just a few
hundred yards from this holy place.

521
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,075
The song I'm about to sing...

522
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,918
...is called "Miss Celie's Blues."

523
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,397
Because she scratched it out
of my head when I was ailing.

524
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,632
"Sister

525
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,714
"You've been on my mind

526
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,231
"Oh, Sister

527
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,791
"We're two of a kind

528
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,395
"So, Sister

529
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,517
"I'm keeping my eye on you

530
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,315
"I bet you think I don't know nothing

531
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069
"But singing the blues

532
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,471
"Oh, Sister

533
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,190
"Have I got news for you

534
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,755
"I'm something

535
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,394
"I hope you think
that you're something, too

536
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,790
"Oh, scuffling

537
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,478
"I been up that lonesome road

538
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,310
"And I seen a lot of suns going down

539
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,990
"Oh, but, trust me

540
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,749
"No low-life's going to run me around

541
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,830
"So let me tell you something, Sister

542
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,390
"Remember your name

543
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,271
"No twister

544
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,830
"Going to steal your stuff away

545
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,470
"My sister

546
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,989
"We sure ain't got a whole lot of time

547
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,830
"So shake your shimmy

548
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,118
"Sister

549
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,749
"Because, honey, this Shug is feeling

550
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,952
"Fine"

551
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,837
I used to live here.

552
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,832
This used to be my living room.
That was my kitchen.

553
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,794
Harpo run the doors and
windows from the creek to here.

554
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,950
Now, somewhere is my dining room.

555
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,797
Look at who's here. IØs Miss Celie.

556
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,637
Miss Celie, it sure is good to see you.

557
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,280
Pull up a chair. Have a cold drink.

558
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,600
I believes I want me some of this here.

559
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,074
I want to introduce y'all to my friend.
Henry Broadnax is his name.

560
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,756
Everybody call him Buster.
He's a good friend of the family.

561
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,991
How you doing? How you feel?

562
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,517
- Where are your children?
- At home. Where are yours?

563
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,639
What you doing here?

564
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,753
I came to hear Miss Shug sing and
to see what a nice place you built.

565
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,436
This is scandalous!
A woman with children in a jook joint!

566
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,638
A woman need to have a little fun, Harpo.

567
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,712
A woman need to be at home.

568
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,236
I don't fight my woman's battles.

569
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,438
My job is to love her and take her
where she want to go. Right?

570
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,194
LeØs dance.

571
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,916
First time I ever been knocked out
without a punch.

572
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,073
Be nice now.

573
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,913
Be nice now.

574
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,632
Who this woman?

575
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,473
You know who this is.

576
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,312
She best leave you alone.

577
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,834
Fine with me.

578
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,229
You ain't going nowhere.
This is my jook joint.

579
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,151
You said iØs our jook joint!

580
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,629
Can't a man dance with his wife?

581
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,712
Not if she left him.

582
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,309
Good night.

583
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,953
And not if he my man.
You just a big old heifer!

584
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,632
Like I said, fine with me.

585
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,273
Time to go.

586
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,314
Oh, shit!

587
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,715
This is my place!

588
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,592
Get off my boy!

589
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,558
What about me?

590
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,873
Come on, I don't want to come in after you.

591
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,794
Lord have mercy! Firemen ain't
gonna get it, somebody call the law!

592
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,270
You can light a fire without a match.

593
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,194
You can catch a fish without a hook.
You can make a blind man see.

594
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,798
Now do your shimmy.

595
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,358
Shake your shimmy, girl!
Come on! Show me your stuff!

596
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,637
Miss Celie, why you always
covering up your smile?

597
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,312
Show me some teeth.

598
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,870
Show me that pretty smile.

599
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,671
Oh, girl, you need...

600
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,911
...a smiling lesson.

601
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,755
"Made him stout. Wasn't satisfied
till he made him a snout.

602
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,310
"Made him a snout as long as a rail.

603
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,633
"Wasn't satisfied till he made him a tail.
Made him a tail..."

604
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,037
You see, Miss Celie,
you gots a beautiful smile.

605
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,432
Well, Miss Celie, I do believe
iØs time for me to go.

606
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,031
September. Yeah, September be a
good time to go off in the world.

607
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,512
WhaØs the matter?

608
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,430
He beat me when you ain't here.

609
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,189
Who do?

610
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,034
Albert?

611
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,755
Mister.

612
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,712
Why he do that?

613
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,800
He beat me for not being you.

614
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,031
I know he a bully...

615
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,517
...but there's some things I love about him.

616
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,752
You still love him?

617
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,310
I got what you call a passion for him.

618
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,793
If I was ever going to have a husband,
he'd been it. But he weak.

619
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,872
Tell me the truth.

620
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,749
Do you mind if Albert sleep with me?

621
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,832
You like sleeping with him?

622
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,914
I have to confess, I love it. Don't you?

623
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,638
No, most time I pretend I ain't even there.

624
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,837
He don't know the difference.

625
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,600
He don't never ask me how I feel.

626
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,990
He never ask me about myself.

627
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,039
He just climb on top of me
and do his business.

628
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,590
"Do his business"?

629
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,512
You sound like...

630
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,718
...he going to the toilet on you.

631
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,430
ThaØs what it feel like.

632
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,232
Then, Miss Celie...

633
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,910
...that mean you still a virgin.

634
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,675
- Yeah, because don't nobody love me.
- I love you.

635
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,560
- You think I's ugly.
- No, I don't.

636
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,077
"You ugly. You sure is ugly."

637
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,837
"You still ugly."

638
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,792
Amen.

639
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,595
Oh, Miss Celie, that was just
the salt in the sugar.

640
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,480
Me being jealous of you and Albert.

641
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,870
I think you beautiful.
