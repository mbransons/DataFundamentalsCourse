1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:19,874
I beg your pardon.

3
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:24,638
Good evening.

4
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,947
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Hardwick.

5
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,121
- Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,890
He's been waiting for you

7
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,325
the entire evening, sir.

8
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,528
The entire evening? Oh, dear.

9
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,196
Thanks.

10
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,098
Begging your pardon, sir.

11
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,667
But is that the Mr. Travers,

12
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,870
the well-known American gentleman, sir?

13
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,238
It is indeed.

14
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,874
He's come over to star in my show.

15
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,042
It's his first London appearance.

16
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,744
Your show, Mr. Hardwick?

17
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,045
I'm producing it.

18
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,547
But I don't want

19
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,781
any of the members here to know.

20
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,216
I want to surprise them.

21
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,452
I'm sure they'll be surprised,

22
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,419
Mr. Hardwick.

23
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,437
Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

24
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,319
Jerry, there are a lot of things

25
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,253
that I have to discuss.

26
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,488
So I want you to come over

27
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,589
to my hotel now.

28
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,967
What happened?

29
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,878
Jerry, I forgot to tell you.

30
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,147
I want you to stay here for the night.

31
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,815
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

32
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,016
But you must, old man, really.

33
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,117
You see, at the moment, I'm having

34
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,452
a sort of a problem with my valet.

35
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,922
What do you want me to do,

36
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:22,790
press your pants?

37
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,391
No. You wouldn't know how.

38
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,826
No, you don't understand.

39
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,694
It's my man, Bates.

40
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,629
- We've had a bit of a tiff.
- How terrible.

41
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,732
- You didn't come to blows or anything?
- Nothing like that.

42
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,033
We're not speaking to each other.

43
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,903
We've had rather a clash of taste.

44
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,739
You see, Bates insists that a square tie...

45
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,374
is the only possible tie

46
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,176
that can be worn with evening clothes.

47
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,545
A square tie, imagine.

48
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,780
I prefer the butterfly.

49
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,617
- I think Bates is right.
- Bates is never right.

50
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,120
- Well, then why don't you fire him?
- That's a little difficult.

51
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,055
I'm hoping against hope

52
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,824
that the man will just disappear.

53
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,259
I hate to interfere

54
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,027
in these little family squabbles.

55
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,362
But let's hope he'll approve of me.

56
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,664
There's never any telling with Bates.

57
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,966
There you are.

58
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,401
If you please.

59
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,541
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

60
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,276
Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir.

61
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,977
We are Bates, sir.

62
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,312
Really?

63
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:24,084
- We are Jerry Travers.
- Welcome to our menage.

64
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:24,885
Thank you, Bates.

65
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,087
It seems that I'm to stay here tonight.

66
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,722
At least that was the idea

67
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,491
of our beloved impresario.

68
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,992
Whose idea?

69
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,727
Mr. Hardwick's.

70
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,096
His idea.

71
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,204
Welcome anyhow.

72
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,372
Thank you, Bates.

73
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,541
Pardon, sir, but may we make

74
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,776
a personal observation?

75
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,412
- Not too personal.
- No, sir.

76
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,581
It's merely that we feel impelled

77
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,848
to compliment you, sir...

78
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,586
upon your excellent taste in ties.

79
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,429
- They like me.
- You never know.

80
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,264
Where on earth did you ever find him?

81
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,665
From the Salvation Army,

82
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,399
as a matter of fact.

83
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,501
I sent them a pair of very old shoes.

84
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,337
I see. And the shoes came back

85
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,238
and Bates was in them.

86
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,505
And he's been wearing

87
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,573
my good ones ever since.

88
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,178
- How's Madge feeling?
- She's fine. Thanks, Jerry.

89
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,112
The climate at the Lido

90
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,046
has done her a lot of good.

91
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,915
That's fine. Too bad she won't be here

92
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,849
for the opening tomorrow night.

93
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,718
Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really.

94
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,319
However, she's expecting us to fly down

95
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,654
to Italy for a weekend.

96
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,422
Fly down to Italy for a weekend?

97
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:37,858
I can't. I haven't got any goggles.

98
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,960
My word, Jerry, you'll have to go.

99
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:40,694
She's counting on us.

100
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,729
She's going to have

101
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,897
a young friend visit her.

102
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,465
I suspect there's something in the air.

103
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,666
You know Madge

104
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,301
and her matchmaking proclivities.

105
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,702
Is she expecting me

106
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,637
for a weekend or a wedding?

107
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,306
You can't tell. You know how wives are.

108
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,508
No, I don't. How are they?

109
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,479
Wives? They always have a little scheme.

110
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,881
Look here, I think it's about time

111
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:01,982
you found out for yourself.

112
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,751
- You do?
- I certainly do.

113
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,785
No, thanks, Horace.

114
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,986
In me you see a youth

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,588
who's completely on the loose.

116
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,523
No yens, no yearning.

117
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,177
Hello. This is Miss Tremont.

118
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,844
I'd like to speak

119
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,145
to the manager immediately.

120
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,557
Hello. Are you there?

121
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,059
Who? The manager. Yes.

122
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,794
I can't hear a word you're saying.

123
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,197
There's a young lady downstairs.

124
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,033
A young lady. At this time of night?

125
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,768
She can't come up here now.

126
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,170
No, I'd better come down myself.

127
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,706
Jerry, go right ahead.

128
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,807
A young lady downstairs

129
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,975
evidently wants to see me.

130
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:07,895
Hello.

131
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:13,367
Won't you come in?

132
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,071
I'm awfully glad you dropped in.

133
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,639
I dropped up from the room below,

134
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,341
where I've been trying to get some sleep.

135
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,710
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,279
I didn't realize I was disturbing you.

137
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,481
You see, every once in a while,

138
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,782
I suddenly find myself...

139
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:30,985
dancing.

140
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,888
I suppose it's some kind of an affliction?

141
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,923
Yes, it's an affliction.

142
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,726
St. Vitus' dance.

143
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,295
And it only occurs at this time of night?

144
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,830
Yes, that's it.

145
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,598
It only occurs at this time of night.

146
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,967
As a matter of fact,

147
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,336
I really shouldn't be left alone.

148
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,738
Yes, I can see that.

149
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:51,839
You probably should have

150
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,307
a couple of guards.

151
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,377
I think you're very unkind

152
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,211
to make fun of me.

153
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,046
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,517
- I wish you wouldn't leave.
- Why not?

155
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,353
I think I feel an attack coming on.

156
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,357
See, there it is.

157
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:14,828
So I see.

158
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,764
There's only one thing that'll stop me.

159
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,833
You must tell me what it is.

160
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,602
My nurses always

161
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,670
put their arms around me.

162
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,875
I'll call the house detective

163
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,710
and tell him to put his arms around you.

164
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:37,751
Good night.

165
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,880
What are you doing here?

166
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,047
What are you carrying that for?

167
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,049
- Who was the young lady?
- What young lady?

168
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,452
That call wasn't for me. It was for you.

169
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,853
Somebody has registered a complaint.

170
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,489
I know. I've just seen the complaint.

171
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:16,457
She's lovely, she's delightful,

172
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,226
she's charming, and she wants to sleep.

173
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,327
She does?

174
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,729
And I'm going to help her,

175
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,298
and you're going to help me. Take this.

176
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,600
No, bring it in here

177
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:27,735
and guard it with your life.

178
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:28,903
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.

179
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,550
Look here, what's the idea?

180
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,818
The young lady downstairs wants to sleep.

181
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:45,553
So you told me.

182
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,988
I've appointed myself her official sandman.

183
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,658
But, Jerry...

184
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:14,975
What else have you got?

185
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:16,310
I'm sorry, sir,

186
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,311
but you've cleaned out the shop.

187
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,413
You better tell them

188
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,481
to plant some more for tomorrow.

189
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,417
They are all to go

190
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,418
to Miss Dale Tremont, sir?

191
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,586
That's right.

192
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,157
Her room number is 304.

193
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,231
What's that?

194
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:38,832
That's for the opening

195
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:39,733
of a butcher shop, sir.

196
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:44,405
- Send that up, too.
- But, sir, a horseshoe?

197
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,373
Why, yes, I may want to order

198
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:47,675
a peach orchard tomorrow.

199
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,444
What's the number of your room, sir?

200
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:55,182
Just charge it to Horace Hardwick,

201
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,517
room 404.

202
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,151
Yes, sir.

203
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:02,323
I wonder what Mr. Beddini

204
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,424
is going to say about this.

205
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,825
What can he say?

206
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,761
He's been sending her flowers daily

207
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:08,896
ever since they came here.

208
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,633
And entre nous...

209
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,035
the desk clerk has intimated...

210
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,171
that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont

211
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,906
with all the niceties...

212
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,375
including her clothes.

213
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,209
Really?

214
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:32,920
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

215
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:36,890
- I do hope you slept well last night.
- I slept well enough, but not long enough.

216
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,625
I'm sorry. I was hoping...

217
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,760
there was something I could do

218
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,828
to square myself.

219
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,329
That's quite all right.

220
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,164
I thought perhaps I could drive you

221
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:44,865
to the stables.

222
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,834
No, thank you. I have a hansom cab

223
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:47,868
waiting for me outside.

224
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:49,436
With a horse in front of it?

225
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,471
Yes. You see,

226
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,840
the stable people always use them.

227
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,242
They feel the horse is coming back.

228
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,844
Where's he been?

229
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,619
We're leaving tonight.

230
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,887
Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements?

231
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,788
Yes, Miss Tremont.

232
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,022
He's ordered your baggage

233
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:09,957
to be picked up at 7:00.

234
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,024
Thank you.

235
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,883
- Driver.
- Yes, miss?

236
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,619
Can't you go any faster than this?

237
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,355
Lord love a duck, miss. I can,

238
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,190
but I'm not allowed to leave the horse.

239
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,263
I meant the horse, of course.

240
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,299
It's like this, miss.

241
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,168
You see, the horse is
kind of tired today...

242
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,269
on account of having won

243
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,570
the Grand National on Friday.

244
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,038
Are you trying to tell me

245
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,806
that this is a racehorse?

246
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,409
Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too.

247
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:03,644
As a matter of fact,

248
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,479
his sire was Man O'War.

249
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,882
Who was his dam?

250
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,387
- I beg your pardon, miss?
- I said, who was his dam?

251
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,656
I don't know, miss. He didn't give a...

252
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,613
Peekaboo.

253
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,215
Stop this cab at once.

254
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,417
I don't know how.

255
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,284
I've never handled anything

256
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,719
more complicated than a Duesenberg.

257
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:47,588
Take it easy, Mavis.

258
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,623
What are we going to do?

259
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,759
In dealing with a girl or horse,

260
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,696
one just lets nature take its course.

261
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,019
There we are, miss.

262
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:21,722
I told you the horse

263
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,890
would bring you to the right place.

264
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,125
What is this strange power

265
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,660
you have over horses?

266
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:28,529
Horsepower.

267
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,499
Don't I even get any thanks?

268
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,972
Buy yourself a new hat.

269
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,160
Cab, miss?

270
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:58,919
May I rescue you?

271
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,524
No, thank you, I prefer being in distress.

272
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,032
Charming little spot you have here.

273
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,168
When does the concert start?

274
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,472
Just as soon as you and the rain stop.

275
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,341
Now, please.

276
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:22,609
You wouldn't like to be

277
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,745
just a little bit more friendly, would you?

278
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:27,781
Why should I?

279
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,917
I don't know you from Adam.

280
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,420
Maybe it's the way I'm dressed.

281
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:40,460
Are you afraid of thunder?

282
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:44,131
No, it's just the noise.

283
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,634
You know what thunder is, don't you?

284
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,003
Of course.

285
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:55,042
It's something about the air.

286
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,380
No, when a clumsy cloud from here

287
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,916
meets a fluffy little cloud from there...

288
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,786
he billows towards her...

289
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,154
she scurries away

290
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,690
and he scuds right up to her.

291
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,658
She cries a little...

292
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,594
and there you have your shower.

293
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,029
He comforts her.

294
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,297
They spark.

295
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,299
That's the lightning.

296
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:21,768
They kiss.

297
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,404
Thunder.

298
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,840
Who is sending you this horse's shoe?

299
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,409
How cute.

300
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:56,510
Alberto, I've seen him.

301
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,911
I've talked to him. I've danced with him.

302
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,680
- Him? Who is this him?
- Who?

303
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,616
His name is Adam.

304
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:03,750
You forget this Adam.

305
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:06,220
You have promised to go with me to Italy.

306
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,387
Your friend Madge Hardwick

307
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:08,121
is awaiting you.

308
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,691
There, you will dazzle the eyes

309
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,594
in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini.

310
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:14,928
Alberto, I hope you don't mind,

311
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,230
but I'm not going to the Lido.

312
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:17,965
Madre mia. What you say?

313
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:19,366
My dear, listen to me.

314
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,367
We have made agreement.

315
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,069
Beddini designs the clothes...

316
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,470
which you wear among your friends,

317
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:24,505
the smart people.

318
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:25,339
So that they ask:

319
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,640
"Who is so smart

320
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,242
as to make these smart clothes?"

321
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:28,942
And you say,

322
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:31,945
"Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "

323
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:34,481
Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it.

324
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,985
Beddini does, does he?

325
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,187
Alberto, up to the
present, our relationship

326
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,722
has been purely a business one.

327
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,223
But if you start interfering

328
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,491
in my personal affairs...

329
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:45,726
I'll go back to America

330
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,760
and live on the dole.

331
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,496
Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry.

332
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,998
I did not mean to interfere.

333
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:53,433
Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam.

334
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,101
Marry him.

335
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:57,304
But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear?

336
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,173
Fig leaves.

337
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:09,683
Thank you, sir.

338
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:12,719
Dale, a telegram for you.

339
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:15,022
Read it to me, please.

340
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,225
"Come ahead, stop.

341
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,227
"Stop being a sap, stop.

342
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,730
"You can even bring Alberto, stop.

343
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,732
"My husband is stopping

344
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,067
at your hotel, stop.

345
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,269
"When do you start, stop. "

346
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,506
I cannot understand. Who wrote this?

347
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:35,075
Sounds like Gertrude Stein.

348
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,645
No, it's from Madge Hardwick.

349
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,481
She says her husband is stopping

350
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:42,316
at this hotel and will look you up.

351
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,320
Wonder what kind of man Madge married.

352
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:47,855
He's sure to have influence.

353
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:48,989
Let's be nice to him.

354
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,124
I'm going to be too busy

355
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,426
being nice to somebody else.

356
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,228
Dale, you can't do this.

357
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,330
All my life I have promised my dresses

358
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:57,531
to take them to Italy...

359
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:58,966
and you must be in them.

360
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:01,001
Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking.

361
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:07,941
Never again will I allow

362
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,710
women to wear my dresses.

363
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,692
- Good evening, Miss Tremont.
- Good evening.

364
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,961
Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay.

365
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,830
I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order

366
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:30,597
about the bags.

367
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,833
Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick

368
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:34,268
stopping at this hotel?

369
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,202
Why, yes, Miss Tremont.

370
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,471
Mr. Hardwick has room 404.

371
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:38,906
Just above you.

372
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,811
- Are you sure?
- Definitely, miss.

373
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,147
As a matter of fact,

374
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,515
there's Mr. Hardwick now...

375
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,249
on the mezzanine.

376
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,050
The gentleman

377
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,418
with the briefcase and cane.

378
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:05,499
- Horace, here's a telegram for you.
- For me?

379
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,968
- It's from Italy.
- Italy? That's probably from Madge.

380
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:09,770
There's a message in your room

381
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:10,704
to call the box office.

382
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:11,338
Some trouble about the tickets

383
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:11,939
or something.

384
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,074
Trouble? With the tickets?

385
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:16,143
My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare.

386
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:18,078
Will you hold those things for me please?

387
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:19,746
Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs.

388
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,914
All right.

389
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:38,298
Cab, miss?

390
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,335
When a clumsy cloud meets

391
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:42,903
a fluffy little cloud.

392
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,813
We're only trying

393
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,081
to investigate matters, miss.

394
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,550
We must protect our guests.

395
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,285
She does not need your protection.

396
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,654
I am too much protection enough.

397
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:02,923
There's nothing to investigate.

398
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,159
Nothing matters, nothing's happened.

399
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,093
Will you please ask

400
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,294
these gentlemen to go?

401
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,229
You mean to tell me

402
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:10,597
that girl slapped your face...

403
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:12,132
in front of all those people for nothing?

404
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,101
What would you have done, sold tickets?

405
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,702
I mean, you did nothing,

406
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:16,870
and yet she slapped your face?

407
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,973
- Now you're getting it.
- I wish you'd be serious about this.

408
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,109
One breath of scandal at this time

409
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,076
will ruin our show.

410
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,578
Why, I'd rather have had it happen

411
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,479
to me than to you.

412
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:28,482
- If you enjoy that sort of thing.
- I do, immensely.

413
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,817
Don't be absurd.

414
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,886
I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men!

415
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,423
But cara mia, you make a big mistake.

416
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,591
I am no man.

417
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,493
I am Beddini.

418
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:43,163
How could he have made love to me

419
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,465
when he was married all the time?

420
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,067
And to Madge of all people.

421
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:50,537
So, this snake in the grass, this Adam...

422
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:52,239
already he has eaten the apple?

423
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:53,173
Yes.

424
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,946
I will kill him for you.

425
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,181
Have you finished packing?

426
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,151
But you do not understand.

427
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:07,788
Are we leaving or aren't we?

428
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,023
No, you cannot go back to America.

429
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,425
We must go to the Lido.

430
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,893
But I can't face his wife.

431
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:14,361
And why not?

432
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,563
Women are facing wives every day.

433
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:18,599
And, after all, you can't avoid seeing

434
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:19,933
Madge sometime, can you?

435
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:22,336
I guess not.

436
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,403
Very well then.

437
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,672
Why not face the musicians now?

438
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:30,110
All right. Maybe she ought to know.

439
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:32,679
You're sure

440
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:33,847
you didn't forget yourself in the park?

441
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:34,515
Positive.

442
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,250
If I ever forgot myself with that girl,

443
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:37,050
I'd remember it.

444
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:46,326
- We're the management.
- Are you?

445
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:48,695
Oh, dear. Some more

446
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,097
of these plural personalities.

447
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,967
Just a moment.

448
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,737
Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick.

449
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,938
No one must know you're here.

450
00:33:57,971 --> 00:34:00,007
If they ever suspect that you're in this,

451
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,375
it'll be in every newspaper in an hour.

452
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,981
Well, gentlemen,

453
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:08,982
this is a pleasant surprise.

454
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,951
A small matter of great import

455
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:12,553
has come to our attention, sir.

456
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,621
I am up here in your interest

457
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,290
and to protect the hotel.

458
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,526
- We wish to avoid any scandal.
- Scandal?

459
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,394
Yes, in connection

460
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,196
with a certain slap in the face.

461
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,364
The young lady refuses to divulge

462
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,799
why she slapped you.

463
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,402
Well, she didn't slap my face.

464
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:31,438
Who did she slap?

465
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,974
Why, it was... Who?

466
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:36,710
It was he, my valet.

467
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,112
Me, sir?

468
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,382
Why, of course. Don't argue with me.

469
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,050
How did it happen?

470
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,788
Possibly we had been

471
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:50,124
a little imprudent, sir.

472
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,458
Of course. You see,

473
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:53,160
we had been a little imprudent.

474
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:54,695
But you said it wasn't you.

475
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:57,664
Not Mr. Hardwick.

476
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:02,769
Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself.

477
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,272
And there we are. There you are.

478
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:06,507
You see, it was just a mistake.

479
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,609
I'll take him to task personally.

480
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,577
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.

481
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,445
- Good night.
- Not at all.

482
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,546
- Good night.
- Good night.

483
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:19,086
Bates, thank you.

484
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:21,522
You know, really,

485
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,357
you are an invaluable assistant.

486
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,960
Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir.

487
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:27,961
Thank you, Bates.

488
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,231
- Your coat, sir.
- Really?

489
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,601
This is like old times, isn't it?

490
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:35,936
Your helping me with my coat, I mean.

491
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,739
It's a pleasure we have missed, sir.

492
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,841
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, sir.

493
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,678
How is our lumbago this evening, sir?

494
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:47,981
- It's so much better, Bates, thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

495
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,485
- Bates.
- Yes, sir?

496
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,489
There's a crisis afoot.

497
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,658
Couldn't we bury the hatchet?

498
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:58,959
I mean, couldn't we forget

499
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,060
all about the ties?

500
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,765
Sic transit gloria mundi, sir.

501
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:07,201
- Bates.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,736
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

503
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,305
He's practically put his foot

504
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,073
right into a hornet's nest.

505
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:17,377
But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir.

506
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:18,679
Never mind that.

507
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,414
We have got to do something.

508
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:23,116
What about rubbing it with butter, sir?

509
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,252
You blasted fool,

510
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:26,787
you can't rub a girl with butter!

511
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,755
My sister got into a hornets' nest

512
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,524
and we rubbed her with butter, sir.

513
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,426
That's the wrong treatment.

514
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:33,260
You should have used mud.

515
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,728
Never mind that!

516
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,864
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

517
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,565
It is liable to develop into a scandal

518
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,733
that will involve all of us.

519
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:43,303
There's a young lady in the room below us.

520
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:45,239
I've seen her, sir.

521
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,273
I want you to find out

522
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,441
all you can about her.

523
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,176
Follow her wherever she goes.

524
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,611
Never take your eyes off her.

525
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,246
- Never, sir?
- Never.

526
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:56,150
- Whither she goes...
- Thither I, sir.

527
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,755
Right you are, sir. Whither or thither.

528
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,497
- What happened?
- It's all right. I fixed it.

529
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,299
But things are getting involved.

530
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,667
This is a deep-laid plot.

531
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,869
Nonsense. Why should this girl want

532
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:16,770
to involve me?

533
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,572
Why, for money, of course. Publicity.

534
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,807
Anything to create a scandal.

535
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,342
I'm going to see her and buy her off.

536
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:23,744
You're not. If anyone's going to buy

537
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:24,878
her anything, I am going to do it.

538
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,446
No, you stay right here.

539
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,348
I'll clear this all up myself.

540
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,250
It's probably some little thing you did...

541
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,752
carried away for the moment,

542
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,720
that offended her sense of decorum.

543
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,489
If I did, I'm going right down

544
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,291
and do it again. Goodbye, old boy.

545
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,234
Come along, cara mia.

546
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,242
- Get me a taxi, quickly.
- Taxi.

547
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,246
Follow that cab.

548
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:01,482
Come in.

549
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:07,254
Where's the young lady

550
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,021
that has this room?

551
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,389
She's gone, sir.

552
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:11,091
- Gone?
- Yes, sir.

553
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,329
You don't mind if I get on with me work?

554
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:16,530
I gotta get these flowers out

555
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:17,431
in the morning's rubbish.

556
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,634
That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead.

557
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:38,619
Jerry, do you realize that we have

558
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,020
less than an hour before the show opens?

559
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,455
We've got to get out of here. Come on.

560
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:08,882
Women do strange things sometimes,

561
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:09,883
don't they, George?

562
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:10,484
Yes, sir.

563
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,756
- That first act was simply marvelous.
- Good.

564
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:16,990
Everybody's crazy about it.

565
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:17,891
The critics are raving.

566
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,393
I've got some more good news.

567
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:21,962
- Did you find out were she's gone?
- She? Oh, that girl.

568
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:23,530
No, but, Jerry, please.

569
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:25,399
The entire Thackeray Club is out in front.

570
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,734
You don't suppose

571
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:28,869
my dancing has disturbed them?

572
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:30,804
I don't think so. They didn't say.

573
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,573
Of course not. It's
perfectly all right here.

574
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:34,541
Second act begins, Mr. Travers.

575
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:35,476
Thanks. I'll be there.

576
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:36,810
Really, the second act.

577
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,111
A lot of telegrams for you.

578
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:39,746
I'll be right back as
soon as the act is over.

579
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,348
My word, I never read

580
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,616
my own telegram from Madge.

581
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,685
Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight?

582
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:45,686
The biggest night of my life

583
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,386
and she isn't here.

584
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,356
- What does she say?
- All kinds of good wishes for our success.

585
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,158
Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after

586
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,593
the performance to meet her friend.

587
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,328
Her little friend is in London,

588
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,329
staying at my hotel.

589
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:56,330
Her name is Tremont.

590
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,532
Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that.

591
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,102
Horace, hire a plane right away.

592
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,871
We're leaving for Italy in the morning.

593
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,139
One minute, Mr. Travers.

594
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,807
You can't do that. The seats were sold out

595
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,774
for months in advance.

596
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:08,876
How long does it take to fly there?

597
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,144
Seven hours. You have to be back

598
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,345
Monday for a performance.

599
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,413
Charter a plane for the weekend,

600
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:14,381
we'll be back in time.

601
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,349
You're on, Mr. Travers.

602
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:16,950
I will not jeopardize my position.

603
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:18,552
If you want this show to run two nights,

604
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,787
get me a plane now.

605
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,589
- What kind of a plane?
- One with wings.

606
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:49,850
I'll go look for Madge

607
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:51,218
and see you later for cocktails.

608
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,113
- Dale, when did you get down?
- Just now.

609
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:21,515
Good. Have something to drink.

610
00:46:27,922 --> 00:46:29,223
Horse's neck.

611
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:35,196
- It's grand seeing you.
- And it's grand seeing you.

612
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:36,530
Now tell me, did my husband look you up?

613
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,101
- Yes.
- How did he impress you?

614
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,272
I think he is very fascinating.

615
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,408
Fascinating?

616
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:49,076
You know, every once in a while, the effect

617
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,212
Horace has on people surprises me.

618
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,715
He sort of surprised me, too.

619
00:46:54,748 --> 00:46:56,517
I'm glad you liked him.

620
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,852
He will be here today.

621
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,821
No. He can't...

622
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:04,692
What's the matter? Did he flirt with you?

623
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:08,762
He sent me a room full of flowers.

624
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,931
That was sweet of him.

625
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,069
But, Madge, you don't understand, he...

626
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:20,474
- He chased me in the park.
- Really?

627
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,175
I didn't know

628
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,344
Horace was capable of that much activity.

629
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:24,745
Did he catch you?

630
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,750
- Yes.
- Good for Horace.

631
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:33,521
Why, Madge, you shock me.

632
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:34,655
Horace flirts with

633
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,789
every attractive girl he meets.

634
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:37,024
He doesn't mean anything.

635
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:43,731
That's a funny way to take it.

636
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,333
My dear, when you are as old as I am,

637
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,835
you'll take your men as you find them.

638
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,104
If you can find them.

639
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:04,885
And another thing, Jerry.

640
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:06,020
The gossip at the hotel

641
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:07,054
was that this man, Beddini...

642
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:08,322
was supplying her with everything.

643
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,957
Money, clothes, flowers.

644
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,194
No, Horace, you provided the flowers.

645
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:14,562
I? I never did anything.

646
00:48:14,595 --> 00:48:16,764
I didn't even know her.
Don't be ridiculous.

647
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:18,232
But anyway, as soon as we land,

648
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,333
I'm going to see Madge...

649
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,568
and I am going to find out from her

650
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:22,570
just who and what this Tremont person is.

651
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:25,239
I only want to find out where.

652
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:26,807
Now, Jerry, I warn you...

653
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,609
you don't realize the trouble

654
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:30,511
a designing woman can make for a man.

655
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:32,146
Now, I know all about these things.

656
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,747
I wouldn't tell this to anybody.

657
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:38,219
I am the victim

658
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,787
of a designing woman myself.

659
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:43,357
- Surely you don't mean Madge?
- Why, certainly, who else?

660
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:45,159
Not Madge. She doesn't know

661
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:46,126
anything about it either.

662
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,229
Her name is Violet.

663
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:51,065
She is what the French call a passade.

664
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:55,269
I see. Little ships that pass in the night.

665
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:58,572
Ships? Yes. Exactly.

666
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,342
I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo.

667
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,810
She was a very pretty little thing

668
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:04,912
and she seemed to be quite frightened.

669
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,313
Of the birds?

670
00:49:06,347 --> 00:49:07,448
Yes. You see,

671
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,683
she had led a very sheltered life.

672
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,252
It was the storks in particular

673
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,086
that worried her.

674
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,855
I took her to a cinema...

675
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:15,923
and then we had dinner

676
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,291
and then I took her to another cinema.

677
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,160
Then I fear

678
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,028
I forgot myself and let her kiss me.

679
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:40,347
That must be his plane now. Come on.

680
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:44,018
No, I'd rather not.

681
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:46,086
Come on. If I were you...

682
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,488
I wouldn't miss this opportunity

683
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:49,690
of seeing the early worm get the bird.

684
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:59,433
You know, Dale, I haven't told you

685
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,835
the real reason I asked you down here.

686
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:03,037
Haven't you?

687
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,806
No, I feel I've known you long enough

688
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,608
to have the right to talk to you this way.

689
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:09,677
In spite of the fact that

690
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,213
all men are males...

691
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:14,114
there is no feeling so secure as having

692
00:50:14,148 --> 00:50:17,551
a good, reliable husband. I know.

693
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:38,973
- Jerry.
- Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute.

694
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,613
Where did Miss Tremont go?

695
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:49,049
- Dale didn't tell me she'd met you.
- Yes, we've met.

696
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,317
Fine, I've arranged

697
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:51,785
a little dinner party for all of us.

698
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:52,753
Let's eat now.

699
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:54,321
Leave the child alone,

700
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,789
she's a little upset about something.

701
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:58,759
- Really?
- Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you?

702
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,763
- Right between the eyes.
- Good.

703
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:06,901
- Where's Horace?
- I left him struggling with the baggage.

704
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:08,435
The hotel's crowded and both of you

705
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,471
will have to bunk together tonight.

706
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:11,305
Dale's with me.

707
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:14,542
- Did you get that room for my husband?
- Si, signora, but I am so sorry...

708
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:15,776
because of the carnival,

709
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,745
the only thing available
is the bridal suite.

710
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:22,216
- The bridal suite.
- How romantic. Thank you.

711
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,321
Signor, are you Horace Hardwick?

712
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:29,890
Thank you, I am. How do you do?

713
00:51:30,524 --> 00:51:32,793
- I am very displeased to meet you.
- Really?

714
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:35,629
What do you mean, displeased?

715
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,064
Signor, I warn you.

716
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,699
For men of your kind,

717
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:41,135
this is not a healthy place.

718
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,369
My dear fellow, this is one

719
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:43,437
of the healthiest spots in Europe.

720
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:45,072
The air, the breeze, the flowers.

721
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:48,442
So it is funny tricks you're being.

722
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:49,510
I warn you...

723
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,612
never let your path

724
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:55,516
criss-cross mine again, or the heart...

725
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,764
- Horace.
- How do you do?

726
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:14,034
Madge, darling.

727
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:17,104
My, your passion frightens me.

728
00:52:17,138 --> 00:52:21,509
- Been practicing?
- Yes. Well, scarcely. No.

729
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,877
Madge, what do you think

730
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:23,644
has happened to me?

731
00:52:24,612 --> 00:52:28,349
- I know. You got your first long trousers.
- Madge, please.

732
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:29,116
There's something down here

733
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,284
that I have to investigate...

734
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,318
and Jerry thinks that I...

735
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:33,254
Maybe I better tell it anonymously.

736
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:34,989
You know, it sounds as if you were

737
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,590
about to confess something, Horace.

738
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:39,293
Does it? What would I have to confess?

739
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,195
You really want to tell me

740
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:42,663
about Dale Tremont, don't you?

741
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:45,132
Yes, but then again, no.

742
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:46,634
You see, as a matter of fact,

743
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:47,802
I haven't even met her yet.

744
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,570
- You haven't met her?
- No.

745
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,339
If that's your story,
Horace, you stick to it.

746
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:55,309
I suppose you weren't in the park, either.

747
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,577
The park, my dear girl,

748
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,212
it happened in the zoo. What?

749
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:00,381
The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park.

750
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:01,749
How did you know I was there?

751
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,352
- A little bird told me.
- The stork?

752
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,190
I think, after the trip
I better clean up a bit.

753
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:11,659
- Of course, I understand just
how you feel. - Yes.

754
00:53:30,311 --> 00:53:32,613
- What's the matter?
- It's Madge.

755
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,248
- Has she been chasing you?
- No.

756
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,487
Jerry, I think she's
found out about Violet.

757
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:41,856
And I just had my life threatened.

758
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,492
But what did he say?

759
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,660
He just lied in a straightforward manner,

760
00:53:46,694 --> 00:53:48,062
and said he'd never met you.

761
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:53,767
- He did, did he?
- I told you he'd forget all about you.

762
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:58,772
I'll make him remember me

763
00:53:58,806 --> 00:54:00,508
in a manner he'll never forget.

764
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:04,645
Has Horace been away from you lately

765
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:05,579
for any length of time?

766
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:06,447
Well, he was alone

767
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,615
on the Continent last year.

768
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:13,587
Connect me with Mr.
Hardwick's apartment, please.

769
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:15,556
Madge, have you any objections

770
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,657
if I scare your husband...

771
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,159
so that he'll never look at another woman?

772
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:19,860
Dale, no husband

773
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:21,829
is ever too scared to look.

774
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:24,431
Hello.

775
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:30,437
Hello, where are you?

776
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:32,273
So you do remember me?

777
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:34,942
He remembers me all right.

778
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,447
- Are you alone?
- Completely and desolately.

779
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:42,416
Fine. I'll be right up.

780
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:54,795
Horace, she's coming up.

781
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:56,430
She's coming up here?

782
00:54:56,464 --> 00:54:58,132
She can't do that. It isn't proper.

783
00:54:58,165 --> 00:55:00,868
- She wants to see me alone.
- Alone? Jerry.

784
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:02,303
What did I tell you?

785
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:03,504
She wants to compromise you.

786
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:05,239
Rack your brains, please.

787
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:06,106
Couldn't you have met

788
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,408
that girl someplace else before?

789
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,478
I could have met her in Moscow.

790
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:15,449
- In Moscow. You see?
- But I've never been to Moscow.

791
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,986
Couldn't you have met her in Paris?

792
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,221
The last time I was in Paris,

793
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:21,255
I was 10 years old.

794
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,358
Jerry, I don't think it's safe

795
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,626
for you to see that girl alone.

796
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:28,262
I don't think it would be quite proper

797
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:29,663
for you to receive her that way.

798
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:44,411
Hello.

799
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:46,113
I know you'll think this is

800
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,082
a little unconventional of me...

801
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:52,553
but I just couldn't wait to see you alone.

802
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:02,129
I'm awfully glad you came up.

803
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:05,332
My darling.

804
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:10,771
Hello. How have you been?

805
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:14,141
I've been missing you terribly.

806
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,343
I came down

807
00:56:16,377 --> 00:56:17,745
on the fastest plane I could get.

808
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:21,882
No, I meant before yesterday.

809
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:27,521
- Before yesterday?
- Yes, of course.

810
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:29,757
Don't you remember?

811
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:33,928
Should I?

812
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:36,363
Have you forgotten...

813
00:56:36,397 --> 00:56:41,168
- what we've been to each other?
- No.

814
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,905
What we've been to each other...

815
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:49,210
I knew yesterday in the park,

816
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:50,744
when I was dancing in your arms...

817
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:53,948
- you remembered who I was.
- Of course.

818
00:56:55,649 --> 00:56:56,417
Who are you?

819
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:01,155
Then you still don't remember?

820
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:06,627
I can try to remember something.

821
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:10,197
How could you forget

822
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,499
that funny little house...

823
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:14,568
and the suspicious concierge...

824
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,139
and that quaint little room?

825
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,276
We used to have tea and muffins

826
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,410
in front of the fireplace...

827
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:24,712
watching the

828
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,413
shadows leaping on the ceiling.

829
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:29,617
And those long walks down that

830
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,552
twisty cobblestone street to the river.

831
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:36,690
Paris is heavenly in the spring.

832
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,201
So that's where we met.

833
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:49,336
Yes, last year.

834
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:53,307
In Paris.

835
00:57:58,379 --> 00:57:59,947
Why, of course.

836
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,652
It's all coming back to me now.

837
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:06,453
Is it?

838
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:08,989
Yes, but you weren't calling
yourself Dale Tremont.

839
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:12,626
- Wasn't I?
- No, it was...

840
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:17,832
Madeline, that was it.

841
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,000
I called you Mad for short.

842
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,137
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?

843
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:28,809
Remember that night on the Left Bank...

844
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,045
you had on that little blue dress

845
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:32,146
I bought for you?

846
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:37,551
And to think that I almost forgot you...

847
00:58:40,888 --> 00:58:41,856
Tell me something.

848
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:46,894
Do you still have that awful weakness

849
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,529
for diamond bracelets?

850
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:53,367
I suppose I do.

851
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:56,504
Make yourself comfortable, darling.

852
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,172
I'll order some cocktails.

853
00:58:58,205 --> 00:58:58,806
A little later on,

854
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,741
we'll have supper up here, just we two.

855
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:04,378
It'll be like old times, won't it?

856
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,314
I think I'd better be going.

857
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,683
I'll let you go on one condition.

858
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:12,153
Promise me, now that I found you again...

859
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:13,888
we can be to each other

860
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:16,690
what we were in Paris.

861
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,871
There, you see? I was right.

862
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,940
Of all the scheming, brazen creatures...

863
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:33,908
trying to pretend

864
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:34,842
that she met you in Paris.

865
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:35,776
Do you realize that she's

866
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,111
deliberately trying to trap you?

867
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:39,713
- What are you going to do about it?
- Marry her.

868
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:41,949
Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny.

869
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,651
All right, then, you be funny.

870
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:44,185
I'm going down

871
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:45,519
and ask her to marry me right now.

872
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:46,887
Jerry, please wait.

873
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,489
Now, before you make

874
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:49,457
a complete fool of yourself...

875
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,425
promise me that you won't ask her...

876
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:52,827
until I find out from Madge

877
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,794
more about her past.

878
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:55,429
All right, you find out
all about her past...

879
00:59:55,463 --> 00:59:57,064
and I'll go down and plan her future.

880
00:59:57,097 --> 01:00:01,602
- Remember, that's a promise.
- All right, it's a promise.

881
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:12,313
What happened? Did you scare him?

882
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:16,617
No. He scared me.

883
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:19,820
What did he do, make faces at you?

884
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:23,357
You know, sometimes

885
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:24,158
I get up in the morning...

886
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,426
and I take a good look at him

887
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,861
and he frightens me, too.

888
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:28,996
He mistook me for someone called

889
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:30,965
Madeline he'd met in Paris.

890
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:32,766
Really?

891
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,702
Madge, do you think you ought

892
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:35,903
to let him go away from you alone?

893
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:38,239
I don't believe he was nearly so innocent

894
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:39,306
in Paris as you seem to think.

895
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,609
Darling, you interest me.

896
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:43,611
I must send him to China next year.

897
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:44,478
But, Madge,

898
01:00:44,512 --> 01:00:45,646
you don't seem to understand.

899
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,515
I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid...

900
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:51,485
that we're carrying this thing too far.

901
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:57,258
You know, I wonder if you've seen

902
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,225
something in Horace...

903
01:00:58,259 --> 01:00:59,360
that I've never seen.

904
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:41,902
I wonder what's keeping Horace.

905
01:01:48,142 --> 01:01:49,043
What's the matter?

906
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,379
I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache.

907
01:01:52,413 --> 01:01:53,481
Don't go. This is a meeting

908
01:01:53,514 --> 01:01:54,782
I've been planning a long time.

909
01:02:00,588 --> 01:02:01,222
Good evening.

910
01:02:03,157 --> 01:02:04,758
It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont.

911
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:09,029
You've robbed me of the pleasure

912
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,030
of introducing you two.

913
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:11,132
You've already met.

914
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:15,236
Yes, we've met last spring.

915
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,473
I hope you see a lot of each other.

916
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:22,209
You know, Madge is

917
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:23,310
the most understanding person.

918
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:24,745
She seems to know instinctively

919
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:26,046
the kind of girl that interests me.

920
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,317
I don't know what I'd do without her.

921
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,919
That's sweet of you, darling.

922
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,053
You two run along and dance,

923
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,188
and don't give me another thought.

924
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:39,326
That's what I'm afraid of.

925
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:49,203
I think Madge is a very brave person.

926
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:50,571
Yes, I have

927
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:52,106
a tremendous admiration for her.

928
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,889
Well, if Madge doesn't care,

929
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:09,957
I certainly don't.

930
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:13,093
Neither do I, all I know is that it's...

931
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:38,352
Why don't you tell me

932
01:08:38,386 --> 01:08:39,420
what this is all about?

933
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:41,589
You know we never met in Paris.

934
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:45,026
I know. I'm afraid

935
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:46,694
I haven't been quite fair with you.

936
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:49,197
You see, I know who you are.

937
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,466
What difference does that make?

938
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,405
- So that doesn't make any difference?
- No, why should it?

939
01:08:57,438 --> 01:08:59,640
I don't know who you are, and I don't care.

940
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:01,909
That's big of you.

941
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:05,646
Well...

942
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:08,983
Well, what?

943
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:10,852
Aren't you now supposed to say...

944
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:12,253
we should think

945
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:13,588
only of what we mean to each other...

946
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:16,123
that we're entitled to live our own lives?

947
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:19,627
I don't think I'd say it

948
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,129
that way exactly, but aren't we?

949
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:25,299
Go on.

950
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:28,803
If it weren't for a promise I made

951
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:29,670
in a moment of weakness...

952
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:30,771
I would go on.

953
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:33,641
You made a promise.

954
01:09:35,076 --> 01:09:35,510
That shouldn't make

955
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:36,577
much difference to you.

956
01:09:39,247 --> 01:09:42,483
That's right. Forget it, marry me.

957
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:47,088
How could I have fallen in love

958
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:49,257
with anyone as low as you?

959
01:09:56,797 --> 01:09:57,865
She loves me.

960
01:10:03,805 --> 01:10:05,807
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

961
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:07,909
I'm leaving. You don't know

962
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:09,076
what a mess we've got into.

963
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,877
Why, what's the matter?

964
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:12,346
Your husband.

965
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:18,653
- He wants to divorce you and marry me.
- I see.

966
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,555
He wants to do right by both of us.

967
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:22,523
Did he mention any settlement?

968
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:23,457
No.

969
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:25,426
That'll come later.

970
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:26,527
He'll probably want me

971
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:27,595
to pay myself alimony.

972
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,565
Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go.

973
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:32,099
That won't solve anything.

974
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:35,236
I can't stay here under the circumstances.

975
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:36,237
Here or there,

976
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,638
as long as you remain a spinster...

977
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:39,774
you're fair game for any philandering male.

978
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:43,311
You know, what you really should have...

979
01:10:43,344 --> 01:10:45,012
is a husband you can call your own.

980
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:49,150
Seriously, I mean it.

981
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:51,886
But what are we going to do

982
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:52,787
about your husband?

983
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,722
Don't worry, dear. I'll do it.

984
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:02,563
Come in.

985
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:07,068
Darling.

986
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:20,548
All I said was darling and she smacked me.

987
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,853
Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly.

988
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:28,890
It looks like a sunrise
by Maxfield Parrish.

989
01:11:31,325 --> 01:11:32,260
Jerry, that's terrible.

990
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:34,896
I can't go around now like this.

991
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:37,365
Put a piece of raw steak on it.

992
01:11:37,398 --> 01:11:38,432
That'll take the swelling down.

993
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,534
It would?

994
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:42,436
- A steak?
- Sure.

995
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:48,042
Yes, sir.

996
01:11:48,376 --> 01:11:52,613
- Order a steak.
- A steak. Very good, sir.

997
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:55,716
You know, Jerry, I can't imagine

998
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,218
what's got into Madge recently.

999
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:58,686
She's never hit me before.

1000
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,222
Maybe she just never thought of it before.

1001
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:05,526
Room service.

1002
01:12:06,427 --> 01:12:08,563
Yes. This is the bridal suite.

1003
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,464
Yes, will you please send up

1004
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:12,133
a nice, juicy steak?

1005
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,668
I beg your pardon?

1006
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:18,506
Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots...

1007
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,077
and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee...

1008
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,051
As soon as you get your eye fixed,

1009
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,118
we'll go down and see Madge.

1010
01:12:32,653 --> 01:12:33,721
Where do you want it, sir?

1011
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:36,691
- Want what, Bates?
- The steak, sir.

1012
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:38,292
On my eye.

1013
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:42,029
On your eye, sir?

1014
01:12:43,064 --> 01:12:44,599
My word, why do I always

1015
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:45,967
have to say things twice?

1016
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,102
On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it?

1017
01:12:48,136 --> 01:12:49,670
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Don't argue!

1018
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,908
Jerry, you see what I'm up against.

1019
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:55,443
The man has a sluggish brain,

1020
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:56,677
always wants to debate things.

1021
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,380
First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge,

1022
01:12:59,413 --> 01:13:00,214
and now it's Bates.

1023
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:01,015
I give you my word,

1024
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,917
if anything else happens, I'll go insane.

1025
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,411
We are a grand success.

1026
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,507
Every woman, she's saying this dress,

1027
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:38,439
she's wonderful.

1028
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:40,369
This Beddini is the tops.

1029
01:13:41,169 --> 01:13:41,967
I'm so happy.

1030
01:13:44,998 --> 01:13:47,326
No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress,

1031
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:48,292
it's not Beddini.

1032
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,456
It's you who wears it.

1033
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,818
Thank you, Alberto.

1034
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:59,011
What is it? Is it Adam again?

1035
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:01,075
His Garden of Eden...

1036
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:03,970
he has made you sad?

1037
01:14:07,799 --> 01:14:09,661
It's just that I'm all
mixed up, that's all.

1038
01:14:09,697 --> 01:14:12,259
Why worry about this man?

1039
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,153
I think I'm worrying more about his wife.

1040
01:14:19,882 --> 01:14:22,477
Beddini does not like to see you so sad.

1041
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:27,603
Alberto, you seem to be

1042
01:14:27,638 --> 01:14:29,435
the only one left I can turn to.

1043
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,593
Why don't you marry Beddini?

1044
01:14:36,626 --> 01:14:37,391
He'll make you happy.

1045
01:14:39,055 --> 01:14:42,882
Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty...

1046
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:45,013
and then this Hardwick

1047
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:46,111
will leave you alone.

1048
01:14:51,505 --> 01:14:52,935
I'll marry you if you really want me to...

1049
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:55,964
but let's do it right away.

1050
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:08,347
First of all,

1051
01:15:08,381 --> 01:15:09,645
we'll get you straightened out...

1052
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,444
and then I'll ask Madge about Dale.

1053
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,305
Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our

1054
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,303
guests has informed us...

1055
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:16,435
that he is to be married this evening.

1056
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,968
We wondered

1057
01:15:17,003 --> 01:15:18,433
if you would give up your bridal suite.

1058
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:22,628
- Give it up? Why we...
- We've hardly settled in it yet.

1059
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:26,156
- Have we, angel?
- No, and all our clothes are... Please.

1060
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,586
- Of course you may have it.
- Thank you, sir.

1061
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:29,649
I shall remove you elsewhere.

1062
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:33,779
Come on, dear sir, brace up.

1063
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:35,276
Madge has merely heard something

1064
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:36,541
about this Violet girl.

1065
01:15:36,576 --> 01:15:37,972
We know it isn't the truth,

1066
01:15:38,006 --> 01:15:39,037
you tell her yourself...

1067
01:15:39,072 --> 01:15:40,069
that's all she's waiting for.

1068
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:41,533
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.

1069
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:43,698
Always remember that the truth

1070
01:15:43,732 --> 01:15:45,295
has never hurt any man.

1071
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:48,059
Jerry, you are right.

1072
01:15:52,686 --> 01:15:53,650
Anyway, if it does,

1073
01:15:53,685 --> 01:15:55,049
I'll go to the hospital with you.

1074
01:15:59,377 --> 01:16:01,806
Horace, what is this, Halloween?

1075
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:04,969
Madge, Horace has

1076
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:06,267
a little confession to make.

1077
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,195
I've been waiting for this for some time.

1078
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:10,927
Come right in and get it off your chest.

1079
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:15,920
You'd better take your glasses off.

1080
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:21,778
Sit down.

1081
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,422
You see, when Horace was in London,

1082
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:39,653
he met a certain young lady.

1083
01:16:39,687 --> 01:16:40,951
And, Madge, you must have

1084
01:16:40,986 --> 01:16:42,217
had an inkling of this or...

1085
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:47,309
- Or you wouldn't be telling me now.
- Never. What? Certainly.

1086
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:49,339
What Horace means to say is...

1087
01:16:49,374 --> 01:16:50,238
that he'd like to make

1088
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:51,769
a clean breast of the whole thing.

1089
01:16:51,803 --> 01:16:56,895
- Before I find out the truth.
- Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What?

1090
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:59,625
Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I?

1091
01:17:08,682 --> 01:17:10,046
- Hello.
- Madge, darling...

1092
01:17:10,878 --> 01:17:11,709
I wanted to call you

1093
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:13,340
and tell you I just got married.

1094
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:14,605
You got what?

1095
01:17:15,438 --> 01:17:16,669
I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.

1096
01:17:16,703 --> 01:17:17,568
It sounds just as if you said

1097
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:18,333
you got married.

1098
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:22,561
- I did.
- Where are you now?

1099
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:24,825
Going to the bridal suite?

1100
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:26,921
Very proper place

1101
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:27,986
for a bride and groom, isn't it?

1102
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:29,884
Darling, I must compliment you

1103
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:30,882
on your speedy work...

1104
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:31,880
but who on earth did you find

1105
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:32,979
to marry you so quickly?

1106
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,641
Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear.

1107
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,371
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Dale.

1108
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:41,867
What was that?

1109
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,430
- Dale Tremont married?
- Yes, to that dressmaker.

1110
01:17:45,464 --> 01:17:48,193
- Good.
- Good? What did you have to do with this?

1111
01:17:48,226 --> 01:17:49,990
- It's all his fault.
- My fault?

1112
01:17:50,024 --> 01:17:51,654
Yes, she told me how you chased her

1113
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:53,184
in the park and she slapped your face.

1114
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,746
Yes, but I'm the one she slapped.

1115
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,473
She's been mistaking me

1116
01:18:01,508 --> 01:18:03,138
for Horace all this time.

1117
01:18:04,537 --> 01:18:05,402
No wonder she thought

1118
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,499
Horace was fascinating.

1119
01:18:06,534 --> 01:18:08,963
No wonder. I resent that.

1120
01:18:10,195 --> 01:18:13,190
- Madge, where is she now?
- On her way to the bridal suite.

1121
01:18:13,225 --> 01:18:14,654
Bridal suite.

1122
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:21,345
I'll see you later.

1123
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:23,776
But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that.

1124
01:18:23,809 --> 01:18:24,540
It isn't fair.

1125
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:25,971
All is fair in love and war,

1126
01:18:26,007 --> 01:18:27,470
and this is revolution.

1127
01:18:32,132 --> 01:18:34,494
- Yes, this is very pretty.
- Thank you, dear sir.

1128
01:18:34,528 --> 01:18:35,759
We are very proud

1129
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:36,924
of our bridal arrangements.

1130
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:38,122
Is there anything else, sir?

1131
01:18:38,156 --> 01:18:40,452
Yes, would you please ask my wife

1132
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:41,352
to join me here?

1133
01:18:41,386 --> 01:18:42,849
It is a pleasure, dear sir.

1134
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:08,946
What are you doing here?

1135
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:12,774
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, but this is my room.

1136
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:18,066
- Yes, but this is my room.
- But I have the key.

1137
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:20,198
But I have the key.

1138
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:25,790
- But I am Beddini.
- You got me there, pal.

1139
01:19:27,422 --> 01:19:29,851
We will see who is the owner of this room.

1140
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,523
But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here.

1141
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:52,352
- It isn't cricket.
- No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either.

1142
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:05,268
Signor, there is a man in my bed.

1143
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:11,791
It's too bad. He's not here yet.

1144
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,788
I'll just wait until my uncle returns.

1145
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:16,817
Thank you.

1146
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,549
Why, Jerry, I didn't know

1147
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,580
that you had an uncle here.

1148
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:21,178
- Didn't you know?
- No.

1149
01:20:21,846 --> 01:20:23,609
I haven't, but this room is

1150
01:20:23,642 --> 01:20:24,940
just above the bridal suite.

1151
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:30,433
He's not here, signor.

1152
01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:31,864
If he returns, you will call us.

1153
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,328
If he returns, I will kill him.

1154
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:35,858
We Beddini have the motto:

1155
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:38,755
For the woman, the kiss.

1156
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:40,752
For the man, the sword.

1157
01:21:27,023 --> 01:21:28,820
Dale, you are lovely.

1158
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,347
Like a flower I am afraid to crush.

1159
01:21:32,382 --> 01:21:33,912
Don't be afraid.

1160
01:21:43,433 --> 01:21:44,797
Alberto, make him stop!

1161
01:21:44,831 --> 01:21:46,794
Who is it? You know?

1162
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:48,591
Yes, it's Horace.

1163
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,652
Horace Hardwick, that interloper.

1164
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:54,350
I'll stop him.

1165
01:22:01,674 --> 01:22:04,102
For the man, the sword.

1166
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:18,083
Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please.

1167
01:22:26,705 --> 01:22:27,803
- He's coming.
- Is he?

1168
01:22:27,837 --> 01:22:29,168
You keep this up and hold him

1169
01:22:29,202 --> 01:22:29,966
here as long as you can.

1170
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:30,964
I will.

1171
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:45,612
Madge, you'd better come over

1172
01:22:45,646 --> 01:22:46,444
and rescue Horace.

1173
01:22:46,477 --> 01:22:48,274
Alberto has gone after him with a sword.

1174
01:23:03,088 --> 01:23:04,285
Why, yes, of course.

1175
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,468
I'm sorry to break in like this,

1176
01:23:17,502 --> 01:23:18,666
but I simply had to see you.

1177
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:20,895
Will you please stop annoying me?

1178
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,159
But you've been mistaken about me.

1179
01:23:24,492 --> 01:23:26,688
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- All right, then.

1180
01:23:26,723 --> 01:23:28,286
I'll stay right here and there will be

1181
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:29,283
a scene with your husband.

1182
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:32,879
He'll be furious if he finds you here.

1183
01:23:34,278 --> 01:23:35,308
Then please come with me

1184
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,108
for a few minutes.

1185
01:23:36,142 --> 01:23:37,239
I've simply got to talk to you.

1186
01:23:41,435 --> 01:23:42,465
And so you see, my dear chap,

1187
01:23:42,499 --> 01:23:44,429
I am definitely the wrong person.

1188
01:23:44,464 --> 01:23:48,224
- But you are Horace Hardwick, no?
- Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick.

1189
01:23:48,259 --> 01:23:48,990
Then you are not

1190
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,086
the wrong person. Prepare.

1191
01:23:58,412 --> 01:23:59,076
Don't mind me.

1192
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,374
I just came up to see the fun.

1193
01:24:00,408 --> 01:24:02,104
Madge, explain to this maniac that

1194
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,670
he is making a very serious mistake.

1195
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,534
He may be making a mistake,

1196
01:24:05,568 --> 01:24:06,631
but it's not serious.

1197
01:24:07,698 --> 01:24:08,828
Go right ahead, Alberto.

1198
01:24:10,028 --> 01:24:11,890
No, I cannot kill him before a lady.

1199
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,621
If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto,

1200
01:24:14,655 --> 01:24:16,019
maybe it's best that you don't kill him.

1201
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:18,981
I may want that pleasure myself someday.

1202
01:24:23,177 --> 01:24:24,840
But why didn't you tell me who you were?

1203
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:28,735
After all, I mean, you never gave me

1204
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:29,866
very much of a chance.

1205
01:24:37,923 --> 01:24:39,254
Mr. Travers!

1206
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:45,545
Help, somebody.

1207
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:47,708
I am so sorry.

1208
01:24:47,742 --> 01:24:49,705
I really did not want to kill you.

1209
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,936
- You must forgive me.
- I forgive you.

1210
01:24:56,197 --> 01:24:57,761
Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me.

1211
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:01,156
Not tonight, Alberto.

1212
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:01,721
Some other time

1213
01:25:01,757 --> 01:25:02,854
when I'm feeling stronger.

1214
01:25:02,888 --> 01:25:03,786
Thank you.

1215
01:25:04,618 --> 01:25:06,514
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it? What's the matter?

1216
01:25:06,549 --> 01:25:07,480
What have you been doing?

1217
01:25:08,313 --> 01:25:08,944
Pardon me, sir,

1218
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,743
Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir...

1219
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:11,974
they're drifting out to the bay

1220
01:25:12,008 --> 01:25:12,939
in a gondola, sir.

1221
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:15,535
There. That ought to make you

1222
01:25:15,571 --> 01:25:16,668
feel pretty small, accusing me.

1223
01:25:16,702 --> 01:25:18,865
- He's kidnapped her.
- Kidnapped her?

1224
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:22,060
You are in this plot.

1225
01:25:22,094 --> 01:25:24,056
You are cahooting with him.

1226
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:24,856
I've had just about enough...

1227
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:27,120
Children, if Dale and Jerry

1228
01:25:27,153 --> 01:25:28,084
are drifting out to sea...

1229
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:29,049
don't you think the best thing

1230
01:25:29,085 --> 01:25:30,748
we could do is rescue them?

1231
01:25:30,949 --> 01:25:31,879
Yes, come.

1232
01:25:31,914 --> 01:25:34,077
Isn't it marvelous to have some brains?

1233
01:25:34,111 --> 01:25:35,009
I'm always so helpless.

1234
01:25:35,043 --> 01:25:37,372
Don't answer me like that. Do something.

1235
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,830
- Jerry.
- That isn't Jerry.

1236
01:25:43,165 --> 01:25:44,895
That's right. Make a fool of yourself.

1237
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,760
It's no crime to look, is it?

1238
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:55,880
- I think there is no gas left.
- My word, no petrol?

1239
01:25:56,614 --> 01:25:57,811
Perhaps I'd better look at the engine,

1240
01:25:57,845 --> 01:25:58,576
where is it?

1241
01:25:58,611 --> 01:25:59,874
They may have hidden it up there

1242
01:25:59,909 --> 01:26:00,640
under the hood.

1243
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:06,798
This is the first time

1244
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,496
I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.

1245
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:14,954
Jerry, you mustn't come with me.

1246
01:26:14,988 --> 01:26:16,751
I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.

1247
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:18,380
Alberto will have to get accustomed

1248
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:19,479
to talking in front of me.

1249
01:26:20,148 --> 01:26:20,745
No, seriously,

1250
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,510
I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.

1251
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:24,439
When am I going to see you again?

1252
01:26:26,637 --> 01:26:27,935
I don't know.

1253
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,026
Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir,

1254
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,490
to look for you, sir, in a motorboat.

1255
01:26:37,923 --> 01:26:40,318
- Mr. Beddini, too?
- Yes, sir, all three of them...

1256
01:26:40,353 --> 01:26:41,983
but they won't be back this evening, sir.

1257
01:26:42,017 --> 01:26:42,915
We took the precaution

1258
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:44,612
of removing the gasoline.

1259
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,641
Thank you, Bates.

1260
01:27:02,555 --> 01:27:04,285
What is it, my good man?

1261
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:12,241
Yes. I'm masquerading.

1262
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,696
Don't you understand English?

1263
01:27:22,329 --> 01:27:24,026
You don't understand English?

1264
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:28,586
Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity

1265
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:30,316
like this since my childhood.

1266
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,878
You frozen-faced flatfoot.

1267
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,038
And grazie to you if it comes to that,

1268
01:27:38,073 --> 01:27:40,135
you stultified shrimp.

1269
01:27:44,265 --> 01:27:45,328
Can I help it if you look

1270
01:27:45,362 --> 01:27:47,757
like a mildewed donkey?

1271
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:52,451
I'm adoring this.

1272
01:27:52,486 --> 01:27:54,782
And grazie to you, since you insist.

1273
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,311
You see, I happen to be breaking the law.

1274
01:27:57,346 --> 01:28:00,008
I admit it wholeheartedly...

1275
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,638
but, of course, you would never know that,

1276
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:03,936
you fish-faced nincompoop.

1277
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:07,598
Good night.

1278
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:15,853
I arrest you for masquerading

1279
01:28:15,887 --> 01:28:16,652
as a gondolier.

1280
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:18,416
I further charge you with insulting

1281
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:19,680
an officer with vile names...

1282
01:28:19,715 --> 01:28:21,445
according to Rule Three, Section Three

1283
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,342
of the law dealing with delinquents.

1284
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:37,589
Beg your pardon, signoro,

1285
01:28:37,624 --> 01:28:38,687
the carnival is beginning.

1286
01:28:38,722 --> 01:28:39,319
Shall I serve now

1287
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,452
or will you wait for the groom?

1288
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:43,081
I don't think the groom

1289
01:28:43,116 --> 01:28:44,146
will be here tonight.

1290
01:28:44,947 --> 01:28:46,744
- Very good, sir.
- Very good? It's perfect.

1291
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:48,906
I still feel a little guilty

1292
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:50,038
being here with you...

1293
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:51,668
while Alberto's out looking for us.

1294
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:54,132
Let's eat, drink, and be merry,

1295
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:55,498
for tomorrow we have to face him.

1296
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:35,569
The hour of reckoning is at hand.

1297
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,306
Beddini is about to settle his accounts.

1298
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:49,116
Skipper, will you tell

1299
01:35:49,149 --> 01:35:50,684
my husband we're here?

1300
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,858
He's the one with his mouth closed.

1301
01:36:05,966 --> 01:36:06,633
Listen, you two idiots,

1302
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:08,202
Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador.

1303
01:36:08,235 --> 01:36:10,337
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the room.

1304
01:36:11,472 --> 01:36:12,473
If you take my advice, you'll take

1305
01:36:12,506 --> 01:36:13,874
the first plane back to London pronto.

1306
01:36:14,575 --> 01:36:16,076
Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his

1307
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:18,712
wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me?

1308
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:25,786
- Mr. Hardwick.
- What do you want?

1309
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,121
I regret to report, my dear sir,

1310
01:36:27,154 --> 01:36:29,022
that your manservant has been arrested.

1311
01:36:29,056 --> 01:36:31,792
- Bates? Really?
- Yes, sir.

1312
01:36:31,825 --> 01:36:33,394
He would have spent the whole night

1313
01:36:33,427 --> 01:36:35,129
in jail if I had not bailed him out.

1314
01:36:35,162 --> 01:36:36,196
You don't mean it.

1315
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:41,969
Come in.

1316
01:36:48,575 --> 01:36:49,810
At last.

1317
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:52,679
The little birdies have come flying back

1318
01:36:52,713 --> 01:36:53,847
to the rooster.

1319
01:36:57,918 --> 01:36:59,753
Mr. Beddini, we want to explain

1320
01:36:59,787 --> 01:37:01,055
this whole thing to you.

1321
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:03,557
I will not listen to any excuses,

1322
01:37:04,324 --> 01:37:05,759
not even the truth.

1323
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,895
Jerry, Madge,

1324
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:09,730
I have the most amazing news.

1325
01:37:09,763 --> 01:37:12,633
A few days ago,
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

1326
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,502
Allow me to tell them, sir, please.

1327
01:37:15,536 --> 01:37:17,237
Quiet, your turn will come later.

1328
01:37:18,272 --> 01:37:19,006
A few days ago,

1329
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:20,808
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

1330
01:37:20,874 --> 01:37:22,943
The needle has gotten stuck in a crack.

1331
01:37:24,211 --> 01:37:25,145
You tell it, Bates.

1332
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:26,213
Thank you, madam.

1333
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:33,087
You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought

1334
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,221
you were a dangerous woman.

1335
01:37:34,254 --> 01:37:35,456
And he asked me to follow you

1336
01:37:35,489 --> 01:37:38,926
in case you did something dangerous.

1337
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,729
- Follow me?
- Yes, miss.

1338
01:37:41,762 --> 01:37:43,464
And in order to put you off the scent,

1339
01:37:43,497 --> 01:37:46,066
I thought of many little disguises.

1340
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,102
This evening, I met

1341
01:37:48,135 --> 01:37:49,470
Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont...

1342
01:37:49,503 --> 01:37:50,604
and fearing

1343
01:37:50,637 --> 01:37:51,872
that they might recognize me...

1344
01:37:51,905 --> 01:37:54,274
I turned my collar around...

1345
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:58,412
like this.

1346
01:37:58,445 --> 01:38:02,549
And very cleverly, I became a clergyman.

1347
01:38:04,284 --> 01:38:06,687
You are the one who married us.

1348
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,088
Yes, sir.

1349
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:11,458
Then we've never been really married?

1350
01:38:11,492 --> 01:38:13,260
Precisely, miss.

1351
01:38:16,797 --> 01:38:18,599
Well, Mr. Beddini...

1352
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:20,134
what are you doing

1353
01:38:20,167 --> 01:38:21,869
in this young lady's room?

1354
01:38:22,305 --> 01:39:22,671
