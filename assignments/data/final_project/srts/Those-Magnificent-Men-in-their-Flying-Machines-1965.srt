1
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,866
Ever since man started to
think, he's wanted to fly.

2
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,037
But flying was strictly for the birds...

3
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:44,210
and continued to be so
for thousands of years.

4
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,478
Man, eternally optimistic,
kept trying.

5
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,720
Encouraged by his many successes,
man kept trying.

6
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,432
Through his genius
and his inventiveness,

7
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,060
he managed to get
his machines off the ground,

8
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,522
and sometimes
he brought them down again.

9
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,195
Bravo! Bravo!

10
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,454
All over the world, early pioneers
were making flying history.

11
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,749
And in Italy,
Count Emilio Ponticelli...

12
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:33,045
made what many people claimed
was the first long-distance flight.

13
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,060
There was no doubt about it,

14
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,480
by 1910, flying had become the rage.

15
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,608
Man had conquered the air,

16
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,485
and people everywhere
were all agog about...

17
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,323
those magnificent men
in their flying machines.

18
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,671
тЩк Those magnificent men
in their flying machines тЩк

19
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,842
тЩк They go up tiddly up up

20
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,512

тЩк Those magnificent men

28

тЩк They can fly upside down

29
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,411
тЩк They don't think of danger
They really don't care тЩк

30
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,914
тЩк Newton would think
he had made a mistake тЩк

31
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:36,168

42
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,899
Hello, Richard!

43
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard,
please take me up.

44
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,766
Oh, no, not today.
No, it's much too windy.

45
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,851
Come on.
We'll swing her round.

46
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,688
And anyway, strictly speaking,
I'm still on duty. Lift!

47
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,691
It isn't too windy
for you to fly.

48
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,777
Come on.
Give a hand.

49
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,032
Oh, Richard,
look at that bird.

50
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,953
It can go wherever it likes,
whenever it likes.

51
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,872
- You're so lucky.
- Yes, I know.

52
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,708
Oh, I'd like to soar through the
air and look down on the world.

53
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,044
Right, let her down.

54
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,216
I think I'd make
a very nice bird.

55
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,553
Yes, I daresay.
Thank you, Carter.

56
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,557
Richard, isn't the rigging
a bit tight?

57
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,684
It seems to be
stretching the fabric.

58
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,853
You're getting rather good
at noticing things.

59
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,148
Well, I should jolly well hope so.
Thank you, Carter.

60
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,526
After all the work I've done
on this contraption.

61
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,611
Uh, Patricia,

62
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,239
did you get a chance to talk
to your father about my idea?

63
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,534
Yes, he's very interested, but
you'll still have to talk to him.

64
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,619
Oh, well, I can do that,
all right.

65
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,205
Tell him it will increase the
circulation of his newspaper.

66
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,709
Wave the flag. You know,
Britannia rules the sea,

67
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,919
but she doesn't rule the sky,
and all that sort of thing.

68
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,005
Yes, I know
exactly what to say.

69
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,383
Good. Then, when he's agreed
to your idea,

70
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,886
you're to ask him
if you can take me flying.

71
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,096
Hmm. Yes, I might.

72
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,182
This afternoon?

73
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,186
- All right.
- Oh!

74
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,271
Patricia, not now.
I'm in uniform.

75
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,983
Oh, Richard,
don't be so silly.

76
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,239
Follow me in your motorcar.
I'll try not to go too fast.

77
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,325
Oh.

78
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,261
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, nothing.

79
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,931
- Father doesn't know about this.
- Oh.

80
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,141
Won't be a minute.

81
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,003
- Well?
- Very nice.

82
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,089
You look just like a girl.

83
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,174
Thank you.

84
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,641
You know, one of these days, your
father's going to find you out.

85
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,768
Mmm, I know.

86
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,604
Exciting, isn't it?

87
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,324
The trouble with aviation today
is that too many good ideas.. .

88
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,661
are being dissipated
in too many aeroplanes.

89
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,373
If we could bring together all these
different types from all over the world,

90
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,458
then everyone could learn
from each other.

91
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,669
From all over the world?

92
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,964
If possible, Lord Rawnsley. The French
and the Americans are well ahead of us.

93
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,425
- I never knew that.
- Well, it's our own fault.

94
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,469
Believe it or not, no Englishman
flew until three years ago.

95
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,555
Really?

96
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,892
Britannia may rule
the waves, sir,

97
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,896
but she doesn't rule the
skies, not yet anyway.

98
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,524
Have some more Madeira.
Oh, you haven't finished.

99
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,653
Damn it.
We should rule the sky.

100
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,781
I can see you're going to be
a real enthusiast, sir.

101
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,867
Anytime you should
care to come up-

102
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,162
No, thank you, Mays.
I may be an old fogy,

103
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,998
but I think that if the Lord
had intended me to fly,

104
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,917
he would have
given me... wings.

105
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,505
You travel by train, Father,
but you haven't any wheels.

106
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,094
Do you really mean no Englishman
flew until three years ago?

107
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,597
That's right, sir.

108
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,766
Hmm.

109
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,228
Come and see me again
in a few days.

110
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,231
Meanwhile, I'll discuss your idea
with my circulation people.

111
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,443
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

112
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,580
Uh, by the by, sir,
there's one other thing.

113
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,584
I wonder if I might take
Patricia up this afternoon.

114
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,669
Up? Where?

115
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,882
Oh, into the sky,
Father, flying.

116
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,054
Certainly not! I absolutely
forbid you to go up,

117
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,139
and I absolutely
forbid you...

118
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,850
to take my daughter flying,
today or any other day.

119
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,603
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,190
Absolutely, sir.
Thank you, sir.

121
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,997
"I absolutely forbid you to take my
daughter flying, today or any day.

122
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,125
- Patricia, darling-
- Is that absolutely understood?"

123
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,253
"Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely,
sir." Three bags full, sir!

124
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,922
It's not my fault. Now, Patricia,
you can't blame your father...

125
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,550
for thinking that flying
is dangerous. It is.

126
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,387
But when he gets enthusiastic about
the idea, he'll change his mind.

127
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,181
Now, you'll see.
Oh, Patricia.

128
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,851
No, Richard.
You're in uniform.

129
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,481
If you won't take me flying,

130
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,567
I shall find someone who will.

131
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,694
Oh, all right.

132
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,947
I suppose you wouldn't like
to go have lunch at Windsor.

133
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,618
You could drive
the car if you like.

134
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,623
- Me?
- Yes.

135
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,918
Oh! Come on.

136
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,133
Well, that's my idea,
gentlemen.

137
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,263
Not a festival but something which
will fire the imagination of the world,

138
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,434
which will bring together all the
different types of flying machines...

139
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:35,272
and, at the same time, increase
the circulation of my newspaper.

140
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,067
An air race, gentlemen,

141
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,322
initiated, sponsored
and rewarded by the Daily Post.

142
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,159
An air race which will show that
Britannia not only rules the waves...

143
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:51,622
but intends, in future,
to rule the skies.

144
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:56,835
An air race between the two most
important capitals of the world-

145
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,339
London and Paris.

146
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,925
But that means flying
across the English Channel.

147
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,553
Well, of course it does.
That's the whole idea, Gascoyne.

148
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,139
Well, the French fellow
did it last year.

149
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,767
I presume some progress
has been made since then.

150
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,144
- Of course there has, sir.
- Very well.

151
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,855
I shall leave the details
to be worked out by my staff.. .

152
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,192
and you gentlemen
of the Royal Aero Club.

153
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,487
You, Gascoyne,
will be my liaison officer,

154
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,656
an aeronautical correspondent.

155
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,868
I shall expect you to go
aloft as often as possible.

156
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,121
Yes, sir. Um, may one ask
what the prize will be, sir?

157
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,040
┬г10,000.

158
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,877
┬г10,000?
Most generous, sir.

159
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,421
That should attract fliers
from all over the world.

160
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,424
That's the idea.
Nevertheless,

161
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,803
I shall expect the prize
to be won by an Englishman.

162
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,188
"Great London-Paris air race.

163
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,066
"Daily Post offers ┬г10,000 prize.

164
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,153
Competitors will actually fly across
English Channel." That's not bad, eh?

165
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,448
Could you add, um, "Foreign
newspapers, please copy"?

166
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,576
That's already done there
at the bottom of the page.

167
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,744
- Here are some more invitations.
- Good.

168
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,289
You know, between these
invitations and the newspapers,

169
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,001
we should reach every
flying man in the world.

170
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,878
Emilio Ponticelli-
Italy.

171
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,966
Pierre Dubois
- Dieppe, France. France. Right.

172
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,936
Mademoiselle, s'il vous pla├оt.

173
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,106
Monsieur Dubois!
Monsieur Dubois!

174
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,775
Monsieur Dubois!

175
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,486
Monsieur Dubois!

176
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,185
- Mon Dieu!
- Dear me.

177
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,024
Il est mort!

178
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,492
Oh, am I dead,
or am I dreaming?

179
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,828
Ah, merveilleuse.
You are so charming.

180
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,456
- What's your name?
- Brigitte.

181
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,000
Brigitte?
Oh, formidable.

182
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,796
Concussion.

183
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,507
Sir.

184
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,427
Monsieur, perhaps it is important.
It's from England.

185
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,723
Nom de chien!

186
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,811
250,000 francs?

187
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,063
- You?
- We must get down the machine.

188
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,607
- Yeah, What, me?
- Yes, you. Quick!

189
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,950
Read it, please.

190
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,748
"His Imperial Majesty
the Kaiser commands.. .

191
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:08,795
"that a German officer wins
the- the London-Paris air race.

192
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,131
You will make
arrangements accordingly."

193
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,178
- Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?

194
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,263
Order another flying machine.

195
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,057
Jawohl, Herr Colonel,
another flying machine.

196
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,351
But there's no one else
who can fly.

197
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,437
It cannot be difficult,

198
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,522
otherwise Winkler
couldn't have done it.

199
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,736
- Not that he was any good at it.
- Of course, Herr Colonel.

200
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,114
- So, Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?

201
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,200
You will fly the new machine.

202
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,285
Jawohl, Herr Colonel.

203
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,207
But how will I learn to fly?

204
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,710
Same way as we learn everything
else in the German army-

205
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,796
from the book of instructions.

206
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,008
Come on!

207
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,481
I don't mind your being interested
in the ladies. That's natural.

208
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:14,110
But it ain't natural to stand up and
wave to 'em when you fly past them.

209
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,196
I lost my head, George.

210
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,908
Yeah. You lost most
of my investment too.

211
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,118
I told you I could fix it.

212
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,996
Maybe we better just
call it a day, Orvil.

213
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,459
Go back to work
like ordinary people.

214
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,420
George, you just don't
have the flying bug.

215
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,383
You don't fly, so you don't
know what it's like up there.

216
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,844
It ain't the going up
that discourages me.

217
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:43,849
It's the different ways you
keep finding of coming down.

218
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:48,228
Boy, when you're up there, you get
a sense of freedom and power that-

219
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,690
well, that you just don't
get from anything else.

220
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,694
No, sirree. I'm never
gonna give up flying.

221
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,578
Hey, Orvil,
look at this.

222
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:09,833
"London to Paris air race.
First prize- $50,000."

223
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:14,921
- Whoo-ee!
- "For further details, turn to page six."

224
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,007
Whoa!

225
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,181
Somewhere out there
is page six.

226
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,350
Where is the great Ponticelli?

227
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,436
Ah! There he is!
There he is over there.

228
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,063
Emilio!

229
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,274
Emilio, have you heard the news?

230
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,617
Papa.

231
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,916
Emilio, now you
give up flying, huh?

232
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,335
I promise, cara.

233
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,797
No more flying.
Finito Ohh!

234
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,176
Emilio, are you all right?

235
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,678
Every bone in my body is broken.

236
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,514
Emilio, have you seen this?

237
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,648
- Sophia?
- Eh?

238
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,983
Look.
I shall enter.

239
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,736
I shall win...
for Italia.

240
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,113
- But you promised.
- Is postponed.

241
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,325
Come, we go and
make-a the plans.

242
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll buy the best-a flying
machine in the world.

243
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,873
Like-a Caesar,
we go to England!

244
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,918
Bella, Bambini, andiamo!
Bravo!

245
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,088
Bravo! Emilio! Emilio! Italia!

246
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,495
Yamamoto!

247
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,828
┬г10,000.

248
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,582
Just imagine, do you know we've
had 83 entries?

249
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,667
Forty from the continent alone.

250
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,962
Ha! Interest in the race
is worldwide.

251
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,215
I really think it's one of
the best ideas I ever had.

252
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,844
Shh!

253
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,929
Your go, Patricia.

254
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,271
Another entry,
from Phoenix-

255
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,191
- Arizona, milord.
- Arizona.

256
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,568
Arizona?
Oh.

257
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,363
Well, for someone to come all that way,
must be either very rich or very confident.

258
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,574
Well, as he's American,
he's probably both.

259
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,785
I say, there you are!

260
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,496
You didn't invite that
bounder Sir Percy, did you?

261
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,624
No, of course not. Then, what
the devil's he doing here?

262
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,667
I don't know.

263
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,795
- Hello, Miss Rawnsley.
- Hello.

264
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,840
Rawnsley, Mays. Just popped
in for an entrance form.. .

265
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,468
for that little junket
of yours to Gay Paree.

266
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,887
If you are referring to
an official entry form.. .

267
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,891
for my London to Paris air race,
my office will send you one.

268
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,686
Well, considering the fact that I'm
one of England's foremost aeroplanists,

269
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,189
it's rather jolly inefficient
of them not to send me one before.

270
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,692
I say, excuse me, if you'll
hold your mallet like this,

271
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,778
you'll play
that shot much better.

272
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,155
I shall hold my mallet
as I've always held my mallet.

273
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,241
In that case,
you'll miss the shot.

274
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,371
What did I tell you?
Missed the shot.

275
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,832
Well, I expect we'll be seeing
you again soon, Sir Percy.

276
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,959
- Mm-hmm. - Glad you're
going to join the race.

277
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,087
I'm not only going to join it,
dear boy. I'm going to win it.

278
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,714
Do you really think you
have a chance, Sir Percy?

279
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,800
Miss Rawnsley,

280
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,636
I never leave
anything to chance.

281
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,905
Hang on to the tail.
I'm revving up. Hang on.

282
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,275
Hey, Orvil,
look at that.

283
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,944
Wow! So this is
Brookley, huh?

284
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,617
- That's what you gotta beat.
- Yeah.

285
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,165
- Whoo-ee!
- Oh!

286
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,667
Hey, you take over.
I'll be right back.

287
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,379
- You all right?
- Yes, of course.

288
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,465
Oh, dear.

289
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,595
Thank you. No, no, the
other way. This way.

290
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,056
- No, it's the other way.
- Ohh!

291
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,978
- Oh, look what you've done.
- What I've done?

292
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,606
Oh! Haven't you ever
seen legs before?

293
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,900
Well, sure I have,
lots of times,

294
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,403
particularly when you take
girls flying as often as I do,

295
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,489
you get to see
lots of legs.

296
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,742
And bloomers too.

297
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,827
Oh, but none of them
as pretty as yours.

298
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,706
If that's supposed to be a
compliment, I'm not flattered.

299
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,919
Did you say you
took girls flying?

300
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,421
Well, sure I do, all
the time, only back home.

301
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,465
I'm strictly here to race.

302
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,678
- Oh, you're one of the Americans.
- Uh-huh.

303
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,848
Oh, well, that
explains everything.

304
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,644
- My bicycle, please.
- Oh, sure.

305
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,813
Say, uh, do you
work around here?

306
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,982
No. Why?

307
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,776
Well, I thought that,
uh-

308
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,861
Well, I'd like
to see more of you.

309
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,614
You could have
worded that better.

310
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm afraid
it's impossible.

311
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,953
I'm not being stuffy, but
we haven't been introduced.

312
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,038
Well, do we have to be?

313
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:09,210
But of course. English girls
don't care to be picked up.

314
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,880
So, until we are
properly introduced,

315
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,966
good-bye.

316
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,777
Ah, there
you are, Mays.

317
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,114
- Oh, hello, sir.
- I'm glad you're in. I want to have a word with you.

318
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,450
Oh, certainly, sir.
Inside or out?

319
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,535
Out.

320
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,919
Well, I expect you know what
I want to talk to you about.

321
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,005
Oh, yes, sir,
the race, of course.

322
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,633
No, no, not the race-
Patricia.

323
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,678
She's getting rather keen on you.

324
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,139
Oh.

325
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,060
Well, are you intending
to propose to her?

326
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,145
Well, with
your permission, sir.

327
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,981
My dear fellow, you can
take that for granted.

328
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,901
Your father was
at school with me.

329
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,239
There's just one snag, sir.

330
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,283
Oh?

331
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,620
It's finding the time for
married life. What do you mean?

332
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,582
Well, I'm soldiering all day, and
I'm rather busy in the evenings too.

333
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,461
Monday I dine in.
Tuesday's card night at White's.

334
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,838
Wednesday I play snook
with the adjutant.

335
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,717
Thursday, uh, well, we
like to end up at Romano's.

336
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,803
Uh, that only
leaves Friday.

337
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,389
Yes, but what
about the weekends?

338
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,142
Well, that's flying, sir.
It's the only time I've got.

339
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,314
But I could give up
my card night if you like, sir.

340
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,651
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
We don't want to spoil the girl.

341
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,694
You do love her,
don't you?

342
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,489
- Oh, I do, sir, very much.
- I thought you did.

343
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,660
Well, glad to have had this little
talk. Nice to know you're serious.

344
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,247
So few young people
are these days.

345
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,249
Good-bye.

346
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,670
Good-bye, sir.

347
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,010
Well, over there
are the hangars.

348
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,597
When you get delivery of your plane,
you will put it in the one nearest us.

349
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:30,143
First-a class for a first-a
class plane. Wait till you see it.

350
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,354
Oh, my darling,
it's-a wonderful.

351
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,690
I'm going to be
very happy here.

352
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,609
And I'm very happy
for you too.

353
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,820
What is all that water?

354
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,991
Actually, it's the sewage
farm. What is sewage?

355
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,369
Actually, it's rather nasty,
really. Drains and all that.

356
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,372
Jolly useful. Most of the pilots
crash over there sometimes-

357
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,834
- Crash?
- They don't consider themselves aeroplaners until they have.

358
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,961
- Oh, oh.
- Well, now, uh,

359
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,881
you'll want to know
all about the practice times.

360
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,300
You are scheduled
for 7:30 in the morning.. .

361
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,343
and 4:00 in the afternoon.

362
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,890
Ah, first-a class. You'll
be following the French.

363
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,894
I no follow any Frenchman. Italy
come-a first or no come at all.

364
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,606
We go! Finito. Andiam' a casa. Andiamo.

365
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,860
Sir! Sir!
I say, sir! Sir!

366
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,905
Sir, if you feel so strongly about
it, sir, you can go before the French.

367
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,659
I can?

368
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,786
- First-a class.
- Okay, steady on.

369
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,915
Sophia, we go
before the French.

370
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,084
- Who is this?
- It's Lord Rawnsley.

371
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,088
Ah. This is
the English milord.

372
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,759
Good morning, milord!

373
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,928
Good heavens. He's
brought his entire family.

374
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,388
Who is he?
Emilio Ponticelli.

375
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,474
Richard says he's not
only a great pilot,

376
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,559
he's one of
the richest chaps in Italy.

377
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,770
Never stops buying
flying machines.

378
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,273
A great enthusiast for everything.

379
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,742
- Morning, milord.
- Morning, sir!

380
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,120
Righto, lads.
Heave-ho, onto the field.

381
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,343
Achtung!

382
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,996
Brigitte!
Oh, wonderful!

383
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,373
Every time I see you,
my heart sings.

384
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,585
Brigitte, no. Ingrid.
I am Swedish.

385
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,670
- Swedish?
- Ja.

386
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,548
- But didn't I see you in Normandy?
- It's possible.

387
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,009
Come. Come
and teach me to fly.

388
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,265
Oh!

389
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,187
Oh!

390
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,566
Look, Father! He's teaching her to fly!

391
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,776
How ridiculous. Anyone
can see that young woman.. .

392
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,862
isn't in the least
mechanically minded.

393
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,657
- Good heavens, what's that?
- Does 35 miles an hour!

394
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,953
Wingspan of 30 feet!

395
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,707
Now, when you get up
to about 40 flaps a minute,

396
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,043
use the top power
and you're away!

397
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,128
You are sure it will fly?

398
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,839
Of course it'll fly! What do you
think it's gonna do, lay an egg?

399
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,676
This has the power of an eagle,
the- the grace of a swan.

400
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,220
- And it's a bargain for 350 guineas.
- Emilio!

401
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,514
Don't-a worry. It's-a
going to be first-a class!

402
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,600
Put it on for me,
please!

403
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,394
No, I don't want that.
Is guaranteed.

404
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,688
Emilio, put it on
for me, please!

405
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,483
Ah, Sophia.

406
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,236
Eh.

407
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,119
All right!

408
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,205
Take it away!

409
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,975
Up! Up! Up!

410
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,317
Up! Up!

411
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,783
Oh, God.

412
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,414
Oh, well, we all make mistakes.

413
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,005
Easy with her.

414
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,884
- Watch the tail skid, Charlie.
- Right.

415
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,432
Morning, sir.

416
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,101
Morning, madam.

417
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,478
Morning, Sir Percy.

418
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,525
I hope your hands are clean.

419
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,616
Come on, Courtney!

420
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,161
- Switch is off, sir?
- Switch is off, Courtney.

421
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,873
- Switch is on, sir?
- Switch is on, Courtney.

422
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,167
Contact, sir?

423
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,878
Contact, Courtney.

424
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,389
Come on, Courtney,
you lazy loafer!

425
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:04,477
Hang on! I haven't
revved up yet! Useless lot!

426
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,689
You! Yes, you!
Go and stand over there!

427
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,275
Give my chaps a hand,
will you?

428
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,801
He's not supposed
to carry passengers.

429
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,729
Ooh, heck.

430
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,608
Stand by, lads!
It's Sir Percy!

431
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,071
Make for the sewage farm!

432
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,223
Uhh! Oh!
Buzz off!

433
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,271
What the hell
are you doing?

434
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,816
Whoo, that's my toe! Get
your backside out of my face!

435
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,485
What the hell are you
doing down there?

436
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,950
I can't land the plane!

437
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,602
Back to the sewage farm!

438
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,320
- He's gonna crash!
- Yeah.

439
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,382
You bounder! Look what
you've done to my aeroplane!

440
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,509
I'll kill you!
Aaah!

441
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,820
- Come on, Courtney! Get on!
- Ooh!

442
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,122
Achtung! Halt!

443
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,718
Is this where the
Yankee fellow hangs out?

444
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,803
Yes, governor,
this is the place.

445
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,723
Are you quite certain
he's smaller than me?

446
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,308
- Oh, yes, governor.
- Right.

447
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,394
Stay there.

448
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,148
Hey, you there,
Yankee chap.

449
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,818
Oh, howdy.

450
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,781
- Did you want me?
- I certainly do.

451
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,659
You caused me to crash
my flying machine.

452
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,120
I therefore intend giving you
a jolly good thrashing.

453
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,247
- Ready?
- Ready.

454
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:43,255
I suppose you think that's funny.

455
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,217
- Well, pardon me.
- Eh?

456
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,720
You might wanna thrash
someone else with this.

457
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,805
Yes.

458
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,769
Got a cold, governor?

459
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,031
тЩк Ooh-ooh тЩк

460
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,116
You're late.

461
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,917
Ooh, Richard. Ooh, you
taste of castor oil.

462
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,002
Ew.

463
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,590
Did you fix
the extra petrol tank?

464
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,343
Yes.
And changed the oil.

465
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,428
Did need changing.
You were quite right.

466
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,431
Of course.
I'm always right.

467
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,730
And now you're going to help me
grease the undercarriage.

468
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,566
- Whoops!
- Now, come on.

469
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,446
Right. You begin
greasing here.

470
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,116
On the axle?

471
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,493
Mmm, it could do with it.

472
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,460
Say, you've really got yourself
something here, don't you?

473
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:07,214
- Anything I can do for you?
- Well, I was, uh-

474
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,717
I was hoping that you might let
me borrow a monkey wrench from you.

475
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,262
Monkey wrench?

476
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:18,142
Oh. Well, I can let you have an
adjustable spanner if that's what you mean.

477
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,395
Well, I guess that's what
they call it in England.

478
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,897
- You're Orvil Newton, aren't you?
- That's right.

479
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,066
- I'm Richard Mays.
- Howdy-do.

480
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,695
I'll get it for you.

481
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:38,370
Oh. May I present
Miss Patricia Rawnsley?

482
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,455
Well, howdy-do.

483
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,796
Now, wouldn't you say this
constitutes a formal introduction?

484
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,757
Well, y-yes,
I suppose so.

485
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,429
Do you have to do that
every time we meet?

486
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,516
Oh, please.

487
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,602
Well, I-
Go on.

488
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,687
Hurry up!

489
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,906
Thank you!

490
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,120
Your monkey wrench,
Mr. Newton.

491
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,706
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

492
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,584
I'll bring it back just as
soon as I'm through with it.

493
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,883
Where'd you meet
that fellow?

494
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,093
Oh, I-
I met him here.

495
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:39,014
Oh. Good-looking chap,
isn't he?

496
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,601
Is he?
Oh, I-I didn't notice.

497
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,063
Come on, Richard.
On with the greasing.

498
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,401
Oh, thanks, dear.

499
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,488
Here. Just a wee dram
to warm me up a bit, eh?

500
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,331
Oh!

501
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,333
Ingrid!
You are working here.

502
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,460
My name is Marlene.
I'm German.

503
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,963
But I've met you
somewhere before, I'm sure.

504
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,217
- Oh, it is possible.
- Oh, never mind. We have met now.

505
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,720
And I would like you
to know I adore Germans.

506
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,481
Howdy.
May I sit down?

507
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,694
Let me make quite sure my
skirt is out of the way first.

508
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,738
How is the food?

509
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,241
Everything's off
but the chop and chips.

510
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,411
Oh. Well, uh, well,
that's what I'll have then.

511
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,496
Can I order you
anything?

512
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,124
Oh, no
- no, thank you. I'm just going.

513
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,595
Not bad, huh?

514
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,473
Oh. Oh, yes. It's a
very beautiful aeroplane.

515
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,310
- No, I meant me.
- Oh!

516
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,895
- Oh, is that you? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,106
Well, I don't normally
carry my photograph around.

518
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,650
It's just that, uh, well, Mr.
Gascoyne of the Daily Post,

519
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,236
well, he wanted it,
you see.

520
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,572
Oh, uh, please begin.

521
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,117
That's a Wright biplane,
isn't it?

522
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,662
- No, that's a Curtis.
- Oh.

523
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,748
Is that the one
you take passengers up in?

524
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:33,003
Mm-hmm. It's got an Anzani engine
in it, developing 70 horsepower.

525
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,047
And you brought it
all the way from Arizona?

526
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,008
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you must be very rich.

527
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,093
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, ma'am,

528
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,096
but we came all the way
across by cattle boat.

529
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,932
We're in hock
way up to our eyebrows.

530
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,312
Now, if I don't win that race, I'm
going to lose my plane and everything.

531
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,821
Say, do you know that
you are very beautiful?

532
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,908
Oh, yes,
I know I am.

533
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,203
I also have a very
good figure, I'm rich...

534
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,373
and I'm in love with
an extremely handsome man.

535
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,709
- Mmm.
- Is he in love with you?

536
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,462
- Well, I think so.
- Well, hasn't he told you?

537
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,174
Well, no.
No, not exactly.

538
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,510
I mean, yes.
Yes, he has.

539
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,555
- Hmm.
- Well, let's talk about you.

540
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,058
All right. What do you
want to know about me?

541
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,602
Would you
take me up?

542
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,438
Well, sure. Anytime.

543
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,777
Tomorrow?

544
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,988
All right. First thing
in the morning, huh?

545
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Say, um,

546
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,456
you have flown before,
haven't you?

547
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,209
Yes. Yes.

548
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,294
Hundreds of times.

549
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,506
Well, I-
I just love it. I-

550
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,886
Oh, I have to go now.
Until tomorrow then.

551
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,264
I'll be looking forward
to seeing you outside my hangar.

552
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,766
Yes.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

553
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,935
I've brought the car
to the door.

554
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,020
Been sitting with that
American, have you?

555
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:18,316
Yes. He was telling me
all about Arizona.

556
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,402
Oh, you were quite right,
Richard.

557
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,822
H is very good-looking.

558
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,827
Well, I didn't fancy
the way he was looking at you.

559
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,830
Richard, I do believe
you're jealous.

560
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,291
Me, jealous? I've never
been jealous in my life.

561
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,919
If I catch him looking
at you again like that,

562
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,005
I'll give him a good hiding.

563
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,424
Oh, don't be so pompous.

564
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,332
Who's first off this morning,
Courtney?

565
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,876
Mr. Dubois, sir.

566
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,961
Oh, he's one of the dangers.

567
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:24,299
I know, sir. He's got a better
flying machine than you have.

568
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,384
I don't admit that.

569
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,803
But if he has,
it'll have to be nobbled.

570
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,264
You're not going-

571
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,517
You're not going to
sabotage it, governor?

572
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:37,103
I certainly am not.
You are.

573
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,984
Get back. Get back.

574
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,285
Bonne chance, Pierre!

575
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,871
Okay!
Bon voyage, Pierre!

576
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,593
I think the Frenchy's
taking off.

577
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,058
- Shall I call the lads out?
- No.

578
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,187
It's a lovely day. He'll be all
right. He knows what he's doing.

579
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,588
You all right, Chief?

580
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,343
Halt!

581
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,766
Today we fly,
Herr Rumpelstrosse.

582
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,436
You will taxi across
the field, take off,

583
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,855
fly one circle and return.

584
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,899
Understood, Herr Colonel. Taxi across the field, take off, fly one
- Aaah!

585
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,867
Oh! Aaah!

586
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,163
Ach, Schweinehund!

587
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,291
Take up your flying machine
at once...

588
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,795
and show those French idiots
what a German officer can do!

589
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,923
Jawohl,
Herr Colonel.

590
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,288
On the double!

591
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,836
Eins, zwei, drei!

592
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,554
Rumpelstrosse!
Come back!

593
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:20,100
Herr Rumpelstrosse!

594
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:29,234
Rumpelstrosse, you fool!
Stop playing the games!

595
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,319
Aaah!

596
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,990
How can I stop
this damn thing?

597
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,247
Get out of the way!
I can't stop!

598
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:54,968
Oh, go away!
Idiotic instructions!

599
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,053
Stop in the name of
the- Oh!

600
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,100
Come back here!

601
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,147
Hey! Just a minute!
Here! Here, what-

602
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,199
Go faster!
Put your foot down!

603
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,680
Leave my fire engine alone!

604
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,829
- Hey! No!
- Look out!

605
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,050
Where's that flying machine from?

606
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,177
Somebody do something!

607
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,270
Hrr Rumpelstrosse, no!
Not again! Aaah!

608
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,775
Hey, Orvil, where you going?

609
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,237
Orvil, you're supposed
to be practicing!

610
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,334
Follow that flying machine!

611
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,715
Hrr Colonel,
what shall I do now?

612
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,010
- Look in the book, fool!
- I already did so!

613
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,728
- What's he trying to do?
- Stop it, I suppose.

614
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,273
Oh, isn't he brave?

615
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,611
Oh, well done!
Whoops!

616
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,707
Oh!

617
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,959
We're heading for the wall!

618
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,086
Come on!
We gotta jump off!

619
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,840
Stop! Stop!
Stop the plane!

620
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,218
He's stopped him! Hear!
Three cheers for the American!

621
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,804
Hey, Orvil, have you gone crazy?

622
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,931
- What do you think you're doing?
- Somebody had to.

623
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,975
You're supposed to be flying!

624
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,853
Hey, put that man down!
You hear me?

625
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,397
Bravo, Orvil!
Well done!

626
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,733
It's another German!
Can't stop!

627
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,655
Rumpelstrosse!

628
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,741
Herr Colonel!
Come back!

629
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,452
Rumpelstrosse,
save me!

630
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,830
Rumpelstrosse!

631
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,460
Rumpelstrosse!
Hang on! Hang on!

632
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,060
Hey, Orvil, what you doing? What's that
contraption you're sticking on there?

633
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:35,730
It's a scoop. Produces more
pressure up in the engine.

634
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,025
Yeah, well it might blow up
the engine. Ever think of that?

635
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:43,071
- You ever think that cigar might too?
- Mmm. Ah.

636
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:46,074
No, I need the speed. All
these monoplanes around here...

637
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,660
are a lot faster
than this old buzzard.

638
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,745
Since we've been here,
I been looking around,

639
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,082
- getting some new ideas.
- Yeah.

640
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,918
Um, may I come in?

641
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,212
Oh. Well, how do you do?

642
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,803
Boy, you sure are pretty.

643
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,765
I, uh- I waited as long
as I could this morning.

644
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,059
Oh, I wanted to apologize,

645
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,687
but I just couldn't get away.

646
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,731
- Why not?
- My father insisted on coming down...

647
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,817
to watch everyone practice.

648
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,194
What's he got to do  with it?

649
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,864
- He's Lord Rawnsley.
- Lord who?

650
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,575
- Oh! Didn't you know?
- No.

651
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,578
But this is his race.

652
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:37,333
Ha! Well, I guess he's got every right
in the world to watch it then, huh?

653
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,586
Oh, I get it.

654
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,924
Well, he won't allow you to-
to fly, will he?

655
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,927
Hmm. What'd you ask me
to take you up for then?

656
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,221
You want me
kicked out of the race?

657
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,725
Why didn't you ask that fellow you're
supposed to be in love with to take you up?

658
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:57,603
Oh, I couldn't. He gave my
father his word that he wouldn't.

659
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,689
Richard's a man of principle.

660
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,150
Oh, yeah?

661
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:05,695
I asked you
to take me flying.. .

662
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,780
because I like you.

663
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,951
Oh?

664
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,037
I like you very much.

665
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:18,624
And I'm dying to fly!

666
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,630
Well, I have to go now.

667
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,051
Just a second. Look,
I'm going all out to win.

668
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,178
Now, do you think
I have a chance?

669
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,806
Well, that's entirely up to you.

670
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,352
Isn't it?

671
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,689
Well, yeah.
I guess it is.

672
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,570
I'll see you tomorrow
at Dover.

673
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,239
Those are the rules, gentlemen.
Now for the route.

674
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:53,576
First day, first leg-
London to Dover.

675
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,163
Emergency landing fields
here, here and here.

676
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,416
First aid stations
here, here and here.

677
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,003
Refueling points here and here.

678
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,089
What is all this fuss about?

679
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,008
Why do we have to go to Dover
by road? Why can't we fly?

680
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:12,845
Good heavens! You can't expect these
machines to fly 62 miles nonstop!

681
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,931
You've got to reconnoiter by road.

682
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,600
None of you foreigners know which
railway lines to follow anyway!

683
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:22,188
On my left,
landmark number seven.

684
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,193
The level crossing
five miles west of Tunbridge.

685
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,362
Mark it on your maps,
gentlemen,

686
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,156
and follow
the railway line to Dover.

687
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,123
It's a hell of a long way
to the other side.

688
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,084
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?

689
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,169
Can you swim?

690
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,255
Look!
You can see France.

691
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,632
Yes, but there's an awful
lot of water in-between.

692
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,261
It is impossible to cross,
Herr Colonel.

693
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,638
Nothing is impossible
for the fatherland.

694
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,062
Aren't you afraid of
getting "drownded," governor?

695
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,774
Sorry to disappoint you,
Courtney.

696
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,860
If anybody's going
to get his feet wet,

697
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,903
it isn't going
to be me.

698
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,072
Uh, I say.

699
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,366
Pardon.
Uh, pardon moi, monsieur.

700
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,536
Uh. est-ce qu'il.
uh, um,

701
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,914
landing field-
Calais- Oh.

702
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,000
What's going-

703
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,923
Oh, I say! Oh, boy!

704
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,165
They're all enjoying
themselves, sir.

705
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,375
I should hope so.
It's costing enough.

706
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,935
Hey, waiter.

707
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,104
Thank you.

708
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,486
Mr. Newton!
Orvil!

709
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,490
- Wanna drink to my health?
- What, the seawater?

710
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,618
No, I mean champagne.

711
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,831
That was a very
charming gesture.

712
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,633
It is most strange.

713
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:59,387
I have been to every seaside
resort all over the continent,

714
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,555
but never have I seen
a German dive.

715
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,851
Perhaps their skulls
are too thin.

716
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:10,106
Come, Rumpelstrosse.
We are going to dive.

717
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,581
Come in, Colonel.
The water is magnificent.

718
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:44,390
- You don't like our little joke, Colonel?
- Schweinehund!

719
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:55,276
- Uh, Newton, may I have a word with you?
- Why, sure.

720
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,323
- What's on your mind?
- I think I should mention...

721
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:04,660
that if you continue to make advances to
my fianc├йe, I shall knock your block off.

722
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,746
Champagne?

723
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,544
Well, she's not. uh,
officially engaged to you.

724
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:17,757
It's an understood thing
between Lord Rawnsley and myself.

725
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,093
But Patricia hasn't agreed,

726
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:25,431
and until she does, well, I'll
make all the advances I want.

727
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,644
You really are
being most tiresome.

728
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,029
What are you doing?

729
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,699
Are you two fighting over me?
Oh, good!

730
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,452
I say! I say! The
Japanese chap has arrived!

731
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,791
It's Yamamoto!

732
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:59,131
You know he's flown
all the way from Japan?

733
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,758
- Really?
- Yes.

734
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,719
- We don't have the facts yet, sir.
- Don't argue with me.

735
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,971
We must get to the landing
field and welcome him.

736
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,057
Come along, everyone!

737
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,437
Lieutenant Parsons,
Royal Navy.

738
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,481
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?

739
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,193
- Mr. Richard Mays, Coldstream Guards.
- Excuse me.

740
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,279
Yamamoto, excuse me, sir.
First-a class-a flying machine.

741
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,949
Thank you.

742
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,159
- May I?
- Of course.

743
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,245
Now that the Japanese are here,

744
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,540
nobody's going to
stand a chance.

745
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,167
He's right. This'll be
the one to beat, governor.

746
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,421
In that case, we'll have to
nobble the man and not the machine.

747
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:43,884
Perhaps a little cascara
in his chop suey.

748
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,011
Shut up.

749
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,180
Excuse me, sir. May I
have a word with you?

750
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,266
You must've had
a remarkable journey.

751
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,185
Ten thousand miles, wasn't
it? Did you fly it all?

752
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,814
Of course. First I came
by mule train to Yokohama,

753
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,899
then by ship
to Vladivostok.. .

754
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,985
to catch
the Trans-Siberian Express.

755
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,070
Good heavens!

756
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,115
From Moscow, overland
to Paris, then to Dieppe,

757
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,160
where I took the cross-channel
ferry to Folkestone.

758
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,245
Quite a remarkable journey.

759
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,458
But at Folkestone I boarded my
machine and flew all the way here!

760
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,210
Four miles!
Amazing.

761
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,590
- Orvil.
- Oh, hello.

762
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,926
I've been looking all over
for you. Well, here I am.

763
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,137
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- Yeah?

764
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,140
While everyone's still here,
you know what we could do?

765
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,059
I know what we could do
and I know what I'd like to do,

766
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,103
but do you think
we dare do it?

767
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,525
Motorcycles go very much

768
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,571
If we left now, we could be back
at Brookley before everyone else.

769
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,325
- And then?
- Then...

770
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,785
you could take me up
in your flying machine.

771
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:56,207
Oh. You're really determined to get
me into trouble, now, aren't you?

772
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,417
Don't you think I'm worth it?

773
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,379
All right. Come on.

774
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,071
Bonjour, mon capitan.

775
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,784
Oh. Colonel.

776
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,036
The name of your second,
please.

777
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,623
My second?
Who wishes to be my second?

778
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,833
Oh, Jean Pascal.

779
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,342
Colonel Baron
Manfred Von Holstein...

780
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,386
demands satisfaction
before the race.

781
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,514
- I suggest at dawn tomorrow.
- Anything you wish.

782
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:58,310
But you are not serious?
This is 1910, you know?

783
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,604
I'm aware of the date.

784
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,359
Tell the idiot I agree.

785
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,530
He agrees.

786
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,283
The choice of weapons
is yours.

787
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,995
Do you wish to use pistols,
sabers or rapiers?

788
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:27,214
Balloons.

789
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:33,304
- Balloons?
- And blunderbusses.

790
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,723
You are trying to make
the fools of us again.

791
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:39,268
On the contrary. There is
an historical precedent.

792
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,395
- N'est-ce pas?
- Mm-hmm.

793
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,940
A similar duel between a Frenchman
and German took place in, uh-

794
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,234
- 1817.
- Is right.

795
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,403
1817.

796
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,743
The Frenchman won.

797
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,960
In that case, I accept.

798
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,803
Come along, everybody.
Let's get back to the motors.

799
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,306
I expect
you'll be flying back.

800
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,600
Come along, Richard!

801
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,019
Where's Patricia? I thought
she was with you, sir.

802
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,939
Well, of course she is-

803
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:29,860
What the devil is my daughter doing in that
contraption? Going back to Brookley, I think.

804
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,154
You don't think she's
persuaded him to take her up?

805
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:36,367
I absolutely forbid it. Stop him!
Stop him at once! Absolutely useless.

806
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,669
Faster. Richard.
Faster!

807
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,588
I'm doing nearly 40 miles
an hour as it is, sir.

808
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,394
Come down at once!
I absolutely forbid it!

809
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,770
Marvelous!

810
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,980
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yes!

811
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,108
Oh, look, look!
Look, there's Father.

812
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,195
Let's give him a fright.

813
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:32,047
Oh, rats!
I broke a wing strut.

814
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,299
You take over the stick
and keep it steady, will ya?

815
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,802
Oh, no.
I- I- I can't.

816
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,887
Okay.

817
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,856
I said keep it steady!

818
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,618
Orvil, help!

819
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,476
Orvil!

820
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,896
I can't keep it straight!

821
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,112
Orvil! Help me!

822
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,873
I can't do it. Hurry!

823
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,997
- Did that girl fly the machine herself?
- Yes!

824
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,333
- Are you all right, Patricia?
- Of course I'm all right.

825
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,837
- How dare you take my daughter up!
- He isn't to blame!

826
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,339
This race was organized
to help flying,

827
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,509
not for brainless boneheaded
nincompoops to give joyrides.

828
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,636
I tell you, Father,
it was my fault.

829
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,514
It didn't occur to you, I suppose, that
if you'd crashed with a woman onboard,

830
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,600
you would have
put flying back 20 years.

831
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,727
- You might've killed her.
- Now, look,

832
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,812
I knew exactly what I was doing.

833
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:37,107
And I know what I'm doing.

834
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,359
Oh, Richard!

835
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:41,445
Patricia,
come with me.

836
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,866
Yes, Father.

837
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,660
Niven, I'll have that machine
scratched from the race.

838
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,705
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, not now, Not in front of everyone.

839
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,374
- I am entirely to blame.
- I know that.

840
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,710
This is the last time
you'll go up flying...

841
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,296
and this is the last time
you'll ride a motorcycle.

842
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,381
Yes, Father.
And that includes...

843
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,425
the one you have
hidden in the garden.

844
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,552
- But-
- Get into the motor!

845
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,638
Oh!

846
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,652
She's at it again-

847
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,737
disobeying my instructions.

848
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,239
I don't think so.
It's the American.

849
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,284
The American? What's he doing
prowling around in my garden?

850
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,162
- You suppose he has a gun?
- Why should he, sir?

851
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,790
Well, the fellow's from
the Wild West, isn't he?

852
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,960
- It's only a motorbicycle, sir.
- Oh.

853
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:41,672
He's trying to get back into the race,
just as I've been telling you for some time.

854
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,675
Well, he's not going to.
He may have changed your mind.

855
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,094
Nothing is going to make
me change mine. Nothing!

856
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:50,097
Well, go and tell him so!
Well, don't stand there!

857
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,433
- Anyone thinks you're afraid of the fellow!
- Yes, sir.

858
01:11:57,105 --> 01:12:01,233
I'm sorry, Newton. but Lord
Rawnsley's quite adamant.

859
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,318
Not only are you
out of the race,

860
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,404
but he expects you
to remove yourself...

861
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,489
and your flying machine from
Brookley as soon as possible.

862
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,992
Are you sure you told him
that I had to see him?

863
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,328
Look, if I don't get back in that
race, I'm gonna lose everything.

864
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:15,664
Boy, we don't even have enough
money to get back to London,

865
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,834
much less Phoenix, Arizona.

866
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,919
You should have
thought of that before.

867
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,005
Let's face it, old chap.
H only has one daughter.

868
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,425
Yes, but-
Aw, shucks!

869
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:32,347
Well, I wanna thank you
for trying to help me.

870
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:36,018
- What are you going to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

871
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,687
I guess I'll have to sell
my flying machine.

872
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,772
Oh, I'm sorry.

873
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,692
But at least you're in
the right place to do that.

874
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:47,320
Well, good-bye,
and the best of luck to you.

875
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,781
- You know your way out.
- Thanks for everything.

876
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:05,297
Orvil, I'm-
I'm terribly sorry.

877
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,383
Oh, well.
You were worth it.

878
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,804
Winning the race meant
a great deal to you,

879
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,973
didn't it?

880
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,309
Mm-hmm.

881
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,978
If I'd have won it,
I'd have been somebody.

882
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,647
I might've been able
to go up to any girl,

883
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,318
even a rich
and a beautiful one,

884
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,404
and say to her
what I wanted to say,

885
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,615
ask her what I wanted to ask.

886
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,578
Only it can't happen now.

887
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:40,082
Oh, pl-please
forgive me.

888
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,417
I've been
very, very selfish.

889
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:45,337
I'll never forget you,
Patricia.

890
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,136
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no! No. Wait.

891
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,680
I'm going to talk to Father.

892
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,766
It won't be easy,

893
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,894
but I'm going to get
you back into the race.

894
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,563
Well, uh-

895
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,774
He'll soon change his mind.. .

896
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,945
when he hears what the American
ambassador's got to say about this.

897
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:12,781
Well, does he know
the American ambassador?

898
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,534
No.

899
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,036
Neither do I.

900
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,164
But Father doesn't know that.

901
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,970
Achtung!

902
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,822
No one knows better than you gentlemen
of the international press that-

903
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,552
I guess a lot of innovations have been
introduced by the various competitors.

904
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,637
Oh, yes, indeed!
I- Well, uh,

905
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,723
take young Parsons of the
Royal Navy, for instance-

906
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,808
the fellow alighting now.

907
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:25,395
He's got a marvelous new naval idea
for stopping his flying machine. Look.

908
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:40,994
Uh, what's that?

909
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,711
It's a flying machine,
I think.

910
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,797
Yes, it must be a flying machine.
It's got, um, propellers.

911
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:03,475
- Any other questions?
- That's one out.

912
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:08,271
You guarantee this one
will fly better than the last?

913
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,941
There was nothing wrong
with my ornithopter,

914
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,652
just rotten piloting,
if you ask me!

915
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,115
You'll like this one.

916
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,868
Just start the engine,
and you're off, all right?

917
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,373
Contact!

918
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:29,042
Hmm? Oh!

919
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,829
Gentlemen,
prepare your weapons!

920
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:33,982
Gentlemen, I count 10...

921
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,193
and then you will fire!

922
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,114
One, two,

923
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:46,077
three, four,

924
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:51,082
five, six.

925
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,085
seven,

926
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,339
eight,

927
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,549
nine- Nein!

928
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:02,927
Get back to your position.
Monsieur Dubois!

929
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:07,390
Schweinehund, you are not
following the rules!

930
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,060
- We always follow the rules!
- No! You didn't!

931
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,854
The French always follow the rules!
Vive la France!

932
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,939
This time I'll count to five!

933
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,442
One, two, three,

934
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,820
four, five!

935
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,156
Fire!

936
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,790
Sabotage! Sabotage!

937
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,046
You idiot!

938
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,551
Ooh la! Ooh la!

939
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:46,388
Ooh la! Ooh la!
Ooh la la!

940
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,148
Ooh.

941
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,530
Colonel!
Rumpelstrosse!

942
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:08,704
Hello.
"With only 16 hours to go.. .

943
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:11,707
"before the start of the
greatest race of all time,

944
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:15,211
"temperatures have reached
boiling point here at Brookley.

945
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,464
"Not surprising perhaps,

946
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:22,385
"when so many different
nationalities are involved.

947
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:26,389
"You will be glad to know that
the slight technical difficulty...

948
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:29,892
"which it was thought would keep
Orvil Newton out of the race...

949
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,978
"has now been ironed out.

950
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,397
"Tonight, along with
the other competitors,

951
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,733
"he is attending a small
eve-of-the-race reception,

952
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:40,903
"a gathering which one hopes
may foster the spirit...

953
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:44,240
of peace and goodwill
amongst the aeronautists."

954
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,577
That's the idea. It won't take a minute.
If you could just turn round too, sir.

955
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,246
Could we just get your photograph?
Sir, if you turn this way-

956
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,416
Yes. Hand-to-hand, hands
across the sea. That's the idea.

957
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,501
Now, if you could just
give us a big smile.

958
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,920
That's the idea.
Now, hold it.

959
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:00,256
I always thought that
the English were noted...

960
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,300
for their sense of fair play.

961
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,177
- Oh, we are, indeed. Yes.
- I'm ready, gentlemen.

962
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,680
Well, you punched me
when I wasn't looking.

963
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:10,349
My dear fellow, if you continue to
pursue a certain party,

964
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:13,936
I shall take the greatest pleasure
in punching you when you are looking.

965
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:15,938
Well, you're gonna
have your hands full,

966
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:18,441
because I'm gonna marry
that certain party.

967
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,526
I'm afraid that's
going to be rather awkward,

968
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,612
because I'm going to
marry her also.

969
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:25,865
Gentlemen, could we have
a nice smile, please?

970
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:31,245
Thank you so much.

971
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:38,961
Oh! I beg your pardon.

972
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:54,310
Ooh! Buzz off.

973
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,863
Hello! Care for
a glass of wine?

974
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:09,533
No, thanks, old chap. I
only drink whiskey and water.

975
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,577
Oh. Sir Percy. Very kind. Is that mine?

976
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,830
Thank you very much.

977
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:18,167
Ahhh. Serves him right,
the greedy blighter.

978
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,050
Come, Courtney. We've got work to
do. We can't do nothing tonight.

979
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,135
There's guards
all over the place.

980
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,930
Besides, everybody's going
to sleep by their planes.

981
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,224
Not everybody.
Yamamoto's still inside,

982
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,309
and, uh. I've given
the Frenchman...

983
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,395
the address of
a very lovely young lady.

984
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,897
Oh-ho-ho. I'll bet she's a
bit of all right, governor.

985
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:43,067
Well, you should know.
She's your daughter.

986
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,070
But, governor, she's an innocent
young girl.

987
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,657
Not is, Courtney-
was.

988
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:53,494
Come on.

989
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,418
Now, drop me at
the American's hangar,

990
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,129
then pop into Yamamoto's and
see what you can do with this.

991
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,424
What are you gonna do
to the Yankee?

992
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,509
It's no business
of yours, Courtney,

993
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,594
but if you really
want to know,

994
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,723
I'm going to arrange that
one of his wheels falls off.

995
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,850
That's a bit dirty,
isn't it, governor?

996
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,269
If he can't land on one wheel,
he shouldn't be in the race.

997
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,354
Yeah, but he might
kill himself.

998
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,606
There are plenty more Americans
where he comes from.

999
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,425
Now, sir, just one
without your cap.

1000
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,511
Certainly not.
I'm a naval officer.

1001
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,596
Oh, well. perhaps
a bit of a smile, sir?

1002
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,932
Oh, very well.
Just a bit of a one.

1003
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:41,435
Lieutenant Parsons, where have you
been? Everybody's been waiting for you.

1004
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,730
You've not got your logbook filled in
or your starter's forms or anything.

1005
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:47,483
- Meet Nelson, my passenger.
- You can't take that with you.

1006
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:50,111
- Why not?
- It'll muck up my starter's forms.

1007
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:52,738
And for another, no one has
yet taken an animal aloft.

1008
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,824
Nelson doesn't go,
neither do I.

1009
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:57,076
Absolutely out of the question.

1010
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,287
- Go on.
- Oh, very well then, fill these forms.

1011
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:04,708
Well, that's everybody-

1012
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,794
all 14 of you.

1013
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,672
Oh, no, it isn't. Where
are those blasted Germans?

1014
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:13,175
Over at the hangars, old man. I don't think
they know anything about your starter's forms.

1015
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,017
Rumpelstrosse, the great
moment has arrived. Come.

1016
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,812
Herr Colonel,
it is no good.

1017
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,064
I'm a sick fellow.

1018
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,733
I cannot fly.

1019
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:32,236
You must fly!

1020
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,363
For the emperor
and the fatherland!

1021
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,448
For the emp-

1022
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,534
Excuse me.

1023
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:51,755
It's going to be
a busy day for our lads.

1024
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,383
All spectators away
from the flying machines!

1025
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:57,011
Spectators away from
the flying machines, please!

1026
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,098
- Ought to be starting them, sir.
- Nonsense.

1027
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:03,184
I haven't wished
the competitors good luck yet.

1028
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,269
What's the Japanese
for "good luck"?

1029
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,147
I have it here, sir.
One moment.

1030
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:10,232
Here we are.

1031
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,403
Thank you, sir.

1032
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:19,783
Good luck.

1033
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:29,418
Get out of it!

1034
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:36,217
- Aren't you sitting the wrong way round?
- Of course I'm not.

1035
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,594
You take me for an idiot?

1036
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,846
This is my latest invention.

1037
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,099
It's an idea
I had in the bath.. .

1038
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:47,102
when sitting
with my back to the taps.

1039
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,772
You see, the wind resistance
on the tail...

1040
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:52,149
is less than it would be
on the wings.

1041
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,777
Heh. I shall most likely
be in Paris...

1042
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:57,905
before any of this lot
have even got to Calais.

1043
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,949
It's pathetic, isn't it?

1044
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:03,744
- I don't know what he's talking about.
- Neither does he, sir.

1045
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,205
Well, let's see, now.. .

1046
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,291
what was the French
for "give us the money"?

1047
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:11,710
Ah, bonne chance,
Monsieur Dubois.

1048
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,673
Ah, merci, monsieur.
Mmm. Mmm.

1049
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:18,342
Wrong frog, sir.

1050
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,552
Bonne chance,
Monsieur Dubois.

1051
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:25,766
Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1052
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:34,900
Really, Monsieur Dubois!

1053
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,904
Uh, forgive me, mademoiselle.
I was carried away.

1054
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:42,491
The spirit of the occasion,
sir. The entente cordiale.

1055
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,995
If you ask me, too much
entente and far too cordiale.

1056
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:52,376
The trouble with these international
affairs is that they attract foreigners.

1057
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,505
Achtung!

1058
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:59,883
Ja!

1059
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:09,685
But I thought Captain Rumpelstrosse
was your pilot, Herr Colonel.

1060
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:13,397
I am taking his place.
H is indisposed, sir.

1061
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,566
I didn't know
you could fly.

1062
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,569
Oh, there's nothing
a German officer cannot do.

1063
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:25,659
So, "'Number One. Sit down."
Ah, so-

1064
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:33,375
Surely, you're not taking
your family with you, are you?

1065
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,461
You always make-a the joke.

1066
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,380
They come to wish
their papa good-bye.

1067
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:42,593
No, no. Sophia, no. No,
no, no, no, no. Sophia.

1068
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,095
I see you have another
new flying machine.

1069
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,431
Presented to me personally...

1070
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,850
by his majesty
the King of Italy.

1071
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:54,271
Generale Parlonni.
Fsst. Fsst.

1072
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:56,899
Well, good luck to you
and the King of Italy.

1073
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,276
Thank you, milord.
Thank you, milord.

1074
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:02,029
No, no, Sophia.
Sophia, no, no, no.

1075
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:05,491
- Can you tell me where you come from?
- Phoenix, Arizona.

1076
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,242
Good luck.

1077
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,370
If it wasn't for my
daughter's persuasiveness.. .

1078
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:13,207
and my native sporting instinct,
you'd be out of this race.

1079
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,876
Fortunately, I am
a very reasonable man.

1080
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,212
Good luck to you.

1081
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:20,422
At least if he breaks his neck,
my daughter won't be with him.

1082
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,384
- Good luck, Orvil.
- Oh, thank you, Patricia.

1083
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,719
Say, will I get to
see you in Paris?

1084
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:29,890
There's something I want to talk to you about
- something very important.

1085
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:32,476
Oh, yes,
I'll be there.

1086
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:37,481
Mm. We're going over on
Father's private yacht.

1087
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,566
Richard.

1088
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,569
Oh. Well-
Oh.

1089
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,696
I'm not going to
wish you luck, my boy.

1090
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:47,825
- I expect you to win without it.
- Well, I'll do my best, sir.

1091
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,868
Thank you.

1092
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:52,663
Well, good luck, me dear
fellow. Thank you, sir.

1093
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,000
Good luck, Richard.

1094
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:00,629
Uh, well, thanks. And
thanks for all your help too.

1095
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:03,674
Listen, Patricia, as soon as I get
to Paris, I've got to talk to you.

1096
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,135
It's very important.
You'll be there, won't you?

1097
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:08,470
Yes, I'll be there.
Bye.

1098
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:10,764
Bye-bye.

1099
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,476
There they are,
Courtney.

1100
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,937
- I've done everything you said, sir.
- Good.

1101
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,190
Right, now get down to Dover and carry
out the rest of your master's instructions.

1102
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:23,193
Oh, can't I just wait
and see the nip take off?

1103
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,279
All right.

1104
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,865
Don't think you're gonna get treats
like this all the time, Courtney.

1105
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,665
I say, the wind's
getting up a bit, sir.

1106
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:39,460
- We're 20 minutes late as it is.
- We've just got to start.

1107
01:36:48,178 --> 01:36:50,179
I can't start
without Lord Rawnsley.

1108
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,389
Well, can you start it
quickly when he does arrive?

1109
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:55,058
Of course. I've only
got to do this to start it.

1110
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:04,026
Look. They're off!

1111
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,111
I didn't tell them
they could start.

1112
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,189
A knife!

1113
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,442
Get me a knife.

1114
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,528
You ain't going
to commit hari-kari?

1115
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,738
Of course not,
you bloody fool.

1116
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,699
I've got to cut my way out,
haven't I?

1117
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:59,039
All right, Courtney, shoot off.
You've had your treat.

1118
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:01,166
- Yeah-
- Well, go on!

1119
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:13,720
Away you go!

1120
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:49,089
- Mama! Mama, he's up!
- Yes, but he's got to get down again.

1121
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:24,995
Oh, Dio.
Oh, mamma mia.

1122
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:11,625
This is indeed an unwarranted
intrusion into our privacy.

1123
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:14,586
Be good enough to remove yourself
and your machine immediately.

1124
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,630
Sisters,
return to your work.

1125
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:19,549
- Un momento.
- What is it?

1126
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:23,220
I cannot leave
unless I have-a some help.

1127
01:42:23,304 --> 01:42:26,681
I need-a men to hold down the tail
so I can take off. Fsst!

1128
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:28,850
Men are not permitted here.

1129
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:31,812
No men, no take off.

1130
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:35,106
Mother,

1131
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:38,068
perhaps, uh, the sisters-

1132
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:41,696
- Certainly not.
- A pity.

1133
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:45,408
We are the first aviators to make-a
the race from London to Paris.

1134
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:47,911
We are not interested
in worldly matters.

1135
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,121
I understand, Mother,

1136
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,415
but it is a pity.. .

1137
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:56,044
that the race. it will
now be won by a Protestant.

1138
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:59,798
Protestant?

1139
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,385
Sisters, don't stand around gaping.

1140
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:06,137
This good Catholic
needs our help.

1141
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,182
Brava! Superiore!

1142
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:09,135
Oh! Ooh!

1143
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,221
Don't push!

1144
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:38,581
What's the idea?
Damn silly thing to do!

1145
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,667
Nearly frightened the life
out of the memsahib!

1146
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,128
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I had no alternative.

1147
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:45,380
Fuel pipe blocked.

1148
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:48,800
You haven't got a pipe cleaner
I could run through it, have you?

1149
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,928
Why, we haven't got
a pipe cleaner, have we?

1150
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:54,973
Oh, wait a minute.
Would that do?

1151
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:57,058
That's just the thing.

1152
01:45:57,143 --> 01:45:59,394
Thank you very much,
madam.

1153
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,106
I'm a competitor in the Daily Post Air
Race. I suppose you've read about it.

1154
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:06,317
- No. I only read the Times.
- That's right.

1155
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,977
Hold on, please.

1156
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:02,123
I think I'll get
one of those, Muriel.

1157
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:07,128
I shouldn't, Willy. You're near
enough to your wings as it is.

1158
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:09,214
Come on.

1159
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,361
Right over here. Could
we just have a photograph-

1160
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:15,947
Oh, I say! There's the French
chappie. Very good effort.

1161
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:26,457
Well done, sir! We'll
take care of the machine.

1162
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:33,131
Well done!

1163
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:49,439
Hey!
Hey, you! No!

1164
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:04,495
Come on!
Quick! Over here!

1165
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:16,591
Danke sch├╢n.

1166
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,676
Danke sch├╢n.

1167
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:25,558
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1168
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:28,770
Assassin! Assassin!

1169
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,856
Hey!

1170
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,486
Ah!

1171
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:57,548
Whoo!

1172
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:02,804
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1173
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:04,889
It's my flying machine
I'm worried about.

1174
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:07,600
- Looks like you're out of the race.
- I wouldn't say that.

1175
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:10,645
Say, do ya think they got any
spare wheels on this landing field?

1176
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:13,231
Well, possibly, but it'll
take all night to repair that.

1177
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:18,236
- Is there anything wrong with working all night?
- Well, no.

1178
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,322
- All right then.
- Good luck.

1179
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:27,287
- Any more to come?
- Let's see now.

1180
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:30,623
Of the 14 starters,
eight have landed,

1181
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:33,001
two crashed on takeoff,

1182
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:36,087
three crashed on the
way here, and one. ..

1183
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:40,091
is on his way to Scotland?

1184
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:33,394
- Ah!
- Marlene, what are you doing here?

1185
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:37,065
Marlene? No, Fran├зoise.
I am Bulgarian.

1186
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:41,694
But aren't you
- I mean, haven't I met you somewhere before?

1187
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,322
- It is possible.
- I see.

1188
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:47,075
Have a drink?
D'accord.

1189
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,912
Your attention, please!

1190
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:54,082
Uh, your attention, please! I-I
have a sensational announcement.

1191
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:57,377
Sir Percy Ware-Armitage
has taken off for France.

1192
01:51:57,503 --> 01:52:01,130
H is crossing the channel
even now in the dark.

1193
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:06,344
Stop mucking about!
Useless lot!

1194
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:16,562
Oh, evening, sir. Great honor having your
eminence onboard our little brig, sir.

1195
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:18,606
I say,
careful of that wing.

1196
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:20,733
Courtney!

1197
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:23,778
I say, I hope it
isn't going to be rough.

1198
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:28,408
Argh! Smooth as a billiard table,
sir. Uh, you did bring the money, sir?

1199
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:31,953
Oh, I never discuss that sort of thing.
You'll have to take it up with my man.

1200
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:34,956
Courtney, are these people
to be trusted?

1201
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,292
Yes, governor, if you
give them 10 guineas each.

1202
01:52:38,377 --> 01:52:42,463
Ten guineas? I can get a
chambermaid for a year for that.

1203
01:52:42,548 --> 01:52:45,383
Do they guarantee to get me
over to France before dawn?

1204
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,468
Yes, governor.

1205
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:51,806
Courtney, there are 10 of them.

1206
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:55,518
Do you realize this is going
to cost your master 100 guineas?

1207
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:57,937
Uh, a hundred and ten.

1208
01:52:58,021 --> 01:53:00,481
You'll be paying me
the same, I fancy?

1209
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:04,402
Well, you fancy wrong,
Courtney. Impudent oaf!

1210
01:53:04,486 --> 01:53:06,946
Any more of this blackmail, I'll
have you thrown out of your cottage.

1211
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,990
- Now buzz off!
- Sorry.

1212
01:53:09,116 --> 01:53:11,617
- Go on! Off you go!
- Just a joke.

1213
01:53:11,743 --> 01:53:13,995
- I say, Courtney?
- Yes, governor?

1214
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:19,500
You'll be hearing more of this matter
when I return from la belle France.

1215
01:53:27,509 --> 01:53:31,888
Good heavens. Sir Percy is
flying the channel at this moment.

1216
01:53:32,014 --> 01:53:35,808
In the dark? He must be mad. He won't
be able to see the railway lines.

1217
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:39,479
- What railway lines?
- I never thought he had the courage.

1218
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:42,356
If we go on deck, sir, we might
be able to hear him pass overhead.

1219
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:44,442
Or drop into the sea!

1220
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:04,378
Five guineas each,
wasn't it?

1221
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:07,465
Ten, or we go
straight back to England.

1222
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:12,386
Outrageous! I shall never
hire your boat again.

1223
01:54:12,471 --> 01:54:16,098
Hey! The tide's in!

1224
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:19,644
It'll be out in a couple
hours. Back on board!

1225
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:23,481
You don't think I'm gonna wait till
daylight to be caught by the French?

1226
01:54:23,565 --> 01:54:25,816
You'll have to
get your feet wet.

1227
01:54:25,901 --> 01:54:28,361
You dirty rotter.

1228
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:33,449
I had hoped that I should
be dealing with a gentleman.

1229
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:37,078
So had I.
All ashore!

1230
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:22,540
Good-bye!

1231
01:55:49,735 --> 01:55:53,029
Just look at those
magnificent men...

1232
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:55,156
daring the elements,

1233
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,908
challenging the gods,
trying-

1234
01:55:57,993 --> 01:56:02,496
nay, hoping
- to fly their machines across no less than 22 miles.

1235
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:07,418
Yes, that's what I said-
22 miles of sea!

1236
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:14,759
Welcome to Calais, monsieur.

1237
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:17,845
Give me a hand, will you?
No, no, no! Put me down!

1238
01:56:17,929 --> 01:56:20,222
Don't do that! Go away!
What are you doing?

1239
01:56:20,349 --> 01:56:23,768
I've gotta get to Calais to compete in
the race! Put me down, you ruddy idiots!

1240
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,103
Don't be silly!
I haven't got the time!

1241
01:56:26,188 --> 01:56:29,231
I've got to get to Calais
to continue the race!

1242
01:57:42,097 --> 01:57:45,766
Bon voyage, monsieur!

1243
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:02,742
Are you all right,
Lieutenant Parsons?

1244
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:06,620
Don't worry!
We'll soon have you out!

1245
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:42,072
Aah!

1246
01:59:15,607 --> 01:59:17,650
Can you swim?

1247
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:22,446
There is nothing
a German officer cannot do!

1248
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:40,065
The race is not over yet! We've got
to get them refueled and off to Paris!

1249
02:01:00,378 --> 02:01:04,006
Richard Mays,

1250
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:10,054
Orvil Newton away
from Calais at... 8:50.

1251
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:22,650
La am├йricaine, you can vive who
you like, they haven't got a chance.

1252
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:25,653
The fabulous Sir Percy
took off for Paris two hours ago.

1253
02:01:25,737 --> 02:01:28,822
He's so far in the lead, nothing
can stop him. Nothing at all. Ha!

1254
02:01:28,907 --> 02:01:30,908
Vive Sir Percy!

1255
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:33,243
What am I saying?
He's a most ghastly person.

1256
02:01:43,672 --> 02:01:45,381
Buzz off!

1257
02:01:47,092 --> 02:01:49,760
Go on! Bug off!

1258
02:04:28,211 --> 02:04:30,921
Blast it!

1259
02:04:33,925 --> 02:04:35,926
Driver!

1260
02:04:50,024 --> 02:04:52,776
Driver!
Stop the train!

1261
02:04:56,948 --> 02:05:00,200
Arretez le train!

1262
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:41,992
Blast!

1263
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,621
Look! Go!

1264
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:34,920
Hey, you!
Where can I get some-

1265
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:38,006
Fran├зoise,
what are you doing here?

1266
02:06:38,091 --> 02:06:40,092
Pardon, monsieur?

1267
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:43,762
- Uh, you are not Fran├зoise?
- No, Yvette. Why?

1268
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:45,847
Hey.

1269
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:49,851
Um, where can I get
some gasoline?

1270
02:06:49,936 --> 02:06:53,480
At Amiens. It is
five kilometers from here.

1271
02:06:53,564 --> 02:06:55,649
Uh-huh.

1272
02:06:55,733 --> 02:06:59,736
Be a good fellow and bring
me as much as possible.

1273
02:06:59,821 --> 02:07:04,449
The honor of France
is at stake.

1274
02:07:04,575 --> 02:07:07,786
- But, Yvette!
- You must go. Go, go, go!

1275
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:13,583
All right! All right, but
I will be a good 30 minutes.

1276
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:22,342
We have 30 minutes.

1277
02:08:08,306 --> 02:08:11,641
Excuse me.
Can you see anyone yet?

1278
02:08:11,726 --> 02:08:16,688
Yes! Ponticelli is first
round the Eiffel Tower.

1279
02:08:16,773 --> 02:08:18,774
There are two more on his tail!

1280
02:08:38,336 --> 02:08:41,880
This is going to be a close
finish, very close indeed.

1281
02:08:41,964 --> 02:08:45,175
Count Ponticelli's still ahead,
followed by...

1282
02:08:45,259 --> 02:08:48,095
Orvil Newton, Richard Mays.

1283
02:09:50,032 --> 02:09:52,242
Jump!

1284
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:19,102
And here they come now!
Here's the winner!

1285
02:10:21,564 --> 02:10:25,275
It's Richard Mays!
Richard Mays of England!

1286
02:10:40,458 --> 02:10:42,292
You get ready to jump now!

1287
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:09,861
- Ponticelli. Ponticelli! You all right?
- Eh?

1288
02:11:09,987 --> 02:11:12,739
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1289
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:14,783
Emilio! Emilio!

1290
02:11:14,867 --> 02:11:20,038
Emilio! Ohh!

1291
02:11:27,255 --> 02:11:30,215
Patricia?

1292
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:34,302
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard!
You won!

1293
02:11:34,387 --> 02:11:38,473
Oh, Richard! You won! You
won! You won! I'm so pleased.

1294
02:11:38,599 --> 02:11:42,727
- What happened to Ponticelli?
- Well, his machine caught fire.

1295
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:46,606
Orvil was marvelous!
He had to stop to pick him up.

1296
02:11:46,691 --> 02:11:49,317
H could have won though.

1297
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:52,946
Hey, Richard!
Richard.

1298
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:55,073
Richard, congratulations.

1299
02:11:56,492 --> 02:11:59,202
Well done, Richard!
Congratulations!

1300
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:03,123
Well, you deserve it more than I
do. It was a wonderful thing you did.

1301
02:12:03,207 --> 02:12:05,542
You'd have done the same thing
if you'd have seen him.

1302
02:12:05,626 --> 02:12:08,128
Well, you did it.

1303
02:12:08,212 --> 02:12:10,422
Let's call it a tie.
We'll share the prize.

1304
02:12:15,219 --> 02:12:19,097
The city of Paris salutes
the gallant victor!

1305
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:26,479
Pierre Dubois is coming!

1306
02:12:58,512 --> 02:13:00,513
Pierre!

1307
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:06,811
You remember me,
don't you?

1308
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:11,024
- Yes, of course. You-You are- You are-
- Betty.

1309
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:14,778
Betty! Of course. Oh.
How could I ever forget?

1310
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:17,322
Every time I look at you,
my heart sings.

1311
02:13:17,406 --> 02:13:19,574
Oh!

1312
02:13:21,452 --> 02:13:23,662
Will you pardon me?

1313
02:13:23,746 --> 02:13:27,957
I better have a look at my undercarriage.
It's been taking an awful beating.

1314
02:13:30,586 --> 02:13:32,504
I think we ought to go
and find somewhere to put-

1315
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:35,715
We must have your photograph
by your machine, monsieur.

1316
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:39,469
Over here. This way.

1317
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:41,721
And now you stop flying, huh?

1318
02:13:41,806 --> 02:13:43,848
- Do I have to?
- You have to.

1319
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,892
Not for me,
but for bambinos.

1320
02:13:45,976 --> 02:13:49,688
By now they're
used to it.

1321
02:13:49,814 --> 02:13:53,733
- Another one?
- Uh-huh.

1322
02:13:53,818 --> 02:13:56,569
In that-a case,
I give up.

1323
02:13:56,654 --> 02:13:59,823
- Emilio.
- Sophia.

1324
02:13:59,907 --> 02:14:03,326
Turn around.

1325
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:27,517
- Whoops!
- Oh!

1326
02:14:29,687 --> 02:14:32,897
So ended the 1910 air race.

1327
02:14:33,023 --> 02:14:37,318
The winner's time:
25 hours, 11 minutes.

1328
02:14:44,034 --> 02:14:49,998
Today the same distance can be covered
by supersonic jets in seven minutes,

1329
02:14:51,208 --> 02:14:54,794
but it can take longer.

1330
02:14:58,549 --> 02:15:00,633
May I have your attention,
please?

1331
02:15:00,718 --> 02:15:04,596
We regret to announce that the departure
of all planes from London to Paris...

1332
02:15:04,722 --> 02:15:07,140
have been delayed again,
owing to bad weather.

1333
02:15:07,224 --> 02:15:09,642
Buses are waiting outside
to take you back to your hotels.

1334
02:15:09,727 --> 02:15:11,728
Will you all come
this way, please?

1335
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:14,230
Will you all follow me?

1336
02:15:52,603 --> 02:15:54,771
тЩк Those magnificent men тЩк

1337
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:56,856
