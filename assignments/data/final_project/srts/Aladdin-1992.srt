Wow!

theirs never will.

learning something, dear?

14

What's so special
about a lamp?

20
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,427
Oh,

21
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,863
Maybe if you sing.

22
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,463

23

somewhere we'll be safe.

Here comes the master.

197
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,184
You bring me the rough
but never a diamond.

198
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,419
Take them away.

199
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,187

- Take them away.

00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,190
- Please!
- My vizier...

201
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:10,595
perhaps this diamond in
the rough does not exist?

202
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,397
He is out there.

203
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,500
But we've searched
for months!

204
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:18,404
I do not understand what could
possibly be in that cave...

205
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,974
that could help a man
as great as you.

206
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:25,077
You are already second
only to the sultan!

207
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,345
Second! Uh-oh!

208
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,149
Who's in trouble now?

209
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,218
And you think
second is enough?

210
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:34,652
Of course.

211
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,055
You were not born
to be sultan.

212
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,490
Not smart.

213
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:42,161
Do you know what I had to do
to get the power that I have?

214
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,564
The sacrifices that I've made,
the bodies that I've buried?

215
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,100
The five years
spent in a Shirabad jail?

216
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,703
People need to understand

217
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,503
that they will pay
for underestimating me.

218
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,641
Second is not enough!
And it will never be enough!

219
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:59,043
That's why I need the lamp,
and why I no longer need you!

220
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,252
This way.

221
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:09,754
Oh.

222
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,224
Where are we, exactly?

223
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:13,525
You'll see.

224
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,263
Oh, my.

225
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,033
Is this...
Is this where you live?

226
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,701
Yep.

227
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:27,105
Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

228
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,714
Welcome to my humble...

229
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,584
You'll see.

230
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,791
You are
quite the magician.

231
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,459
Thank you.

232
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,698
Abu, no, help!

233
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,607
I can't believe...

234
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,142
What?

235
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,712
I can't believe we did that.
That I did that.

236
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,147
That we're alive!

237
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:09,380
With the chase.

238
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,347
Abu, tea?

239
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,084
Jumping buildings.

240
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,285
- That was incredible.
- Tea?

241
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:17,823
Thank you. And thank you
for getting me out of there.

242
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:20,425
Aladdin, isn't it?

243
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,560
Uh, you're welcome...

244
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,197
I'm... I'm Dalia.

245
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,431
Dalia.

246
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:28,466
From the palace.

247
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,768
How could you tell?

248
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,305
Well, only someone
from the palace

249
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,374
could afford a bracelet
like that.

250
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,642
And that silk lining
is imported, too.

251
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,310
It comes
from the merchant boats,

252
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,512
straight to the palace.

253
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,613
But not to servants.

254
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,416
At least, not most servants,

255
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,453
which means you are
a handmaid to the princess.

256
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,288
Impressive.

257
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,324
You think that's impressive,

258
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,126
you should see the city
from up there.

259
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,259
Oh.

260
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,767
Agrabah. It's so beautiful.

261
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,368
I should get out more.

262
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:07,438
You should tell the
princess to get out more.

263
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:09,874
The people haven't
seen her in years.

264
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,709
They won't let her.

265
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,146
Ever since my...

266
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:19,317
The queen was killed,
the sultan's been afraid.

267
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,886
So she's kept locked away.

268
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,887
Seems everyone's
been afraid since then.

269
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,190
But the people of Agrabah
had nothing to do with that.

270
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:27,325
The people loved her.

271
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,262
They did, didn't they?

272
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,765
Is this yours?

273
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,468
It's kind of borrowed.

274
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,776
My mother taught me
that song.

275
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:48,379
Mine too.

276
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,449
It's all I remember of her.

277
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,218
And what about your father?

278
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,653
I lost them both
when I was young.

279
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,689
Been on my own ever since.

280
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,490
It's all right, it's just...

281
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,825
What?

282
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,627
It's a little sad.

283
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:04,662
Having a monkey

284
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,297
as the only parental
authority in your life.

285
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,269
We get by.

286
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:14,472
Every day I just think
things will be different...

287
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,541
but it never
seems to change.

288
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:20,178
It's just sometimes,
I feel like I'm...

289
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,245
Trapped.

290
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,417
Like you can't escape
what you were born into?

291
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,921
Yes.

292
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,522
Hmm.

293
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,593
Welcome Prince Anders!

294
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,828
I have to get back
to the palace.

295
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:38,797
Uh... Now?

296
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,534
Make way
for Prince Anders!

297
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,269
Make way for Prince Anders!

298
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,873
It's just another prince
coming to court the princess.

299
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:53,779
Yes, and I have
to get her ready.

300
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,414
Oh! Do you have my bracelet?

301
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:56,547
Sure.

302
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,819
Make way
for Prince Anders.

303
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,487
I'm sure I put it in here.

304
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:04,890
Somewhere.

305
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:07,392
Abu, did you take it?

306
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,893
That was
my mother's bracelet.

307
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,397
Yes. It's beautiful.

308
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:14,799
You are a thief.

309
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,568
- No, no. Yes, but...
- I'm so naive.

310
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:18,737
- Abu.
- Excuse me.

311
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,774
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, it's not like that!

312
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,543
Clear the way!

313
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,776
No! Watch it!

314
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:30,983
Street rat,
get out of the way!

315
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:32,883
Who do you think
you're calling a street rat?

316
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,719
Are you talking back to me?

317
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,856
You were born worthless
and you will die worthless.

318
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,392
And only your fleas
will mourn you.

319
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,430
Come on, Abu.

320
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,665

<i>♪ They'd find out</i>

327
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:30,441
<i>♪ There's so much more to me ♪</i>

328
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,985
Abu.

329
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:42,753
There's a time
that we do steal,

330
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,389
and a time we don't.

331
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,892
This was definitely a don't.

332
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,102
Welcome, Prince Anders!

333
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,770
We trust you had
an enjoyable journey.

334
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,546
Oh, wow.

335
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:28,500
Prince Anders, my daughter,
Princess Jasmine.

336
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:34,406
So, why did no one tell me
of your beauty?

337
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,107
No one mentioned yours,
either.

338
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,011
Oh! Thank you.
They say that in Skanland.

339
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,079
Yeah. Right?

340
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,419
It's very, very amusing.

341
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,553
- Is it?
- Yeah.

342
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:49,921
We have the same title,

343
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,922
yet are never
described the same way.

344
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:56,461
Jasmine.

345
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:57,728
Yeah.

346
00:19:58,129 --> 00:19:59,131
Oh.

347
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,565
What is that?

348
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,835
Don't tell me.

349
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,406
It's a cat with stripes!

350
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,574
He likes you.

351
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,808
I know.

352
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,744
'Cause in Skanland,
cats love me.

353
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,012
Here, puss, puss.
Hey, puss, puss.

354
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,914
Hey, puss, puss, puss...

355
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:24,088
My sultan, our enemies
grow stronger every day...

356
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,025
yet you allow your daughter
to dismiss Prince Anders...

357
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:28,692
and a possible
military alliance.

358
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:29,761
Which enemies?

359
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,963
Shirabad continues to amass.

360
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:34,900
- Shirabad is our ally.
- Was our ally!

361
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:38,069
You would drag us into a war
with our oldest...

362
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:39,570
And you would allow
your kingdom

363
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,907
to sink into ruin
for mere sentiment!

364
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:42,974
Jafar!

365
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:48,546
Remember your place.

366
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,651
I apologize.

367
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,788
Forgive me, my sultan.

368
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,958
I went too far.

369
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:06,797
But...

370
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,835
if you would
only reconsider...

371
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,205
I think you will see...

372
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,145
that invading Shirabad
is the right thing to do.

373
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:27,552
Invading Shirabad is...

374
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:28,886
Invade Shirabad?

375
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:33,623
What?

376
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,594
Why would we invade
Mother's kingdom?

377
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,630
We would never
invade Shirabad.

378
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:43,268
But an ally in Skanland
would improve our situation.

379
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:48,540
Yes, if you consider giving
Prince Anders a chance.

380
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,510
To rule? Baba,
Rajah would make a better ruler.

381
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,546
My dear, I'm not
getting any younger.

382
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,716
We must find you a husband,

383
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,584
and we are running
out of kingdoms.

384
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,820
What foreign prince could care
for our people as I do?

385
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,055
I could lead if only...

386
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,657
My dear,
you cannot be a sultan...

387
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,559
because it has
never been done

388
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,862
in the 1,000-year history
of our kingdom.

389
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:16,301
I have been preparing for this
my whole life. I have read...

390
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,137
Books? But you cannot
read experience.

391
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,639
Inexperience
is dangerous.

392
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:24,575
People left unchecked
will revolt.

393
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,645
Walls and borders unguarded
will be attacked.

394
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,113
Jafar is right.

395
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,315
One day...

396
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,019
you will understand.

397
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:42,160
You may leave now.

398
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:03,648
Life will be kinder to you,
Princess,

399
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,350
once you accept
these traditions...

400
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,952
and understand
it's better for you

401
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,056
to be seen and not heard.

Open the gate!

416
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,743
Splendid!

417
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,980
You know what to do, Abu.

418
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:49,054
Get off me!
Get off me, you dirty monkey!

419
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,057
Go away! Go away! Go away!

420
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:55,994
Close the gate!

421
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:57,261
Dirty monkey!

422
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,864
Street thief. Street thief.

423
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,136
"Remember your place, Jafar."

424
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,205
Remember your place!

425
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:10,474
If I hear that
one more time...

426
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,076
Sorry, master!

427
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:16,046
Another petty insult
from that small-minded fool.

428
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,316
He sees a city
where I see an empire.

429
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,852
Such vision.

430
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,421
Once that lamp
sits in my hand...

431
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:28,425
then I shall sit
on his throne.

432
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,062
Thief.
Thief in the palace.

433
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,498
"Thief in the palace"?

434
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,167
That's what I said. Thief!

435
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,135
What have you seen, Iago?

436
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,238
Diamond in the rough.

437
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:01,392
I told you,
now, come on!

438
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:04,362
Bigger circles.
Bigger circles.

439
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:16,106
Who's a clever boy?

440
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,810
But, Dalia,
there has to be something I can do.

441
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,313
A handsome prince
wants to marry you.

442
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,181
Oh, when will
life get easier?

443
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:26,551
It's not that I don't want to
marry, it's just...

444
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:29,353
You want to be sultan.
But why?

445
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,189
You remember
my mother used to say...

446
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:35,325
we would only ever be as happy
as our least happy subject?

447
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:39,130
If she saw what I saw today,
she would be heartbroken.

448
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,400
She would also
want you to be safe.

449
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,303
And clean.
I'll draw the bath.

450
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,940
Jafar's guards
on every corner.

451
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,008
Soon, he'd have them
invading our neighbors,

452
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,344
risking lives, for what?

453
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,880
I can help.

454
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,216
I know I can.

455
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:01,486
I was born to do more than
marry some useless prince.

456
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,988
If you had to marry
a useless prince,

457
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:05,923
you could certainly
do worse than this one.

458
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,459
He's tall and handsome.

459
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,295
And yes, he's a little dim,

460
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,196
but you're just
getting married.

461
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,231
It's not like
you have to talk to him.

462
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,969
But you'd prefer that boy
from the market.

463
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,049
Can I help you?

464
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:34,618
Tea?

465
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,154
You? You!

466
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,289
What are you doing here?

467
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,457
Get in here, now!

468
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,860
I came back to return
your bracelet.

469
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,360
My bracelet?
Where is it?

470
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,863
On your wrist.

471
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,296
What?

472
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,333
Not bad.

473
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:50,301
I like what she's done
with the place.

474
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,237
How did you
get past the guards?

475
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,440
That was challenging,
but I have my ways.

476
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,309
While the princess is out,

477
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,378
would you like to go
for a stroll?

478
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,012
Have a little chat?

479
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,215
You are unbelievable.

480
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,417
You cannot just
break into a palace

481
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,187
and walk around
like you own the place.

482
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,487
If you don't have anything,

483
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:12,222
you have to act like
you own everything.

484
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,326
So, what do you say?
I did find your bracelet.

485
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:18,563
You did not find it,
you stole it!

486
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,565
Correction,
the monkey stole it.

487
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:21,931
He's your monkey.

488
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,003
He's still just a monkey.

489
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,270
Who ordered the tea?

490
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,272
Uh...

491
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:31,075
I did.

492
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:36,613
For you, Princess Jasmine.

493
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,617
Your Majesty!

494
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:42,452
Why are you being weird?

495
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:54,265
Oh, I'm the princess.

496
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:55,667
Yes.

497
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,134
Mmm-hmm.

498
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,437
And it is good to be me...

499
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:03,240
with all my palaces...

500
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:06,678
and wagons of gold things...

501
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:13,017
and dresses
for every hour of the day.

502
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,488
Now it is time
for my cat to be cleaned.

503
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,026
She doesn't get out much.

504
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:23,560
Mmm-hmm.

505
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,696
Clearly.

506
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:27,597
Oh.

507
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,534
Aren't you supposed to be
in the bath?

508
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,637
Oh, servant girl,

509
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,107
this cat isn't
going to clean itself!

510
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:40,177
But don't cats
clean themselves?

511
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,547
You have to go now.

512
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,681
Oh, okay. But I'm coming back
tomorrow night.

513
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,084
What? No, you can't...

514
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,152
Meet me in the courtyard
beside the fountain

515
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,454
when the moon
is above the minaret.

516
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,590
To return this.

517
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,298
I promise.

518
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,007
Can you believe it, Abu?

519
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,111
The most heavily guarded
place in all of Agrabah...

520
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:15,479
Evening.

521
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,681
Evening.

522
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:19,116
Evening.

523
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,518
Guards are behind me.

524
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,555
Hello, boys.

525
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:50,414
Where am I?

526
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,717
In a world
of trouble, boy.

527
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,321
That bracelet,
is that what this is about?

528
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,391
Because I didn't steal it.
The handmaid...

529
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,493
What was a handmaid doing
wearing the queen's bracelet?

530
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,495
The queen? No, no.

531
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,432
She said that
it belonged to her...

532
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,565
Mother.

533
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,637
Well, at least she told
the truth about one thing.

534
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:16,239
Are you saying
that was the princess?

535
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,610
I was talking to the...

536
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,445
She was toying with you.

537
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,782
It amuses her
to meet commoners.

538
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:29,187
Did you actually think
she liked you?

539
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:32,590
What do they call you?

540
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,592
Aladdin.

541
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,228
Aladdin. People like us
must be realistic if...

542
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:39,296
Us?

543
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:42,099
You see,
I was once like you.

544
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,103
A common thief.

545
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:49,272
Only I thought bigger.

546
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:52,375
Steal an apple
and you're a thief,

547
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:54,712
steal a kingdom
and you're a statesman.

548
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,748
Only weak men stop there.

549
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:00,584
You're either the most
powerful man in the room,

550
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:01,719
or you're nothing.

551
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,590
You, you stumbled upon
an opportunity.

552
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,557
I can make you rich.

553
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,294
Rich enough
to impress a princess.

554
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,630
But nothing comes for free.

555
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:23,773
What would I have to do?

556
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:30,581
<i>There's a cave nearby,
and in it, a simple oil lamp.</i>

557
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,784
<i>Retrieve it for me
and I will make you</i>

558
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:36,554
<i>wealthy enough
to impress a princess.</i>

559
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:43,161
<i>You're nothing to her,
but you could be.</i>

560
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,864
<i>Your life begins now, Aladdin.</i>

561
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,407
Still waiting?

562
00:32:57,373 --> 00:33:00,944
No. No, I came out to...

563
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,517
He promised.

564
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,789
I'll be upstairs
if you need me.

565
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:13,557
Good night, Dalia.

566
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:23,500
The Cave of Wonders.

567
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:24,701
When you enter,

568
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,305
you will see more riches
than you ever dreamed of...

569
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,308
gold, diamonds,
and the lamp.

570
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,377
Bring it to me and I will
make you rich and free.

571
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:36,913
But take no other treasure,

572
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,417
no matter how sorely
you are tempted.

573
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,589
And you will be tempted.

574
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:51,528
Only one may enter here.

575
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:55,432
One whose worth
lies far within.

576
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:58,669
The diamond in the rough.

577
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:00,738
Remember...

578
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:03,274
take nothing but the lamp.

579
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,584
Abu, don't touch.

580
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,752
Remember?

581
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:37,368
Whoa.

582
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:45,675
Abu.

583
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,913
This is a magic carpet.

584
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,849
These really do exist.

585
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:53,850
Hello, Carpet.

586
00:35:57,821 --> 00:36:00,658
Let's see what we can do
about your situation here.

587
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:16,506
Oh, hey.

588
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,676
Don't mention it.

589
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,714
Abu, keep your little
monkey hands to yourself.

590
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,054
Abu, no!

591
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:41,858
You have touched
the forbidden treasure.

592
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:45,562
Now you will never again...

593
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,098
see the light of day!

594
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,195
Carpet!

595
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:28,205
Abu, jump!

596
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:53,830
Could you give me a hand?

597
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,132
First, the lamp.

598
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,567
No, first your hand.

599
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,868
We don't have much time.

600
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,169
Give me the lamp.

601
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,176
Your hand!

602
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:08,578
Second no more, master.

603
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:09,680
Now your hand.

604
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,051
How about my foot?

605
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,253
No! No!

606
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,995
Get off me, monkey!

607
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:35,872
Stop.

608
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,209
Dirty monkey!
Second, second!

609
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,195
Whoa.

610
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,699
We're alive.

611
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,865
I think.

612
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:04,935
Thank you, Carpet.

613
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,908
Abu.

614
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,044
How did you...?

615
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,312
You cunning little monkey.

616
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,152
Now, all we need's a way out.

617
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:28,091
Hey, Carpet, do you know
a way out of here?

618
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,161
The lamp?

619
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,033
What is that?

620
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:55,051
Oh, great one who summons me,

621
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,187
terrible one
who commands me...

622
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:02,292
I stand by my oath,
loyalty to wishes three.

623
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:10,167
I said, "Oh, great..."

624
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,803
Excuse me,
boy, where's your boss?

625
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:16,106
Help me out here.
Where's your boss?

626
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,274
If I was gonna
talk to myself,

627
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,709
I could've just
stayed in the lamp.

628
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:19,810
Uh... Uh...

629
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,310
Hello?

630
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:22,779
I'm...

631
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,080
Use your big boy voice.

632
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:28,686
I'm talking
to a smoking blue giant?

633
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:30,754
No!

634
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:32,756
I am not a giant,

635
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:35,859
I am a genie.
There is a difference.

636
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:37,960
Giants are not real.

637
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:39,862
- Where's your boss?
- Uh, my boss?

638
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:42,765
Look, kid, I've been doing
this a long time, all right?

639
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:45,069
There's always a guy,
you know...

640
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,438
he's cheated somebody
or buried somebody...

641
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,406
I mean, you get my point.
Where's that guy?

642
00:41:49,538 --> 00:41:52,042
I know that guy.
He's outside.

643
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:57,113
So, it's just you and me
down here?

644
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,149
And a monkey?

645
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,883
That's your
personal business...

646
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,852
but we gonna need to talk
about that monkey later.

647
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:04,020
It's a pretty
little monkey.

648
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,388
So, you rubbed the lamp?

649
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:06,790
Uh-huh.

650
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:09,960
Oh. Okay.
Hey, do you mind...

651
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,728
if I could just stretch it out over
here, do you mind?

652
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,497
Uh... Are you asking me?

653
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,165
Yes. You're my master.

654
00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:17,934
I'm your master?

you should be my master.

Right, but that's not quite
how it works, though.

658
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,310

trapped in here?

"A thousand years."

00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:34,484
Kid, is it me or does, like,
everything surprise you?

663
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:36,754
So, you really don't know
who I am?

664
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:40,858

No, no, no. Please, please.

736
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:10,167
You can thank me outside.
In the sun.

737
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:11,301
When you wish us out.

738
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,670
So, how does it work?

739
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:16,540
You're kidding, right?

740
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,045
The whole song
was the instructions!

741
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:25,549
Obviously, you can't dance
and listen at the same time.

742
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:28,085
So, here's the basics.
Step one, rub the lamp.

743
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,419
Step two, say what you want.
Step three...

744
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,556
there is no step three.
See, it's that easy.

745
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:34,657
You get three wishes...

746
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:36,460
they must begin
with rubbing the lamp

747
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,094
and saying,
"I wish." Got it?

748
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:39,763
- I think so.
- Couple other rules.

749
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:42,032
You can't wish for more
wishes. Three is enough.

750
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:45,002
Now, I can't make
anybody love anybody or

751
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,069
bring anybody
back from the dead.

752
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:48,372
Feel free to interrupt me

753
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:49,605
anytime you don't understand.

754
00:46:49,817 --> 00:46:51,883
I'm kidding, don't ever
interrupt me, no matter what.

755
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:53,345
Now, I usually don't have to
go through all of this...

756
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,344
because by the time
the guy gets to me,

757
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,613
he pretty much knows
what he wants...

758
00:46:56,745 --> 00:46:58,781
and it generally
has to do with

759
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:01,584
tons of money and power!

760
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:06,689
Do me a favor,
do not drink from that cup.

761
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,492
I promise you there is
not enough money

762
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:10,626
and power on earth
for you to be satisfied.

763
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,629
Good? So,
what's your first wish?

764
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:15,698
Mmm... Well,
I have to think about it.

765
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:17,767
I mean,
if there are only three...

766
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,335
Why are there
only three anyway?

767
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:21,504
I don't know, who cares?

768
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:23,806
You don't know?

769
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,142
I thought
you were all-knowing.

770
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,475
That's 'cause
you don't listen.

771
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:29,078
I never said
I was all-knowing.

772
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:30,814
I said I was all-powerful.

773
00:47:30,913 --> 00:47:33,149
The most powerful being
in the universe.

774
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:35,084
Look, whatever I don't know,

775
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,319
I know I can learn it.

776
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:37,219
Outside in the sun.

777
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:38,754
Why are you playing
hard to wish?

778
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:41,625
I know you can't tell,
but I am very pale.

779
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:45,494
This is sky blue.
My natural pigmentation is navy.

780
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:47,129
Give us some sun.

781
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,233
Okay, Genie. I wish for you
to get us out of this cave.

782
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:52,636
Boom! Booyah!

783
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:55,272
He has made his first wish!

784
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:57,140
Thank you for choosing
Carpets, Camels and Caravans.

785
00:47:57,306 --> 00:47:59,076
Please don't forget to tip
your genie on the way out.

786
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,143
Hey.

787
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,378
Hold yourself, kid!

788
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:07,716
Whoa.

789
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:10,320
Man, look at this world.

790
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:13,323
It's so big!

791
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:14,757
Inside the lamp,
everything is, like,

792
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:17,393
brass, brass, brass!

793
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,008
You're like,
"Oh! Is that some copper?"

794
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:23,066
Nope, brass! Sorta the
problem with the genie life...

795
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:27,070
phenomenal cosmic powers,
but itty-bitty living space.

796
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:31,373
So, is this magic,
or are you magic?

797
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,410
Eh, kind of a package deal.

798
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:38,280
Can you warn me
before you do that?

799
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:39,849
Oh, you'll get used to it.

800
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:41,249
Right.

801
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:44,154
So, do I have to make
all my wishes here?

802
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:46,522
I mean, if I take you back
to Agrabah, won't people...?

803
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,593
No, no, no!
I can look totally normal.

804
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:50,660
Boo!

805
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:52,696
Right, totally normal.

806
00:48:54,797 --> 00:48:55,799
Still blue.

807
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,803
Do we need the top knot?

808
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:01,705
That's my little
cherry on top!

809
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:03,172
Okay, okay.

810
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:07,310
So, what are you gonna wish?

811
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,579
Oh, I haven't
thought about that.

812
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:12,449
Mmm. You really
are not that guy.

813
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:14,384
Okay.

814
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,685
So, what would
you wish for?

815
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:16,585
Mmm.

816
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,524
No one's ever
asked me that before.

817
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:23,893
It's an easy one, though.

818
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:26,296
I'd wish to be free.

819
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:28,364
To not have to say,

820
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:29,598
"Poof! Can I help you?"

821
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:31,434
"Poof! What would you like?"

822
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:32,702
"Poof! Welcome to the lamp.

823
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:33,903
"May I take your order,
please?"

824
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,372
Freedom.

825
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:36,640
I wish to be...

826
00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:39,441
to be human.

827
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:41,310
Why don't you just
set yourself free?

828
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,850
Carpet! Did you hear
what this boy said?

829
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:49,318
Why don't I set myself free?

830
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:51,755
Only way a genie
gets to be free...

831
00:49:51,886 --> 00:49:54,223
is if the owner of the lamp

832
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,625
uses one of his wishes
to set him free...

833
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:58,728
and the last time
that happened was, like,

834
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:01,264
the fourth of Never-ary.

835
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,937
I'll do it.
I've got three, right?

836
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,738
Actually, you have two left.

837
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,407
You used one to get out
of the cave. Remember?

838
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:13,310
Did I? Or did you?

839
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:15,812
I thought I had to be
rubbing the lamp.

840
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,280
Okay, little street boy.

841
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:19,481
Let's rewind the tape.

842
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,852
<i>Okay, Genie. I wish...</i>

843
00:50:23,953 --> 00:50:26,422
Ooh! Little monkey
with the lamp trick!

844
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:28,491
Never seen that one before.

845
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,460
- I'll keep my eye on you.
- Uh-oh.

846
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,829
At least now, I can use
my third wish to set you free.

847
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:36,900
Here's the thing
about wishes...

848
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,837
the more you have,
the more you want.

849
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,272
That's not me.

850
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:44,673
Mmm.

851
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:45,841
We'll see about that.

852
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,643
- But there is something.
- Uh-oh.

853
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:48,911
Seen that face before.

854
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:51,781
Who is she?
Who's the girl?

855
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:53,950
She's a princess.

856
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,484
Aw, aren't they all?

857
00:50:55,618 --> 00:50:58,321
"Treat your woman like
a queen," I always say.

858
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,756
No,
she's an actual princess.

859
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,325
Well, I already told you,

860
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,326
I can't make anyone
love anyone, so...

861
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,363
No, no.
We had a connection.

862
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:07,397
Did they?

863
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:10,033
Okay.

864
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:13,469
She is smart, and kind,
and so beautiful.

865
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:15,772
But she has to marry a...

866
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,440
Hey! Can you make me
a prince?

867
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:22,779
There's a lot of gray area
in "make me a prince."

868
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:26,048
I could just
make you a prince.

869
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,350
Oh, no.

870
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,417
Right. You'd be snuggled up

871
00:51:28,516 --> 00:51:29,926
with that dude
for the rest of your life.

872
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:31,655
Yo, y'all seen my palace?

873
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,522
Be specific with your words.

874
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:36,893
- The deal is in the detail.
- Got it.

875
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,027
Which I don't
really understand

876
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,328
because if she
already likes you...

877
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:40,463
why change?

878
00:51:40,562 --> 00:51:42,732
I told you,
she has to marry a prince.

879
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,433
I just
wanna go home, man!

880
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:46,670
Okay, I can do that.

881
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,938
An official wish this time,

882
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:50,440
for those of us
who are counting...

883
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:52,341
which now, I am one.

884
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:55,010
Genie,
I wish...

885
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:56,546
Lamp.

886
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:57,713
Oh, sorry.

887
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:01,984
All right. Genie...

888
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,419
Don't hurt him, Genie!

889
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:08,825
I wish to become a prince.

890
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:10,759
Back up, boy.
I need some room to work.

891
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:12,696
I'm about to fabulize you.

892
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,531
Genie?

893
00:52:20,169 --> 00:52:22,471
Little head-spinney.
Better though, right?

894
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:25,374
I think
I'm getting used to it.

895
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,078
Okay, a prince, a prince.

896
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,047
Obviously, the ghetto-chic
is not gonna work.

897
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:34,784
I'm feeling a periwinkle.

898
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:36,486
What's periwinkle?

899
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:38,421
No! Chartreuse.

900
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,955
Cerise!

901
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:41,958
Ah!

902
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,560
- The lines are all wrong.
- What is this?

903
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,829
The color clashes
with your skin tone,

904
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:46,895
the silhouette is confused.

905
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:48,364
This is a big hat!

906
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:50,566
No, that is not a big hat.

907
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:52,735
Come on, Genie!
Gotta kick the door down!

908
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:55,604
We gotta go bold and gold!

909
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:57,973
No!

910
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:00,110
- We've gone too far.
- Genie, you're slippin'!

911
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,778
It's gotta be neutral
for the desert.

912
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:04,080
Ivory, beige, bone, Albion.

913
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:05,415
It's a little heavy.

914
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:08,084
White.

915
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:12,922
Oh! And the crowd goes wild!

916
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:14,391
Oh!

917
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,727
The genie!
The genie's on fire!

918
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,562
<i>The genie's on fire, folks!</i>

919
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:21,663
Don't hurt him, Genie!
Don't scald him!

920
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:23,533
Somebody cool me down!

921
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:26,536
Somebody put me out!
I'm too much!

922
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,538
Ow! I'm back!

923
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,507
- So, what do you think?
- I like it.

924
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,875
Of course you like it, boy!
I made it!

925
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,109
I think that's me.

926
00:53:34,243 --> 00:53:36,478
Strictly speaking,
it is me.

927
00:53:36,578 --> 00:53:37,747
I mean,
I did most of the work.

928
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:38,881
You was just
standing there.

929
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:40,015
But I hear you.

930
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:42,152
But won't people
recognize me?

931
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:43,553
Nobody'll recognize you.

932
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,087
That's how
genie magic works.

933
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,823
People see
what they're told to see.

934
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:49,558
Right. Who am I?

935
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:50,693
Who...?

936
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:54,163
Prince Ali?

937
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:56,800
- From?
- Duh!

938
00:53:57,098 --> 00:53:58,133
From Ababwa.

939
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:00,002
A-bub-wha?

940
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:02,571
You're not listenin'.
Ababwa.

941
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:04,507
- Is that a real place?
- Yeah!

942
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,209
Like,
everybody knows about it.

943
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,911
It has a brochure.

944
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:09,611
Little hot in the summer,
temperate in the fall.

945
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:11,547
But no, I'll let you
read it en route.

946
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:14,083
How are we gonna
get there?

947
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,986
I guess
you can't ride a chimp.

948
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,189
Don't you just love
a moonwalking monkey?

949
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:21,658
Uh-uh. Hold it there, Abu.

950
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:23,493
Donkey. Too small.

951
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,095
No.

952
00:54:27,228 --> 00:54:28,230
Too obvious.

953
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:30,098
We need somethin' robust!

954
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,473
Relax, Abu.
It's just for a minute.

955
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,841
Whoa.

956
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,609
Prince Ali of Ababwa.

957
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:42,578
And now,
for your entourage!

958
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,580
What?

959
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:47,716
What's happening?

960
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,486
Genie?

961
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,236
Clear the way!

962
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:08,837
Clear the way!

963
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:11,274
Clear the way!

964
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:12,609
Clear the way!

965
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:16,779
Clear the way!

966
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:47,544
<i>♪ Make way for Prince Ali</i>

967

00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,911
What are you doing?

1035
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:10,979
Put your arms down.

1036
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,348
I'm presenting it.

1037
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,415
Put your arms down!

1038
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:17,185
It's a pleasure to welcome you to
Agrabah, Prince Ali.

1039
00:59:18,953 --> 00:59:19,955
Oh.

1040
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:20,823
How did you break that?

1041
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:22,424
I don't know,
it fell off.

1042
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:24,426
It's a pleasure
to meet him, probably.

1043
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,495
Uh...

1044
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:30,833
It's just as much a pleasure
for me, Your Highness, sir.

1045
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:32,768
You look very serene.

1046
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:35,404
That's a curtsy,
not a bow. Stand up.

1047
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:39,007
I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar
with Ababwa.

1048
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,779
- Well, it's north.
- It's south.

1049
00:59:45,513 --> 00:59:49,218
Uh, we have
a north and a south.

1050
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,151
What?

1051
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:52,922
It's near,
if you were to go, it's...

1052
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:56,024
Around there, you can find it,
if you just look.

1053
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,126
Don't help me.

1054
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:00,296
The world is
changing quickly, Jafar.

1055
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:04,033
It seems as if there is a new
country every day.

1056
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:07,536
Don't touch me.

1057
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:09,205
Don't touch me.

1058
01:00:09,337 --> 01:00:14,042
Well, yes,
you are very wise.

1059
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,078
Uh, tell him
that we have gifts, please.

1060
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:18,547
Oh, right! We have things.

1061
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:19,882
Gifts!

1062
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:21,417
- Did you organize this?
- Yeah!

1063
01:00:24,352 --> 01:00:26,288
Yes, here we are.

1064
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,924
Gifts coming right up!

1065
01:00:29,056 --> 01:00:33,995
We have spices, golden camels,
and spoons, tiny spoons!

1066
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:35,131
Spoons!

1067
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,932
How do they
make them that tiny?

1068
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:37,966
We have jams!

1069
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,368
- Jams?
- Jams?

1070
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,506
Yes, jams!
Yam jams, fig jams.

1071
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:45,507
- Yam jams!
- And date jams.

1072
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,845
Seedless, delicious,
exotic jams.

1073
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,348
Move away from the jams.

1074
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,950
- What?
- We have jewels.

1075
01:00:54,216 --> 01:00:58,286
Jewels!
We have them! And, uh, that!

1076
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,622
Over there,

1077
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:02,424
- hidden for suspense.
- Hmm?

1078
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:03,491
Whew!

1079
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:05,260
Ta-da!

1080
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:08,264
- Uh...
- It's a wheel?

1081
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,399
It's, uh, very expensive.

1082
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:14,871
And what do you hope to buy
with this expensive?

1083
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,104
You!

1084
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:19,975
Wow!

1085
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:21,944
No! No, no, no.

1086
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:24,479
A moment with you,
a moment. That's not...

1087
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:28,317
Are you suggesting
I am for sale?

1088
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,551
Of course...

1089
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:32,455
not! No, of course not!

1090
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:33,623
No!

1091
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:37,959
It's cold and it's dark
in that lamp.

1092
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:39,094
But I prefer it to this.

1093
01:01:39,227 --> 01:01:40,363
Please excuse me.

1094
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:44,065
I need to go
and find some bread.

1095
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:47,603
For the jams.

1096
01:01:47,736 --> 01:01:49,906
No! That's not
what I meant. I...

1097
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:51,507
You did great.

1098
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,067
That's not what I meant.

1099
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,010
Just leave her alone.
You didn't do great.

1100
01:01:55,143 --> 01:01:57,546
You will get the chance
to speak again.

1101
01:01:58,145 --> 01:02:01,917
We hope you can
join us tonight, Prince Ali,

1102
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,320
when we celebrate
our harvest.

1103
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:08,524
Of course, your serene self.

1104
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:10,625
We will join you.

1105
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:12,361
Smooth.

1106
01:02:13,328 --> 01:02:14,964
In 10,000 years...

1107
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,966
I've never been
that embarrassed.

1108
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:28,576
Don't worry. You are not
out of the game yet.

1109
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,446
Just do whatever
you'd normally do at a party.

1110
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:31,948
I've never been to a party.

1111
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,717
- What?
- What?

1112
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,552
Oh, you're gonna need to
go back to the room, then.

1113
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:37,687
You're not messing up
my night.

1114
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:39,321
Prince Ali.

1115
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:45,293
May I have a word?
Privately.

1116
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:48,564
This doesn't concern
your servant.

1117
01:02:49,464 --> 01:02:53,302
Well, be over there
minding my business.

1118
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,208
I know who you are.

1119
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:03,512
You do?

1120
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:07,082
Yes.

1121
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:09,651
You're a man of
great ambition like myself.

1122
01:03:11,419 --> 01:03:14,055
I, uh, don't believe we've
been properly introduced.

1123
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:17,392
Jafar,
vizier to the sultan.

1124
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:21,730
I could be a valuable ally to
help you get what you want.

1125
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:24,266
I, uh...
I will think on that.

1126
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,501
I don't wanna
keep the princess waiting.

1127
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,470
Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

1128
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:33,042
This offer will not be on
the table for long, you see.

1129
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:36,712
Prince Ali.

1130
01:03:36,844 --> 01:03:40,382
Excuse me. Prince Ali,
your presence is requested.

1131
01:03:41,783 --> 01:03:43,786
So, I guess
that's the guy.

1132
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,322
Mmm-hmm.
That's the guy.

1133
01:03:54,629 --> 01:03:57,500
Okay, there she is.
This is your chance.

1134
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,767
You know what?

1135
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:01,737
There are a lot of people.
I don't think I can do this.

1136
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,472
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

1137
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:05,274
This one's gonna be easy.

1138
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:08,777
Ooh! And look
at her handmaid.

1139
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:12,348
And she's going
to get some punch.

1140
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,549
Feelin' a little
thirsty myself.

1141
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,351
No! No, no!
You can't leave me.

1142
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,619
They'll see
right through me.

1143
01:04:16,718 --> 01:04:19,354
No, they won't.
All you have to do is walk over there.

1144
01:04:19,453 --> 01:04:21,556
And speak.
I also have to speak.

1145
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,192
Okay, listen to me.

1146
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,627
- I live in a lamp.
- Mmm-hmm.

1147
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:27,128
This is a party.

1148
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:29,364
Do not mess this up
for me. Okay?

1149
01:04:29,497 --> 01:04:31,399
I like to party.

1150
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,268
Go get her!

1151
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:36,504
Okay.

1152
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:45,613
Princess Jasmine!

1153
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:47,649
You? You're still here?

1154
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:48,783
Yes.

1155
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:55,391
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

1156
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:56,826
What are you doing?

1157
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,396
I'm just making sure the
water is a good temperature.

1158
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,630
Why are you not over there?

1159
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:04,100
How am I supposed to
compete with that?

1160
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,368
Look at him.
He's so princely.

1161
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,269
You have got to be
more confident

1162
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,772
about what you have to offer.

1163
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:11,473
What do I have to offer?

1164
01:05:11,605 --> 01:05:13,308
Knowledge of
how to steal food?

1165
01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:15,276
How to jump
between buildings?

1166
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,879
Now, Prince Ali,
he has jewels.

1167
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:18,714
No, stop, stop, stop!

1168
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:23,786
I made you look like a prince
on the outside.

1169
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,888
But I didn't change anything
on the inside.

1170
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:29,757
Prince Ali got you
to the door...

1171
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,360
but Aladdin has to open it.

1172
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:34,162
Oh.

1173
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,864
See, the sultan
does like me!

1174
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,901
Okay, well, maybe
he'll let you be his wife.

1175
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:44,507
Look at that, another prince
more interested in Baba.

1176
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:46,307
I don't know,
I think this one might be different.

1177
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,879
And he comes with an
incredibly attractive friend.

1178
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,514
Please make it work.

1179
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,617
And what about Prince Ali?

1180
01:05:55,216 --> 01:05:57,385
Oh, look at him.
He's trying so hard.

1181
01:05:58,553 --> 01:05:59,888
And that's the problem.

1182
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,457
- Showtime.
- No.

1183
01:06:01,556 --> 01:06:02,658
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

1184
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:04,727
No. No waiting.
We're done waiting.

1185
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:06,661
No, I'm in charge. Okay?

1186
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:08,596
I say when
it's the right moment.

1187
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:14,603
Really? Really?

1188
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:19,941
He's here.
Say something, act natural.

1189
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,244
Hi!

1190
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:28,184
I'm sorry for the jams,
and the jewels...

1191
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:30,451
and the buying you.

1192
01:06:30,585 --> 01:06:33,422
That wasn't me. It was me,
I don't...

1193
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:36,859
It was me, I don't have a
twin or anything, but I...

1194
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,661
Um...

1195
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,329
Dance? I'd love to.

1196
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:42,198
Yes.

1197
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:45,701
Dance?

1198
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,203
Just dance.

1199
01:06:48,736 --> 01:06:51,439
Go. Go.

1200
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,654
Relax.

1201
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:03,438
Bravo! Well done!

1202
01:09:11,112 --> 01:09:13,549
Something very strange
about him.

1203
01:09:15,582 --> 01:09:17,920
Keep a close eye
on Prince Ali.

1204
01:09:19,953 --> 01:09:22,491
She just walked out.

1205
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:25,394
Maybe I went a tad far
with the back flip...

1206
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,996
but that dance
may be the best thing

1207
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:29,430
you ever do in your life!

1208
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:31,433
I was pretty good.

1209
01:09:31,532 --> 01:09:33,401
But nothing seems
to impress her.

1210
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:37,473
Yeah, it's crazy.
Not gems or jams or jewels.

1211
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:40,675
If I can't impress her,
I wonder who can.

1212
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:42,911
What's that
supposed to mean?

1213
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:46,581
I'm just sayin'
try being yourself.

1214
01:09:46,714 --> 01:09:48,884
But she has to
marry a prince.

1215
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:51,519
If I just had
a few more minutes with her,

1216
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,621
I know I could...

1217
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:54,922
You need to get me
over there.

1218
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:56,157
Is that an official wish?

1219
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:58,861
No. It's a favor.
For a friend.

1220
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:01,864
Oh, yeah, see, genies don't
really have friends.

1221
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:04,032
I thought you said you never
had a friend like me.

1222
01:10:04,165 --> 01:10:07,769
No, I said you never had
a friend like me!

1223
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,739
When you're a genie,
somebody always wants

1224
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,608
something from ya.
It's awkward.

1225
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:14,510
You're right,
you're right.

1226
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:16,545
Besides,
it would've involved

1227
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:18,580
distracting
a certain handmaiden...

1228
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:20,848
Ooh! Ha!
I see what you're doing!

1229
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:22,651
You hooked me.
See you there?

1230
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:31,826
Good evening.

1231
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,694
How did you get past
the guards?

1232
01:10:34,194 --> 01:10:36,598
Oh, uh, I snuck past.

1233
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:37,832
All 48 of them?

1234
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:40,635
Even the ones that eat fire?
Impressive.

1235
01:10:40,768 --> 01:10:43,872
Yes, well, that's what people
say about me!

1236
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:47,943
Well, that didn't come out
the right way.

1237
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,045
No one says that.
I don't know why I said that.

1238
01:10:50,144 --> 01:10:51,145
Uh...

1239
01:10:52,179 --> 01:10:54,849
They're beautiful!
She will hate them.

1240
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,554
Tell Prince Ali the way to
her heart is through her mind.

1241
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:02,089
Oh, actually, these are
from me to you.

1242
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,528
Could you excuse me
one moment?

1243
01:11:06,894 --> 01:11:08,763
Wait, no, just...

1244
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:16,804
"That's what people say
about me." Come on, Genie!

1245
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:20,709
My favorites. I accept.
Please continue.

1246
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:25,613
I was noticing
how pleasant the evening is.

1247
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:29,116
At the party,
I noticed you noticing...

1248
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,621
how pleasant I am.

1249
01:11:33,654 --> 01:11:35,056
Right. How's this going?

1250
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:38,260
It's clumsy,
but in a charming sort of a way.

1251
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:39,795
A stroll.

1252
01:11:41,763 --> 01:11:44,867
Would you like to take
an evening stroll?

1253
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,504
Just the two of us?
On purpose?

1254
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,671
Yes, as people.

1255
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:52,908
Just one more second.

1256
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,276
Okay.

1257
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:56,911
Why would I say
"as people"?

1258
01:11:57,045 --> 01:11:58,814
That kid is contagious!

1259
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:02,050
Go.

1260
01:12:05,153 --> 01:12:07,723
I've never done this before.
How does it work?

1261
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:10,692
- Do you like sheep cheese?
- Uh...

1262
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:16,598
Come in.

1263
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:18,634
Actually,
I'm already in.

1264
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:20,736
Don't move.

1265
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:26,141
I just came back
because you left so...

1266
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:28,242
How did you get there?

1267
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:31,647
Magic carpet?

1268
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,617
Actually, I'm glad
you are here.

1269
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,152
You are?

1270
01:12:37,285 --> 01:12:39,121
I've been trying
to find Ababwa,

1271
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,723
but it doesn't seem to be
on any of my maps.

1272
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:44,158
Care to show me?

1273
01:12:45,026 --> 01:12:46,094
I'd love to.

1274
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:49,665
Rajah,
let's not eat the prince today.

1275
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,567
He needs his legs
for dancing.

1276
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,937
Did I go too far
with the back flip?

1277
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:56,237
A little.

1278
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:00,242
- Ababwa?
- Yes.

1279
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:01,777
Genie,
I need to find Ababwa.

1280
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:02,977
My other brother...

1281
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:04,345
the short one,
not the one

1282
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,648
who gifted me a goat,
he's married...

1283
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:09,183
She has maps, lots of maps.

1284
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,086
Ababwa, of course.

1285
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:18,225
Ababwa.

1286
01:13:18,358 --> 01:13:20,761
Yak napkins
are not easy to find...

1287
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:36,310
Have you lost your country?

1288
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:40,047
My country?
No, no.

1289
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:41,116
Uh...

1290
01:13:44,285 --> 01:13:45,787
There it is.

1291
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:49,090
I don't think so.
I've been...

1292
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,228
There it is.

1293
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:55,931
How did I not see that?

1294
01:13:56,063 --> 01:13:57,798
Who needs maps
anyway?

1295
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,636
They're old and useless,
and add no practical value.

1296
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:03,805
Maps are how I see the world.

1297
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:06,774
I thought a princess
could go anywhere.

1298
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,810
Not this princess.

1299
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:15,317
Well,

1300
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:17,084
would you wanna...?

1301
01:14:17,184 --> 01:14:19,187
Oh. Uh...

1302
01:14:19,287 --> 01:14:20,856
Sorry, sorry.

1303
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,792
Rajah!

1304
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,059
Oh.

1305
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:35,103
Thanks for that.

1306
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:41,042
I was saying you should
see these places.

1307
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:45,814
I mean, there's a whole world
outside of books and maps.

1308
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:49,283
Do you want to?

1309
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,120
How? Every door is guarded.

1310
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:54,755
Who said anything
about a door?

1311
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:56,024
What are you doing?

1312
01:14:56,523 --> 01:14:58,727
Sometimes, Princess...

1313
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:02,864
sometimes, you just
have to take a risk.

1314
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,071
What just happened?

1315
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,111
What?

1316
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:19,114
Is this...?

1317
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,848
A magic carpet?

1318
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:23,485
Do you trust me?

1319
01:15:24,484 --> 01:15:25,853
What did you say?

1320
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,289
Do you trust me?

1321
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:34,395
Yes.

you've shown me,

1369
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:24,532
this is by far
the most beautiful.

1370
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:27,535
Sometimes,
you just have to see it

1371
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:28,637
from a different
perspective.

1372
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:32,908
It's them, the people.
They make it beautiful.

1373
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,542
And they deserve a leader
who knows that.

1374
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,544
I don't know why
I think it could be me.

1375
01:18:37,678 --> 01:18:39,314
Because it should be you.

1376
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:41,283
You think so?

1377
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:43,685
Does it matter
what I think?

1378
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:54,194
Oh, look at that adorable
monkey down there.

1379
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:55,062
Is that Abu?

1380
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:57,232
No, no,
it couldn't be Abu, he's...

1381
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:05,473
So, how many names
do you have, Prince Aladdin?

1382
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:07,142
No, no, I...

1383
01:19:07,273 --> 01:19:08,442
So who is Prince Ali?

1384
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:11,278
I am Prince Ali.

1385
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:13,315
But how would you
know the city so well?

1386
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:15,150
I came to Agrabah early...

1387
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:16,985
because to know a people,

1388
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,219
you have to see them
for yourself.

1389
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:19,987
But you already
know that.

1390
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:23,391
When we first met,
you were disguised in your own city.

1391
01:19:23,523 --> 01:19:25,225
You saw us arrive

1392
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:28,363
with dancers, an elephant,
and a magic carpet.

1393
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:30,398
How could a street thief
have all that?

1394
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:33,001
But how could I not
recognize you?

1395
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:36,337
People don't see the real you
when you're royalty.

1396
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:42,410
I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassed.

1397
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:45,113
I mean, you've seen
more of Agrabah in days

1398
01:19:45,212 --> 01:19:47,247
than I have
in an entire lifetime.

1399
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:52,086
We should...

1400
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:56,357
probably head back.

1401
01:19:57,757 --> 01:19:59,426
Already?

1402
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:10,270
Until tomorrow, Princess.

1403
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:26,653
Good night.

1404
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:30,692
Good night.

1405
01:20:35,563 --> 01:20:36,598
Yes!

1406
01:20:43,837 --> 01:20:46,174
Fascinating.

1407
01:20:49,343 --> 01:20:50,511
Ooh.

1408
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,614
I like that face.
Good date?

1409
01:20:52,746 --> 01:20:54,049
The best.

1410
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,283
But it was better
than the best.

1411
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:59,486
She figured out I was Aladdin.
You said that wouldn't happen.

1412
01:20:59,586 --> 01:21:03,491
Wow! I mean, genie magic
is really just a facade.

1413
01:21:03,623 --> 01:21:05,193
At some point,

1414
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,694
real character's always
gonna shine through.

1415
01:21:07,827 --> 01:21:09,663
But that's a good thing,
right? Now, she knows.

1416
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:11,266
Well...

1417
01:21:11,398 --> 01:21:12,567
Well, what?

1418
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,701
He told me he was only

1419
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,370
pretending to be a thief
to see the city...

1420
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,238
but he's actually
a prince.

1421
01:21:17,337 --> 01:21:19,607
I convinced her that
I really was a prince.

1422
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:20,774
And you believed him?

1423
01:21:20,907 --> 01:21:22,109
And she believed you?

1424
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,211
I think so.

1425
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:27,515
Eventually, you are going to
have to tell her the truth.

1426
01:21:27,648 --> 01:21:30,618
Eventually,
I will tell her.

1427
01:21:31,352 --> 01:21:34,855
Anyway,
I sort of am a prince now.

1428
01:21:35,322 --> 01:21:36,391
Oh!

1429
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:39,127
So, you're gonna drink
from that cup.

1430
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:42,330
You don't think maybe
you want to believe him...

1431
01:21:42,429 --> 01:21:43,697
because you have to
marry a prince,

1432
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:45,332
but you can't marry a thief?

1433
01:21:45,465 --> 01:21:49,636
No, I believe him. I do.

1434
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:00,314
When the time is right,
I will tell her.

1435
01:22:05,352 --> 01:22:06,354
Morning.

1436
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:08,323
Morning.

1437
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:12,759
Not again.

1438
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:18,800
Please, please.

1439
01:22:19,366 --> 01:22:22,636
Gentlemen, I think there's
been some sort of confusion.

1440
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:24,438
I don't think you know
who I am.

1441
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,707
Oh, no, no.

1442
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,541
I know who you are.

1443
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:29,611
Aladdin.

1444
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,778
Aladdin?

1445
01:22:30,911 --> 01:22:32,212
Aladdin.

1446
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:34,349
I don't know who that is.
I'm Prince Ali...

1447
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,184
- Street rat!
- ...of Ababwa.

1448
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:38,486
Prince from a kingdom
that doesn't exist...

1449
01:22:38,618 --> 01:22:41,389
who now possesses
a magic carpet

1450
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:43,257
from the Cave of Wonders.

1451
01:22:43,389 --> 01:22:44,691
Seems to me, the only way
that's possible...

1452
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:45,759
Where's your monkey?

1453
01:22:45,858 --> 01:22:47,362
...is if you found
a certain treasure.

1454
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:50,597
My treasure.

1455
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,334
Where's the lamp?

1456
01:23:01,474 --> 01:23:03,678
There's clearly been some
sort of misunderstanding.

1457
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,879
I'm Prince Ali.

1458
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:06,915
If I throw you
off of that balcony,

1459
01:23:07,848 --> 01:23:10,350
and you are
who you say you are...

1460
01:23:11,352 --> 01:23:13,421
you will die
a watery death.

1461
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:18,660
If you survive,
it can only be because of the lamp.

1462
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,895
In which case,
I will have my answer.

1463
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:24,799
For the last time...

1464
01:23:29,036 --> 01:23:31,806
where is the lamp?

1465
01:23:31,938 --> 01:23:35,843
Listen to me. I don't know
who you think I am.

1466
01:23:35,975 --> 01:23:37,277
Goodbye, Aladdin.

1467
01:23:37,377 --> 01:23:38,712
No! No!

1468
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:02,903
Hmm.

1469
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:44,978
Boy, what in the...?

1470
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,716
Whoa. Hey, kid, okay.

1471
01:24:48,815 --> 01:24:50,718
I can't get you out of this
unless you make a wish!

1472
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,888
You have to make a wish!
Come on, wake up!

1473
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,457
Okay, try and form the words
"I wish."

1474
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,961
Kid, come on, wake up!
Wake up.

1475
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:02,864
You need to think.
Think, think.

1476
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:04,931
Think.

1477
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,869
Okay, okay!
A little gray area here,

1478
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,004
but it's worth a try.

1479
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:12,640
"I, Aladdin,
being of sound body and mind...

1480
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,776
"declare that my second wish

1481
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,011
"is to be saved
from certain doom."

1482
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:18,913
I took the liberty
to backdate that a day.

1483
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:19,947
I hope you don't mind.

1484
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,948
Yes! Here we go! Come on!

1485
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:35,063
Come on, kid! Come on!
Kid? Kid? Kid, please.

1486
01:25:35,395 --> 01:25:37,799
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up, wake up!

1487
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,634
Kid, wake up.

1488
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:41,803
Please.

1489
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:43,870
Ew.

1490
01:25:46,572 --> 01:25:49,410
Probably could've done that
the other direction, but...

1491
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:54,415
How you doing?

1492
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:56,584
Thanks, Genie.

1493
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:59,821
Hey, no problem, you know.
I was in the neighborhood.

1494
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,888
I thought you said no favors.

1495
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,692
I thought you said no friends.

1496
01:26:05,058 --> 01:26:09,430
Right. Um... It actually
cost you a wish.

1497
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:15,402
Whatever it cost,
you saved my life.

1498
01:26:15,536 --> 01:26:16,671
Yeah, that's true.

1499
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:20,006
I mean, strictly speaking
though, it was a team effort.

1500
01:26:23,743 --> 01:26:24,845
Thank you.

1501
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,882
We have to stop Jafar.

1502
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:30,884
That's not gonna be easy.

1503
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:32,953
The sultan trusts him
completely.

1504
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:35,490
He has everybody fooled.

1505
01:26:37,657 --> 01:26:39,826
Maybe not everyone.

1506
01:26:41,798 --> 01:26:44,031
I overheard Prince Ali
talking to his advisor...

1507
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:46,600
about returning with an army
to conquer Agrabah.

1508
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,635
What?

1509
01:26:47,734 --> 01:26:50,772
Now it appears
he's fled in the night.

1510
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,507
Jasmine.

1511
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:57,144
You heard him
say this, Jafar,

1512
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,479
and you saw him leave?

1513
01:26:58,578 --> 01:26:59,546
Uh-oh.

1514
01:26:59,645 --> 01:27:03,617
Yes, with my own ears
and my own eyes.

1515
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,587
So, what's the problem
now, Princess?

1516
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:09,757
This is the problem, Jafar.

1517
01:27:10,556 --> 01:27:11,858
If what you say is true,

1518
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:14,429
then why is Prince Ali
still here?

1519
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,563
Your Majesty.

1520
01:27:16,563 --> 01:27:18,565
Prince Ali.

1521
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,002
This is a surprise.

1522
01:27:21,101 --> 01:27:23,770
Your Highness,
your advisor's not who he says he is.

1523
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:25,506
Oh.

1524
01:27:25,605 --> 01:27:26,873
I'm not who I say I am?

1525
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:29,844
Baba, he tried
to kill Prince Ali.

1526
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:34,181
Jafar, can you explain
this to me?

1527
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:36,217
Yes.

1528
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,488
My sultan...

1529
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:45,125
you know my loyalty
belongs to you.

1530
01:27:47,794 --> 01:27:49,497
Your loyalty...

1531
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:52,800
Your loyalty...

1532
01:27:53,032 --> 01:27:54,468
Yes.

1533
01:27:56,903 --> 01:28:00,207
Prince Ali, you invited
yourself into our city...

1534
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,777
and we welcomed you
as our guest.

1535
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:06,247
But I believe
your intentions are...

1536
01:28:09,282 --> 01:28:10,817
...deceitful.

1537
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:13,554
You're a grave danger
to Agrabah

1538
01:28:13,653 --> 01:28:14,788
and you shall be
dealt with as such.

1539
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,659
- Baba, what are you saying?
- Enough, Jasmine!

1540
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:22,796
Jafar told me
of Prince Ali's ambition.

1541
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:23,930
His staff.

1542
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,131
He's here
for my throne.

1543
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:26,200
Hakim!

1544
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:37,612
Baba?

1545
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:39,714
What happened?

1546
01:28:39,845 --> 01:28:40,947
He had you under a spell.

1547
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:43,784
He's not to be trusted,
Your Majesty.

1548
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:44,952
He wants your throne.

1549
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:48,288
Jafar! You were
my most trusted advisor.

1550
01:28:49,755 --> 01:28:52,292
Hakim! Put him
in the dungeon!

1551
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:03,270
You should think
about how quickly

1552
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:06,607
the sands of power shift
in a storm, Hakim.

1553
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:12,045
I am loyal to my sultan,
as you should have been.

1554
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,183
The law is the law.

1555
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:36,003
Prince Ali,
I must apologize.

1556
01:29:36,169 --> 01:29:40,741
Well, Your Highness,
there's something I'd like to explain.

1557
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,742
Your honor and integrity

1558
01:29:42,843 --> 01:29:45,746
will never again be
questioned here in Agrabah.

1559
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:47,181
I...

1560
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,849
A more noble
and sincere young man

1561
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:52,219
has never graced
the chambers of this palace.

1562
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:53,354
Well, uh...

1563
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:54,889
- Wow.
- I...

1564
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:58,291
I would be honored
to call you my son...

1565
01:29:58,392 --> 01:29:59,359
Ooh!

1566
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:03,831
...if that were something
anyone wanted.

1567
01:30:04,997 --> 01:30:06,600
So, you got the girl.

1568
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:08,336
I mean, trust me,
I had my doubts

1569
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:10,837
after your whole jam debacle.

1570
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,642
But you pulled yourself
back together a little bit.

1571
01:30:14,774 --> 01:30:15,843
I did, didn't I?

1572
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:17,945
I think I finally got the
hang of being a prince.

1573
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:20,080
Oh, well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

1574
01:30:20,246 --> 01:30:22,816
You were right! People see
what they wanna see.

1575
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,685
Aladdin is gone.
I'm Prince Ali now.

1576
01:30:25,818 --> 01:30:28,755
Wow. Got it all figured out
now, huh, kid?

1577
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:31,092
And, you know, I was thinking
about my last wish...

1578
01:30:31,224 --> 01:30:34,395
and I just can't do this
without you.

1579
01:30:34,728 --> 01:30:36,130
I know I told you
I'd use it to set you free,

1580
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:37,197
but you heard the sultan.

1581
01:30:37,296 --> 01:30:39,800
I can't let everything
we worked for fall apart.

1582
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:42,836
So, you just
never tell her the truth?

1583
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:44,071
You're gonna
keep living the lie?

1584
01:30:44,203 --> 01:30:46,706
It's not a lie.
People can change.

1585
01:30:46,806 --> 01:30:49,175
Oh,
they can change all right.

1586
01:30:50,176 --> 01:30:52,278
And that's a bad thing?

1587
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:54,849
Everything is better now.
No one got hurt.

1588
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,282
You'd rather me be
back on the streets

1589
01:30:56,382 --> 01:30:57,350
stealing to survive?

1590
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:00,254
I thought you'd be
happy for me.

1591
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:02,790
But all you cared about
was that

1592
01:31:02,889 --> 01:31:05,091
I use my last wish
to set you free.

1593
01:31:05,192 --> 01:31:09,330
Well, kid, I don't care
nothin' about that wish.

1594
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:12,867
This is about you,
what's happening to you.

1595
01:31:12,998 --> 01:31:15,935
You'd rather lie
to somebody you love

1596
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:17,438
than give all of this up.

1597
01:31:17,537 --> 01:31:18,906
You don't get it, Genie.

1598
01:31:19,872 --> 01:31:21,942
People like me
don't get anything

1599
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:23,109
except by pretending.

1600
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:27,214
I think maybe
you don't get it.

1601
01:31:27,813 --> 01:31:31,251
The more you gain
by pretending,

1602
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:33,187
the less you're actually
gonna have.

1603
01:31:34,019 --> 01:31:38,459
In 10,000 years,
I have never once, ever...

1604
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:41,261
called a master a friend.

1605
01:31:42,095 --> 01:31:45,266
I broke the rules for you,
I saved your life.

1606
01:31:45,398 --> 01:31:47,068
And for what?

1607
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,270
You are breaking
my heart here, kid.

1608
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,706
You're breaking my heart.

1609
01:31:51,837 --> 01:31:53,239
Genie, no!
Hey, come on!

1611

Master. Lamp.

1612
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:19,032
Who does he think he is?
He's supposed to serve me.

1613
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:21,936
I'm the same as I always was
on the inside. Right, Abu?

1614
01:32:26,572 --> 01:32:27,774
Hey!

1615
01:32:48,995 --> 01:32:50,397
Aah! Are you kidding?

1616
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:52,532
Now, why would you
rub the thing under the...

1617
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:55,102
archway?

Jafar.

1629
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:03,536
You should have left Agrabah
while you had the chance.

1630
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:06,373
Why leave when the city
belongs to me now?

1631
01:34:06,505 --> 01:34:08,975
- It's over, Jafar.
- Oh, good for you.

1632
01:34:09,108 --> 01:34:11,444
I've endured
your spineless incompetence

1633
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:12,613
for long enough now.

1634
01:34:12,946 --> 01:34:15,082
- Hakim.
- Old fool.

1635
01:34:25,692 --> 01:34:26,894
Genie!

1636
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:29,296
For my first wish,

1637
01:34:29,395 --> 01:34:31,965
I wish to be
sultan of Agrabah!

1638
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:33,100
What?

1639
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:35,236
As you wish, Master.

1640
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,303
No!

1641
01:35:11,638 --> 01:35:12,605
Hakim.

1642
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:14,540
Hakim!

1643
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:19,313
You obey the sultan,
so you obey me now.

1644
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:27,087
You know the law, Hakim!

1645
01:35:32,157 --> 01:35:33,160
No.

1646
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:38,431

Hakim.

1649
01:35:44,269 --> 01:35:46,306
Marshal an army
to invade Shirabad.

1650
01:35:46,438 --> 01:35:47,507
- Shirabad!
- You cannot...

1651
01:35:47,606 --> 01:35:49,809
I think we've heard enough
from you, Princess.

1652
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:51,010
It's time you start doing

1653
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:52,179
what you should have done
all along.

1654
01:35:52,278 --> 01:35:53,714
Stay silent.

1655
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:57,318
Guards, remove her!

1656
01:36:01,087 --> 01:36:04,090

Hakim!

1701
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:53,160
Take her away!

1702
01:38:54,894 --> 01:38:56,563
Tell them, Hakim.

1703
01:39:05,505 --> 01:39:08,142
You were just a boy

1704
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,244
when your father
came to work the grounds.

1705
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:12,778
But you have risen up

1706
01:39:12,879 --> 01:39:16,250
to become
our most trusted soldier.

1707
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:19,752
As a man, I know you to be
both loyal and just.

1708
01:39:21,821 --> 01:39:23,323
But now you have to choose.

1709
01:39:24,756 --> 01:39:26,826
Duty isn't always honor.

1710
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,862
Our greatest challenge

1711
01:39:28,961 --> 01:39:31,197
isn't speaking up
against our enemies...

1712
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:35,602
but defying those whose
approval we seek the most.

1713
01:39:36,536 --> 01:39:41,175
Jafar is not worthy of your
admiration nor your sacrifice.

1714
01:39:41,306 --> 01:39:45,211
I wish nothing but glory
for the kingdom of Agrabah.

1715
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:49,183
No. You seek glory
for yourself.

1716
01:39:49,314 --> 01:39:52,352
And you would win it
off the backs of my people!

1717
01:39:53,286 --> 01:39:56,422
Hakim, these men,

1718
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:57,658
they will follow
where you lead...

1719
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,660
but it's up to you.

1720
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,294
Will you stand silent

1721
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:03,429
while Jafar destroys
our beloved kingdom...

1722
01:40:03,595 --> 01:40:05,698
or will you do
what is right...

1723
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:13,674
and stand with the people
of Agrabah?

1724
01:40:25,451 --> 01:40:26,486
My princess.

1725
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,392
Forgive me, my sultan.

1726
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:39,765
Hakim.

1727
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,870
Guards, arrest the vizier!

1728
01:40:45,904 --> 01:40:48,341
Lamp! Rub the lamp.

1729
01:40:48,474 --> 01:40:50,544
So, this is how it will be.

1730
01:40:51,077 --> 01:40:52,813
Not even the title of sultan

1731
01:40:52,912 --> 01:40:54,480
will wake the herd
from their sleep.

1732
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:56,782
I should've known.

1733
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,653
If you won't bow
before a sultan,

1734
01:40:59,752 --> 01:41:01,688
you will cower
before a sorcerer.

1735
01:41:01,821 --> 01:41:03,991
Genie! I wish to become

1736
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:06,026
the most powerful sorcerer
there is!

1737
01:41:07,093 --> 01:41:09,028
As you wish, Master.

1738
01:41:32,751 --> 01:41:35,455
This could be fun.

1739
01:41:37,023 --> 01:41:40,661
Hakim, I had
such big plans for you.

1740
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:43,297
But now...

1741
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:46,867
you are no longer
of any use to me.

1742
01:41:47,632 --> 01:41:49,736
Perhaps your men would like to
follow you to the dungeon.

1743
01:41:52,805 --> 01:41:54,640
You too.

1744
01:41:56,675 --> 01:41:58,044
Prince Ali!

1745
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,416
If it isn't our Prince Ali.

1746
01:42:02,547 --> 01:42:04,951
- Ali!
- Or should I say...

1747
01:42:09,956 --> 01:42:11,425
Aladdin.

1748
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,095
Aladdin.

1749
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:17,698
He's been pretending
the entire time.

1750
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:21,401
An impostor.
There is no Prince Ali.

1751
01:42:21,533 --> 01:42:22,935
There never was.

1752
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:24,904
He's nothing
but a lying thief.

1753
01:42:25,037 --> 01:42:26,073
I'm sorry.

1754
01:42:26,738 --> 01:42:28,107
You're insignificant.

1755
01:42:28,207 --> 01:42:31,077
An irritation I no longer
need to tolerate...

1756
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:33,113
once I ensure
your agonizing death

1757
01:42:33,212 --> 01:42:36,716
by banishing you
to the ends of the earth.

1758
01:42:37,082 --> 01:42:38,085
No!

1759
01:42:57,002 --> 01:42:58,138
No.

1760
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:59,572
No!

1761
01:43:02,841 --> 01:43:03,977
Abu.

1762
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:06,580
Abu!

1763
01:43:09,081 --> 01:43:11,385
I could simply kill you all.

1764
01:43:12,585 --> 01:43:14,587
But that would be
inadequate repayment

1765
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,890
for years of humiliation
and neglect.

1766
01:43:19,425 --> 01:43:22,095
"Remember your place, Jafar."
"You forget yourself, Jafar."

1767
01:43:22,662 --> 01:43:23,463
Jafar.

1768
01:43:23,795 --> 01:43:28,434
No, what you need, Baba,
is to suffer.

1769
01:43:29,202 --> 01:43:30,971
- Like I have suffered.
- Baba?

1770
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:33,073
Would watching me rule
your kingdom be enough?

1771
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:34,507
Stop!

1772
01:43:34,606 --> 01:43:37,109
Or watching my armies
devour your toothless ally?

1773
01:43:37,242 --> 01:43:38,879
Please, make it stop.

1774
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,679
No, the most
suitable punishment

1775
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:41,747
would be to make you watch...

1776
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:44,084
while I take
what you love most.

1777
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:45,552
No. No, please.
Baba.

1778
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:46,952
And marry your daughter.

1779
01:43:47,752 --> 01:43:48,921
No!

1780
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:50,924
No.

1781
01:43:51,724 --> 01:43:54,895
She will never marry you.

1782
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:01,033
Baba.

1783
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:02,169
I will do as you wish!

1784
01:44:03,635 --> 01:44:04,670
Make it stop.

1785
01:44:07,773 --> 01:44:09,709
Make it stop.

1786
01:44:13,313 --> 01:44:16,550
Baba!
Baba, are you all right?

1787
01:44:16,882 --> 01:44:17,983
Jasmine.

1788
01:44:20,752 --> 01:44:21,921
Abu!

1789
01:44:24,122 --> 01:44:25,991
Abu!

1790
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:28,495
Abu!

1791
01:44:40,572 --> 01:44:42,174
Abu.

1792
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:45,178
Are you okay?

1793
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,147
Let's get out of here.

1794
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:48,914
No.

1795
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,781
Your Highness, Sultan,
in honesty and sincerity...

1796
01:45:23,616 --> 01:45:25,185
do you accept
Princess Jasmine...?

1797
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:26,720
Yes.

1798
01:45:26,852 --> 01:45:28,955
Yes, I accept.

1799
01:45:29,087 --> 01:45:30,689
Princess.

1800
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:32,759
Princess Jasmine,

1801
01:45:32,858 --> 01:45:35,594
do you accept the sultan
to be your husband?

1802
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:42,167
Come on, woman.

1803
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:44,304
Accept.

1804
01:45:44,403 --> 01:45:45,571
I...

1805
01:45:50,843 --> 01:45:51,845
Yes?

1806
01:45:52,278 --> 01:45:53,280
I...

1807
01:45:55,648 --> 01:45:56,650
do not!

1808
01:45:56,849 --> 01:45:58,652
The lamp! The lamp!

1809
01:45:58,751 --> 01:45:59,986
Stop her!

1810
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:02,621
No, Jasmine! No!

1811
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:04,724
No! No!

1812
01:46:11,063 --> 01:46:12,565
The lamp! Iago!

1813
01:46:12,898 --> 01:46:14,734
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1814
01:46:26,112 --> 01:46:27,614
Hold on!

1815
01:46:33,285 --> 01:46:34,287
The lamp!

1816
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:36,156
Abu!

1817
01:46:56,809 --> 01:46:58,078
The lamp!

1818
01:47:05,084 --> 01:47:06,353
Carpet, get me up there!

1819
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,223
Abu!

1820
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:16,696
Jump!

1821
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:31,778
No!

1822
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:47,260
You're nothing
without your staff!

1823
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:48,327
Nothing!

1824
01:48:16,522 --> 01:48:17,724
The lamp!

1825
01:48:24,897 --> 01:48:25,931
Carpet!

1826
01:48:38,309 --> 01:48:39,379
Jasmine.

1827
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:45,752
Punish them. Punish them.

1828
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,355
Genie should witness.

1829
01:48:56,595 --> 01:48:57,964
As the old man said...

1830
01:48:58,063 --> 01:49:00,867
you should've left Agrabah
when you had the chance.

1831
01:49:10,975 --> 01:49:13,946
I told you before
to think bigger.

1832
01:49:14,078 --> 01:49:16,116
You could've been the most
powerful man in the room.

1833
01:49:16,447 --> 01:49:18,450
But now I hold the lamp.

1834
01:49:18,584 --> 01:49:20,353
I hold the power.

1835
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:26,326
You can't find
what you're looking for

1836
01:49:26,425 --> 01:49:27,960
in that lamp, Jafar.

1837
01:49:28,093 --> 01:49:30,162
I tried and failed,
and so will you.

1838
01:49:30,295 --> 01:49:32,898
You think so,
but I am sultan!

1839
01:49:33,866 --> 01:49:37,002
I am the greatest sorcerer
the world has ever seen.

1840
01:49:37,169 --> 01:49:41,440
I will create an empire
that history cannot ignore.

1841
01:49:41,573 --> 01:49:45,077
I can destroy cities.

1842
01:49:46,077 --> 01:49:49,081
I can destroy kingdoms.

1843
01:49:54,086 --> 01:49:56,523
And I can destroy you.

1844
01:49:56,622 --> 01:49:57,790
True.

1845
01:49:58,389 --> 01:49:59,959
But who made you a sultan?

1846
01:50:01,126 --> 01:50:02,295
Who made you a sorcerer?

1847
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:05,165
There will
always be something,

1848
01:50:05,264 --> 01:50:07,132
some man, some being...

1849
01:50:07,265 --> 01:50:09,067
- more powerful than you.
- What are you doing?

1850
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:10,804
Genie gave you your power,

1851
01:50:10,903 --> 01:50:12,004
and he can take it away.

1852
01:50:12,136 --> 01:50:13,939
- He serves me!
- For now.

1853
01:50:14,072 --> 01:50:16,075
But you'll never have
more power than the genie.

1854
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:23,516
You said it yourself.

1855
01:50:23,648 --> 01:50:26,486
You're either most powerful
in the room...

1856
01:50:26,586 --> 01:50:28,321
or you're nothing.

1857
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:32,858
You'll always be second.

1858
01:50:33,091 --> 01:50:35,127
Second! Second!

1859
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:39,232
Second?

1860
01:50:39,631 --> 01:50:42,000
Only second?

1861
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:44,504
He serves me!

1862
01:50:46,671 --> 01:50:50,242
I will make sure no one will
ever say these words again.

1863
01:50:50,509 --> 01:50:51,511
Genie!

1864
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:54,413
For my final wish,
I wish to become

1865
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:57,217
the most powerful being
in the universe.

1866
01:50:57,349 --> 01:50:58,985
More powerful than you!

1867
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:04,156
A lot of gray area
in that wish, but, uh...

1868
01:51:04,256 --> 01:51:07,926
most powerful being
in the universe

1869
01:51:08,027 --> 01:51:09,162
coming right up!

1870
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:38,190
The most powerful
in the universe, at last...

1871
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,326
second to no one.

1872
01:51:40,459 --> 01:51:43,328
And I thought
I had power before!

1873
01:51:44,095 --> 01:51:48,667
First, I'll lay waste
to those fools in Shirabad.

1874
01:52:03,983 --> 01:52:05,184
What have you done to me?

1875
01:52:05,317 --> 01:52:07,020
I haven't done anything
to you, Jafar.

1876
01:52:07,152 --> 01:52:08,688
What have you done to me?

1877
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:10,989
This was your wish, not mine.

1878
01:52:12,157 --> 01:52:14,294
A genie might have
phenomenal cosmic powers...

1879
01:52:14,425 --> 01:52:17,129
But an itty-bitty
living space.

1880
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:20,366
You see,
a genie without a master

1881
01:52:20,465 --> 01:52:21,934
goes back in their lamp.

1882
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:25,237
No! Not the lamp!

1883
01:52:27,105 --> 01:52:28,707
I will not forget you, boy!

1884
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:30,276
Mark my words,

1885
01:52:30,376 --> 01:52:32,478
I will not forget
what you have done to me!

1886
01:52:32,611 --> 01:52:33,613
Goodbye, Jafar!

1887
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:36,281
Parrot! You're coming with me!

1888
01:52:36,581 --> 01:52:39,184
No!

1889
01:52:54,632 --> 01:52:56,001
Baba.

1890
01:52:56,135 --> 01:52:57,403
- Baba.
- Come on.

1891
01:52:57,502 --> 01:52:59,471
Couple thousand years
in the Cave of Wonders

1892
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:00,672
ought to cool you off.

1893
01:53:12,151 --> 01:53:14,487
Wait. Wait.

1894
01:53:14,653 --> 01:53:16,622
How can I ever thank you?

1895
01:53:17,156 --> 01:53:20,560
Oh, no. No,
you don't need to thank me.

1896
01:53:21,059 --> 01:53:23,495
But I hope
you accept my apology.

1897
01:53:23,629 --> 01:53:26,532
I'm sorry to the both of you.

1898
01:53:27,265 --> 01:53:28,701
Especially you.

1899
01:53:28,834 --> 01:53:32,171
You deserve so much.

1900
01:53:33,371 --> 01:53:35,273
We all make mistakes.

1901
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:39,760
Aladdin?

1902
01:53:43,215 --> 01:53:45,318
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1903
01:53:51,156 --> 01:53:53,526
Ooh, that's a bit
of a mess there, Abu.

1904
01:53:53,658 --> 01:53:55,161
Let me take care
of that for you.

1905
01:54:02,733 --> 01:54:04,202
Beautiful.

1906
01:54:04,303 --> 01:54:05,404
Uh-uh-uh.

1907
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:07,806
No, no long faces, all right?

1908
01:54:08,139 --> 01:54:10,108
I got an idea.
All right?

1909
01:54:10,209 --> 01:54:11,644
This is your last wish.

1910
01:54:11,777 --> 01:54:14,413
Royalty was
the right idea, okay?

1911
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:16,181
We should just
riff on that a little bit.

1912
01:54:16,314 --> 01:54:17,750
All right,
here's what I'm thinking.

1913
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:21,754
Aladdin, warrior prince,

1914
01:54:21,854 --> 01:54:25,625
a noble heart in a land
where thieves run feral!

1915
01:54:26,425 --> 01:54:29,696
Jasmine!

1916
01:54:29,795 --> 01:54:30,797
You like it?

1917
01:54:31,831 --> 01:54:34,367
No? Okay, all right.
I hear you loud and clear.

1918
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,202
All right.
But this is what you need.

1919
01:54:36,335 --> 01:54:39,404
The governing laws of Agrabah
by royal decree.

1920
01:54:39,537 --> 01:54:41,607
Okay? And here it is.

1921
01:54:41,739 --> 01:54:43,643
"Must marry a prince."

1922
01:54:43,774 --> 01:54:45,812
Right.
But you say the words...

1923
01:54:45,912 --> 01:54:49,182
and this law just,
kinda like, goes away.

1924
01:54:49,313 --> 01:54:52,551
And you and the princess
are in it together forever.

1925
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:54,720
You can just make
the law disappear?

1926
01:54:54,819 --> 01:54:57,590
Pfft! Please.
Like it never existed.

1927
01:54:58,924 --> 01:55:00,859
All right.
Last wish, let's get it.

1928
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:03,863
Okay. Last wish.

1929
01:55:05,496 --> 01:55:06,498
Genie?

1930

Um...

1950
01:56:27,712 --> 01:56:31,317
Actually,
there is this handmaiden...

1951
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:36,255
that I would love
to travel the world with.

1952
01:56:38,357 --> 01:56:39,559
If she'll have me.

1953
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,930
When do we leave?
Also, I want children.

1954

<i>Lian and Omar,

<i>We'll have a boat.</i>

1960

<i>and magnificent sails.</i>

1962
01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:01,980

more of a smaller one.

01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:03,248
Perfect.

1964

Perfect.

1965
01:57:05,584 --> 01:57:07,553
Sit with me, my child.

1966
01:57:08,787 --> 01:57:09,889
I'm sorry.

1967
01:57:09,988 --> 01:57:12,724

- Please, let me finish.

1968
01:57:13,524 --> 01:57:17,996
I feared losing you.
Like I lost your mother.

1969
01:57:18,596 --> 01:57:23,702
All I saw was my little girl,
not the woman you have become.

1970
01:57:23,934 --> 01:57:28,673
You have shown me
courage and strength.

1971
01:57:28,806 --> 01:57:33,612
You are the future of Agrabah.

1972

You shall be the next sultan.

1973

01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,903
And as sultan,
you may change the law.

1975
01:58:00,404 --> 01:58:01,907
He is a good man.

1976

Where'd he go?

1977
01:58:38,577 --> 01:58:41,614
Stop, thief.
Your sultan commands it.

1978
01:58:46,117 --> 01:58:47,486
Sultan?

1979
01:58:49,153 --> 01:58:51,424
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

1980
01:58:54,593 --> 01:58:56,696
