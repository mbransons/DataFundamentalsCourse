1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,310


3
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,822
Not that one.

4
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,709
The next.

5
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:04,341
How am I to bear it
when you are gone?

6
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:07,062
I am going only
half a mile, Emma.

7
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,277
But great is
the difference between

8
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,960
a Mrs. Weston half a mile away
and a Miss Taylor in the house.

9
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,151
Dear Emma.

10
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,981
You have been a friend

11
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:27,797
and companion
such as few possess.

12
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,301
A governess in office, but...

13
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,621
...little short of a mother
in affection.

14
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:36,789
I wish you every happiness
on your wedding day.

15
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,630
<i>Poor Miss Taylor!</i>

16
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:50,167
It's a pity Mr. Weston
ever thought of her.

17
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,773
Papa, Mr. Weston is
such a good-humored,

18
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,150
pleasant, excellent man.

19
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,942
He thoroughly deserves
a good wife.

20
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,509
And you would not have had
Miss Taylor

21
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,822
live with us forever
when she might have had

22
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,486
- a house of her own.
- "A house of her own."

23
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:03,798
Where is the advantage
of a house of her own?

24
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,718
This is...

25
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,576
three times as large.

26
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:10,485
It's entirely unnecessary.

27
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,245
Poor Miss Taylor.
Poor Isabella.

28
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,877
My sister married
seven years ago, Papa.

29
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,797
You must be
reconciled to it by now.

30
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,727
That was a terrible day.

31
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,397
It shall always be
a matter of great joy to me

32
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,189
that I made the match myself.

33
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:33,525
Everyone said Mr. Weston
would never marry again,

34
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,285
but I did not believe it.

35
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:37,845
Emma, you should not make
matches or foretell things.

36
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,245
Whatever you say
always comes to pass.

37
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,230
You must not make any more.

38
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:45,589
I promise to make none
for myself, Papa.

39
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:47,702
But I must indeed
for other people.

40
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,486
It is the greatest amusement
in the world.

41
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,598
And after such success,
you know.

42
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:07,062
Miss Bates. Mrs. Bates.

43
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:08,789
Miss Gilbert. Mrs. Cox.

44
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,742
Mr. Woodhouse, sir.
Miss Woodhouse.

45
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,720
- Mr. Cole, Mrs. Cole.
- Good morning.

46
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,424
M-Miss Woodhou...

47
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,207
M-Miss Woodhouse.

48
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,926
Morning.

49
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,813
Is this not the most happy...

50
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:32,054
happy, the-the most fortunate?

51
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,744
This morning, I could not get
my bonnet on for trembling.

52
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:36,725
Hmm.

53
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,605
Surrounded by blessings.

54
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,453
Wanting for nothing.

55
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,181
I am trembling again.

56
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,351
It is <i>too</i> joyful!

57
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:50,869
What is it, Emma?

58
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,205
I have a fancy
that Mr. Weston's son

59
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,965
- may surprise us.
- Frank Weston?

60
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,302
He's Frank Churchill now, Papa.

61
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,902
He's his uncle's heir.

62
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,142
When he came of age,
he took his uncle's name.

63
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,349
I so long to meet him.

64
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,269
But how do you know
he might surprise us?

65
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,478
It is his father's wedding day.

66
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,389
Mr. Weston speaks of him
so highly.

67
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,151
I cannot doubt
that he will come.

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,496
Poor Miss Taylor.

69
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,150
Dearly beloved friends,

70
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:47,030
we gather here
in the sight of God

71
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:51,317
to join together this man
and this woman

72
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,397
in holy matrimony,

73
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,405
an honorable estate
instituted by God

74
00:06:56,407 --> 00:07:00,501
in this time of...
of man's great inno-cence.

75
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,296
"Inno-cence"?

76
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,174
Innocence.

77
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,837
No?

78
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,629
Well...

79
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,791
Mmm.

80
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:23,287
Mother, you must eat.
It is impolite not to eat.

81
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,078
I was just telling Mrs....

82
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:37,077
You know what
I'm about to say, sir.

83
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,797
"Why do you keep a carriage
if you never put it out?"

84
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,261
It's just such a shame
to see it standing by.

85
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:43,925
A gentleman on foot--

86
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,717
- it's unusual.
- Unusual.

87
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,967
Good evening, Mrs. Reynolds.

88
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:26,133
At last.

89
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:28,024
Mr. Knightley.

90
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,054
You must have had
a shocking walk.

91
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,549
Not at all, sir.
It's a beautiful evening.

92
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:36,854
You must have found it
very damp and dirty.

93
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,613
Dirty, sir?

94
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,277
Look at my shoes.

95
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,525
Not a speck on them.

96
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,638
How do you do?

97
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,462
I came to wish you joy.

98
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:46,742
Joy?

99
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,086
Oh, the wedding.

100
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,133
What a terrible day.

101
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,198
So, how did you all behave?
Who cried the most?

102
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,693
We all behaved charmingly.

103
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,613
Everybody was in
their best looks.

104
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,365
Not a tear, and hardly
a long face to be seen.

105
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,838
Bring the screen
a little closer.

106
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,781
Mr. Knightley feels a chill.

107
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:07,189
And what of
Mr. Frank Churchill?

108
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,277
Is he every bit as handsome

109
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,456
as his father
promised he would be?

110
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,271
He did not come?

111
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,030
You see, he wished
exceedingly to come,

112
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,854
but his aunt and uncle
could not spare him.

113
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,669
Well, I dare say
he might have come if he could.

114
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,654
I do not know why
you should say so.

115
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:32,342
If Frank Churchill had wanted
to attend his father's wedding,

116
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:34,005
he would have contrived it.

117
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,925
He... he chose not to come.

118
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,877
You've never met
Mr. Frank Churchill.

119
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,085
We do not know what he is able
or unable to do.

120
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,933
There is one thing, Emma,
which a man can always do

121
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,045
if he chooses,
and that is his duty.

122
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,934
It is Frank Churchill's <i>duty</i>

123
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,725
to pay this attention
to his father.

124
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,349
He also has a <i>duty</i> to his aunt,
who is unwell.

125
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,269
Mrs. Churchill has been unwell

126
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:55,382
for as long
as she could say so.

127
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,237
Her nephew is not a doctor.

128
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,414
If he had told her simply
and resolutely that he...

129
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,189
...that he must
attend his father's wedding,

130
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:05,270
there would have been
no opposition to his going.

131
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:07,605
You are the worst judge
in the world, Mr. Knightley,

132
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:09,045
of the difficulties
of dependence.

133
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,902
You've always been
your own master.

134
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,685
You've no idea what it is
to have tempers to manage.

135
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,406
I shall remember that
next time you quarrel with me.

136
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,014
There is a new
parlor boarder, Papa,

137
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,934
at Mrs. Goddard's school.

138
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,501
- Miss Smith.
- There.

139
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,325
Distinctly.

140
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:03,861
Do you feel it?
A chill draft.

141
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,462
A chill and sickly draft.

142
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,221
She's a natural child.

143
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:10,005
Nobody knows her parentage,
not even Miss Smith herself.

144
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:11,863
Is that not mysterious?

145
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,623
Miss Taylor would have felt it.

146
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,558
The misfortune of your birth,
Harriet,

147
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,438
ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates.

148
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,029
There can be no doubt of your
being a gentleman's daughter.

149
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:01,173
You must support your claim
to that station

150
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,095
by everything
within your power.

151
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,837
Know you the Martins,
Miss Woodhouse,

152
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,342
of Abbey Mill Farm?

153
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,613
I know that they are
tenant farmers.

154
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,471
They rent their farm
from Mr. Knightley.

155
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,373
They were ever so kind to me
this summer.

156
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,357
Thank you.

157
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:21,525
When I went away,
Mrs. Martin was so very kind

158
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,247
as to send Mrs. Goddard
a beautiful goose.

159
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,984
The finest goose Mrs. Goddard
had ever seen, she said.

160
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,894
The Martins are of precisely
the order of people

161
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,709
with whom I feel
I can have nothing to do.

162
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:40,725
A degree or two lower
might interest me.

163
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,902
If they were very poor,
I might hope to be

164
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:45,206
useful to them
in some way, but...

165
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,702
a farmer can need
none of my help

166
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:50,327
and is therefore as much above
my notice as he is below it.

167
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,109
Mr. Robert Martin went

168
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,094
three miles one day
to bring me walnuts

169
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,749
because he knew
how fond I was of them.

170
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,934
I believe he's very clever.

171
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,469
He understands everything.

172
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,389
Come.

173
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,982
After tea, we shall call on
my dear Mrs. Weston.

174
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:07,542
We promised we should be
seeing one another every day.

175
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,918
It was
a beautiful service, Mr. Elton.

176
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,702
I'm not the first
to visit you this morning.

177
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,645
You are no less welcome
for being the second.

178
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,496
Mr. Elton, Miss Harriet Smith.

179
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,430
It is my great honor.

180
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:43,190
Harriet,
you must sit over there

181
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,110
so that you may admire
the view of Enscombe.

182
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:47,637
Mr. Frank Churchill
is the artist.

183
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,822
I have heard it described as

184
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,486
one of the finest houses
in Yorkshire.

185
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:52,277
I have heard the same.

186
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,189
And Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

187
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,405
He is very fortunate.

188
00:14:56,407 --> 00:15:00,245
There is such symmetry
between us.

189
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,805
We both lost our mothers
when we were very young.

190
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,717
And he has his aunt
to care for, as I have Papa.

191
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:09,557
But how can we admire
a painted beauty

192
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,421
with such... loveliness
before us in the flesh?

193
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,189
Mr. Elton is
such a good-humored man.

194
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,109
So cheerful and obliging.

195
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,062
And gentle.

196
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,751
I think very well of Mr. Elton.

197
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,974
I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse,

198
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,789
that you should not be
going to be married.

199
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,285
So charming as you are.

200
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,582
I have none of the usual
inducements of women to marry.

201
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,373
Fortune I do not want.

202
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,197
Employment I do not want.

203
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,213
Consequence I do not want.

204
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,909
I believe few married women

205
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,085
are half as much mistress
of their husband's house

206
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:53,655
as I am of Hartfield.

207
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,944
You must come again tomorrow.

208
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,557
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.

209
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,391
Thank you.

Miss Woodhouse,
which do you prefer?

217
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,542
They are practically identical.

218
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:36,086
Of course, if the dark
gets dirty, it would not show.

219
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,229
- But the light...
- The dark, then.

220
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,831
The light is
a good deal prettier.

221
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,549
Miss Woodhouse, what's the matter?

222
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,597
Miss Woodhouse.

223
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,653
Miss Woodhouse.

224
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:50,870
How do you do?

225
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,696
And you, Miss Smith.

226
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:55,701
I saw you through the window.

227
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,237
I saw you through the window.

228
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,485
Miss Woodhouse,
I bring happy news.

229
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,949
We have had a letter
this very morning

230
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,390
from my niece, Jane Fairfax.

231
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,341
I hope that she is well.

232
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:07,605
In normal course, she writes
on a Tuesday, but today was...

233
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:08,918
Oh, her health.

234
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,725
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you are
so very kind to inquire.

235
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,805
Poor Jane. She was at Weymouth

236
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,662
with Colonel Campbell
and, uh...

237
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:18,389
Oh, where is the letter?

238
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:21,109
Oh. Oh, it must not be far off.

239
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:22,550
Oh, such an unexpected...

240
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:25,013
Oh, it's on the glove stand.

241
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,542
It was with the gloves.
It was with the gloves.

242
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:30,005
Yes, at Weymouth with Colonel Campbell

243
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,085
and his wife
and Jane's dear friend,

244
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,070
Miss Campbell,
who is recently married.

245
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:35,925
She's Mrs. Dixon now.

246
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,782
And, oh, dear, Mr. Dixon,

247
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,381
who is the most charming
young man,

248
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:42,678
rendered to Jane
a great service in recent days.

249
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,005
They were... Oh, too pretty.
That is...

250
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:50,133
Yes, they were out in a part...
oh, in a party on the water,

251
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,013
and Jane, by the sudden
whirling around

252
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:55,925
of something or other
in the sails,

253
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,974
would have been dashed
to the sea at once...

254
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,749
...and actually all but gone.

255
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:05,750
But Mr. Dixon, with
the greatest presence of mind,

256
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:10,965
caught hold of her habit
and saved her life.

257
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,165
Oh, to think that poor Jane
may have perished.

258
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,942
I cannot think of it
without shaking, she an orphan.

259
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,565
I am very pleased that
Miss Fairfax was not harmed.

260
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,030
How gratified Jane will be
to know that she has

261
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:25,814
such dear, devoted friends.

262
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,702
Heaven forbid that I should
ever bore anybody

263
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,654
half as much about
all the Knightleys together

264
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,670
as Miss Bates does
about Jane Fairfax.

265
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,077
One is sick of the very name
"Jane Fairfax."

266
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,254
Every letter from her
is read 40 times over.

267
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,270
And if she does but knit
a pair of garters,

268
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:44,150
one hears of nothing else
for a whole month.

269
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,824
It is Robert Martin.

270
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,103
Good boy.

271
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,205
- Miss Smith.
- Mr. Martin.

272
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:12,597
- Lovely to see you, Miss Smith.
- Goodbye.

273
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:20,630
Only think of
our happening to meet him.

274
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:22,325
Well, Miss Woodhouse?

275
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,405
Is he like what you expected?

276
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:27,318
What do you think of him?

277
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,877
I had no right to expect much,

278
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,669
and indeed,
I did not expect much,

279
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,998
but I had imagined him,
I confess,

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,421
a degree or two nearer...

281
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,311
gentility.

282
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,382
To be sure...

283
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:47,159
he's not so genteel
as to a real gentleman.

284
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,437
Mm-hmm.

285
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:03,573
I do hope
Mr. Woodhouse is not ill.

286
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,397
Oh, no.

287
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:08,534
Oh, Papa sees Mr. Perry
every day.

288
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:10,454
I know I disappoint him
awfully.

289
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,374
I'm so seldom indisposed.

290
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,294
If he does not invent
an illness for me,

291
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,767
I hardly figure in his letters.

292
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,158
Truly...

293
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,222
you are the very picture
of good health, Miss Woodhouse.

294
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,653
Mrs. Martin thinks you
the most handsome woman

295
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,215
in all of Highbury.

296
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,621
You must never
flatter me in front of

297
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,126
Mr. Knightley, Harriet.

298
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,398
He thinks me
vain enough already.

299
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,893
I do not think you
personally vain.

300
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,174
Considering how
very handsome you are,

301
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,743
you seem little occupied
with it.

302
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,423
Your vanity lies
a different way.

303
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:57,464
Did I tell you what Mr. Elton
said of you the other day?

304
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,071
He called you...

305
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,198
..."loveliness itself."

306
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,262
It-it seems to me

307
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:13,461
his manners are rather softer
than they used to be,

308
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:16,022
and I rather wonder
whether he means

309
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,326
to ingratiate himself with you.

310
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,461
Morning, Mrs. Goddard.

311
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,189
- Good morning, Mr. Elton.
- Girls.

312
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:30,007
Quickly now.

313
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,645
These are exquisitely done,
Miss Woodhouse.

314
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,661
You have a charming talent.

315
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,773
I dare say
there is merit in them,

316
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,142
in the least finished
perhaps the most.

317
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:02,742
So Mr. Knightley tells me,

318
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:04,694
and he finds fault
in everything I do.

319
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:09,206
Did you ever have
your likeness taken, Harriet?

320
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,053
Oh... no.

321
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:15,861
What an exquisite possession
a good picture of her would be.

322
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:17,047
It would indeed.

323
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,669
It would indeed.

324
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,982
Let me entreat you,
Miss Woodhouse.

325
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,637
Now, at once.

326
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,790
You have given Miss Smith...

327
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,670
all that she requires.

328
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,621
She was a beautiful creature
when she came to you,

329
00:22:57,623 --> 00:23:00,245
but the attractions
you have added are

330
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:03,861
infinitely superior
to what she received from...

331
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:04,917
nature.

332
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:05,846
It's depressing for me

333
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:07,221
- to have to take care of it, you know?
- No.

334
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:08,246
- Well, quite.
- Take over.

335
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:09,974
Mr. Woodhouse,
your daughter's gifts

336
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:12,405
are without compare.

337
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,263
Bear witness.

338
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,191
Mm. You've made her
too tall, Emma.

339
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:22,197
Uh, no.

340
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:24,213
No, certainly not too tall.

341
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:26,165
Not in the least too tall.

342
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:30,005
Mm, mm, yes.
It is very... pretty.

343
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,862
When it is finished,
you must have it framed.

344
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:35,222
Allow me.

345
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,782
Trust me with this commission,
Miss Woodhouse,

346
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:41,269
and I will ride to London
the moment I am asked.

347
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,680
It would be my great honor.

348
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,374
I cannot have a moment's doubt.

349
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,839
It is exactly as I planned.

350
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:54,104
He's in love with you.

351
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:00,469
I do not know
what your opinion may be,

352
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,645
Mrs. Weston, of this great...

353
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:05,269
intimacy between Emma
and Harriet Smith,

354
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,902
but I think it a bad thing.

355
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,565
How differently we feel.

356
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:11,157
Miss Smith knows nothing
about herself

357
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,336
and looks upon Emma
as knowing everything.

358
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,174
Her ignorance
is hourly flattery.

359
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,062
But educating Harriet
will be an inducement

360
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,757
for Emma to educate herself.

361
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,909
They will read together.

362
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,509
Emma has been meaning
to read more

363
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,461
ever since she was
12 years old.

364
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,062
She never would submit
to anything

365
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,821
requiring industry
and patience.

366
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,453
I cannot allow you to be

367
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,213
a judge in this matter,
Mr. Knightley.

368
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:34,005
You are so used to live alone,

369
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:37,302
you do not know the value
of a companion.

370
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:39,797
Well, she always declares
that she will never marry,

371
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,677
which, of course,
means just nothing at all.

372
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,949
I should like to see
Emma in love

373
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,541
and in some doubt of a return.

374
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:49,431
It would do her good.

Always buy out of season,
Mr. Martin, whenever you can.

Mr. Knightley, sir,
forgive my liberty,

388
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:32,056
but may I be so bold
as to seek your advice?

389
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,383
Of course.

390
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,638
Miss Woodhouse!

391
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,462
You will never guess
what has happened.

392
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:43,415
Robert Martin
has offered me his hand.

393
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,991
He writes as if
he really loves me very much.

394
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,855
Is it a good letter?

395
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,894
Or too short?

396
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:01,653
It is a very good letter.

397
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:04,694
So good I think one of his
sisters must have helped him.

398
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,582
But what shall I say?

399
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,173
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
do advise me.

400
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:10,454
Oh, no, no, no.

401
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:12,151
The words must be your own.

402
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,295
You think I ought
to refuse him.

403
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,325
I lay it down
as a general rule, Harriet,

404
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:37,398
that if a woman doubts whether
she should accept a man or not,

405
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,703
she certainly ought
to refuse him.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,911
Perhaps... it is safer.

407
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,749
Do you think
I had better say no?

408
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:52,469
Not for the world
would I advise you either way.

409
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:55,319
You must be the best judge
of your own happiness.

410
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,621
I have now...

411
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:11,608
quite determined...

412
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,439
...and really almost
made up my mind...

413
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,494
...to...

414
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,991
refuse Mr. Martin.

415
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,102
<i>Refused?</i>

416
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,982
Then she is a greater simpleton
than I ever believed her.

417
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,182
Harriet Smith
refuse Robert Martin?

418
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:37,845
I...

419
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:39,477
I hope you are mistaken.

420
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,982
I saw her answer.

421
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,229
Nothing could be clearer.

422
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:43,445
You saw her answer?

423
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:45,590
You wrote her answer.
This is your doing.

424
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:47,989
Emma, you persuaded her
to refuse him.

425
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:50,997
Well, if I did, I should not
feel that I had done wrong.

426
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:52,789
Mr. Martin's
a respectable young man,

427
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,709
but I cannot admit him
to be Harriet's equal.

428
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:57,942
No, indeed, he is her superior
in both sense and situation.

429
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,950
Emma, your infatuation
about that girl blinds you.

430
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,317
What are Harriet Smith's
claims, either of

431
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,525
birth, nature or education,
to any connection

432
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,125
higher than Robert Martin?
She is the natural daughter

433
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:08,309
- of nobody knows whom.
- There can scarcely be a doubt

434
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,037
that her father is a gentleman,
and a gentleman of fortune!

435
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,189
Probably no settled provision
at all, and certainly

436
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,917
- no respectable relations!
- Her allowance is very liberal.

437
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,997
Nothing has been grudged
for her improvement.

438
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,109
She is known only as a parlor
boarder at a common school.

439
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:19,029
She is pretty,
and she is good-tempered,

440
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,621
- and that is all.
- That is all?

441
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:23,990
These are not trivial
recommendations, Mr. Knightley.

442
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:25,718
Till men do fall in love

443
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,830
with well-informed minds
instead of handsome faces,

444
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,397
a girl with such loveliness
as Harriet

445
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,221
has a certainty
of being admired

446
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,630
and sought after
wherever she goes.

447
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:34,581
I am very much mistaken
if your sex, in general,

448
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,117
would not find these qualities

449
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,365
the highest claims
a woman could possess.

450
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,085
Upon my word, Emma,

451
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,102
to hear you abusing
the reason you have

452
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,661
is almost enough
to make me think so, too.

453
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:45,974
Better to be
without sense altogether

454
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,896
than to misapply it as you do.

455
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:57,237
Men of sense
do not want silly wives.

456
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:00,021
And more prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience

457
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,102
and disgrace that
they might be involved in

458
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:05,174
when the mystery of her
parentage came to be revealed.

459
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,158
Let her marry Robert Martin,

460
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,653
and she is safe
and respectable forever.

461
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,894
But if you teach her
to expect to marry greatly,

462
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,645
nobody within her reach will
ever be good enough for her.

463
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:18,261
Your plans for Harriet are
best known only to yourself.

464
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:21,494
But as you make no secret
of your love of matchmaking,

465
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:24,342
it is fair to suppose
the plans you have.

466
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:27,797
And as a friend...

467
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,045
I shall just hint to you

468
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,965
that if Elton is
the man that I think,

469
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,629
it will be your labor in vain.

470
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:35,958
He knows that he is
a very handsome young man

471
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,941
and-and a great favorite
wherever he goes,

472
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,702
but from his general
way of talking

473
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:41,493
when there are
only men present,

474
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,605
I'm convinced that he does not
mean to throw himself away.

475
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,269
I'm very much obliged to you

476
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:47,285
for opening my eyes,
Mr. Knightley,

477
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:50,071
but know that I am done with
matchmaking for the present.

478
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:54,071
I only want to keep Harriet
for myself.

479
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:40,085
It's so beautiful!

480
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:42,967
You certainly spared
no expense.

00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:55,125
...me to do all

484
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:56,213
- the disciplinary action to the children.
- You must...

485
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,365
- It is utterly unfair.
- You, it is your responsibility

486
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,285
and your responsibility to
teach the baby to drink milk...

487
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,374
It is not only
my responsiility.

488
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:01,302
...without spilling it
all over my favorite trousers.

489
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:02,837
That is the nurse's
responsibility, not...

490
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,869
Emma, they're here.

491
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,597
That was unendurable.

492
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,423
Husband, comport yourself.

493
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:18,197
- Papa.
- Isabella.

494
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,382
Emma.

495
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,621
I shall always
be sorry you went to the sea

496
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,061
this autumn
instead of coming here.

497
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:24,117
But why should you
be sorry, sir?

498
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,269
It did us a great deal of good.

499
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,861
On the contrary, Mr. John
Knightley looks far from well.

500
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:28,949
Southend was
strenuously recommended

501
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,069
by our physician, sir.

502
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,190
Sea air and sea bathing.

503
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,110
The sea is rarely of use
to anybody.

504
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:34,549
It nearly killed me once.

505
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:35,702
Come.

506
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:37,878
I must beg you
not to speak of the sea.

507
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,509
Makes me miserable.

508
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,654
And envious--
I who have never seen it.

509
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:42,902
Mr. Wingfield specified
that Southend

510
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,534
was the best place to go
for the family.

511
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,197
Perhaps you
should change your physician.

512
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,253
He was
recommended by my husband.

513
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,430
Cornwall
might have been forgivable,

514
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:50,901
but Southend?

515
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,919
Let us be friends.

516
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:01,878
Aw.

517
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:07,349
Tell your aunt, little Emma,
that she was very wrong

518
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,943
and she ought to set you
a better example.

519
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:13,877
- Oh.
- Wh...

520
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,861
- What is the matter? Is there fever?
- Uh...

521
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:16,886
Uh...

522
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:18,837
Where is the nurse?
Give her to me.

523
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,989
- Is she feverish?
- I do not know.

524
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:20,822
I-I do not know.
Wh-Where is the nurse?!

525
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:23,862
- Send for Perry.
- Do not send for Perry.

526
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:25,557
Send for Perry!

527
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,527
As death follows life...

528
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:43,862
Mm.

529
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:46,679
Yes.

530
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:53,271
As... far as
good intentions went, um...

531
00:32:54,616 --> 00:32:56,536
...we were both in the right.

532
00:32:59,255 --> 00:33:01,847
I must admit, I have not yet
been proved wrong.

533
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,623
Mr. Knightley.

534
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:19,063
Was Mr. Martin
very disappointed?

535
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,336
A man cannot be more so.

536
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,005
Miss Woodhouse is coming.

537
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,471
Miss Woodhouse.

538
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:02,774
Harriet!

539
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,525
Miss Woodhouse!

540
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:10,005
You're so, uh... disheveled.

541
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,213
I'm always ill at Christmas.

542
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:13,941
Get back in bed at once.

543
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,629
You'll miss the party
at Randalls.

544
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,549
Mr. Elton will be there.

545
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:24,501
And Frank Churchill
is expected at last.

546
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:28,215
And Mr. Elton's sermon.

547
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,391
A sermon on Christmas Day.

548
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:42,198
I transcribe them every Sunday.

549
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:49,461
I will transcribe it for you.

550
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,511
You are so kind to me,
Miss Woodhouse.

551
00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:59,157
Welcome!

552
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,365
Welcome, my friends!

553
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:05,045
Welcome!

554
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,773
Mr. Elton.

555
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:08,181
How's poor Miss Smith?

556
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,782
Oh, no better, I'm afraid.

557
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,693
Aw, such a sad loss
to our party today.

558
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,645
Miss Smith has sent
her apologies.

559
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:17,143
She will be missed
every moment.

560
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,063
Ooh.

561
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,005
How are the children?

562
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,222
Multiplying.

563
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:25,398
My only moment's rest
is in the office.

564
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,821
Frank has been detained
at Enscombe, I'm sorry to say.

565
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:29,717
Oh.

566
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,024
I had a letter from him
just this morning.

567
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:40,437
Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

568
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,902
I have heard it described
as one of the finest houses

569
00:35:42,904 --> 00:35:44,661
in Yorkshire.

570
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,229
Going out in dismal weather

571
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,318
to return probably in worse.

572
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,261
Four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing

573
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:55,862
but to convey five idle...

574
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,782
Another fine,
flourishing letter

575
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:00,469
full of professions
and falsehoods?

576
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:02,421
Your feelings are singular.

577
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:05,269
His letters seem to
satisfy everybody else.

578
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:09,045
I suspect they do not
satisfy Mrs. Weston.

579
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,358
Were she a person
of consequence herself,

580
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,925
he would have come by now,
I daresay.

581
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,901
You seem determined
to think ill of him.

582
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,757
I should be as ready
to acknowledge his merits

583
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,029
- as any other man, but...
- I hear of none

584
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:21,589
except that he is well grown
and good-looking.

585
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,702
Well, if he has nothing else
to recommend him,

586
00:36:23,704 --> 00:36:25,429
he shall be a treasure
at Highbury.

587
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:28,598
We do not often look
upon fine young men.

588
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,542
Cannot ask for all the virtues
into the bargain.

589
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:33,494
You will excuse my being
so much overpowered.

590
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,414
We are both prejudiced.

591
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,941
You against, I for him.
And we shall have

592
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:39,893
no chance of agreeing
until he is really here.

593
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:41,270
Prejudiced?

594
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:42,933
I'm not prejudiced.

595
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,918
Yes, but I am.

596
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,733
Very much, and without at all
being ashamed of it.

597
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,685
My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston

598
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:52,375
gives me a decided prejudice
in his favor.

599
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,302
Charming Miss Woodhouse.

600
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,029
Mr. Weston.

601
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,637
Mrs. Churchill
rules at Enscombe.

602
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,749
Ev-Everything...

603
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,541
gives way to her.

604
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:37,589
She has decreed that if Frank

605
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,798
does not marry
a lady of some fortune,

606
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,229
then he will be entirely
cut out from her will.

607
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,574
There is jealousy.

608
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:46,069
She is jealous even
of his regard for his father.

609
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,189
Jealousy...

610
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:49,077
But she is so very fond
of her nephew.

611
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,765
- He is her particular favorite.
- Dear Emma.

612
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,877
Do not attempt,
with your good nature,

613
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:55,669
to understand a bad one.

614
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,688
You must let it go its own way.

615
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,462
Uh, I have heard it described

616
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:08,342
as one of the finest houses
in Yorksh...

617
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,214
Mm. What seasonable weather
we're having.

618
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:18,871
I dare say we shall
have snow tonight.

619
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:22,581
Snow? Tonight?

620
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,925
When did it commence?

621
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,653
We shall call
for the carriage right away.

622
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,349
It has hardly begun--
barely an inch--

623
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:29,301
but it is falling fast.

624
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,645
It was snowing
when your mother died.

625
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,862
Oh, Papa, I know.
We shall get you home.

626
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:32,886
Well, what is to be done? Emma!

627
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:34,325
There is room for us all.

628
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:35,925
We have accommodation
for all of you.

629
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,013
Absolutely.

630
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,165
The horses are in
good condition.

631
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:39,254
I do admire
your resolution, sir,

632
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:40,149
venturing out
in such weather...

633
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,230
There's nothing we can do.
It is snowing.

634
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,766
- Mrs. Weston, the party.
- We should go at once.

635
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,949
Wh-Where is the carriage?
Where is James?

636
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,805
Of course, fortunately, we do
have more than one carriage,

637
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,566
so if one is blown over
in the wind...

638
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:50,645
- Husband, please.
- Happy Christmas.

639
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:53,429
I am so very sorry.

640
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,862
- We must leave.
- I think we shall be very glad

641
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:58,071
that-that Frank
did not come at Christmas.

642
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,749
Look to your vinaigrette, Papa.

643
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,382
Mr. Knightley, you must
move your carriage.

644
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,693
- My father is not well.
- Take it.

645
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:09,909
It is first
and will be the fastest.

646
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:11,222
You will catch your death.

647
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,981
Your husband is not...
is not strong.

648
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:18,389
I'll ride with you, then.

649
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,567
Evidently, I may not survive.

650
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,909
Oh.

651
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,767
Miss Woodhouse.

652
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:05,525
Mr. Elton!

653
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:10,005
I must avail myself
of this precious opportunity

654
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,285
to declare sentiments
which must be

655
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:12,981
- already well known.
- Mr. Elton, please.

656
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,869
- You've drunk too much wine.
- My ardent attachment.

657
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,149
Mr. Elton!

658
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,879
You forget yourself.

659
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:21,782
I am ready to die
if you refuse me.

660
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,854
You take me for my friend.

661
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,517
Any message you have
to Miss Smith,

662
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,798
I shall be happy to deliver.

663
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:30,614
For Miss Smith?

664
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:32,661
A message for Miss Smith?

665
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,197
I never thought of Miss Smith

666
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,213
in the whole course
of my existence.

667
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:39,029
Never paid her any attentions
but as your friend.

668
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,846
Never cared whether
she were dead or alive

669
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:43,829
but as your friend.

670
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,693
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.

671
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:52,437
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near?

672
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:55,382
Everything I have said or done
for many weeks

673
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:57,237
has been with the sole view

674
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,855
of making my adoration
to yourself.

675
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,647
Charming Miss Woodhouse...

676
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,927
...allow me
to interpret this...

677
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,351
...interesting silence.

678
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:19,382
It confesses you have
long understood me.

679
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:21,302
No, sir.

680
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,478
It confesses no such thing.

681
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,302
Nothing could be farther
from my wishes.

682
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:28,085
Your pursuit of Harriet
has given me great pleasure,

683
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:30,645
and I've been very earnestly
wishing your success.

684
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,511
Miss Smith is
a very good sort of girl...

685
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,375
...and no doubt there are men
who might not object.

686
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,496
Everybody has their level.

687
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,765
Madam, my visits to Hartfield
have been for yourself only,

688
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:53,078
and the encouragement
I received...

689
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,839
Encouragement?

690
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:58,775
I give you encouragement?

691
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:03,381
You are entirely mistaken, sir.

692
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:05,656
I have no thoughts
of matrimony at present.

693
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:14,294
- Driver, stop the carriage.
- Mr. Elton, please...

694
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,214

Miss Woodhouse.

712
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:43,063
Miss Woodhouse.

713
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,119
He never loved me.

714
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,149
He loves you.

715
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:55,605
He sought to aggrandize
and enrich himself.

716
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:59,511
Yes.

717
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,447
Harriet.

718
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:16,214
You might never have thought
of him but for me.

719
00:44:16,216 --> 00:44:18,134
I assured you
of his attachments.

720
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,150
I contrived his visits
to Hartfield.

721
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,222
I do not blame you,
Miss Woodhouse.

722
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:26,357
I could never have
deserved him.

723
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,662
And none but so partial
and kind a friend as you

724
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:30,389
could even have
thought it possible.

725
00:44:32,248 --> 00:44:34,456
It's silly, really.

726
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:45,525
Harriet.

727
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:47,765
I cannot see it
without thinking of him.

728
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:51,415
Burn the frame if you like,
but you must keep the likeness.

729
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:56,246
Then I will take it.

730
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,166
I will take it,
and I will treasure it

731
00:44:58,168 --> 00:44:59,991
as a picture of my friend.

732
00:45:05,144 --> 00:45:06,935
Goodbye, Papa.

733
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,829
Now, are we going
to be quiet this carriage ride?

734
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:13,557
Sit next to your sister.

735
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:14,709
Why are you so pale?

736
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,309
Where is the baby?
Where is the baby?

737
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:17,493
Where is the baby?!

738
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:21,621
Henry needs his mor-mor.

739
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:23,285
We must retrieve
Henry's mor-mor.

740
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,845
I will not stop
this carriage for a mor-mor.

741
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,789
Goodbye, Isabella.

742
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,136
Goodbye.

743
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:37,431
Papa.

744
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,237
I wish she would not leave.

745
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,351
You must never leave me, Emma.

746
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:47,287
Oh, Papa.

747
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:50,743
You know I never could.

748
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:07,286
He cannot stay away forever.

749
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:10,581
The curate cannot give
the sermon forever.

750
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,783
No one preaches
as Mr. Elton does.

751
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:17,942
Hear this extract,
Miss Woodhouse.

752
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:20,629
Hear this.

753
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:23,383
Enough about Mr. Elton.

754
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:35,445
Miss Woodhouse.

755
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:37,238
Miss Smith.

756
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,735
Such news.

757
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:42,965
My niece, Jane Fairfax...

758
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,005
Miss Woodhouse,
Jane Fairfax, she has...

759
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:49,367
Jane has surprised us.
She is here.

760
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,502
Oh, do come along.
We must have tea.

761
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:54,199
It is too thrilling.

762
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:00,917
She caught
a bad cold. Poor thing.

763
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,933
So long ago
as the seventh of November.

764
00:47:02,935 --> 00:47:04,821
She has not been well since.

765
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:06,806
And her kind friends,
the Campbells,

766
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:08,789
thought she'd better come home

767
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,829
and try an air that always
agrees with her.

768
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:14,357
I hope that
your father is well.

769
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:15,798
Very well. I thank you.

770
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,718
She is very sorry to be parted

771
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,149
from her dear friends,
the Campbells.

772
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:21,302
And Mrs. Dixon.

773
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,445
And, oh, Mr. Dixon,

774
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:25,973
the most amiable young man
who did her

775
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:28,757
so great a service
at Weymouth in October.

776
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:31,797
I still shudder to think
what might have...

777
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:34,005
if not for Mr. Dixon,

778
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:37,622
with the waves and the water
and the sails.

779
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:39,702
Oh.

780
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:41,591
Such a charming man.

781
00:47:43,351 --> 00:47:45,143
Oh, dear.

782
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,264
Is this not pleasant?

783
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,944
She plans to stay three months.

784
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:58,485
We must have you all
to Hartfield.

785
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,629
Oh.

786
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:03,509
Oh, Mother, do you hear?

787
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:08,309
Miss Woodhouse has invited us
to Hartfield!

788
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:11,414
Mother!
You must sample the tart.

789
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:20,789
No, I do... I do...
I do not advise the custard.

790
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:22,934
What do you say
to half a glass of wine?

791
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:25,749
In a tumbler of water,
naturally.

792
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,477
We shall be seeing Frank
any day now.

793
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:28,725
I have...
I have no doubt of it.

794
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:31,862
Oh, now, Jane,
Mr. Frank Churchill

795
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:34,229
is a man much talked about
in Highbury.

796
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:36,278
Is he not, Miss Woodhouse?

797
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,254
We are all very eager
to meet him.

798
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:41,749
He was at Weymouth
when Jane was there.

799
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,927
We are very little acquainted.

800
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:47,573
Frank Churchill
was at Weymouth?

801
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:48,918
In October?

802
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,319
That was the month
of his father's wedding.

803
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,638
But you must describe him.

804
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,367
Is he handsome?

805
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:01,109
Is he agreeable?

806
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:03,959
I believe he is
generally thought so.

807
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,885
How well prepared
this custard is.

808
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:11,511
I must ask your cook
for the method.

809

Miss Fairfax.

820
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:10,422
Oh, what a pity
you did not bring your music.

821
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,917
I hope I can
recollect the tune.

822
00:50:19,127 --> 00:50:22,742
Nobody in the world
plays like you.

823
00:50:55,672 --> 00:50:59,157
I'm glad you invited
Miss Fairfax to play.

824
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,461
Having no instrument
at her grandmother's,

825
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,829
it must be a real indulgence.

826
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,749
I am glad you approve.

827
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:07,637
But I hope I am not
often deficient

828
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,976
in what is due
to my guests at Hartfield.

829
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,758
No.

830
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,255
You are not often deficient.

831
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,069
You make it very plain
you do not like Miss Fairfax.

832
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:26,805
Everybody supposes we must be
so fond of each other

833
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:28,725
because we are the same age.

834
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:31,029
Ever since I can remember,
I have been told I can find

835
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:33,653
no better companion
than Jane Fairfax.

836
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:37,589
She who is so accomplished
and so superior.

837
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,800
She is certainly accomplished.

838
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:44,373
Perhaps the accomplished
young woman

839
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,327
you wish to be thought
yourself.

840
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,485
Three months of doing
more than I wish

841
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:08,246
and less than I ought.

842
00:52:08,248 --> 00:52:10,935
That indifferent,
imperturbable statue.

843
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:23,608
I must go.

844
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:37,622
Harriet.

845
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:38,869
Oh.

846
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,663
We have missed you.

847
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:44,885
Our mother's been
asking for you.

848
00:52:44,887 --> 00:52:46,807
Will you come
and visit us again?

849
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:54,645
Of course.

850
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:57,173
Good day, Miss Martin.

851
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,191
Miss Catherine Martin.

852
00:53:06,136 --> 00:53:07,127
Mr. Martin.

853
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:21,496
Miss Smith!

854
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:33,845
Th... The near way is flooded.

855
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:39,349
You would do better
going by Mr. Cole's stables.

856
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:41,271
The ground is higher there.

857
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,182
You behaved extremely well.

858
00:53:52,184 --> 00:53:54,102
And it is over.

859
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:57,589
As a first meeting,
it cannot occur again.

860
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:59,958
You must stay no longer
than a quarter of an hour.

861
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,573
And allow no dangerous
reminiscences.

862
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,197
There must be
no recurrence to the past.

863
00:54:22,807 --> 00:54:24,918
I seek the village
of Highbury, sir.

864
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,742
Over the bridge,
left at The Crown.

865
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:28,629
You'll see the steeple.

866
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,229
Thank you.

867
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:31,576
Very much obliged.

868
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:00,376
Here we are.

869
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:04,853
- My dear.
- Mrs. Weston.

870
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:07,125
My son, Mr. Frank Churchill.

871
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,669
- Miss Emma Woodhouse.
- Miss Woodhouse.

872
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:14,613
He, uh... he's caught us
quite by surprise.

873
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,533
Indeed he has.

874
00:55:16,535 --> 00:55:18,453
There are not many houses
in which I would

875
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:21,494
presume on so far, sir, but...

876
00:55:21,496 --> 00:55:26,133
in coming home, I felt
I might take the liberty.

877
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,149
We, uh... we had a plan

878
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:29,685
to walk to the village, Emma.

879
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:30,837
Will you join us?

880
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:31,960
I would be delighted.

881
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:34,677
Splendid.

882
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:35,735
Right.

883
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,742
I believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in Jane Fairfax.

884
00:55:58,744 --> 00:56:00,629
Did you meet often at Weymouth?

885
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:02,421
Pray, let us go in here.

886
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:04,758
That I may prove myself to be
a true citizen of Highbury,

887
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,536
I must buy something at Ford's.

888
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:21,014
And I beg your pardon,
Miss Woodhouse,

889
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:23,509
you were speaking to me.

890
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:24,950
I merely asked
whether you had known

891
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:27,415
much of Miss Fairfax
and her party at Weymouth.

892
00:56:28,696 --> 00:56:31,189
And now that I understand
the question,

893
00:56:31,191 --> 00:56:33,367
I must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one.

894
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:36,662
Well, it is always
the lady's right

895
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:39,062
to decide on the degree
of acquaintance.

896
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:42,038
You answer as discreetly
as she would herself.

897
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,621
Though her account leaves
so much to be guessed

898
00:56:45,623 --> 00:56:47,669
that I really think
you may say what you like

899
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,589
of your acquaintance with her.

900
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:52,309
I only know what is
generally known.

901
00:56:52,311 --> 00:56:54,487
That she is poor
and of no consequence.

902
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:02,294
Here's where you have
your balls, I suppose.

903
00:57:02,296 --> 00:57:04,502
Every fortnight through the winter.

904
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,221
I am afraid Highbury may yet
disappoint you, Mr. Churchill.

905
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,982
We have not society enough
for dancing.

906
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:11,509
Ah, but an inn of this size
must have a ballroom,

907
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,840
and where there is a ballroom,
there can be a ball.

908
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:18,357
We cannot do without dancing.

909
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:24,053
Instances have been known
of young people

910
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:26,262
passing many, many months
successfully

911
00:57:26,264 --> 00:57:29,685
without any ball
of any description

912
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:32,822
and no injury either to body
or to mind, but when...

913
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,920
when the felicities of
rapid motion have been felt...

914
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,678
...it must be
a very heavy heart

915
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,269
that does not ask for more.

916
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,213
It is very dirty inside.

917
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,102
Oh, my dear, my dear,
you are too particular.

918
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:53,045
By candlelight, it'll be
as clean as Randalls.

919
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:54,869
We must have a ball.

920
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,773
Yes, and when we do,
may I hope for the honor

921
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,431
of your hand
for the first two dances?

922
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:06,582
The Coles are to hold a
supper party in Frank's honor,

923
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,600
and perhaps there'll be
dancing there.

924
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:15,318
So, Emma Woodhouse
deigned to accept

925
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,198
an invitation
from the merchant Mr. Cole.

926
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,557
Mr. Churchill will soon
return to Yorkshire.

927
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:24,021
We must make the most of every
opportunity until he does.

928
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:25,429
"We must."

929
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:26,645
He's in Highbury
only two weeks.

930
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:28,629
And yet he spent a whole day
going to London

931
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,422
just to get his hair cut.

932
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,237
16 miles, twice over.

933
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,541
He's a trifling, silly fop.

934
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:40,087
Indeed.

935
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:50,453
Mr. Cole.

936
00:58:50,455 --> 00:58:53,525
Such grand estates you have
in common, gentlemen.

937
00:58:53,527 --> 00:58:54,710
Donwell Abbey.

938
00:58:54,712 --> 00:58:56,502
Enscombe,
soon to inherit, of course.

939
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:58,358
Soon to inherit Enscombe.

940
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,117
Not too soon.

941
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,087
I trust your uncle Churchill
is in good health?

942
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:06,839
Uh, excellent health.

943
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:31,766
And have you heard
the choicest piece of gossip

944
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,005
that has set all the tongues
of the village aflame?

945
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:37,142
A pianoforte, very elegant,
delivered to Miss Fairfax

946
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:39,509
this very morning
with no return address.

947
00:59:39,511 --> 00:59:41,301
I never saw so fine
an instrument.

948
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:45,141
A pianoforte, very elegant,
and with no return address.

949
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:46,358
No return address.

950
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,278
Jane herself
is quite at a loss.

951
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,294
Quite bewildered to think
who could have sent it.

952
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:52,149
Bewildered, indeed.

953
01:00:01,687 --> 01:00:03,349
Why do you smile?

954
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,567
Nay, why do you?

955
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:07,317
I suppose I smile for pleasure.

956
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:11,157
A pianoforte is
a very handsome present.

957
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,173
I rather wonder
it was never made before.

958
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,062
Perhaps Miss Fairfax
has never been

959
01:00:15,064 --> 01:00:17,109
staying here so long before.

960
01:00:17,111 --> 01:00:18,261
Or that Colonel Campbell
did not

961
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:19,989
give her use
of his own instrument,

962
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,742
which must now be shut up
in London untouched by anybody.

963
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,814
She has done her hair
in so odd a way.

964
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:28,343
I never saw anything like it.

965
01:00:29,656 --> 01:00:31,221
Must be a fancy of her own.

966
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:32,438
I see nobody else
looking like her.

967
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:36,117
If Colonel Campbell
is not the giver,

968
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,205
who can be?

969
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:38,582
Mrs. Dixon?

970
01:00:38,584 --> 01:00:42,198
As a token of her...
her friendship, perhaps?

971
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,342
What say you to Mr. Dixon?

972
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:45,845
Mr. Dixon?

973
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:47,509
He saved her life.

974
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,365
Did you hear of it?

975
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:51,349
A water party,
and by some accident,

976
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:52,982
she was falling overboard.

977
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:54,485
He caught her.

978
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:55,576
Huh.

979
01:00:58,231 --> 01:01:00,278
Ladies and gentlemen,

980
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,200
a duet.

981
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:07,382
What do you say to this, Emma?

982
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:10,965
I have made a match between
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.

983
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:14,645
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax?

984
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:16,725
This pianoforte's
been sent to her by somebody.

985
01:01:16,727 --> 01:01:19,253
And she has always been
a favorite with him.

986
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:21,590
Tonight, he sent his carriage
for her as a courtesy

987
01:01:21,592 --> 01:01:23,445
and walked himself.

988
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:26,165
Was that not gallant?

989
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,087
Mr. Weston.

...shall no man living

1002
01:04:16,216 --> 01:04:18,005
He's married.

1003
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:19,893
It cannot be
a long acquaintance.

1004
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:21,911
He's only been gone six weeks.

1005
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,511
My wife, Mrs. Augusta Elton.

1006
01:04:43,895 --> 01:04:45,717
This house is very like

1007
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:49,365
my brother Mr. Suckling's seat
at Maple Grove.

1008
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:51,285
Very like.

1009
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:54,645
I'm quite struck by
the likeness.

1010
01:04:54,647 --> 01:04:56,502
Is it not astonishingly like,
dear husband?

1011
01:04:56,504 --> 01:04:58,197
Very like.

1012
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:00,053
I really could almost
fancy myself at Maple Grove.

1013
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:01,302
The staircase as I came in--

1014
01:05:01,304 --> 01:05:03,926
I observed how very like
the staircase is.

1015
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:06,136
Placed in exactly the same part
of the house.

1016
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:11,573
I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
it is very delightful to me

1017
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,774
to be reminded of a place
I am so extremely partial to

1018
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:16,694
as Maple Grove.

1019
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:18,902
A most impressive residence.

1020
01:05:18,904 --> 01:05:21,782
Whenever you are transplanted

1021
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:25,013
like me, Miss Woodhouse,

1022
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:26,837
you will understand
how very delightful it is

1023
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,085
to meet with anything at all

1024
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:30,904
that reminds one
of what one has left behind.

1025
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:35,765
We have been calling
at Randalls.

1026
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:38,357
What pleasant people
the Westons seem to be.

1027
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:40,341
And who should call in
while we were there?

1028
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:42,549
Knightley.

1029
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:45,109
Knightley himself.

1030
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:48,245
Of course, as so particular
a friend of Mr. E's,

1031
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,933
I had a great curiosity
to meet him.

1032
01:05:50,935 --> 01:05:53,142
"My friend Knightley"
had been so often mentioned

1033
01:05:53,144 --> 01:05:55,669
that I really was
impatient to see him.

1034
01:05:55,671 --> 01:05:59,573
And I must do
my <i>cara sposo</i> the justice

1035
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:03,830
to say that he need not be
at all ashamed of his friend.

1036
01:06:03,832 --> 01:06:06,229
"Knightley."

1037
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:08,085
I could not have believed it.
"Knightley."

1038
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:09,462
Never met him before
in her life

1039
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:10,581
and calls him "Knightley."

1040
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,662
And to discover
that he is a gentleman.

1041
01:06:12,664 --> 01:06:14,358
Upstart, vulgar being,

1042
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,886
with her "Mr. E"
and her <i>cara sposo.</i>

1043
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:18,102
Emma.

1044
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:19,895
- Mr. Weston.
- Miss Smith.

1045
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:23,958
The Churchills
have settled at Richmond.

1046
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,526
Here.

1047
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:26,742
Frank is returning.

1048
01:06:26,744 --> 01:06:28,725
We shall have our ball.

1049
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,197
No. No.

1050
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,470
- You are Frank Churchill.
- Oh.

1051
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:38,327
Of course.

1052
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:55,445
You dance so beautifully.

1053
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:02,325
Oh.

1054
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:04,949
Oh, this is brilliant, indeed.

1055
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:07,125
This is admirable.

1056
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:10,485
Excellently contrived,
upon my word.

1057
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,566
Nothing wanting.

1058
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:14,805
Oh! Miss Woodhouse.

1059
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:16,725
You must really have had
Aladdin's lamp.

1060
01:07:18,231 --> 01:07:21,494
This is meeting
quite in fairyland.

1061
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,510
Such a transformation.

1062
01:07:23,512 --> 01:07:26,229
Now, where shall we sit?
Where shall we sit?

1063
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:28,310
Oh, now, anywhere where Jane
is not in a draft.

1064
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:29,973
How do you like my gown?

1065
01:07:29,975 --> 01:07:31,669
- Oh!
- Oh, Mr. Elton!

1066
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:33,974
I do not know whether
it is not over-trimmed.

1067
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:37,365
I have the greatest dislike to
the idea of being over-trimmed.

1068
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:38,774
Quite a horror of finery.

1069
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:40,694
Of course, I must put on

1070
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:43,445
a few ornaments now
because it is expected.

1071
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:46,518
A bride, you know,
must appear like a bride.

1072
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,336
But my natural taste
is all for simplicity.

1073
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:52,725
How do you like Jane's hair?

1074
01:07:52,727 --> 01:07:54,645
She did it all herself.

1075
01:07:54,647 --> 01:07:55,862
Too wonderful.

1076
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,909
No hairdresser
from London, I think,

1077
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,767
could do a finer style.

1078
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:11,349
Emma,
it has just occurred to us

1079
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:14,582
that Mrs. Elton will expect
to be asked to begin the ball.

1080
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:17,238
And she will surely think
Frank ought to ask her.

1081
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,190
Frank cannot break
his promise to you.

1082
01:08:19,192 --> 01:08:21,078
He's promised you
the first two dances.

1083
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,549
Here's the plan.

1084
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:24,822
I will ask Mrs. Elton.

1085
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:27,415
The ball is in Frank's honor,
but it's in my design.

1086
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,424
I shall ask her.

1087
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:34,005
You must submit
to stand second.

1088
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,877
A bride must be first
in company.

1089
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:40,085
It is almost enough
to make me think of marrying.

1090
01:08:40,087 --> 01:08:41,205
Oh.

1091
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:42,773
Must I go first?

1092
01:08:42,775 --> 01:08:45,014
I really am ashamed
to always be

1093
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:47,383
leading the way.

1094
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:53,781
Gentlemen.

1095
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,493
You have been much missed
in Highbury.

1096
01:09:17,495 --> 01:09:19,191
Have I?

1097
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:29,207
How is your aunt?

1098
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:32,565
Most reluctant to release me.

1099
01:09:58,519 --> 01:10:00,437
Do you not dance, Mr. Elton?

1100
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:02,709
Most readily, Mrs. Weston,
if you will dance with me.

1101
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:04,502
- Oh.
- Ah.

1102
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,389
Well, perhaps...

1103
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:09,237
There is a young lady
disengaged

1104
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,480
whom I should be very glad
to see dancing-- Miss Smith.

1105
01:10:13,271 --> 01:10:16,310
Miss Smith.

1106
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,645
If I were not
an old married man.

1107
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:19,989
But my dancing days are over.

1108
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:21,976
Mrs. Weston,
you will excuse me.

1109
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,823
Will you dance, Miss Smith?

1110
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:05,558
Thank you.

1111
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,640
For your kindness to Harriet.

1112
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:14,229
He was unpardonably rude.

1113
01:12:14,231 --> 01:12:16,951
And he aimed at wounding
more than Harriet.

1114
01:12:18,775 --> 01:12:21,974
I was completely mistaken
in Mr. Elton.

1115
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:23,894
There is a littleness about him

1116
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:25,784
which you discovered
and I did not.

1117
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,485
You would have chosen
for him better

1118
01:12:30,487 --> 01:12:33,045
than he has chosen for himself.

1119
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:37,077
Harriet Smith has some
first-rate qualities

1120
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,024
which Mrs. Elton
is totally without.

1121
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:45,141
She does you credit, Emma,
as you do her.

1122
01:12:45,143 --> 01:12:46,709
Ah.

1123
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,533
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
Come.

1124
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:49,653
Set your companions an example.

1125
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:50,774
They're all lazy.

1126
01:12:50,776 --> 01:12:52,245
They're all asleep!

1127
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,493
We must dance another set.

1128
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,384
I am ready
whenever I am wanted.

1129
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,887
With whom will you dance?

1130
01:13:02,968 --> 01:13:04,184
With you.

1131
01:13:05,944 --> 01:13:07,862
If you will ask me.

1132
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:09,141
You have shown
that you can dance,

1133
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:11,829
and we are not really so much
brother and sister

1134
01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:13,526
as to make it improper.

1135
01:13:13,528 --> 01:13:14,776
No, indeed.

1136
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:27,926
Stop it.

1137
01:13:27,928 --> 01:13:29,078
Stop embarrassing yourself.

1138
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,190
I am not embarrassing myself!

1139
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:05,045
Oh!

1140
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:08,885
Mr. Churchill. Harriet.

1141
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:10,262
- Oh!
- What has happened?

1142
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:11,990
She was set upon by some
gypsies as she was coming home.

1143
01:17:11,992 --> 01:17:14,774
When she attempted escape,
she fell.

1144
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:16,469
She had a cramp.

1145
01:17:16,471 --> 01:17:19,445
- From too much dancing!
- Well, is she hurt?

1146
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:20,438
I didn't see.

1147
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,581
I arrived moments after...

1148
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,949
...and brought her here.

1149
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:26,229
I could think of
no other place.

1150
01:17:26,231 --> 01:17:27,957
To the drawing room.

1151
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:30,422
It was on account
of the scissors!

1152
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:31,925
The scissors?

1153
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:33,749
- Oh!
- I...

1154
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,734
...borrowed a pair of scissors
from Miss Bates.

1155
01:17:39,736 --> 01:17:42,197
I was halfway home

1156
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,117
when I made the recollection

1157
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:48,117
and so doubled back.

1158
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:49,877
Whew.

1159
01:17:58,648 --> 01:17:59,831
What is your purpose here?

1160
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:04,790
Um, my-my... carriage...

1161
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,678
My... Uh, my horse
threw a shoe.

1162
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,405
You took
your carriage to the ball?

1163
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:09,782
Yes.

1164
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:12,245
What might have become of me,
Miss Woodhouse,

1165
01:18:12,247 --> 01:18:14,069
if not for the scissors?

1166
01:18:14,071 --> 01:18:15,127
We must send for Perry.

1167
01:18:17,111 --> 01:18:19,029
Miss Woodhouse.

1168
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:22,805
I believe I am in love again.

1169
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:24,725
Mrs. Goddard
should be assured of her safety.

1170
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:25,782
Yes, and I shall
rouse my father.

1171
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:26,709
We ought to let them know

1172
01:18:26,711 --> 01:18:28,598
that there are gypsies
in the neighborhood.

1173
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,263
Yes, let us go at once.

1174
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:33,782
- Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
- Say nothing more.

1175
01:18:33,784 --> 01:18:35,478
Do not go!

1176
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,135
Mr. Churchill.

1177
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:41,846
Please.

1178
01:18:41,848 --> 01:18:43,094
Stay.

1179
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:52,982
What is the matter?
What has happened?

1180
01:18:52,984 --> 01:18:54,582
What... Is she...
is she... is she alive?

1181
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:56,277
Harriet is unharmed, Papa.

1182
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:57,621
We have Mr. Churchill to thank.

1183
01:18:57,623 --> 01:18:59,318
Please stay.

1184
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,334
Mr. Knightley
can sound the alarm.

1185
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,829
We will both go.

1186
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:04,917
Why are we alarmed?

1187
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,837
We have sent for Perry, Papa.

1188
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:08,757
He's your superior,
no doubt, but...

1189
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:10,517
but wonderful things
have taken place.

1190
01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:12,021
There have been matches
of greater disparity.

1191
01:19:12,023 --> 01:19:15,509
Believe me, I have not
the presumption to suppose.

1192
01:19:15,511 --> 01:19:16,821
No, but the service
he rendered you.

1193
01:19:16,823 --> 01:19:18,229
Service?

1194
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:22,325
The very recollection of it,

1195
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:25,077
and all that I felt.

1196
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:29,205
His coming to me,
his noble look.

1197
01:19:29,207 --> 01:19:33,463
Such a change in one moment
from misery to...

1198
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:39,381
...to perfect happiness.

1199
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:40,821
I was very wrong before.

1200
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:42,485
I will be cautious now.

1201
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:44,536
I am determined against
any interference.

1202
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:29,397
What is this I hear, dear Jane,

1203
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:31,349
about your going
to the post office

1204
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:32,661
in the rain last week?

1205
01:20:32,663 --> 01:20:34,262
Why, you sad girl.

1206
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:36,086
Why would you do such a thing?

1207
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:39,285
I will not allow you
to do such a thing again.

1208
01:20:39,287 --> 01:20:41,174
I shall speak to Mr. E.

1209
01:20:41,176 --> 01:20:43,094
The man who fetches
our letters--

1210
01:20:43,096 --> 01:20:45,045
one of our men,
I forget his name--

1211
01:20:45,047 --> 01:20:47,990
shall inquire for yours, too.

1212
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:51,062
Do you suppose Mr. Knightley
might extend us all

1213
01:20:51,064 --> 01:20:54,229
an invitation to the abbey,
Miss Woodhouse?

1214
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:56,277
I love to explore great houses,

1215
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:59,510
and I fear I have
long exhausted Highbury.

1216
01:20:59,512 --> 01:21:01,173
I'm afraid
Mr. Knightley's concerns

1217
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:02,805
are all for his tenants

1218
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:04,278
and none for his house,
Mrs. Elton.

1219
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,422
His ballrooms and picture
galleries are quite shut up.

1220
01:21:06,424 --> 01:21:08,789
I should be very glad
to open Donwell

1221
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,613
for your exploration,
Mrs. Elton.

1222
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,437
- The welcome is long overdue.
- Mm.

1223
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:14,774
I should like that
of all things.

1224
01:21:14,776 --> 01:21:16,790
Name your day, and I will come.

1225
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:19,317
I cannot
name a day until I have spoken

1226
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:21,462
to some others whom I would
wish to form the party.

1227
01:21:21,464 --> 01:21:23,285
Oh, leave that to me.
It is my party.

1228
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:24,342
I will invite your guests.

1229
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:26,102
I hope you will bring Elton,

1230
01:21:26,104 --> 01:21:30,198
but I will not trouble you
to give any other invitations.

1231
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,862
Oh.

1232
01:21:31,864 --> 01:21:34,677
Oh, well, now you are
looking very sly.

1233
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:37,142
But consider,
you need not be afraid

1234
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:38,774
of delegating power to me.

1235
01:21:38,776 --> 01:21:41,685
Married women, you know,
may be safely authorized.

1236
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:44,565
There is but one
married woman in all the world

1237
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,166
whom I can ever allow

1238
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:49,173
to invite what guests
she pleases to Donwell.

1239
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:50,390
Mrs. Weston, I suppose?

1240
01:21:50,392 --> 01:21:52,789
No. Mrs. Knightley.

1241
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:56,503
Until she is in being, I will
manage such matters myself.

1242
01:22:24,727 --> 01:22:26,711
Oh, my heavens.

1243
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:34,389
Do you not feel transported?

1244
01:22:34,391 --> 01:22:37,336
I can hardly believe
that we remain in England.

1245
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:47,925
And I was to accompany him,

1246
01:22:47,927 --> 01:22:51,285
but the night before his going,
I was struck down by a fever,

1247
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:52,696
and so I did not go.

1248
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:56,661
Please excuse me.

1249
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:58,295
Of course.

1250
01:23:09,559 --> 01:23:10,902
There is an excellent prospect

1251
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:12,981
from the south window,
Miss Smith.

1252
01:23:12,983 --> 01:23:14,807
May I escort you?

1253
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:21,429
Jane of course
knows a great deal

1254
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,029
more of the world than I.

1255
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,213
She has been to Ireland.

1256
01:23:30,007 --> 01:23:31,669
Will you...

1257
01:23:31,671 --> 01:23:33,974
be so kind when I am missed

1258
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:35,958
to say that I am gone home?

1259
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,486
If you wish it.

1260
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:40,727
But you're not going to walk
back to Highbury alone.

1261
01:23:43,447 --> 01:23:45,431
- Are you unwell?
- Miss Woodhouse...

1262
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:51,320
We all know at times what it is
to be wearied in spirits.

1263
01:23:53,047 --> 01:23:57,016
Mine, I confess, are exhausted.

1264
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,200
Have I missed the party?

1265
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,517
Not at all.

1266
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:24,375
We're exploring the house.

1267
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:30,422
I was detained by my aunt.

1268
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:33,109
A nervous seizure
which lasted some hours.

1269
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:34,389
Had I known how hot a ride
I should have,

1270
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:36,021
I believe I should not
have come at all.

1271
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:38,165
You will soon
be cooler if you sit down.

1272
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:40,151
Some cold beer, perhaps.

1273
01:24:43,735 --> 01:24:46,581
As soon as my aunt gets well
again, I shall go abroad.

1274
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,798
I'm tired of doing nothing.

1275
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,878
I want a change.

1276
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,542
I'm serious, Miss Woodhouse,

1277
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,750
whatever your penetrating eyes
may fancy.

1278
01:24:53,752 --> 01:24:55,670
I'm sick of England.

1279
01:24:55,672 --> 01:24:58,229
You are sick of prosperity
and indulgence.

1280
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:00,149
Cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself

1281
01:25:00,151 --> 01:25:01,909
and be contented to stay?

1282
01:25:01,911 --> 01:25:04,214
You are quite mistaken.
I do not look upon myself

1283
01:25:04,216 --> 01:25:06,134
as either prosperous
or indulged.

1284
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:11,639
We're going to Box Hill
tomorrow.

1285
01:25:13,463 --> 01:25:16,758
It is not the grand tour,
but it will be something

1286
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,277
for a young man
so much in want of change.

1287
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,349
Well, if you wish me to stay
and join the party,

1288
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,207
I will.

1289
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:39,573
How much I am obliged to you
for telling me to come today.

1290
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:42,453
I had quite determined
to go away again.

1291
01:25:42,455 --> 01:25:44,983
Yes, you were very cross.

1292
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:04,437
Our companions
are excessively stupid.

1293
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:06,614
What shall we do to rouse them?

1294
01:26:06,616 --> 01:26:09,077
Hmm? Any nonsense will serve.

1295
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:10,485
Ladies and gentlemen,

1296
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:12,949
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse
to say that

1297
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:14,997
she desires to know
what you're all thinking of.

1298
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:19,062
Dear. What we are thinking of?

1299
01:26:19,064 --> 01:26:21,302
Is Miss Woodhouse sure
that she would like to know

1300
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:22,742
what we are all thinking of?

1301
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,597
No, no.
Upon no account in the world.

1302
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:25,814
It is the very last thing

1303
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:27,605
I would stand the brunt of
just now.

1304
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:30,389
It is the sort of thing
which I should not

1305
01:26:30,391 --> 01:26:34,454
have thought myself privileged
to inquire into, as...

1306
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:37,205
<i>chaperon</i> of the party.

1307
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:38,997
Very true, my love.

1308
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:40,214
Very true.

1309
01:26:40,216 --> 01:26:42,837
But some ladies
will say anything.

1310
01:26:42,839 --> 01:26:45,717
Best to pass it off as a joke.

1311
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:47,733
Everybody knows
what is due to you.

1312
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,814
They are
most of them affronted.

1313
01:26:49,816 --> 01:26:52,502
I will attack them
with more address.

1314
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:53,654
Ladies and gentlemen,

1315
01:26:53,656 --> 01:26:56,534
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse

1316
01:26:56,536 --> 01:26:58,133
to say that
she waives her right

1317
01:26:58,135 --> 01:26:59,925
of knowing what
you may be thinking of

1318
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:02,869
and only requires something
entertaining from each of you.

1319
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:04,182
She demands either
one thing very clever

1320
01:27:04,184 --> 01:27:06,773
or two things moderately clever

1321
01:27:06,775 --> 01:27:09,717
or three things
very dull indeed.

1322
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:11,669
And she engages

1323
01:27:11,671 --> 01:27:13,142
to laugh heartily at them all.

1324
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,349
Oh. V-Very well, then.

1325
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:17,462
I need not be uneasy.

1326
01:27:17,464 --> 01:27:20,149
"Three things
very dull indeed."

1327
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:21,621
That will do just for me.

1328
01:27:21,623 --> 01:27:23,989
I shall be sure to say
three dull things

1329
01:27:23,991 --> 01:27:25,365
as soon as I open my mouth.

1330
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:27,222
Ah, ma'am, but there is
the difficulty.

1331
01:27:27,224 --> 01:27:29,623
When have you ever
stopped at three?

1332
01:27:35,992 --> 01:27:37,751
Oh.

1333
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:43,544
No. I see what she-she means.

1334
01:27:46,168 --> 01:27:48,245
I shall try to hold my tongue.

1335
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,854
I-I like this plan.

1336
01:28:00,856 --> 01:28:03,734
Uh, agreed, agreed,
agreed, agreed.

1337
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:05,525
Uh, I shall do my best.

1338
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:07,701
Um...

1339
01:28:07,703 --> 01:28:10,069
I'm making a conundrum.

1340
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:11,285
How will a conundrum reckon?

1341
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:13,334
Low, I am afraid, sir,

1342
01:28:13,336 --> 01:28:15,285
but we shall, uh,
be indulgent...

1343
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:20,054
Mr. Knightley, I must have
made myself very disagreeable,

1344
01:28:20,056 --> 01:28:23,990
or she would not have said
such a thing to an old friend.

1345
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:26,389
I cannot think
what I have done.

1346
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:28,502
What two letters

1347
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:32,246
of the alphabet are there
that express perfection?

1348
01:28:32,248 --> 01:28:34,997
What two letters...

1349
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:36,374
...express perfection?

1350
01:28:36,376 --> 01:28:38,997
I... I'm sure I do not know.

1351
01:28:38,999 --> 01:28:40,502
Well, I shall tell you.

1352
01:28:40,504 --> 01:28:42,677
"M" and "A." "Emma."

1353
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:46,902
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1354
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:48,501
Mr. Weston has shown us how

1355
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:50,582
to play this game
but also how to end it,

1356
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:52,821
for who can improve
upon perfection?

1357
01:28:52,823 --> 01:28:54,678
I protest, I must be excused.

1358
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,141
I do not pretend to be a wit.

1359
01:28:57,143 --> 01:28:59,445
I really must be allowed
to judge when to speak

1360
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:01,205
and when to hold my tongue.

1361
01:29:01,207 --> 01:29:02,390
Shall we walk, Augusta?

1362
01:29:02,392 --> 01:29:03,414
Most willingly.

1363
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:06,645
I am very tired of exploring
so long on one spot.

1364
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:08,822
Shall we join
Mrs. Elton, ma'am?

1365
01:29:08,824 --> 01:29:10,742
If you please, my dear.

1366
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:13,559
With all my heart,
I am quite ready.

1367
01:30:06,904 --> 01:30:10,550
How could you be
so unfeeling to Miss Bates?

1368
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:12,374
It was not so very bad.

1369
01:30:12,376 --> 01:30:16,214
How could you be so insolent
to a woman of her character

1370
01:30:16,216 --> 01:30:18,709
and-and-and age
and-and situation?

1371
01:30:18,711 --> 01:30:20,629
I dare say she did not
understand me.

1372
01:30:20,631 --> 01:30:21,813
I assure you she did.

1373
01:30:21,815 --> 01:30:22,998
She felt your full meaning.

1374
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,791
She has talked of it since.

1375
01:30:26,615 --> 01:30:28,758
I know there is not a better
creature in the world...

1376
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,189
I wish you could have heard
how she talked of it--

1377
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:33,269
w-with what candor
and-and generosity.

1378
01:30:33,271 --> 01:30:35,414
You must allow that what is
good and what is ridiculous

1379
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,046
are most unfortunately
blended in her.

1380
01:30:37,048 --> 01:30:39,029
They are blended in her,
I acknowledge.

1381
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:41,078
And were she
a woman of fortune,

1382
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,190
I would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner,

1383
01:30:43,192 --> 01:30:44,757
but she is poor.

1384
01:30:44,759 --> 01:30:46,742
She has sunk from the comfort
she was born to,

1385
01:30:46,744 --> 01:30:49,557
and if she lived to an old age,
she will probably sink more.

1386
01:30:49,559 --> 01:30:51,477
- It is too hot, and...
- She has seen you grow up

1387
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:53,654
- from when her notice of you was an honor.
- And I am tired!

1388
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,309
To have you now,
in thoughtless spirits

1389
01:30:56,311 --> 01:30:57,525
and the pride of the moment,

1390
01:30:57,527 --> 01:31:00,149
laugh at her
and-and humble her,

1391
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:02,165
and before her niece
and before others, many of whom

1392
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,149
are entirely guided
by your treatment of her!

1393
01:31:04,151 --> 01:31:05,751
It was badly done, indeed!

1394
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,917
Go!

1395
01:31:50,999 --> 01:31:54,136
I have been
unpardonably vain...

1396
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,040
...and insufferably arrogant.

1397
01:32:00,727 --> 01:32:02,711
I have been inconsiderate...

1398
01:32:04,823 --> 01:32:08,661
...and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling and...

1399
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:23,989
I'm afraid Jane
is not very well.

1400
01:33:23,991 --> 01:33:26,069
Dreadful headache.

1401
01:33:26,071 --> 01:33:27,959
Writing all morning.

1402
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,902
Such long letters.

1403
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:33,463
I said, "My dear,
you shall blind yourself."

1404
01:33:35,224 --> 01:33:37,655
I'm so very sorry, Miss Bates.

1405
01:33:38,872 --> 01:33:41,366
Please give Jane
my good wishes.

1406
01:33:41,368 --> 01:33:43,157
You were kept waiting
at the door.

1407
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,149
I was quite ashamed.

1408
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,581
No, you... you see,
there was a little bustle,

1409
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,662
for it so happened
we did not hear the knock,

1410
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:50,102
and until you were
on the stairs,

1411
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:52,120
we did not know
that anybody was coming.

1412
01:34:03,767 --> 01:34:05,560
So very kind.

1413
01:34:09,367 --> 01:34:12,376
But you are always kind,
Miss Woodhouse.

1414
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,918
Ah, Emma.

1415
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,805
How did you find them?

1416
01:34:22,807 --> 01:34:24,501
Emma has been to call on

1417
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:26,421
Mrs. and Miss Bates,
Mr. Knightley.

1418
01:34:26,423 --> 01:34:29,335
She is always
so attentive to them.

1419
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:32,149
I...

1420
01:34:32,151 --> 01:34:35,222
I regret I cannot stay, sir.

1421
01:34:35,224 --> 01:34:37,400
We will miss you
in the evening.

1422
01:34:45,527 --> 01:34:46,965
Goodbye, Emma.

1423
01:35:12,664 --> 01:35:13,847
What has happened?

1424
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:17,718
Mrs. Churchill is dead.

1425
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,542
Dead?

1426
01:35:19,544 --> 01:35:22,389
Yes, we-we always thought
her illness

1427
01:35:22,391 --> 01:35:24,374
was invented, but...

1428
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:26,229
Emma.

1429
01:35:26,231 --> 01:35:27,989
Frank was here
this very morning

1430
01:35:27,991 --> 01:35:30,806
on the most
extraordinary errand.

1431
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,047
It is impossible
to express our surprise.

1432
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:36,856
Frank and Jane Fairfax
are engaged.

1433
01:35:38,744 --> 01:35:40,309
What?

1434
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:42,229
There's been a solemn
engagement between them

1435
01:35:42,231 --> 01:35:43,670
ever since October.

1436
01:35:43,672 --> 01:35:46,327
Formed at Weymouth and kept
a secret from everybody.

1437
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,879
What? Um...

1438
01:35:50,903 --> 01:35:52,278
Engaged?

1439
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,198
Before either of them
came to Highbury?

1440
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,342
Secretly engaged.

1441
01:35:56,344 --> 01:35:58,677
Of course,
had his aunt heard of it,

1442
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:00,469
she would have
cut him off, but...

1443
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:01,910
It has hurt me, Emma,
very much.

1444
01:36:01,912 --> 01:36:03,863
It has hurt his father equally.

1445
01:36:07,607 --> 01:36:09,590
He sent the pianoforte.

1446
01:36:09,592 --> 01:36:11,447
He has confessed it.

1447
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:15,029
Emma, you must know

1448
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:17,111
it was our darling wish.

1449
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:20,949
Oh, no, no.

1450
01:36:20,951 --> 01:36:22,679
Not for me.

1451
01:36:27,736 --> 01:36:31,125
I'm so very sorry, Harriet.

1452
01:36:31,127 --> 01:36:34,197
But why should you condole me?

1453
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:38,294
You do not think I care about
Mr. Frank Churchill?

1454
01:36:38,296 --> 01:36:41,877
There was a time,
and not very distant, either,

1455
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:43,797
when you gave me reason
to believe

1456
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,974
- that you did care about him.
- Him?

1457
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,461
Never.

1458
01:36:49,463 --> 01:36:52,245
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
how could you so mistake me?

1459
01:36:52,247 --> 01:36:54,229
Harriet, wh-what do you mean?

1460
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:56,149
I should not have
thought it possible

1461
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:59,414
that you could have
misunderstood me.

1462
01:36:59,416 --> 01:37:02,200
But you told me that
greater things had happened.

1463
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:06,005
That there had been matches
of greater disparity.

1464
01:37:06,007 --> 01:37:07,797
Those were your very words,
Miss Woodhouse.

1465
01:37:07,799 --> 01:37:09,589
Harriet.

1466
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:11,829
Let us understand
each other now

1467
01:37:11,831 --> 01:37:14,327
without possibility
of further mistake.

1468
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:18,485
Are you speaking
of Mr. Knightley?

1469
01:37:18,487 --> 01:37:20,279
Of course.

1470
01:37:22,135 --> 01:37:25,013
- But...
- I thought you knew.

1471
01:37:25,015 --> 01:37:27,350
But the service
Mr. Churchill rendered you

1472
01:37:27,352 --> 01:37:29,078
i-in protecting you
from the gypsies.

1473
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,837
Oh, no.

1474
01:37:30,839 --> 01:37:33,623
It was not the gypsies. No.

1475
01:37:35,063 --> 01:37:38,647
I was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance.

1476
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:45,109
Of Mr. Knightley's coming
and asking me to dance.

1477
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:47,480
When Mr. Elton
would not stand up with me.

1478
01:37:50,392 --> 01:37:52,247
Good God.

1479
01:37:54,232 --> 01:37:57,014
And have you any idea
of Mr. Knightley's

1480
01:37:57,016 --> 01:37:58,742
returning your affection?

1481
01:37:58,744 --> 01:38:00,599
I must say that I have.

1482
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:06,551
He has shown me sweetness
and kindness.

1483
01:38:09,111 --> 01:38:12,662
And at Donwell, he took
great pains to describe to me

1484
01:38:12,664 --> 01:38:16,341
some particulars of the
management of his tenant farms.

1485
01:38:16,343 --> 01:38:19,575
We were interrupted,
but before we were...

1486
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:23,606
...he seemed almost
to be asking me

1487
01:38:23,608 --> 01:38:26,391
if my affections were engaged.

1488
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:29,718
Yes, but is it possible

1489
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,630
that he might have been
alluding to Mr. Martin?

1490
01:38:32,632 --> 01:38:35,384
That he might have had
Mr. Martin's interest in view?

1491
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,853
You think of Mr. Knightley
for yourself.

1492
01:38:44,855 --> 01:38:47,447
Harriet.

1493
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,549
I-I do not flatter myself

1494
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:52,375
with any idea
of his attachment to me.

1495
01:38:55,319 --> 01:38:56,536
Harriet.

1496
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:03,350
I should have considered it
too great a presumption

1497
01:39:03,352 --> 01:39:05,846
even to think of him
but for you.

1498
01:39:05,848 --> 01:39:07,989
Harriet.

1499
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:12,597
I know that he is the last man

1500
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:14,678
who would intentionally give
any woman the idea

1501
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,165
of his feeling more for her
than he does, so...

1502
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:20,407
if you believe...

1503
01:39:22,264 --> 01:39:23,959
...he loves you...

1504
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:29,592
I refused Mr. Martin
because of you.

1505
01:39:32,056 --> 01:39:34,423
Because...

1506
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:36,920
Harriet.

1507
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:14,104
Emma!

1508
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:27,319
Mr. Knightley.

1509
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:34,069
Have you heard the news?

1510
01:40:34,071 --> 01:40:35,541
Miss Fairfax
and Frank Churchill.

1511
01:40:35,543 --> 01:40:37,334
I did not see it.

1512
01:40:37,336 --> 01:40:39,765
But then I seem to have been
doomed to blindness.

1513
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:41,781
Time, my dearest Emma...
time will heal the wound.

1514
01:40:41,783 --> 01:40:43,637
He will soon be gone.

1515
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:45,014
You will forget him.

1516
01:40:45,016 --> 01:40:48,791
You are very kind,
but you are mistaken.

1517
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:51,830
My blindness
to what was going on

1518
01:40:51,832 --> 01:40:54,645
led me to act in a way that
I must always be ashamed of,

1519
01:40:54,647 --> 01:40:57,365
but I have no other regret.

1520
01:40:57,367 --> 01:41:00,245
With respect to...

1521
01:41:00,247 --> 01:41:02,135
Mr. Churchill.

1522
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,198
He is a disgrace
to the name of man.

1523
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,885
And is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman?

1524
01:41:08,887 --> 01:41:12,760
Jane, Jane...
you'll be a miserable creature.

1525
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:16,565
Everything turns out
for his good.

1526
01:41:16,567 --> 01:41:19,189
His-his aunt is in the way,
his aunt dies.

1527
01:41:19,191 --> 01:41:20,534
He uses everybody ill,

1528
01:41:20,536 --> 01:41:22,965
and-and-and they're delighted
to forgive him.

1529
01:41:22,967 --> 01:41:25,079
He is a fortunate man, indeed.

1530
01:41:26,807 --> 01:41:28,214
You speak as if you envied him.

1531
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:31,158
And I do envy him.

1532
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,005
Emma.

1533
01:41:34,007 --> 01:41:37,847
In one respect,
he is the object of my envy.

1534
01:41:47,512 --> 01:41:49,238
You will not ask me why.

1535
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,254
You are... you-you are...

1536
01:41:51,256 --> 01:41:54,198
you are determined, I see,
to have no curiosity.

1537
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,629
You are wise.

1538
01:41:56,631 --> 01:41:58,101
But I cannot be wise.

1539
01:41:58,103 --> 01:42:01,365
I must tell you, Emma,
what you will not ask,

1540
01:42:01,367 --> 01:42:02,870
though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.

1541
01:42:02,872 --> 01:42:04,727
Oh, then do not speak it.

1542
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:20,085
If you wish to speak to me...

1543
01:42:20,087 --> 01:42:21,717
as a friend

1544
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:23,990
or to ask my opinion...

1545
01:42:23,992 --> 01:42:25,653
as a friend,

1546
01:42:25,655 --> 01:42:27,317
I will hear whatever you like.

1547
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:29,558
"As a friend." Emma, that,
I fear, is a word...

1548
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,502
Tell me, Emma.

1549
01:42:32,504 --> 01:42:35,159
Have I no chance
of ever succeeding?

1550
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:37,461
My dearest Emma,

1551
01:42:37,463 --> 01:42:39,381
for dearest you will always be,

1552
01:42:39,383 --> 01:42:41,942
my dearest, most beloved Emma,
tell me at once.

1553
01:42:41,944 --> 01:42:44,118
I cannot make speeches.

1554
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,974
If I...

1555
01:42:45,976 --> 01:42:47,573
If I... if I loved you less,

1556
01:42:47,575 --> 01:42:50,102
then I might be able
to talk about it more,

1557
01:42:50,104 --> 01:42:51,830
but y-y-you-you...

1558
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,462
you know what I am.

1559
01:42:53,464 --> 01:42:56,405
I have... I have lectured you,

1560
01:42:56,407 --> 01:42:59,510
and I've...
I've blamed you, and...

1561
01:42:59,512 --> 01:43:02,037
and you have borne it
as no other woman in England

1562
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:03,381
could have borne it.

1563
01:43:03,383 --> 01:43:06,102
God knows I have been
a very indifferent lover.

1564
01:43:06,104 --> 01:43:07,605
But you understand me.

1565
01:43:07,607 --> 01:43:09,463
You-you understand my feelings.

1566
01:43:15,287 --> 01:43:16,567
Will you marry me?

1567
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:21,173
Oh.

1568
01:43:21,175 --> 01:43:22,262
Emma.

1569
01:43:22,264 --> 01:43:24,949
Oh.

1570
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:26,229
Emma.

1571
01:43:26,231 --> 01:43:28,757
- Oh.
- Emma.

1572
01:43:28,759 --> 01:43:29,781
Oh.

1573
01:43:29,783 --> 01:43:31,094
- Emma.
- Uh, no, I...

1574
01:43:31,096 --> 01:43:32,693
- Emma.
- Oh.

1575
01:43:32,695 --> 01:43:34,902
No, I...

1576
01:43:34,904 --> 01:43:37,397
I...

1577
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:39,317
I-I cannot.

1578
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:40,629
Why not?

1579
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:41,685
Harriet!

1580
01:43:41,687 --> 01:43:43,478
- Harriet? Wh...
- She's in love with you!

1581
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,494
And she believes that you may love her, too.

1582
01:43:45,496 --> 01:43:48,245
And... and you danced with her!

1583
01:43:48,247 --> 01:43:50,262
- Oh. Oh.
- And shown her kindness

1584
01:43:50,264 --> 01:43:53,013
and took notice of her
at Donwell

1585
01:43:53,015 --> 01:43:55,864
and spoke of farming and...

1586
01:43:58,551 --> 01:43:59,958
And seemed on the verge
of asking

1587
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,461
if her affections were engaged!

1588
01:44:01,463 --> 01:44:03,413
To Robert Martin!
To Robert Martin!

1589
01:44:03,415 --> 01:44:04,565
She told you this?

1590
01:44:04,567 --> 01:44:07,221
I cannot break her heart again.

1591
01:44:07,223 --> 01:44:09,525
I shall... I shall
call on Robert Martin

1592
01:44:09,527 --> 01:44:10,997
this very evening.

1593
01:44:10,999 --> 01:44:12,213
I shall urge him
to put his suit

1594
01:44:12,215 --> 01:44:13,845
to Miss Smith a second time.

1595
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:15,222
He still loves her.
I'm certain that he does.

1596
01:44:15,224 --> 01:44:16,502
He need only ask again.

1597
01:44:16,504 --> 01:44:18,005
Not-not by letter,
but in person.

1598
01:44:18,007 --> 01:44:20,757
No.

1599
01:44:20,759 --> 01:44:22,807
No, I must do it.

1600
01:44:26,519 --> 01:44:28,247
I must go.

1601
01:45:09,976 --> 01:45:11,831
Mr. Martin...

1602
01:45:13,559 --> 01:45:15,415
...I have a confession to make.

1603
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:20,405
I have caused you
great suffering.

1604
01:45:20,407 --> 01:45:23,224
As I have also caused
the suffering of my friend.

1605
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:28,055
My dearest friend.

Harriet.

1615
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:11,927
Mr. Robert Martin
has offered me his hand.

1616
01:46:13,943 --> 01:46:15,831
I have accepted.

1617
01:46:17,272 --> 01:46:20,567
Then he is the most fortunate
man of my acquaintance.

1618
01:46:21,944 --> 01:46:23,639
Harriet, I...

1619
01:46:26,872 --> 01:46:28,727
There is something else.

1620
01:46:33,464 --> 01:46:35,991
I have had a letter
from my father.

1621
01:46:37,911 --> 01:46:40,984
Now that I have come of age,
he has revealed himself.

1622
01:46:42,967 --> 01:46:45,557
He is a tradesman.

1623
01:46:45,559 --> 01:46:47,990
In Bristol.

1624
01:46:47,992 --> 01:46:49,847
He makes galoshes.

1625
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:57,111
He comes to Highbury next week
on purpose to meet with me.

1626
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:05,207
Then I hope you will
bring him to Hartfield.

Do you feel a draft,
Mr. Knightley?

1646
01:48:40,823 --> 01:48:43,221
About the knees.

1647
01:48:43,223 --> 01:48:46,805
I-I cannot say that I do, sir.

1648
01:48:46,807 --> 01:48:47,960
Ah.

1649
01:48:49,559 --> 01:48:51,223
Pity.

1650
01:48:54,616 --> 01:48:56,023
In fact...

1651
01:48:57,175 --> 01:48:58,358
Yes.

1652
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:00,117
- A chill draft.
- Chill.

1653
01:49:00,119 --> 01:49:01,622
The screen. Bartholomew!

1654
01:49:01,624 --> 01:49:03,031
Charles, make haste.

1655
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,261
No, not that... This one.

1656
01:49:23,128 --> 01:49:24,951
No, not that one. This one.

1657
01:49:26,839 --> 01:49:29,111
How could I ever leave him?

1658
01:49:33,016 --> 01:49:35,030
He can remove with you
to Donwell.

1659
01:49:35,032 --> 01:49:37,493
You know he never would.

1660
01:49:37,495 --> 01:49:39,223
He could not stand it.

1661
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:42,135
Then I shall come here.

1662
01:49:45,592 --> 01:49:47,157
You would quit the abbey?

1663
01:49:47,159 --> 01:49:49,205
Yes.

1664
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:51,893
Sacrifice your independence?

1665
01:49:51,895 --> 01:49:53,462
Yeah.

1666
01:49:53,464 --> 01:49:57,302
And live constantly with my
father in no house of your own?

1667
01:49:57,304 --> 01:49:58,871
Yeah.

1668
01:50:00,952 --> 01:50:04,471
Uh, h-how
is it now, Mr. Knightley?

1669
01:50:06,712 --> 01:50:09,109
It's much better now.

1670
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:06,741
Dearly beloved friends,

1671
01:52:06,743 --> 01:52:10,550
we gather here
in the sight of God

1672
01:52:10,552 --> 01:52:14,037
to join together this man

1673
01:52:14,039 --> 01:52:18,869
and this woman
in holy matrimony,

1674
01:52:18,871 --> 01:52:23,765
an honorable estate
instituted by God

1675
01:52:23,767 --> 01:52:28,309
in the time of man's
great innocence.
