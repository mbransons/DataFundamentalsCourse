1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,500


2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,074


3
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,801
Hello, John.
-Hi, Bill.

4
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:03,702
-See you later.
-Okay, good bye.

5
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,603
Kent Marlowe. Manslaughter.
Sentenced to ten years.

6
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:14,504
-First time in prison?
-Yes.

7
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:16,105
Sir, to me.

8
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:18,706
-Yes, sir.

9
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,606
-How old are you?
-Twenty-four, sir.

10
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,407
Ever served in the army, navy,
marine corps?

11
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:25,908
No, sir.

12
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,209
-Use tobacco?
-Yes, sir.

13
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,610
Morphine, opium, cocaine?

14
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,611
No, sir.

15
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:32,812
Frisk him.

16
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,513
You can have your cigarettes.

17
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,114
-Married?
-No, sir.

18
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,955
That's my sister.

19
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,856
-You can have the photographs.
-Thank you, sir.

20
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,157
You'll get the rest back
when you leave prison.

21
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:14,758
From now on you'll be number 48642.

22
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,159
Give him the works.

23
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Give him 24.

24
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,361
-Two blankets.
-Two blankets.

25
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,002
-Coat 36.
-Coat 36.

26
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:44,303
-Underwear 4.
-Underwear 4.

27
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,564
-Pants 5.
-Pants 5.

28
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,900
-Shirt 16.
-Shirt 16.

29
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,900
-Cap 7.

30
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,301
-Shoes 8 1/2.
-Shoes 8 1/2.

31
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,602
Change your clothes in there.

32
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:08,503
-Arm length, 35, one half inches.
-35 1/2.

33
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,104
-Scar on the left fourth finger.
-Left fourth finger.

34
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,105
Out this way.

35
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:45,900
I hate to see a young fellow like you
in here for manslaughter.

36
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,301
It was an accident, sir.

37
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:49,802
Yes, I remember your case
very well.

38
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:53,500
-You ran a man down with your car...
-Yes, sir, It was New Year's Eve...

39
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,801
You were drunk.

40
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,852
-Yes, sir.
-Now you're here to pay for that crime...

41
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,453
with ten years of your life.

42
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:04,154
Do you realize that?

43
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,855
Yes, sir.

44
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:08,956
Your sentence can be reduced
by good behavior

45
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,057
and close observance of the prison rules.

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,758
While you're not in the
common sense of the word a criminal,

47
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,559
I want to warn you against
the influences you'll encounter here...

48
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
or In any other prison.

49
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:21,561
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:26,002
So you be careful of your conduct...

51
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,503
and your associations.

52
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:28,504
Yes, sir.

53
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:29,805
And remember this.

54
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,996
Prison does not give a man
a yellow streak.

55
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:36,497
but if he has one, it brings it out.

56
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,008
That's all.

57
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,609
Well, Raggart, what is it?

58
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,810
Do you know who they're putting
that boy in with?

59
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,400
No. Who?

60
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:59,501
Morgan. The slickest crook
we ever had here.

61
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,602
And Machine Gun Butch.

62
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:02,603
Yes?

63
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:13,800
A weak kid like that thrown in
with a murderer and a gun man?

64
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,501
Now, now, Pop, don't you get
chicken-hearted again.

65
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,302
He might have a chance
in a cell alone.

66
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:23,103
Yes, I warned them at the last
governor's council.

67
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:27,304
We have 3,000 here
and cell accommodations for 1800.

68
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,600
They all want to throw people
into prison

69
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,801
but they don't want to provide
for them after they are in.

70
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,102
And you mark my word, Pop.

71
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,603
Someday we're going to pay
for this shortsightedness.

72
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,304
Sure, the whole prison system
is cockeyed.

73
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,395
-Yeah?
-Here's a peach for you, Sandy.

74
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:16,506
-Goes In 265 with Butch and Morgan.
-Okay.

75
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:20,707
Come on, boy.

76
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,208
Upstairs to the left.

77
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,109
Here we are.

78
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,510
Hello, Jim.

79
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,611
Take off your ear muffs.

80
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,312
I said hello.

81
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,313
Hello.

82
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:27,614
Make yourself at home.
That's your flop up there.

83
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,815
Thank you.

84
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,006
What's your name?

85
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,507
I said what's your name?

86
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,708
Kent Marlowe.

87
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,609
Mine's Schmidt.

88
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,510
I'm known the world over
as Machine Gun Butch.

89
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,811
You heard of me. That's a cinch.

90
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:49,012
You never heard of the Delancey gang
being wiped out?

91
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,413
Well, I done the wipin'.

92
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:55,414
$500 bucks for bumping off three.

93
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,715
That ain't much, it's cheap.

94
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,006
What's your racket?
What you in for?

95
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,607
-Manslaughter.
-Manslaughter!

96
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:07,508
Well, you ain't no morning glory
after all.

97
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,709
Press the flesh.
Who did you croak?

98
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,610
-It was an accident.
-An accident?

99
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,611
Yeah, I was driving a car...

100
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,012
-Oh, you're all wet ears.
Your nose ain't even dry.

101
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,613
-What do you mean?
-I'll show you what I mean, kid.

102
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:22,814
I'll learn you a lot of things
before we're through with you in here.

103
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,915
Morg, there's company in the parlor.

104
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,316
Morgan is my name.

105
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,317
Kent's mine.

106
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:34,018
How are you?

107
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,419
Don't you ever have any air in here?

108
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,920
Sure, plenty. All hot.

109
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,321
How long have you been here?

110
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,822
Three years.

111
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,823
-What for?
-Robbery.

112
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:49,424
I can't stand thieves.

113
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,445
-Hey, my cigarettes.
-What?

114
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,646
You took my cigarettes.

115
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,747
Why, you dirty little liar,
you didn't have no cigarettes.

116
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:56,898
Yes, I did, and you stole them.

117
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,999
Stop your belly aching
before I slough you one.

118
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Come on, give me back
those cigarettes.

119
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,951
You're dingy, you didn't have no cigarettes.
Give me those cigarettes!

120
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,252
-Oh, get out!
-I'll show you crooks

121
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,500
I won't stand for treatment like this.
Hey, guards!

122
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:10,201
Stop your squawking.
Crooks, are we?

123
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:13,002
-Well, Mr. High Hat, I'll show...
-Let go of me!

124
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,103
Pipe down, pipe down...

125
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,504
Hey, hey, what's wrong in here?

126
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,705
-He took my cigarettes.
-Did he, Morgan?

127
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,606
I don't know, sir.
I was asleep.

128
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:23,177
Did you take the kid's cigarettes?
No, sir...

129
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,400
They're both lying!

130
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:26,701
Less noise or you'll spend
your first night in the dungeon.

131
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:30,202
Aw, don't put the kid in the cooler.
He's clean.

132
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:32,703
He just went off his nuts.
He won't do it again.

133
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:35,004
Well, you watch your stuff,
understand?

134
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,405
Well, mister yellowbelly, you're gonna get
your first lesson right now.

135
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:47,206
You can't squeal and in stir.

136
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,407
That's that.

137
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,608
Now lay off that stuff, Butch,
do you hear?

138
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:56,609
Aw, he's only stunned.
I didn't bat him hard.

139
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,210
-Put him in his bunk.
-Yeah?

140
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:00,711
Yeah.

141
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,412
Okay.

142
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,113
Now give him back his cigarettes.

143
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,414
-What?
-You heard me.

144
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,000
Why, I ain't got his old weeds.

145
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,300
Don't lie to me, Butch.

146
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,600
Say, listen, I bumped off guys
for calling me a liar.

147
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,101
Yeah, and look where you are now.

148
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,302
-Who me?
-Yes, you.

149
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,103
Well, look where you are too.

150
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:37,399
That's right, Butch, both of us.

151
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,490
The quick and the dead,
the clever and the dumb.

152
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,600
What?

153
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,901
You know, from the neck down
you're a regular guy, Butch.

154
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,102
Now give the kid back his cigarettes.

155
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:48,803
-Who me?
-Yes, you.

156
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,804
Okay.

157
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,700
I was only kidding.

158
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:01,801
-Just kidding, that's all.
-Sure, I knew that all the time.

159
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,202
Now put them up in his pocket.

160
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,503
I said put them up in his pocket.

161
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,900
Gee!

162
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,701
It reminds me of Sadie.

163
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:33,202
Gee, Sadie was a good old skirt.

164
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:40,303
I shouldn't have slipped her
that ant poison.

165
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:48,704
I should've just battered her
in the jaw a few times.

166
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,905
-Get off of my stones, will ya?
-Get back into line there.

167
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:14,106
You got everything all set?
Sure, this time...

168
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:19,307
We heard you're slated
to get out soon.

169
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:21,508
What do you mean?
Who told you that?

170
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:24,409
Jim, the trusty over at the warden's office.
He's in on everything.

171
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,110
And he heard something about me?

172
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah, the warden said you're
too nice a kid to keep here.

173
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,600
-They're gonna let me go?
-Sure they are.

174
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:32,601
How soon?

175
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:35,002
Just as soon as the warden gets
the ok from the governor.

176
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,103
-Gee, you're a lucky guy.
-Are you Kent Marlowe?

177
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,304
-Yeah.
-Wallace wants to see you.

178
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,800
What does he want to see me for?

179
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,001
To tell you the good news,
that you've been pardoned.

180
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:44,002
Gee, that's great.

181
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,303
Wait a minute.
Aren't you gonna say good bye?

182
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:49,999
Sure, good bye.
Be good, Kent. So long, kid.

183
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,100
Hey, where are you heading?

184
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,951
-Captain Wallace wants to see me.
-You can't go in there. Get back.

185
00:15:57,952 --> 00:15:59,452
What's going on out here?

186
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,003
They said you wanted to see me, sir,
about my parole.

187
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:03,600
Who said that?

188
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,301
They did, that trusty over there...

189
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:09,302
It's true, isn't It?
They weren't ribbing me, were they?

190
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,303
Sure, they're kidding you, Kent.

191
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,104
Then I'm not going out.

192
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:18,905
No, you're going to be with us
for a long time.

193
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,906
Go on, beat it.

194
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,307
Sore are you?
What's the matter, boy?

195
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:32,908
Are you going home?

196
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:37,209
Hey, you. No ganging up here.
Come on, keep this place clear.

197
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,910
Scatter out.

198
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:44,711
Hey, Pop, any letters for me?

199
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,652
Move on, now. If there was,
I wouldn't give them to you.

200
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:51,003
Oh, go on, be a sport,
will you?

201
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,704
Are there any letters for Morgan?

202
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,205
You know, Pop,
if all screws were like you...

203
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,606
Oh, you cut out the apple sauce.

204
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,387
And don't be calling the guards screws.

205
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,788
Yes, sir.

206
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,409
No letters for you, Morgan.
But I've got one for Butch and Kent.

207
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,610
Fine, I'll take them to them.
Thanks, Pop.

208
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,154
-I used to milk a cow all the time.
-Letter for you, Butch.

209
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:14,815
-Letter for me?
-Yes, you.

210
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:19,242
Gee, why don't those dames
let me alone?

211
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:21,938
You're such a deal, Butch.
You can't blame them.

212
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,900
Where's Kent?
Haven't seen him.

213
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:26,795
Hey, stick around.
I'll bet this is a hot one.

214
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,726
Oh, boy.

215
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:30,587
Look at that.

216
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,118
Why, it's from Myrtle.

217
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,649
-Myrtle?
-Yeah.

218
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,844
-I thought you croaked her.
-No, that was Sadie.

219
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:40,405
This girl is nuts about me.

220
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,739
-About you?
-Yes, me.

221
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,297
Wait a minute, I'll show you.

222
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,259
"Dear sweetheart..."

223
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:54,650
"How I miss my great big boy."

224
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,578
"You have it."

225
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,003
Hot doggy.

226
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:05,732
"The only fun I get is sleeping...

227
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:10,461
because then I dream
about you every night."

228
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,348
The rest of this
is too juicy for you guys.

229
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,546
Nobody gets to read this
but me and my pal Morg.

230
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:20,841
Come on, Morg.

231
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:22,999
Aw, come on.

232
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,136
Go on, dream about it.

233
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:29,127
I'm going to read this.
You and me, Morg.

234
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,524
Hey, come on, scram.

235
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,921
-Hey, what's the big idea?
-Get out of here, go on, go on.

236
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,910
Say, Morg...

237
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,105
Who do you suppose
would write me a letter?

238
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,234
I'll read It to you, Butch.

239
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,630
Say, if I even knew
a dame called Myrtle,

240
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,056
I'd kick her teeth out.

241
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,317
Go on, read it.
Who's it from?

242
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,310
Well, it's about your mother, Butch.

243
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,074
-My old lady?
-Yeah.

244
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,803
Gee, she's been holding out on me.
I didn't even know she could write.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,862
Well, It isn't from her, Butch.
It's from a guy named Tony Loop.

246
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,489
-It's about...
-Nothing wrong. Go on, read it.

247
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,047
"Dear Butch,
when your mother was sick,

248
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,441
"She didn't want me
to write no letter and tell you,

249
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:24,469
"Even when
they took her to the county hospital.

250
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:27,133
"I went to see her
a couple of times,

251
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,000
"And she said you
had enough to worry

252
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,959
"Without having
to think about her.

253
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,555
"Anyway, she...

254
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,653
"She died yesterday.

255
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,700
"And as we couldn't get enough money
to give her a send-off,

256
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,180
"we had to let the hospital
take care of it.

257
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,638
"Anyway, we sent her
a bunch of flowers,

258
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,302
"And I guess that's all.

259
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:48,931
Yours truly, Tony Loop."

260
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:00,479
Gee, I can't believe it, Morg.

261
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,812
Ma's dead.

262
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:07,304
-I wonder if it hurt her much.
-Oh, I don't think so, Butch.

263
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:10,220
-She probably just dropped off quietly.
-Yeah?

264
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,200
Yeah, she was pretty old,
wasn't she?

265
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,690
About 70...

266
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,285
And as big as a minute...

267
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:17,886
And game.

268
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,314
And, say, the last time
I was arrested,

269
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:24,905
She fought like a wildcat.

270
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,337
It took two bulls
to hold her,

271
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:30,499
and she almost bit
the thumb off of one of them.

272
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:36,386
Gee, she was a swell old lady.

273
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,008
I wish you would have
met her, Morg.

274
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,711
So do I, Butch.

275
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:46,735
Say, Morg...

276
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,866
I'm going to make
a break.

277
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,896
I'm going to get out of here,

278
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,788
and I'm going to give
that little old lady

279
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,919
the swellest funeral she ever had.

280
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,449
Pipe down, will you?
Here comes Oliver.

281
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,442
Hello, Morgan. Got a match?

282
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,208
Sure.

283
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:09,769
Thanks.

284
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,192
Good news, Butch?

285
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:16,657
Bad news whenever you come around.

286
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,284
Great kidder, isn't he, Morg?

287
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes, and he's not always kidding.

288
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,267
You know, that guy's
a stool pigeon if ever there was one.

289
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,663
I wish I could get
the lowdown on him.

290
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,262
I'll knife him
someday.

291
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:35,999
Aw, that kind of talk
won't get you anywheres.

292
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,722
I'm going to break
this place wide open.

293
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:40,819
Yeah, and then what will happen to you?
Down in the dungeon with the rats.

294
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:43,800
No, we got to take our medicine, Butch.

295
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,406
It's all right for you to talk,

296
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,307
you'll be going out of here
in a few years.

297
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,859
But what do I gain
eating this dirt?

298
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:53,397
I'd go nuts if I
didn't start trouble once in a while.

299
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,926
I'd rather stand up and fight,
and even if I got the rope,

300
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:01,003
It's better than sitting here rotting
in this stinking hole.

301
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:02,814
Aw, cut out that talk, Butch,
do you hear?

302
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,281
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

303
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,474
Okay.

304
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,358
I was only kidding.

305
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,159
Sure.

306
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:21,494
Hey, listen, Butch.
How about that hot number of yours?

307
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,649
The gang wants to hear it again.

308
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,182
Go on, read it.

309
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:26,344
All right, I'll read it once more.

310
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:29,672
Seen Kent around anywhere?

311
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,502
Yeah. He's around the corner
with Oliver.

312
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:38,026
What about Morgan?
Morgan?

313
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:39,789
Who knows anything about him?

314
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,000
But Butch... listen, Oliver.
That guy will kill me someday.

315
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:46,115
-He packs a knife.
-Oh, he packs a knife, does he?

316
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,142
Don't let that worry you.

317
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,640
That knife's gonna get him into trouble.

318
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,999
Say, listen, you guys.

319
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:53,532
If I ever catch either one of you
double-crossing Butch,

320
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,530
I'm going to get you.
Do you understand?

321
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:58,860
-Now, Kent, you keep away from this rat.
-What do you mean?

322
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,687
He's the only guy that's been decent
to me since I've been here.

323
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:04,296
I was only trying
to give him some good advice.

324
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah?
Well, beat it, do you hear?

325
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:10,374
I'll give you some good advice, Kent.
You're in a tough spot.

326
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,800
But you've got to learn that whining
and double-crossing

327
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:13,999
isn't going to get you anywhere.

328
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,096
I'm not whining.
I won't stand for your ribbing.

329
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,490
What right have they got to poke at me...

330
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,594
And you, a robber, bragging about it?

331
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:21,907
Oh, I see. Too good
for the rest of us, huh?

332
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:25,785
Well, if you're wise, you'll stand up
and take your joe like a regular guy.

333
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,279
Yeah?
Yeah.

334
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,804
Here's a letter for you.

335
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:40,924
Get wise, kid.
Play up to Morgan and Butch.

336
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,751
They run the joint here,
and if they're off you,

337
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,604
they'll make it tough for you.

338
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:50,207
If you're friends with them,
they'll let you in on their plans.

339
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:54,432
What do you mean?

340
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,696
I'll tell you later.

341
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

342
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,955
Kid, you trust me.
I'm your friend.

343
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,054
These three dames
were crazy about me, see.

344
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:38,056
Say, Butch...
Butch, I had a dream last night.

345
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,561
Aw, cut It out. You're full of hop.

346
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,588
A dame said to me, she said,
"if you'll come up...

347
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,017
I...I...I was sitting on a velvet cushion,

348
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:49,344
And--and about a thousand
beautiful blue-eyed blondes

349
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,674
was dancing all around me.

350
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,703
Aw, gee, I'd go nutty
over a rag doll.

351
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,464
Hey, look.
Ohh... look!

352
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:01,324
Look. A beautiful butterfly!

353
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,187
Aw, you're crazy.
That's a racehorse.

354
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:05,551
Look at that sucker run.

355
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,912
I bet he'll make to the top
of the wall in 10 seconds.

356
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:13,273
Say, look at the build
on that filly.

357
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,736
I'll take the thin one, Butch.
This is mine.

358
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:18,794
Say, what'll you bet my racehorse
can't trim that one of yours?

359
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,803
You're on.
Hey, Mr. Butch, I'll hold the stakes.

360
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,488
Yeah, who's gonna hold you?

361
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,684
Come on, get up your cigarettes.
Let's have a race here.

362
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:29,445
Come on, put them out there.

363
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:31,541
All right, you boys,
make your bets.

364
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,137
I'll cover all your bets.

365
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:37,001
Two packs of weeds
on my thin one.

366
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,797
All right, make all your bets.

367
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,925
Cover this, Butch.
I'm betting on Morgan's bug.

368
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,951
Come on. Get in there.
I'm covering.

369
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,179
Say, listen, you... what about these?

370
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,042
No, you...you can't
because The Hawk gave me this

371
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:55,273
to buy him a pair
of s-s-suspenders with,

372
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:58,105
and if I don't bring them back,
he'll tear my head off.

373
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:00,162
Aw, come on.
Get in there with them.

374
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,604
Oh, yeah. s-s-s-sure.

375
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:03,724
All right. Come on, now.

376
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:05,487
All right, come on, now,
give me the bugs.

377
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:07,483
I'll warm them up.
All right.

378
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,584
Here you go.
Watch them run.

379
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,009
You all ready?
You all set?

380
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,905
All right, there they go.

381
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:16,736
Look at him go.

382
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,264
Look at that bug go.

383
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:23,925
Hey, Butch, your b-b-b-bug

384
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:29,150
There he goes. Over the line,
over the line.

385
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:33,512
I win. I win.
That's just too bad.

386
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:37,900
Chewing gum.

387
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:43,295
I say, no wonder that bug
couldn't run.

388
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:44,992
Chewing gum, eh?

389
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,003
Who done that?

390
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,209
Come on.

391
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:59,667
What porch-climbing crook done that?

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,266
You did.

393
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:04,130
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

394
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,400
What's the big idea?

395
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,947
You wouldn't double-cross
a pal, would you, Butch?

396
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:15,042
Any more of you guys
think I pulled a phony?

397
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,739
-You, Joe?
-Not me.

398
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,636
-You, Putnam?
-N-No.

399
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,831
-You can't get away with that, Butch.
-No?

400
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:32,779
You're asking for it, ain't you?

401
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,611
One wiggle out of you
and I'll give it to you.

402
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,900
Listen, you guys are liable
to get the hole for this.

403
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:42,299
Yeah, you'll get the hole,
just 5' 10".

404
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,494
They'll have to dig it
big enough for two.

405
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,061
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

406
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:47,469
Look out, Butch!

407
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,809
Ditch that knife.
Here comes Wallace.

408
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,144
Well, what's coming off here?

409
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:58,838
Me and Morgan was just
rassling a bit, sir.

410
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,773
Sure you weren't mixing up
a little fighting with it, huh?

411
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,298
Who, me?
No, sir.

412
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,193
You better not, or I'll fix up
a lot of dark days for you.

413
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,483
-Gambling, huh?
-No, sir. Not me.

414
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:15,511
How did those cigarettes
and tobacco get here?

415
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:18,907
Well, uh... I was packing them
in my shirt, sir,

416
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:23,100
and Morgan and me
starts rassling, and I get sweaty,

417
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,395
so I lay them out
on the ground to dry.

418
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:28,001
-Don't lie to me.
-I wouldn't lie, no, sir.

419
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:31,600
-Let them alone.
-What's that you said?

420
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:33,247
I said, yes, sir.

421
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:37,309
Another move out of you,
and you'll go to the dungeon.

422
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,264
-Who did that?
-I did, wrestling with Butch.

423
00:28:46,762 --> 00:28:49,558
Well, the next time I see you,
you better have it fixed.

424
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,351
You get me?

425
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:54,811
Bring that stuff.

426
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:01,000
I hate his guts.

427
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,468
It's a good thing I warned you.

428
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,365
If Wallace had seen that knife...

429
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,593
Yeah. You ain't such a bad skunk
as I thought you was.

430
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:11,100
-Get a move on, all of you!
-I'll move. I'll move.

431
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,526
I'll move...

432
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:10,824
Fish again.

433
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:14,620
-That dirty, rotten, stinkin' codfish.
-Yeah. It's spoiled.

434
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:23,705
Oh, look!

435
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:27,833
It's so terrible it's even killed one
of our poor little b-b-bu--

436
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,390
...cockroaches.

437
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:36,218
Ohh...

438
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:42,679
Nice tenderloin steak
with mushrooms all over it, gee!

439
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:46,738
I'd like to ram it down their throat.
-Pipe down, Wallace.

440
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,135
You talking, Butch?

441
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,297
Who, me?
No, sir.

442
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:55,861
-I'll get him someday.
-He's on the hunt, Butch.

443
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:57,457
Tell the guys to pipe down.

444
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,458
Pipe down.

445
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,519
Pipe down.

446
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:07,311
I can't eat that stuff!

447
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,908
Who did that?

448
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,739
Me!
What do you think of that?

449
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,603
I want some food.
I don't want any more of this swill!

450
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,300
-Shut up!
-You give me some food to eat!

451
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,500
-I'm not going to eat that junk!
-Shut up, all of you!

452
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,861
Come on, now!

453
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:27,121
Come on!
Give us some food!

454
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:49,427
I ain't afraid of your guns!

455
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,221
I ain't afraid of nobody!

456
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:54,354
Come on, you yellowbellies!
Let's show 'em!

457
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:55,818
That volley went against the wall.

458
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,983
The next time, shoot to kill!

459
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,713
Butch, sit down!

460
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,979
-Yellowbellies! Cowards!
-Sit down, Butch!

461
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,741
It's your last chance!

462
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:11,164
Cover all the entrances.

463
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:17,999
Listen to me, you men.

464
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:21,088
I have treated you squarely,
and you know it.

465
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,484
If you got any grievances
within my power to correct,

466
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,982
...come to me!

467
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,711
You can't gain anything
by starting a row like this.

468
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:31,572
So I'm warning you
for the last time.

469
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,800
I'm running this show,

470
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,669
and I'm ready for you.

471
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,866
That's all.

472
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,499
Wallace!
Who started this?

473
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,529
Butch.

474
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,727
Take him out!

475
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,092
The knife...
What?

476
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,459
The knife.

477
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,996
Butch, in the aisle.

478
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:18,451
-Search him!
-I ain't got nothin'.

479
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,380
No hard feelings, see?

480
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,845
-Nothing on him, sir.
-You had a knife.

481
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:24,143
-Who, me?
-Yes, you!

482
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,572
-No, sir. Someone's been stringing you.
-In the dungeon!

483
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:29,800
What for?
I was only kidding.

484
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,800
Sure, I understand.

485
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,918
Well, that little joke will just cost you...

486
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,793
30 days on bread and water in the dark!

487
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,156
Come on. Move on!

488
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,531
I'm sorry about Butch.

489
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:29,164
-You're what?
-I say, I'm sorry about Butch.

490
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,827
Yeah?

491
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,242
-Who is it?
-Your lawyer.

492
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,777
-Hello, John.
-Hello, Canton. What's up?

493
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,429
-Got a little surprise for you.
-Yeah?

494
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,083
Kid, I got good news for you.

495
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,514
You're gonna be paroled.

496
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,501
Yeah? When?
20 years from now?

497
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,211
Don't be funny. You're gonna leave
this joint tomorrow.

498
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,409
Tomorrow?
Aw, quit your kidding.

499
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm not kidding. It's all settled.
Just came from the warden's office.

500
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,339
Yeah?

501
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:52,434
The next time you'll play it smart.

502
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,033
You say...

503
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:15,579
Hello, sis.

504
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:24,300
What's the matter?
You look so pale.

505
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:25,620
You're not ill, are you?

506
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,599
No, no, but you don't know
how terrible it is here.

507
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:32,297
What have they done
to get me out?

508
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,999
I'm sorry, dear.

509
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:36,793
What do you mean?

510
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,999
We've done everything.
I saw the governor myself.

511
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:45,254
He was very kind.
He said he couldn't do anything.

512
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:50,013
What kind of a dame
would you like to have me get for you?

513
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:51,546
Any kind.

514
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:53,877
How'd you like
a little gal like that?

515
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,274
Say, you're a lawyer, not a magician.

516
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,108
Okay, kid.

517
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:00,503
I'll be around here with a car
in the morning to pick you up.

518
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:02,170
-Fine.
-So long.

519
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:21,320
Oh, Kent, please. I know
you're big enough to see it through.

520
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:22,600
You've got to.

521
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,956
But you don't know what It's like In here.
Every hour, every minute...

522
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,578
It's torture. I'll go crazy.

523
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,211
Honey, but, listen.
You've got to...

524
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:31,000
Anne, listen.
Tell them to try again.

525
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,868
All right. All visitors out!

526
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,332
Good-Bye, good-bye,
good-bye..

527
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,330
Good-bye.

528
00:38:05,507 --> 00:38:07,004
Bad news, kid?

529
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,999
I got to serve out
my full time.

530
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:12,398
No, you haven't.
If you get the goods on somebody,

531
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,298
you get plenty of time off.

532
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:17,597
And if you block a big job,
it may open the gates for you.

533
00:38:23,252 --> 00:38:24,318
Thanks.

534
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,610
How are you?

535
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,512
[Speaking Russian]

536
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:36,314
Oh, you're going to be
a great comfort around here.

537
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,233
-Who's that?
-New guy to take Butch's place.

538
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:56,773
Doesn't speak any English.

539
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,539
What are you doing?

540
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going out
of here tomorrow.

541
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,210
I thought you had
another year.

542
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:04,511
Yeah, I did,
but good behavior got me off.

543
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,746
And that's a very good thing
for you to remember.

544
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:10,148
Think of it.
Bright lights, good food, women!

545
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,399
Say, I saw that sister of yours
in the visitors' room just now.

546
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,401
Yeah?

547
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:16,252
Yeah. That the girl
that owns the bookstore?

548
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,087
-Yeah.
-Swell-Looking kid.

549
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:21,922
You know, I think it's great, Kent,
the way your family stick by you.

550
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,626
Gee, I wish I had a family.

551
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:27,459
I haven't even got a home.

552
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:30,954
Outside, all of you. Come on, Rasputin.
Frisking party.

-[Speaking Russian]
-Shut up!

555
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,999
This your coat, Morgan?

556
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,598
Yes, sir, but that's not my knife.

557
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,000
No. It's Butch's knife.
You know that.

558
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,334
Smart, eh?

559
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,135
-Trying to cover up Butch.
-No, I wasn't, sir.

560
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:35,405
You don't think I'd be crazy enough
to do a thing like that

561
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,307
-...the day before I go out, do you?
-Shut up!

562
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:42,307
Well, this'll just cost you your parole.
-Oh, you can't do that, sir.

563
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,050
I tell you, I never saw that knife before.
It was planted on me.

564
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:46,400
-Ahh...
-I came In the cell,

565
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:48,347
took off my coat, laid it on the bunk.

566
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,748
There was no one In there
but this fellow and...

567
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,317
and then Kent...

568
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,350
You did that.

569
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:57,117
-I didn't do it!
-Don't lie to me!

570
00:40:57,118 --> 00:40:58,618
I didn't do it...

571
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:04,487
I guess the dungeon
will cool him off a bit. Strip him!

572
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:05,891
I'll get you
for this, Kent!

573
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:08,085
Do you hear me?
I'll get you for this!

574
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:10,194
-On your way.
-Do you hear me? I'll get you!

575
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,463
Shut up.

576
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:56,692
Cell 48.

577
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,996
Hello!
Who are you?

578
00:42:55,065 --> 00:42:56,233
Morgan.

579
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:58,165
Morgan, they got you?

580
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah. Where are you, Butch?

581
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:02,502
Second hole away from you.
What happened?

582
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:04,537
They found your knife on me.

583
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,138
-My knife?
-Yeah.

584
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,573
You mean it was planted on you.
Who done it?

585
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:11,477
-Never mind who.
-You tell me, old pal.

586
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:14,452
I'll get him
the first day I'm outside.

587
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:16,122
I'll get him myself.

588
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:21,095
Oh! I knocked over my cup of water!

589
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,898
Oh, forget it, kid!

590
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:27,669
They'll bring you another cup
tomorrow night, the bighearted buzzards!

591
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,480
Can that noise, will you?

592
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:31,881
Hey, Morg!

593
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:35,087
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna make a break, do you hear me?

594
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:36,090
Yeah?

595
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, I'll do it if I have to kill
a flock of screws.

596
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,002
How?

597
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,709
-I'm going to use my brains.
-Ha! Your what?

598
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:47,247
Well, maybe I ain't got no brains,
but I got strength, you hear me?

599
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:48,385
Sure.

600
00:43:48,386 --> 00:43:53,454
Hey, when my time's up,
I'll bet you I'll still be standing on my feet.

601
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,801
-You hear that, Morg?
-Yeah.

602
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:59,597
And you... I bet you'll travel
out of here feet first.

603
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:04,890
You know, that's a swell idea.
-Oh, what do you mean, a swell idea?

604
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,405
Use your brain!

605
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:14,540
# Goin' home...
I'm a goin' home. #

606
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,721
I wish you would go home.

607
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:19,257
# Quiet life... #

608
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,977
Gee, but he was a s-s-swell guy,

609
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:34,747
And s-s-smart, too.

610
00:44:34,848 --> 00:44:40,118
One time he d-d-dug himself
out from underneath a w-w-wall,

611
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:43,296
And It took him 18 months
to do it in.

612
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,570
Yeah? What did he do
with the dirt?

613
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:48,176
Oh, he... he ate it.

614
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,280
Well, he s-s-said he did.

615
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:55,421
Aw, dry up.

616
00:44:55,422 --> 00:44:58,190
That plan of mine would be all right
if we had somebody to work it out.

617
00:44:57,226 --> 00:44:59,560
Yeah, Morgan's the guy to do it.

618
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:01,834
You know, he and Butch
finish their stretch in the hole today.

619
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:17,233
Come out of there, Butch.

620
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:19,800
Come on, come on,
get out of there.

621
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,773
Oh, I'm coming out. I'm...

622
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,885
Well, I'm still on my feet.

623
00:45:28,886 --> 00:45:30,687
Get Morgan out.

624
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:35,762
I ain't heard his voice now
for a week.

625
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:38,867
I told him he'd come out
of there feet first.

626
00:45:41,774 --> 00:45:44,576
He's flat on his back.
Bring in a stretcher.

627
00:46:06,357 --> 00:46:08,228
Get Tony out.

628
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:15,300
You dirty screws! You croaked my pal.
I'll get you for this.

629
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,608
Shut up, or you'll spend
30 days more in the hole.

630
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:19,999
Morg...

631
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,485
I was only kidding... just kidding,
that's all.

632
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,931
Son of a...

633
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,338
-He's just a weak-kneed guy.
-He ain't got no backbone.

634
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:39,582
But me, I'm on my feet.

635
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:41,950
-Shut up!
-Take Morgan to the hospital.

636
00:46:43,423 --> 00:46:45,259
Come on. Let's go.

637
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:54,779
96.

638
00:46:57,996 --> 00:46:59,219
100.

639
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:04,164
Slight congestion.

640
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:05,466
-Doctor?
-Yes?

641
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:08,139
-Carter has just passed away.
-Carter? Oh, yes.

642
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:09,741
Put him in the morgue.

643
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:12,582
Have the wagon
take him away tonight.

644
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,615
Yes, sir.

645
00:47:15,518 --> 00:47:18,889
-Will he be all right, doctor?
-Oh, yes. Yes, I think so.

646
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,000
Number's 44789.

647
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:51,031
Watch the Canadian border.

648
00:48:51,132 --> 00:48:53,735
Watch the best hotels.
That's his racket.

649
00:48:54,436 --> 00:48:56,693
That's the first break
we've had here in five years.

650
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,975
-We'll get him, though.
-How did he make his getaway?

651
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:00,800
-Went out in the dead wagons.
-Well done.

652
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,658
I beg your pardon.

653
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,897
Good evening.

654
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:19,096
Good evening.

655
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:21,604
If you'll just look around,
I'll be with you in a minute.

656
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,244
Thanks. I'm in no hurry.

657
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:44,814
-Here's your book, Mr. Garrett.
-How much is that?

658
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:46,183
$2.00.
$2.00.

659
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:47,920
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

660
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:10,299
Have you found what you wanted?

661
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,700
No, I haven't.

662
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,802
-Well, just what were you looking for?
-A book on the Pacific Islands.

663
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:15,803
A romance?

664
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:19,248
No, no. Something that would give me
an idea of the life there.

665
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,481
Oh.

666
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:25,118
I'm quite sure I have something
in a new shipment that came today.

667
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,958
I'll go and get it
if you don't mind waiting a few minutes.

668
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,333
Not a bit, no.

669
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,117
May I help?

670
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:12,288
Why, yes.
Thank you.

671
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:14,859
I was just going to look
in these boxes.

672
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:19,830
I think the picture... the, uh, travel books
are in the bottom one.

673
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:21,905
Here, let's have a look.
Here. let me help.

674
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:24,086
Well, thank you.

675
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:26,565
You don't mind, do you?

676
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:28,143
Why, no.
Of course not.

677
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:37,076
It's lovely of you
to go to all this... all this trouble.

678
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:38,992
Not at all.
I'm glad to help.

679
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,881
-You know, it's a fun--
-Stay where you are!

680
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:49,701
I thought I recognized you, Mr. Morgan.

681
00:52:50,908 --> 00:52:53,256
I saw you in the visitors' room
at the prison.

682
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,268
Yes, I remember you, too.

683
00:52:55,269 --> 00:52:57,409
Hello... hello.

684
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,824
Give me... give me Police Headquarters.

685
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,813
Yes, please.

686
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:09,812
Never mind.

687
00:53:11,882 --> 00:53:13,761
Well, why didn't you
go through with it?

688
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:15,999
Because...

689
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:20,519
Well, because I just couldn't send you
back there, that's all.

690
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:26,051
You may go now, Mr. Morgan.

691
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:39,085
I'll take that gun.

692
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,245
Thanks.

693
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,242
Oh, good evening.

694
00:53:51,343 --> 00:53:52,446
Hello, Miss Marlowe.

695
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't know you had company.

696
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,503
Oh, that's quite all right.

697
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:59,512
My friend, Mr. Everett,
Sergeant Donlin.

698
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:02,288
-Glad to meet you, Mr. Everett.
-Same here, Sergeant.

699
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,139
Face is kind of familiar.

700
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,746
-Haven't I met you somewhere?
-No, I don't think so, Sergeant.

701
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,162
-No?
-No.

702
00:54:10,534 --> 00:54:10,734
No.

703
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,877
Well, maybe not.

704
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,159
Mr. Everett is one
of my best customers.

705
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,199
Is that so?

706
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,819
I thought it was past your closing time
till I saw the lights.

707
00:54:21,987 --> 00:54:24,465
Well, it is, but we were unpacking
some books.

708
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:25,639
Oh, I see.

709
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,158
Mrs. Donlin like the book I sent her?

710
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:32,296
Huh?
Yes.

711
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:35,483
Well, I have another one that
I'm sure she'll be crazy about.

712
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:36,587
Fine.

713
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:38,733
I'll get it for you.
It's In the next room.

714
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,882
Don't bother.
She'll drive in tomorrow.

715
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,857
Oh, what's that?

716
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,602
The boys are after someone, I guess.

717
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:48,311
Well, I'll be running along.

718
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:51,389
-I'm glad to have met you, Mr...
-Everett.

719
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,634
-Good night, Mr. Everett.
-Good night, Sergeant.

720
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:55,780
-Good night, Miss Marlowe.
-Good night.

721
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:03,654
Thanks.

722
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:05,998
Why did you come here?

723
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,500
To square a bad deal
I got from someone in prison.

724
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:10,964
What do you mean?

725
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:12,935
Well, I was framed.

726
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:16,482
They took my parole away from me
the day before I was to go free.

727
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:18,673
Do you know who framed you?

728
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,119
Yeah. Yeah, I think I know.

729
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,562
Well, good night, Miss Marlowe.

730
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,738
I won't bother you again.

731
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:30,580
-Are you going away?
-Perhaps. I don't know.

732
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,481
I think I understand your bitterness.

733
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,759
If you're ever around here again...

734
00:55:38,932 --> 00:55:40,400
drop in.

735
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:44,252
-Oh, you don't mean that.
-Of course I do.

736
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:47,437
Gee, you're a peach of a girl.

737
00:56:15,144 --> 00:56:17,656
I picked him up one night
and trailed him to a bookstore.

738
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:19,935
-He goes under the name of Everett.
-Everett?

739
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:22,181
Who is she? Is she blond?

740
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:24,428
He's Morgan, all right, all right.

741
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,065
Plenty smart, too.

742
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,410
I lost track of him
for a couple of weeks.

743
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:30,691
When I found him,
he was actually working.

744
00:56:30,692 --> 00:56:32,739
I sent out a man
to spot him.

745
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,515
That night
he quit his job.

746
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,632
Working?
Must be a woman in the case.

747
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:38,900
Yeah.
I know the woman, too.

748
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:40,489
Then you got a line on him.

749
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,341
Sure. I haven't
lost one yet, have I?

750
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:47,059
All right, Eddie.

751
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,999
Let's go.

752
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:12,784
Hello, Dick, how are you?
Glad to see you.

753
00:57:12,922 --> 00:57:15,535
Where's your sister?
She's in the backyard.

754
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:28,394
-Hello, Anne.
-Hello, darling.

755
00:57:28,284 --> 00:57:29,893
-How are you?
-Fine.

756
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,016
Good afternoon, everyone.
How are you, Mr. Marlowe?

757
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,764
Oh, fit as a fiddle.
Younger than ever.

758
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:36,834
Me, too.

759
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:39,999
-Mrs. Marlowe, how are you today?
-I'm fine, thank you.

760
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Anne tells me you're going away,
Mr. Everett.

761
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,300
-We're going to miss you.
-That's awfully nice of you.

762
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:46,362
You know, coming here
has meant a great deal to me.

763
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,707
Oh, you must stay for dinner.

764
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,000
We're going to have corn bread
and fried chicken.

765
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:53,294
-And strawberry shortcake.
-Better stop. I'm liable to miss that train.

766
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:55,775
- Oh, you're not going that soon.
-Yes. Leaving in an hour.

767
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,314
-Oh, that's too bad.
-Oh...

768
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:02,270
I know somebody
that's going to miss you.

769
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:03,573
Why, dad!

770
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:06,847
Don't "why, dad" me.
I wasn't born yesterday.

771
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:08,102
No. Me, neither.

772
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,852
She's been sighing around all morning.

773
00:58:12,054 --> 00:58:14,300
I wondered what was the matter.

774
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:16,480
Now, Dad, I'm ashamed of you.

775
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:18,965
Come on, John.
Don't listen to him.

776
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:23,744
-You're so subtle, Dad.
-Yeah, I can't help It. I...

777
00:58:23,893 --> 00:58:25,807
Oh, now, don't pick on me, Ma.

778
00:58:25,808 --> 00:58:27,789
You love it!

779
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,472
Oh, I'm glad to see Anne happy again.

780
00:58:32,526 --> 00:58:34,240
Well, Anne, I hate to go.

781
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:36,421
Oh, you'll
come back someday.

782
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:38,458
I don't think so.

783
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:41,545
The minute that dick walked into
that place where I was working

784
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:45,597
I knew there was no chance
for me to continue on here.

785
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Wouldn't it be better
if you went back to prison

786
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,283
and served out your time?

787
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:52,309
No. They'd give me
seven more years of it.

788
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,999
I've got a pretty good grip
on myself, Anne,

789
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,470
and I'd like to make a new start.

790
00:58:56,671 --> 00:59:00,457
And my only hope is in some other
country where they can't get me.

791
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:05,111
Well, I suppose you're right.
But I... we'll miss you.

792
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:07,069
Will you really?

793
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,808
You know I will.

794
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,792
Anne, I have no right
to tell you this, but...

795
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,614
you know, I get sort of
a choky feeling...

796
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:17,302
every time I think I'm never
going to see you again.

797
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:20,752
Oh, don't be angry at me
for saying that, will you?

798
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,295
I'm not angry.

799
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:25,016
You see, It's the only way
I have of telling you

800
00:59:25,017 --> 00:59:27,201
how much your friendship
has done for me.

801
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:31,918
Thanks.

802
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,608
What are you going to do?

803
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:37,890
-Work. Does that please you?
-Hm-Hmm.

804
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:40,142
You know, as soon as I get
to the islands...

805
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,448
I'm going to get a little plantation.

806
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:44,266
I've heard of a chap
who made a fortune out there.

807
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:45,743
Oh, that sounds marvelous.

808
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:46,412
Doesn't it?

809
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:49,495
You know, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't mind going.

810
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:52,922
And yet, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be going.

811
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,696
Gosh, how are you
going to figure that one out?

812
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,515
I don't know.

813
00:59:56,516 --> 00:59:57,569
Hello, Morgan.

814
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,770
Let's see what you've got on you.

815
01:00:02,951 --> 01:00:06,002
I guess you didn't know who
this fellow really was, Miss Marlowe.

816
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:07,443
That's too bad.

817
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:09,190
Sergeant, please.
Wait a minute.

818
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:11,472
I'm sorry this had
to happen here, Anne.

819
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:12,740
But I...

820
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:17,215
Now let's get going.

821
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:28,201
Oh, mother!
I love him!

822
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:31,425
Oh, if they'd only give him
another chance!

823
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:39,581
You're going to find things
tougher than ever here.

824
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,972
The state has closed the mill.

825
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:44,453
You know what idleness
does to a man.

826
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:48,073
So you'd better watch your step.

827
01:00:48,274 --> 01:00:49,475
Yes, sir.

828
01:00:50,078 --> 01:00:52,929
All right, Morgan.
Let's go.

829
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,904
Yes, sir.

830
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:05,102
We're gonna have a lot more trouble
with that bird, you'll see.

831
01:01:06,252 --> 01:01:08,396
I think you're wrong,
Wallace.

832
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:10,957
I believe he wants
to go straight.

833
01:01:10,995 --> 01:01:12,086
Straight?

834
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:16,035
Two weeks with the old gang
and he'll be right back where he was.

835
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,430
Maybe.

836
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:21,083
I hope not.

837
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,100
Hello, Morg.

838
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:36,668
Get back over that deadline
or I'll knock your block off.

839
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:38,682
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

840
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,144
Pop's getting tough.

841
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:44,390
How's all the dames outside?

842
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,400
See my initials carved on many
bedposts, Morg?

843
01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:53,712
-How have you been, Butch, huh?
-Oh, okay.

844
01:01:53,803 --> 01:01:57,199
You know, the food's
getting worse here, too.

845
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:00,756
Hello, Morg.

846
01:02:00,957 --> 01:02:02,068
How are you?

847
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:04,748
Well, what's the gang
been up to, Butch?

848
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:07,093
Planning.

849
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:11,206
Six of us is going right out
through that gate.

850
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:12,996
You aren't kidding me, are you?

851
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,417
No, I'm giving it to you straight.

852
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:18,100
-Me and the gopher framed it.
-The gopher?

853
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:20,591
Why, he's been the prison gardener
for seven years.

854
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:22,295
Sure.

855
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,882
He's had an idea
in the back of his bean, though.

856
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:29,614
There he goes now.

857
01:02:41,985 --> 01:02:44,690
For three months, every day
he's been going to that gate.

858
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:47,009
The screw's used to it,
don't pay no attention to him.

859
01:02:47,155 --> 01:02:48,392
Yeah?

860
01:02:48,593 --> 01:02:52,258
Every once in a while, why, he has
an extra big bunch of flowers,

861
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,458
and the screw opens
the gate, savvy?

862
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:56,696
I see. And you six guys go through,
is that it?

863
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,800
-Sure. Simple, ain't it?
-Sure.

864
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,805
What happens when you get
through the inner gate?

865
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,347
We crash that outer gate
and there's a car waiting.

866
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,270
-When does it come off?
-Thanksgiving Day at noon.

867
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:09,063
Most of the screws
go home to turkey dinner.

868
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,569
We'll give them a bellyful.

869
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,655
You know it means the rope, Butch,
if they catch you.

870
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:14,099
Who's in on it?

871
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,449
Well, me, and Olsen,
and Joe. and The Hawk.

872
01:03:18,464 --> 01:03:20,800
-The Hawk? That means blood.
-No...

873
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,958
he promised me
he wouldn't bump nobody off.

874
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,658
-Why, he croaked his own mother.
-Sure he did.

875
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:28,809
He cut her throat.
He was sorry for her.

876
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:30,393
He's all right.

877
01:03:30,497 --> 01:03:31,774
Anybody else
in on it?

878
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,295
Well, there's that
big Swede and Kent...

879
01:03:34,299 --> 01:03:35,301
Kent?

880
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:38,875
Say, listen, you're all wrong
about that Kent guy.

881
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:42,253
It was a Russian that planted
that knife on you, not Kent.

882
01:03:42,264 --> 01:03:44,225
We caught him doing
the same thing to another guy.

883
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:46,063
Yeah?
Sure.

884
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:47,396
I was sure it was Kent.

885
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,863
No. After you
made your getaway,

886
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:54,055
they put the gopher in the same cell
with me and Kent, see?

887
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:57,380
Kent ain't in on the plans,
but he's got to go out with us.

888
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:59,366
We ain't tellin' nobody

889
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:01,788
till we get ready to make the break,
outside of you.

890
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:03,903
Not for me, Butch.
I'm going straight.

891
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:05,508
You wouldn't kid an old friend,
would you?

892
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,933
- You got me all wrong, Butch...
-Hello, Morgan!

893
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:10,000
But I just don't play
a sucker's game, that's all.

894
01:04:10,001 --> 01:04:11,560
-How are you?
-Hey, listen...

895
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,174
don't let that gang know
that you're going straight.

896
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:16,871
They used to have
a lot of respect for you.

897
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:19,690
Hello, Morg.
Welcome b-b-back home.

898
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,030
Hello, Morg.

899
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,700
Hey, listen,
don't gang up here.

900
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,633
Come on. Take a powder,
take a powder.

901
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:26,008
See you later, Butch.

902
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,024
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

903
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:30,009
Let's see that book.

904
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,750
Where's that Bride's Confession
I told you to get me?

905
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:39,999
-Well... well, you see, it's wor-worn out.
-Well, you get me Sappho.

906
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:44,004
Say, you don't mind if I take
a powder, do you, Mr. B-B-B-Butch?

907
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,804
Oh, go on, scram.
Scram.

908
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:49,521
Hey, Kent.

909
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:51,732
I want to talk to you.

910
01:04:51,933 --> 01:04:54,507
Morgan, I want to
explain to you about that knife...

911
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:55,840
Yeah, Butch told me
all about it.

912
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:58,489
What you've done doesn't interest me.
It's what you're going to do.

913
01:05:00,537 --> 01:05:02,181
Are you in on this break?

914
01:05:02,382 --> 01:05:05,262
-Yeah, they took me in on it.
-I know. It's dynamite.

915
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:06,981
They haven't told me
all their plans yet.

916
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:09,695
You keep out of it, do you hear?
Not that I care about you.

917
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,009
But I met that family
of yours, Kent.

918
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,064
They think the world of you.

919
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:15,738
Now, you've caused them
enough trouble,

920
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:18,304
and if anything more happens to you,
they'd never get over it.

921
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:20,482
So you keep out of this break.

922
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,201
It's murder,
and you'll hang for it.

923
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:29,950
Hey, you.

924
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:33,178
Morgan trying
to turn you against the gang?

925
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,006
Yeah, that's what
he was doing, all right.

926
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:39,225
You wouldn't think it
of him, would you?

927
01:05:39,294 --> 01:05:40,506
Aw, he's a rat.

928
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:42,655
I wonder
what Butch will say.

929
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:45,451
Think I'd better go
and tell him.

930
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:48,210
All right.
You tell him.

931
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:52,384
This guy could catch
fish with his hands.

932
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:54,999
He'd reach under the rocks
and get a hold of the fish...

933
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:57,702
Hey, Butch, you take Morgan in?

934
01:05:57,803 --> 01:05:59,179
Morg? Sure.

935
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,125
-You sure he's going with us?
-Sure, he is. He can't wait.

936
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:03,546
-Don't lie to me.
-Who, me?

937
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:06,905
-Why, I never told a lie in my life.
-You know he's not going with us.

938
01:06:06,906 --> 01:06:08,574
I just heard him telling Kent
to keep out of it.

939
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:09,611
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

940
01:06:09,817 --> 01:06:11,506
Said it looked like
a trap to him. Get me?

941
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:13,527
You suppose Morgan
will go yellow?

942
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:15,731
-Who, Morg?
-Well, something's changed him.

943
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:17,396
Yeah, something's changed him.

944
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:18,907
You don't suppose
he'd rat on us?

945
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,186
-What's that you said?
-You don't think he'd squeal?

946
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:24,387
Say, listen,
he wouldn't squeal on nobody.

947
01:06:24,388 --> 01:06:26,400
He's changed. That's all right.

948
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:30,253
But I'll croak the first guy
that says he's a double-crosser.

949
01:06:31,162 --> 01:06:33,581
So Kent's got his ear
to the ground,

950
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,538
and he'll soon have plenty
to tell us.

951
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,219
He thinks the gang
have guns,

952
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,837
but he doesn't know
where they're hidden.

953
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:43,063
I promised him we'd
cut his time in half

954
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:44,784
if he brought us this information.

955
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:46,356
Stool pigeons.

956
01:06:46,357 --> 01:06:49,083
I wish we could
run this place without them.

957
01:06:49,084 --> 01:06:51,570
-Yeah, well, we can't.
-Who's in on it?

958
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,287
All of Butch's gang.

959
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,202
How about giving them solitary?

960
01:06:55,203 --> 01:06:57,098
That would only
keep them quiet for a few weeks.

961
01:06:57,399 --> 01:06:59,179
It isn't any one group.

962
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,640
It's 3,000 idle men
with nothing to do but brood and plot.

963
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:05,200
You can't put them all in solitary.

964
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,202
We can crush them.

965
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:08,069
That's what's
happening to them right now.

966
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,423
We've tried to crush them,
with this result.

967
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:14,145
You search every corner of this prison,
but you find those guns.

968
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,133
Don't worry, sir.
If those guns are here,

969
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:18,996
I'll have them on your desk
before Thanksgiving Day.

970
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:25,381
And now to record
our thankfulness

971
01:07:25,482 --> 01:07:27,305
on this glad Thanksgiving Day,

972
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:32,138
let us rise and sing hymn
number 84.

973
01:07:47,572 --> 01:07:52,540
Ring the bells of heaven.

974
01:07:52,705 --> 01:07:56,834
There is joy today.

975
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:02,553
A lost lamb is returning

976
01:08:02,755 --> 01:08:07,021
From his sinful way.

977
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:12,377
Glory, glory.

978
01:08:12,513 --> 01:08:17,277
How the angels sing.

979
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:22,472
Glory, glory.

980
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:27,266
Loud hosannas ring...

981
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:32,757
with songs of thanksgiving...

982
01:08:32,963 --> 01:08:39,727
Let our voices ring.

983
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,211
Today's the day.

984
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:48,352
Hear the angels sing.

985
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:53,650
Open the gates,
Open the gates

986
01:08:53,849 --> 01:09:03,371
Open the gates and let
the king of glory in.

987
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:06,232
Open the gates,

988
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:08,699
open the gates,

989
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:20,317
open the gates and let
the King of Glory in.

990
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:25,456
And now let us kneel
in prayer.

991
01:09:28,006 --> 01:09:34,880
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

992
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:39,085
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

993
01:09:39,086 --> 01:09:41,527
on earth as it is in heaven.

994
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:44,764
Give us this day
our daily bread

995
01:09:44,837 --> 01:09:47,365
and forgive us our trespasses,

996
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:50,833
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

997
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:53,749
And lead us not into temptation,

998
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,100
but deliver us from evil,

999
01:09:56,301 --> 01:10:00,999
for thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,

1000
01:10:01,007 --> 01:10:04,008
forever and ever. Amen.

1001
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:11,766
The Lord bless you and keep you,
both now and forevermore.

1002
01:10:11,802 --> 01:10:13,237
Amen.

1003
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:17,670
Noon.

1004
01:11:20,003 --> 01:11:21,662
Noon, Swede.

1005
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:24,889
Noon.

1006
01:11:27,903 --> 01:11:29,856
Come on, scram.

1007
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:33,478
-Butch, what's the dope?
-Noon. Watch me.

1008
01:11:34,728 --> 01:11:37,590
Don't go through with it, Butch.
It's a trap. They'll get you.

1009
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:40,000
We'll get through,
if someone don't double-cross us.

1010
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,644
They'll mow you down.

1011
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:43,546
Wallace.

1012
01:11:43,523 --> 01:11:45,969
- Morgan?
-Yes, sir?

1013
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I want to see you
in my office.

1014
01:11:48,655 --> 01:11:49,859
Yes, sir.

1015
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:04,646
Who's in on this break?

1016
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:06,534
I don't know anything
about a break.

1017
01:12:07,332 --> 01:12:09,316
Morgan, you're a liar.

1018
01:12:11,216 --> 01:12:13,964
They've got guns hidden somewhere.

1019
01:12:14,732 --> 01:12:15,952
You know where they are.

1020
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:18,639
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1021
01:12:18,808 --> 01:12:21,089
What kind of a rat
do you think I am?

1022
01:12:21,752 --> 01:12:24,405
Not even if we opened
the gates for you?

1023
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:28,806
Is that all you've
got to say to me?

1024
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,800
I'll have plenty
to say to you later.

1025
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:35,711
Hold him here.

1026
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,808
I can't get anything
out of Morgan, sir.

1027
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:52,300
Don't worry.
I've got the dope from Kent.

1028
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,490
-The break is set for noon.
-Noon?

1029
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:57,659
Just one minute.
What are they going to do?

1030
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,999
Kent couldn't tell me.
I've doubled the gun guards.

1031
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:01,439
Don't you worry.

1032
01:13:04,057 --> 01:13:05,615
Where is he?

1033
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:07,176
Why doesn't he come?

1034
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:09,894
There he is.

1035
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:18,600
Frost is beginning to kill the flowers,
so I picked a whole lot today.

1036
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:22,076
-Make a big bunch, don't they?
-Fine. Thank you.

1037
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:45,615
Grab all those guns.

1038
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:48,834
Get those screws
and take them to the cellar.

1039
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:36,188
Joe! Joe!

1040
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:38,198
-What do you want, Butch?
-We've been double-crossed!

1041
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:40,100
Yes! Morgan done it.
Morgan!

1042
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,377
I'll get that guy
if it's the last thing I do.

1043
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,581
Joe! Get those screws,
put them in the hole.

1044
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:51,336
We'll need them later.

1045
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:54,557
Come on, you guys.
Come on.

1046
01:14:57,175 --> 01:14:58,363
Get in there!

1047
01:15:01,983 --> 01:15:05,367
Any of you guys not with us,
come on, clear out of here!

1048
01:15:05,564 --> 01:15:07,047
Come on, get out of here.

1049
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,929
They're making it
hot for us.

1050
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,582
We'll fix them.
Go and get Sandy!

1051
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,005
Come here, Sandy.
Come out of there.

1052
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,833
Come on.
Get over there.

1053
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,522
Over there.
Come on.

1054
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:25,481
You go to the warden.

1055
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,466
Tell him to open those gates
and let us go through.

1056
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,461
If he don't,

1057
01:16:28,462 --> 01:16:30,517
we're going to bump off
every screw in here

1058
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:32,007
and throw them out in the yard.

1059
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:34,569
-Beginning with Wallace?
-Yes, beginning with Wallace, yes.

1060
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,714
Here, take that gun.

1061
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:39,070
Hang that out that gate.

1062
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:41,589
All right.
Open it just a little bit.

1063
01:16:41,853 --> 01:16:43,052
That much?

1064
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:45,502
All right. Come on.
Put it through there.

1065
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:52,338
All right. Come on. Come out.
Get to moving, you.

1066
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,482
Go on, Wallace, get out there.

1067
01:17:11,136 --> 01:17:13,522
Butch said if you didn't open the gate
and let the gang out,

1068
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:15,736
they're going to kill all the guards
beginning with Wallace.

1069
01:17:20,195 --> 01:17:22,243
I'll see him in hell first.

1070
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,263
Let them have it.

1071
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:17,494
Come on out of there, Wallace.
Come on! Shake it up!

1072
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:33,182
Wallace, you said your prayers?

1073
01:18:33,284 --> 01:18:35,201
I don't know any prayers.

1074
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,658
Go ahead, shoot.

1075
01:18:37,853 --> 01:18:39,670
Aah!

1076
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,275
Wallace!

1077
01:19:06,472 --> 01:19:09,720
Miller! Miller!
Give them the gas bomb.

1078
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:13,602
Open those gates
and let us go through,

1079
01:19:13,603 --> 01:19:16,085
or we'll send the rest of these screws
straight to hell!

1080
01:19:47,594 --> 01:19:50,644
You dirty double-crosser!
They'll get you for this!

1081
01:19:50,672 --> 01:19:51,740
Shut up!

1082
01:19:56,047 --> 01:19:57,765
Butch! Joe!

1083
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:37,667
 Get me another screw out of there!

1084
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:42,806
What's the matter, kid?

1085
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:45,207
Morgan locked the door.
He's got the key!

1086
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,047
Butch!
Butch, come here.

1087
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:48,767
Morgan's got the key.
He's locked the door.

1088
01:21:09,227 --> 01:21:11,183
They'll kill me.

1089
01:21:11,184 --> 01:21:12,411
They'll kill me!

1090
01:21:12,512 --> 01:21:15,429
I didn't mean to squeal!
I didn't mean to...

1091
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,999
They made me do it!

1092
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,575
They made me!
Don't tell Butch. He'll kill me!

1093
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:21,500
So you double-crossed
the gang, huh?

1094
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,226
-You turned them in!
-Don't let them get me, Morgan!

1095
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:26,298
Don't let them get me!

1096
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:30,321
I guess you're not to blame
at that.

1097
01:21:30,422 --> 01:21:32,800
You stay where you are.
I'll attend to this gang.

1098
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:35,156
Don't tell, don't tell  Butch.
I didn't mean to do it!

1099
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,115
The army tanks are here, sir.

1100
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:58,238
All right. Send them in.

1101
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,641
What's that?

1102
01:22:25,234 --> 01:22:27,407
We'll get the rope for this, but I'm going
to get that rat Morgan

1103
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:29,106
if it's the last thing I do.

1104
01:22:30,334 --> 01:22:32,319
Where's Morgan?

1105
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,798
Morgan, you in there?
Come out of there, you rat!

1106
01:22:57,336 --> 01:22:58,795
Come out of there,
you rats!

1107
01:22:58,796 --> 01:23:00,108
Is Morgan there?

1108
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:01,873
-No!
-All right.

1109
01:23:03,428 --> 01:23:05,020
Is Morgan in there?

1110
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,302
I know what you're coming for, Butch.

1111
01:23:09,403 --> 01:23:12,023
But I'm not going to be killed
for something I didn't do.

1112
01:23:12,115 --> 01:23:14,368
If you come
one step nearer...

1113
01:23:15,798 --> 01:23:17,591
He shot me
in the arm, Butch!

1114
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,375
I warned you, Joe!
I didn't double-cross the gang.

1115
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:21,665
You stick your head out of that door,

1116
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,730
and I'll throw a slug between your horns.

1117
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:26,006
-Stand back, Pop!
-Shut up! I'll tell him.

1118
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,232
Butch, this Is Pop Riker.

1119
01:23:28,233 --> 01:23:31,000
You're all wrong, Butch.
Morgan didn't turn you in.

1120
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,600
Even the screws are protecting him.
Come on. Let's go in and get him.

1121
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:34,800
Wait, Butch. My eyes!

1122
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,821
I must be losing my sight.
I'm going blind!

1123
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:38,999
You're all right.
It's only the gas.

1124
01:23:39,008 --> 01:23:41,763
Morgan, we're coming after you,
you snake.

1125
01:23:41,764 --> 01:23:44,713
I warn you, Butch.
Stay where you are! Stay where you are!

1126
01:24:01,157 --> 01:24:03,359
Joe! Joe!

1127
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:06,532
Bring me some more bullets, Joe.

1128
01:24:06,628 --> 01:24:07,730
Oh!

1129
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:32,033
Sorry, Butch.
Did I get you?

1130
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:35,388
-I'm on my feet, see?
-Don't lie to me.

1131
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,400
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

1132
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:41,300
Listen, Butch, it was Kent who sold out
the gang, not Morgan.

1133
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:42,481
Kent?

1134
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,832
You know I wouldn't
double-cross you, Butch.

1135
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:47,300
Sure, I know you wouldn't.

1136
01:24:47,301 --> 01:24:50,574
I was only kidding, that's all.

1137
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,816
Just kidding.
Just...

1138
01:24:53,648 --> 01:24:57,800
Sure. I knew that
all the time.

1139
01:25:34,436 --> 01:25:36,790
I want to thank you, Warden,
for all you've done.

1140
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,685
All ready for
a new start, Morgan?

1141
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,700
Yes, sir, I am.

1142
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,503
Have you made
any plans for your future?

1143
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,569
Yes, sir.

1144
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,715
I thought I'd go to the islands
of some new country

1145
01:25:44,716 --> 01:25:47,008
- and take up government lands.
-Good idea.

1146
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:50,822
New friends, new surroundings,
hard work. That's a man's salvation.

1147
01:25:50,987 --> 01:25:52,840
Are you going alone?

1148
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:54,966
Well, I don't know, sir.

1149
01:25:55,407 --> 01:25:59,150
Well, I wish you luck.
You deserve it.

1150
01:25:59,177 --> 01:26:00,530
Thank you, Warden.

1151
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:13,903
-Well, so long, Pop.
-So long, Morgan.

1152
01:26:13,904 --> 01:26:16,846
See that you don't
get homesick again.
