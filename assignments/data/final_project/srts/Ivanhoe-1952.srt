- You're about to see a story
of bold knights and beautiful maidens.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,520
- A story of love and hatred
and prejudice.

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
- Though our story is old,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,680
- the love, the hatred
and the prejudice are ever new.

in wait for you.

Where is this Jew?

Well?

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,360
Saxons or Normans,
what does it matter to me?

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,320
Do I rejoice because the brave
Normans cross the channel

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,320
and defeat the brave Saxons?
What's the difference?

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
They both treat us like dogs.

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,000
You call them brave knights.
I call them thieves.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,440
A rich merchant, I fear,
is fair game.

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,960
No matter. You have saved my life,
and I am forever in your debt.

Where are you bound?

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
To Ashby, the great tournament.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,280
Why, then, we can
travel together.

36

Ahhhh. May I ask who you are,
that I may thank for my deliverance?

returning from the Holy Land.

Ah!

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Come. To waste any more
time here would be dangerous.

There.

be upon you, pilgrim.

How am I going to repay you?

45

Oh, I want nothing.

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,240
You shall have a horse and
armor for the tournament.

47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,080
But, how did you
know, that I...

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,840
Ha, ha, I see who that was...
beneath your robe.

49
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
The chain mail of a knight
and the golden spurs.

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
You shall have everything
that you need.

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,280
Then, I must warn you, sir,
both horse and armor

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
may be lost in the jousting.

Ahhh, that's impossible.

If it would please, Your Highness,...
- Um? - ...my daughter, perhaps.

111

before the tournament
has yet begun.

Let the gallant knight who
conquers the field here today

make the choice.

115

These three noble challengers
will undertake all comers.

116
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,520
Each challenger may be selected
by touching his shield with a lance.

117

If the shield is touched
with the reverse end of the lance,

118
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,800
then sharp points
will not be used.

119
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,160
But, if the sharp tip of the lance
touches the shield...

120
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,760
then the combat is understood
to be...with sharp weapons.

If any knight should break the lance
of all three challengers here before me,

the victor in this day's combat.

to choose the queen.

[No one steps forward]

[Prince's advisor laughs]

169
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,880
Your Grace, there are none left now
who will meet the challengers.

[an unknown knight rides
out of the woods]

[Cedric shouts]
Is it possible.

Will they let these Normans
invaders take the day?

173
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
The very honor of England
is at stake.

174
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,320
Surely you...

175
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,160
[the hooded knight
continues to approach]

176
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
How annoying that we
should finish so early.

177
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,880
So quickly.

178
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,520
And yet our company to know
that the three strongest knights

179
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,760
on this field,
are loyal only to you.

180

It's him.

185

It's him. The Pilgrim.

186
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,620
Ah, Desdichado,
the Disinherited Knight. Welcome.

187
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,420
You have your choice.

188
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,220
However, the outcome
will remain the same.

189
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,540
I'm disappointed.

190

Would that
I trade places with you Front.

191
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,900
Never.

192
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,460
This one is mine.

[victor's horse rears]

197
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,500
A Saxon.
I'll wager he's a Saxon.

198
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,060
[Brian]  May I hope that you will now
give me the opportunity?

[strikes De Bracy's shield]

200
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,860
What a shame, Brian.

201
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,620
Now, you will never
get your chance.

Who is he?

Find out who he is.

[Rowena, Cedric, Rebecca
and Isaac wildly happy]

Have you confessed
yourself this morning

209

that you peril
our life so frankly?

210

The sharp end!

They will use the points.

steed to match your courage.

[Rebecca falls in love]

the Disinherited One

By what other name
shall we know you?

[silence]

As a stranger in our land,
you may require assistance

in your choice of the Queen.

236
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,860
Let us say to you
that the fair Alicia

is considered the first
in beauty as in place.

238

Would you present your lance?

You may now
indicate your choice.

the crown to the Saxon Lady Rowena]

Love and Beauty.

[crowd]  Long live
the Queen of Love and Beauty!

248
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,140
You can't just waste your
whole life in bitterness, father.

249
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,980
Bitterness?
You speak of bitterness?

250
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,420
What would you have me be?

251
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,980
Our Lord and Master, Prince John,
demands twice the contribution

252
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,420
I gave him last month.

253
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,500
Contribution. [Sigh]
It's a ransom.

254
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,980
But surely King Richard will return
to England and resume his throne.

255
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,620
What difference does it make to us,
Richard or John, in this...

256
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,740
...wicked country, we shall
always be persecuted.

257
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,540
No. All Christians
are not the same.

258
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,820
Think of the gallant
knight who fought today.

259
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,660
Ah, now there was a
brave and noble youth.

260
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,020
I'll wager that pilgrim
was Jewish.

261
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,780
Yes, Thieslen?

262
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,940
There's a stranger at the door, sire.
He wishes to speak to you.

263
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,820
Does he look dangerous?

264
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,540
I don't believe so. He wears
the garments of the pilgrim.

265
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,420
Ahhhh.

266
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,740
Veil yourself.

267

Sir.

269
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,140
Forgive my intrusion.

270
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,260
I am here to pay
my debt to you.

271
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,660
Debt? What debt?

272
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,060
I owe you my life.

273
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,340
Not at all.

274
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,300
My daughter, Rebecca.

275
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,460
I am honored.

276
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,300
You owe me nothing.
You paid me back in full

277
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,700
today at the tournament.

278
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,180
May I offer you
a goblet of wine.

279
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Nevertheless, I have brought
your horse, and I have here

280
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,820
the price of the armor.

281
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,380
Keep them. They're yours.

282
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,980
Why, I feel I must
at least pay you something.

283
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,180
My father owes you
a far deeper kindness

284
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,300
than any steeds
or arms could pay.

285
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,820
Please, let us look upon it
as our debt to you.

286
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,340
For his life.

287
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,220
If that is your wish.

288
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,460
Eh, your wine?

289
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,180
Forgive me, please.
I must prepare myself

290
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,500
for tomorrow's encounter.

291
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,700
Sir, you've been
far too generous.

292
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm honored to have met you.

293
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Thank you
I bid you goodnight.

Oh, you frighten me.

298
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,700
- Wait. I will leave
and come back again.

299
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,820
- Whoo, whoo.
There.

300
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
- Are you frightened, now?

301
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,900
Tell me.
Tell me at once.

302
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,740
Who was the mysterious knight?
Who was he?

303
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,780
Whoo...

304
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,140
Oh, Wamba, please,
don't play games with me.

305
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,020
What did he say?

306
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,780
His voice could
not be heard.

307
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,700
His face. His eyes, his nose,
his mouth could not be seen.

308
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,380
Why?

309
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,740
He wasn't there!

310
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,820
Oh.

311
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,900
Gone!

312
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,380
Into the night.
A good knight.

313
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,420
Gone, into the good knight.

314
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,860
I think it best.

315
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,220
Best?

316
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,180
Would not Ivanhoe,
if he were here?

317
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,300
Would not Ivanhoe be jealous!

318
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,260
Reign, you champion.

319
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,980
He'd have no reason.

320

I am faithful to Ivanhoe.

Ummm?

Would Cedric marries you
to the noble hog, Athelstane?

323
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,340
Never.

324

325

And I will refuse.

[Ivanhoe, "The Disinherited
Knight" at prayer]

327

Halt!

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,620
Wamba.

329
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,980
Well?

330
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,740
What did she say?

331
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,260
Did you talk to her?

332
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,540
She hasn't forgotten me?

333
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,740
Well, tell me, she
hasn't forgotten me.

334
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,900
My Lady is fair.
She would have a prayer.

335
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,020
For me?

336
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,340
For the brave knight
who won the day.

340

Be gone, you knave!

Where is Athelstane?

350
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,180
Master, that is a question.

351
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,140
Is he getting ready
for the combat?

352
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,220
He's a guest of the
noble lord Gurthog.

353
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,340
When I saw them last,
they were eating venison,

355
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,820
Be it known, it is forbidden
to thrust with a sword.

356
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,780
You may strike only.

357
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,940
A mace or battle axe
may be used at pleasure.

358
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,140
But the dagger
is forbidden.

359
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,140
Any knight unhorsed
may renew the combat on foot.

360
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,540
Any knight who breaks
the rules of this tournament,

361
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,020
will be subjected to public
ridicule and stripped of his arms!

[the three Normans
single out Ivanhoe for revenge]

370
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,340
You can stop the combat
at any moment.

371
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,180
Stop it? By the light
of heaven, I will not.

372
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,780

The chaplet, My Lady.

395

I bestow upon you, Sir Knight.
This chaplet as a gift of honor

396
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,880
for this day's victory.

397

And upon these fearful wounds

398
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,360
no worthy wreath of chivalry
could ever be placed.

399

400
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,400
Help him!

401

Your own son!
Will you do nothing?

My son has left my house.
He has deserted my country.

quickly, father.

How?

407
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
Take him to our house.

408
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,440
But he's a Christian.
By our laws we can't deal

409
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,920
with him, except in commerce.

410
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,880
He is gravely wounded,
and by our hearts

411
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
we cannot refuse him.

412
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,080
Think, if he should
die in our care.

413
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,240
He will not die, unless
we abandon him,

414
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,720
and if so, we must announce
it for his blood to God.

415

Quickly, his enemies
are all about.

416
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,600
[De Bracy]  Wilfred of Ivanhoe,
there is more to this than one day's battle!

417
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,440
If Ivanhoe has returned
from the Holy Land,

418
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,640
can King Richard
be far behind?

419
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,080
Well, let him come.
We'll crown his brother

420
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,920
before Richard
can gather his forces.

421
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,240
Then we'll take Richard
and welcome to him.

422
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,200
I, Brian de'Bert make you
this solemn promise

423
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,120
I shall meet this...
Wilfred of Ivanhoe

424
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,520
in mortal combat,...
and send him to eternity.

425
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
Stay there!

426
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,840
Get back there, get back.
Get back.

427
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,120
Who is it?
Who is it that bears him away?

428

Someone thought kind of him
with your grace.

429
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,680
On the road.

430
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320

My father and I.

435
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,080
We bought you here
to care for your wounds.

436
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,880
We have special herbs,
ways of curing wounds.

437
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,440
Though we never
inflict them.

438
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Herbs.

439
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,800
Secret preparations
handed down to us

440
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,440
since the days of Solomon.

441
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,040
You should be able to bear
armor again within eight days.

442
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,320
You may rest at our home in York,
until you health is restored.

443
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,040
We leave in the morning.

444
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Is there not [gasp]
someone else here in Ashby who,

445
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
who could look after me
until I...

446
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,800
Not a step forward, today.

447
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,240
My dear, noble maiden, I...

448
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,560
No, I am not a noble.

449
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,800
I am but a poor Jewess.

450
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,920
Is it our race, then?

451
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,040
Is that why you do not
wish to travel with us?

452
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:29,680
I, uh...I, uh...I have no wish
to inconvenience you.

453
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,600
I accept you service, gratefully.

454
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
Rest, now.

455
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,920
I leave you.

456
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,600
Your Majesty.

457
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,920
Arise.

458
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,560
Did you find him?

459
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,000
At the house of Isaac.
The Jew of York.

460
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,440
They plan to take him
to York in the early morning.

461
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,440
[sigh] That was a
stroke of good luck.

462
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,240
I shall meet with Willoughby,
Forbes and Willister at York

463
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,120
within the week.

464
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,080
All my forces will be gathered there
to challenge my brother.

465
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
You're traveling alone?

466
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,800
I must for the moment.
You may retire, now.

467
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,720
- Oh, and Philippe.
- Your Majesty.

468
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,840
A good night's work.

469
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

470

[sounds of festivities at

[Prince John's high festival banquet]

[convivial laughter]

473
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,080
Well, where is she? Where is
our Queen of the tournament?

474
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Is she...?

475
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,560
Yes. She is your ward,
is she not?

476
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,960
Where is the Lady Rowena?

477
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,160
She is exhausted by
today's events, she...

478
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,320
begs leave to decline
your courteous invitation.

479
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,800
We are not accustomed
by such a refusal from our

480
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,760
appointed Queens. It is
traditional that they attend.

481
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,840
Your customs are not
our customs.

482
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,920
Well! Perhaps you'll not object
if we drink a beaker

483

to the champion of
this passage of arms,

Wilfred of Ivanhoe?

485
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,440
I cannot drink.

486
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,520
To your own son?

487
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,360
He deserted us.
He left his house, his country,

488
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,400
to fight in foreign lands
with your brother, King Richard.

489
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,840
Then let us hope my brother
holds him in more esteem than you.

490
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,760
[laughter]

491
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,840
I cannot forgive him.
I will not forgive him.

492
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,280
A willful youth who refuses the
commands and customs of his fathers.

493
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,320
I fill my cup.

494
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,200
To Cedric...himself.

495
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,440
This...ward of yours,
the Lady Rowena.

496
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,600
Yes?

497
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,600
A rose of loveliness.

498
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,120
And I trust a jewel of worth.

499
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,080
A Saxon of large possessions.

500
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,440
It is my intention that
she marry this gallant and

501
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,440
noble knight, Athelstane.
The last of the royal line of Saxons.

502
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,400
- Uh.

503
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,920
But, then...she is a minor,
is she not, and she is therefore

504
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,680
at our disposal
in marriage.

505
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,480
Indeed.
Uh, what do you think, De Bracy?

506
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,520
I'm told you're attracted
to the Lady.

507
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,600
Would you find it pleasing
to take her as your bride?

508
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,800
If her lands are to my liking,...
I will hold myself bound

509
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,080
to your Highness' wishes.
Huh.

510
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
The day my ward
marries a Norman,

511
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
will be that Norman's
last day on earth.

512
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,680
Hold. Sit down!
Both of you.

513
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,760
We've invited these honored
guests here this evening

514
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,240
and they shall remain
honored guests.

515
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,200
We've offered a toast
to Cedric of Rothrwood

516
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,480
and now we pray you,...
name us some woman in return.

517
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,320
It is a hard task for the conquered
to sing the praises of his conqueror.

518
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,600
Yet, I will name a Norman, even
though he led my only son astray

519
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,120
he is still the best
of your unfortunate race.

520
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,120
I drink this goblet to the health
of King Richard the Lion-hearted.

521
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,920
[some join in]

522
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,520
And now I hope you will excuse us,
we have remained here long enough.

523
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,560
Up, noble Athelstane.

524
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,200
We bid you good night.

525
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm afraid, Your Majesty, that the
Saxon dogs have retreated in triumph.

526
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,720
It isn't possible, is it?

527
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,960
Could Richard be back
in England again?

528
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,320
What does it matter.
You have reserves, us here

529
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,440
of Maurice de Bracy, Front de Boeuf
and my own humble sort.

530
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,120
Enough for an army!

531
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,800
[laughter]

532
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,600
Here is my toast
and solemn pledge:

533
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,240
To Prince John, our
next king of England.

534
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,800
[all]  Prince John!

535
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,880
[chanting over and over]
Prince John!

536
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,880
- Ahhhh. Oh!

537
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,000
- Where is she now.
Where is the Lady Rowena?

538
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
- Weeping.
- Weeping?

539
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,600
[Rowena sobbing]

540
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,680
[door opens]

541
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,360
Come, we must
leave at once!

542
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,920
Would you go
without your son?

543
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
Ivanhoe has chosen to go
his own way. So be it.

544
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,960
- He chose?
- He's better fitted now to do

545
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,120
the juggling tricks of the Normans,

546
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,440
than uphold the honor
of his English ancestry.

547
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,400
Who was it that
defeated the Normans

548
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,200
- at the tournament?
- Silence!

549
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,360
Not another word.
We leave at once.

550
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,560
[gasp]

551
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,160
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

552
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,880
This arrived this morning...
from France.

553
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,800
Noooo!

554
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,680
What is it?

555
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,560
Uh...the Devil is unchained.

556
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,160
- Take heed...
- Richard?

557
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,080
He's escaped from France.

558
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,880
He's back in England.

559
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,240
We mustn’t lose
a moment, Your Highness.

560
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,480
Call your troops
together at York,

561
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,200
and meet, whatever force
he has head-on!

562
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,600
Your Highness.

563
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
At once.

564
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,760
My friends.

565
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,600
My friends,
we ride for York.

566
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,880
York?

567
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,200
We join Prince John
within the fortnight.

568
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,040
For what purpose?

569
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,680
For the purpose
of beating King Richard.

570
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,640
At last.

571
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,200
York is only a three day journey.
We have plenty of time.

572
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,760
Of course. You shall be my guests
at Torquson on the way.

573
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,200
Tankards and venison enough
to fill even your fat bellies.

574
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,480
What do you say?

575
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,440
[laughing]

576
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,680
Ahhhhh!

577
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,000
[Isaac and Rebecca's caravan
with the injured Ivanhoe]

578
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,400
Halt!

579
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,760
Halt, William.

580
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,720
Here, what are you doing?
Why did you stop?

581
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,160
Bandits.

582
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,760
Bandits, there are
no bandits!

583
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,720
Yeah, in the woods, maybe.
We're leaving.

584
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,520
You can't do that.
You can't leave us here!

585
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,680
No?
We're going.

586
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,720
No, stop! You can't take
those horses.

587
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,960
Those are my property!

588
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,280
Thieves!

589
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,200
Thieves.

590
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,040
[Rebecca checks on Ivanhoe]

591
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,560
Here.

592
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,760
Drink this.

593
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,080
[Ivanhoe coughs]

594
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,800
There.

595
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,400
Rest now.

596
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,440
Rest.

597
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,200
[Ivanhoe breathes heavily]

598
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,080
They were hired
to take us to York!

599
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,840
They've got my money.
Why should they care?

600
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,920
We are deserted.

601
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,280
Oh, God of Abraham,
what have I done?

602
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,960
Why must they
smite us so?

603
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,720
Father, look!

604
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,960
May God make them merciful.

605
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,200
Hold.

606
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,320
I greet you warmly, sir.

607
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,240
I trust you are
in good health.

608
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,000
Who are you?
Speak plainly, infidel.

609
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,200
I'm Isaac of York. I hired a guard
of men to escort us to York,

610
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,960
but they've deserted
us, as you can see.

611
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Why?

612
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,280
They say there were
bandits in the forest,

613
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,600
but, heh, heh, who
am I to talk.

614
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,440
I beg you to let us
travel under your protection.

615
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,880
Dogs if infidels,
out of the way!

616
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,800
Sir, may I speak, please.

617
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,280
We have someone here.

618
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,480
An old person who is gravely ill.

619
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,240
I beg you to let this sick person
be transported with care,

620
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
under your protection.

621
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,440
It is no concern of ours.

622
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,720
Wait.

623
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,320
If this poor person is
truly in peril of life,

624
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,360
and if these two kind and earnest
people cannot defend themselves,

625
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,160
well then we must,
in all charity, give them help.

626
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,840
So be it.
They may travel in the rear.

[horn blows a signal]

628
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,960
What is it?
What's the alarm?

629
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,560
No alarm, sir. All is ready
for you at the castle.

630
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,200
We only wish to inform you,
there is a party of Saxons

631
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,400
in the forest there below.

632
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,360
You know them?

633
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,680
Cedric of Rotherwood, the Lady Rowena
and the noble knight, Athelstane.

634
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,880
How large is the party?

635
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,840
Ten or eleven.
Servants and all.

636
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,760
My good friend, De Bracy,
I wager that the hour has struck.

637
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,040
What?

638
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,080
It's time for us to
deliver your wife.

639
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,240
Your wife, De Bracy,
is awaiting you.

640
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,240
What was that?

641
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,320
What?

642
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,000
Ah, uh, nothing.

643
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,120
Huh.

[Saxon train attacked
by screaming Normans]

645

Forgive the intrusion, My Lady.

00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,960
I am pleased to announce
that you are now the guest

of my good friend, Front de Boeuf.

648
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,040
I would sooner, sir,
go with bandits.

649
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,040
Much, indeed, that
is what you are.

650
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,080
De Bracy, are you certain
that you want to marry

651
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,400
this sharp tongue?

652
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,840
[laughing]

653
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,760
[de Boeuf]  Well,...
what have we here?

654
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,640
[ Brian]  I think, perhaps,
that we have caught more than

655
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,080
one bird on this occasion.

656
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,760
[de Boeuf]
An infidel,

657
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,320
[Brian]  and beautiful
beyond belief.

658
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,440
We can do you no harm, sir.

659
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,040
We have an old woman
here, who needs our care.

660
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,640
She shall have it,
I promise you.

661
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,120
[Wamba]

662
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,120
[Cedric]
Dogs. Norman dogs.

663
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,960
[Athelstane]  Barbarians.
But surely they will feed us.

664
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,680
Stop.

665
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,200
[De Bracy know the truth
about the "old woman"]

666
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,000
[first soldier]  What is it?
What affliction does this old hag have?

667
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,680
[second soldier]  I'll not go
close enough to find out.

668
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,000
[Ivanhoe coughing]

669
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,520
Set her down.
Set her down, please.

670
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,080
[Ivanhoe groaning]

671
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,120
Well, you may leave.

672
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,960
[Ivanhoe groaning]

673
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,320
There. It's all right.

674
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,960
Shhhh. He's here.
Rest easy, Ivanhoe.

675
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,520
Don't be alarmed.
Don't shout, I beg you.

676
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,960
Where? Are we in York?

677
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,920
We...we are prisoners.

678
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,360
Here ye dog.

679
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,120
Help me.
Leave me alone.

680
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,840
[Isaac thrown downstairs]

681
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,200
[Wamba]  Lost again.
Lost again. What can I do?

682
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,360
Taken my master.
Left the fool.

683
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,720
[Black Knight]  Bandit or knave?

684
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,840
I am neither, sir.

685
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,080
Then, what are you?

686
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,200
I am a fool...Wamba,
for my master, Cedric of Rotherwood.

687
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,400
The Saxon?

688
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,000
A noble Saxon, sir.

689
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,160
The prisoner.

690
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Prisoner? Where?

691
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,800
Front de Beouf's castle.

692
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,600
His ward, the Lady Rowena
and noble Athelstane.

693
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,520
There's also....

694
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,560
Would you mind, sir.

695
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,080
Thank you.

696
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,040
There's also Isaac,
the Duke from York,

697
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,880
and his daughter, Rebecca.

698
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,840
They were abducted?

699
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,840
Were, indeed, sir,
most certainly.

700
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,720
Just as surely
as you and I.

701
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,520
You? I?
What are you talking about?

702
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,960
Look about you, sir.

703
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,160
The bushes are moving.

704
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,400
Welcome, welcome, gentlemen.
What do you wish, a fool or a knight?

705
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,320
[Robert Locksley's men surround
and capture them, not knowing who they are]

706
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,800
[whistle warning]

707
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,480
Release him.

708
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,320
The Black Knight.

709
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,360
The tournament at Ashby.
You saved young Ivanhoe.

710
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,080
You hold that against me?

711
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,040
Against you?

712
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,840
There is nothing more dear to me
than the life of an Englishman.

713
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,600
If you are as good an Englishman
as you are a knight,

714
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,240
then I hold you in esteem.
Why do you pass our way?

715
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,320
Shortest distance to York.

716
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,040
Then you must stay awhile.

717
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,160
Taste our hospitality.

718
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,520
Please, I entreat you.
Mutually loving this one.

719
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,000
Help save my master.

720
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,760
He speaks of Cedric
of Rotherwood.

721
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,240
The Lady Rowena.
The noble Athelstane.

722
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,240
Prisoners, all of them.
Prisoners in the castle

723
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,360
of Front de Boeuf.

724
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,520
For myself, I would join
any enterprise to save them.

725
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Where's Little John?

726
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,600
He's away from Torquilton.

727
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,720
And Will Scarlet?

728
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,840
He's just arrived.

729
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,600
Where's Friar Tuck?

730
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,600
Did you call, my lord?

731
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,200
- Where have you been?

732
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,400
Why, at Vespers, saying
prayers for all good Englishmen.

733
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,200
It appears you've been drinking.
More than usual.

734
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,280
Perhaps a pious taste
or two of our sacred wine.

735
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,920
Do you think you are in
suitable condition to give a

736
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,200
service in combat?

737
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Hmmm, wazzz, a hissing here
and a weakness here.  I don't know...

738
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,560
[splash]

739
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,240
[general laughter]

740
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,960
Yes, they have good passed away.
I am ready!

741
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,600
Take shun, my wicked priest!

742
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,600
[Robin Hood]
Let us be off, Black Knight.

743
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,960
The fool will lead us
to his master.

744
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,080
[Front de Boeuf's castle]

745
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,120
You want my life?

746
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,000
Do you want my wealth?

747
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,200
Is it too much for you Normans,
that we Saxons still hold land

748
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,960
in this, our own country?

749
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,280
Very well, then.
Put us to death.

750
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,360
I ask only that you free
the Lady Rowena in honor and safety.

751
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,600
[Front de Boeuf laughs]

752
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,200
[he laughs again]

753
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,320
Norman swine!

754
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,520
My God, who would have thought,

755
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,040
that you, the descendent of Saxon kings,

756
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,560
should the prisoner of a vile Norman

757
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,920
in the very hall in which
our ancestors held court.

758
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,280
Perhaps, they'll hold us
to a moderate ransom.

759
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,320
Dogs.

760
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,120
Oh, my tongue
cleaves to my palette.

761
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,160
If they ever gone
to send us wine.

762
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,080
[door opens]

763
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,880
[door closes]

764
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,200
Why don't you
sit down, my lady.

765
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,160
If I am in the presence
of my jailor, sir, I will stand.

766
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,320
Dearest lady, you are in the presence
of your captive, not your jailor.

767
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,880
I don't know you, sir.

768
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,640
And no man dressed in spurs
and wearing chains would intrude

769
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,080
himself upon an unprotected lady.

770
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,040
It's my misfortune, that
I'm not known to you.

771
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,600
I hope the name of De Bracy
is known to all in deeds of chivalry.

772
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,280
De Bracy? I see no
deeds of chivalry on this day.

773
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,640
You are unjust, Lady Rowena.

774
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,240
Won't you allow at least
the passion of a man

775
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,720
drawn by your great beauty?

776
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,440
Sir, you speak the common
language of a minstrel.

777
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,120
Perhaps bold language
best justifies bold action.

778
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,280
I tell you now, you will
never leave this place

779
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,800
unless you leave it as the
wife of Maurice de Bracy.

780
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,560
Your wife!

781
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,080
Oh, I know, you have
great pride. I admire that.

782
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,640
It makes you even more suited
to take your place beside me.

783
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,840
When I do marry, sir,
it will not be to one who

784
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,280
despises the manner in which
I have been brought up.

785
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,120
Huh huh.

786
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,040
[chuckling]

787
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,720
Perhaps you dream that
King Richard will resume the throne.

788
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,040
That is an empty dream.
I can promise you that.

789
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,120
His fate will be as hopeless
as that of Ivanhoe.

790
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,120
What?

791
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,400
Ivanhoe!

792
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,320
Ah.

793
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,480
Do I see a touch
of tenderness, at last?

794
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,840
Where is he?
Do you know where he is?

795
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,360
I do.

796
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,160
Tell me, I beg you.

797
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,280
He lies gravely wounded
in a turret room above.

798
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
I don't believe you.

799
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,720
You didn't take the trouble to look.
You traveled in the horse litter,

800
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,280
with Isaac, the Jew of York,

801
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,320
Now, were I to inform our host of this,
Ivanhoe will no longer breathe, at all.

802
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,040
Smile....dear lady.

803
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,400
Simply smile at my proposal,
and you will have nothing to fear.

804
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,480
I can't believe that your
purpose could be so wicked,

805
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,640
and your power so great.

806
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,080
There are others.
Cedric, your guardian.

The fate of all depends
on your decision.

01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,920
Lady Rowena, I would rather
you kept your original anger

809
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,200
than this.

810
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Be assured, please. You have
no reason for tears, as yet.

811
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,000
I will leave you now.

812
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,600
To dwell upon your decision.
