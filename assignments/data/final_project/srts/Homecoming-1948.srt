00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,526
I don't want to say
"mandatory"... but...

106

- But mandatory?
- Yeah, I guess.

- The only mandatory elements

are the group meals in the cafeteria,

the workshops which you'll hear about,

110
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,269
and, um, these meetings with me,

111
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:58,705
which hopefully won't be too painful.

112

mean, I know why I'm here.

You know, other guys, they came
home and they got really amped

117
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,491
and just dove right into
everything and then...

118
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,911
and they had problems.

119
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:17,247
And I don't want to end up
like them, but... I'm eager.

120
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,208
Eager for what?

121

that your participation

help you with something?

141
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:24,398
Uh... fuck. What was I gonna ask?

Well, anyway, I'm at the new laboratory.

consistent supply now.

- on working with the guys.
- And it's the same medication?

- There's no change in...
- Yeah... oh-oh, Heidi,

151
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,625
let's not throw that word
around the facility, okay?

- Well...

162
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:02,394
I told them we want hip but masculine.

163
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,746
- HEIDI: Right.
- How's that looking?

164
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,980
Uh, it looks good.

165
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,416
Yeah, the decorator did a great job.

166
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,983
COLIN: Okay, perfect.

167
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,544
You know, we're gonna be
in a more legitimate setting

168
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,320
as soon as we have some results.

169
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,631
HEIDI: Right. Well, actually,
the guys don't seem to mind,

170
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:14,882
- and, uh...
- Okay, but you understand

171
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,283
the urgency here, right?

172
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:18,118
We need the data. That's the key.

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,762
- HEIDI: Of course.
- I've got that presentation

174
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,330
at the DoD in six weeks.

175
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:22,974
We need to have everything
squared away by then.

176
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,291
- Understood?
- Understood.

177
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,876
COLIN: Okay, so how soon do you think

178
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,210
you might have that for me?

179
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,629
- HEIDI: Have what?
- The data, Heidi.

180
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,190
- Y... y... you're pushing on that, right?
- Oh.

181
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:32,775
Absolutely, yeah, and
I think we're seeing...

182
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,010
'Cause we need to be
surgically precise in this.

183
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,346
- Everything these guys remember...
- Yes, of course.

184
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:39,348
We have to get really
granular with all that shit.

185
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,141
Okay. Absolutely.

186
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:44,186
I just... if you can
just give me one sec, um,

187
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:47,230
I just had a session,
actually, with a Walter Cruz.

188
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,459
He is a great candidate,
really, really eager to be here.

189
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,419
COLIN: No, Heidi, Heidi, Heidi,
I... I don't have a lot of time.

190
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:54,154
I got to be at the airport
in, like, 32 minutes.

191
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,947
I... I... I'll be quick.
I was just thinking,

192
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:59,242
in terms of being granular,
as you said, and deliberate,

193
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,328
that perhaps we could take
a more holistic approach

194
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,623
to the initial stages of the treatment.

195
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:07,167
- COLIN: Holistic?
- Well, I feel like we're just kind of

196
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,543
throwing them into the process

197
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,379
without developing
much of a relationship.

198
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,231
- COLIN: Yeah, okay, Heidi, I'm gonna stop you there.
- Okay.

199
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,467
COLIN: Okay, what we're seeking
here, Heidi, is information,

200
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,053
not relationships, not rapport,

201
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,138
whatever these men are holding onto,

202
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,099
that's exactly what we need to know.

203
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,768
HEIDI: No, I get that.
I just, in terms of...

204
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,537
COLIN: Okay, well, based on
what you just said, you don't,

205
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,480
so I need you to 180 on this, okay?

206
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:31,942
Um... yeah, okay.

207
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:33,795
I just was thinking of in terms
of improving the data and...

208
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,963
Heidi, if I go into the DoD and
I say things like "holistic,"

209
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:37,406
you know what they're gonna...

210
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,366
No, I don't even know
what they would do.

211
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:41,368
We need real proof of concept here,

212
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,413
just a house of data to drop
on the appropriations people

213
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,540
so they shut their
mouths, stop prevaricating,

214
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,208
and open up the approval process.

215
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,211
- That's our goal. Understood?
- Understood. Yeah.

216
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,004
You're a rock star, Heidi. I'm serious.

217
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,714
It's all great work.

218
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:57,050
I just need that aggressive,
constant focus from you

219
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,261
and we're gonna be fine. Okay?

220
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,263
Okay. You got it. Thanks, Colin.

221
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,597
Okay, I'm running to the airport.

222
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,474
This flight's like 22 hours long.

223
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:05,767
All right. Have a good trip.

224
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,328
COLIN: Guys, what the hell is all this?

225
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,955
We, we can't have crap
all over the floor.

226
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,564
If that's everything, Colin,

227
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,166
I'm just, I'm running a
little late getting home.

228
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,501
COLIN: This stuff is going
to America, all right?

229
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,986
You know, USA? Yeah,
so it's got to be clean.

230
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:17,988
Colin, are you talking to me?

231
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,715
COLIN: This... it's got to
be a sterile facility, okay?

232
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,884
Sterile, clean? How... how the
hell do you say "sterile... "

233
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,161
Okay. I'm... I'm gonna let you go and...

234
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:25,662
W... wait, Heidi, wait!

235
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,707
- I remember what I was gonna ask.
- Oh, great.

236
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:31,168
Did we run the background
check on the busboys?

237
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,003
Background check the what?

238

- (CLATTERS LOUDLY)
- On... damn it. The busboys.

239
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,508
Did we background check the busboys?

240

Whoever we've got
working in the cafeteria.

241
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:46,224
- Uh, I... I didn't realize that was part of my job.
- What?

242
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,143
Uh, well, of course it's part of...

243
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:51,605
Okay. Listen, Heidi, we
need to be extremely thorough

244
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,148
with the food service.

245
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,792
Now, you are my point
person there, right?

246
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,861
- Yes, absolutely.
- Great.

247
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:01,948
So I need you to get into that tonight.

248
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,949
Okay?

Out to that little airfield.

That's like five miles away.

jet out on the runway,

leaning up against the plane,

You know.

316
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,585
Leave the past behind like
you're doing, but together.

317
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,567
So, you've been in a
leadership position before?

318
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:08,236
- That's right. Yeah.
- Good. That's good.

319
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:09,588
And you don't mind working nights?

320
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,031
- Nights? No, I could do that.
- Okay.

321
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,993
Now, you don't seem to have
much experience in this field.

322
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,494
Is that right?

323
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,997
That is true, but I'm
a really fast learner.

324
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:21,082
Okay. I like hearing that.

325
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:22,709
All right. Well, that should do it.

326
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,169
Thank you so much for coming in.

327
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,646
- We'll, uh, let you know soon.
- Thank you.

328
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,064
That was great. That
was really, really great.

329
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,048
That was wonderful.

330
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,235
I really like the part where
you ask me about my experience

331
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,969
working at the store
because an interview,

332
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,321
it's a conversation, essentially, right?

333
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,889
It's a two-way street.

334
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,849
So that was really,
really nice. Thanks a lot.

335
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:40,643
- Good job.
- Good job, dude.

336
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,480
- Appreciate it, bro.
- Yeah, you fucking nailed it.

337
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,899
In a couple years, think
you'll be assistant manager.

338
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,984
And a couple years after that...

339
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,861

340
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:52,989

Okay, how about Rainey?

342
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,457

- Yeah.

343
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:05,794
Okay. So a month from now, you
could be doing this for real.

344
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,046
- Working at a shoe store?
- (LAUGHTER)

345
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,065
Whatever you choose to do,
this could be good practice.

346
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,258
Okay? All right, so let's start.

347
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,470
- Great. Welcome. Hi.
- Hi.

348
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,806
This is my shoe store. I own it.

349
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,726
Wow. All this?

350
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,020
- (LAUGHTER)
- Could I take a look at your résumé?

351
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,522
Thanks.

352
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,024
Okay. I see here that you
served in the military.

353
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,442
Yeah, I do.

354
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,110
That's great. We love that.

355
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:33,947
So, what is something you
learned in the military

356
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:37,283
that you could apply to your
work here at the shoe store?

357
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,035
Not too much, honestly.

358
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:41,412
- (LAUGHTER)
- Okay, but just give it a try.

359
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:43,706
Okay?

360
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,976
It was a fucking desert. There
weren't too many shoe stores.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,628
CRAIG: Okay, right,
but I remember last week

362
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,214
you were talking
about, um, communication

363
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,133
between team members and how
important that is for you guys.

364
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:57,053
- Right?
- I was?

365
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:00,473
Rainey, just humor me
a little. Okay? Please.

366
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:05,019
I don't know. Shoes. Uh...

367
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,856
you got to find the right
size or you could get infected.

368
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:10,108
- (LAUGHTER)
- Okay. No, no, that's good,

369
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,377
that's good, there's something there.

370
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,653
Could you tell me more about that?

371
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:15,488
I just, I had this one pair of boots

372
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,906
that was too small for me,

373
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,658
and I was lazy or
stubborn or whatever...

374
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,910
Oh, lazy and stubborn?
You're the full package, huh?

375
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,872
- Huh? What the fuck you just say?
- CRAIG: Don't worry about that.

376
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,665
Hey, shut that out.
Don't worry about it.

377
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:26,892
Let's just keep it
right here, let's stay

378
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,334
in the shoe store. Rainey.

379
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:31,004
Rainey. All right?

380
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:33,326
Now, what were you saying?
Talking about infection, right?

381
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:41,139
Yeah, just that I kept
wearing them, and over time,

382
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,182
I skinned the front of my big toe off,

383
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:46,269
and then there was fungus
and it got infected,

384
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,247
and by the time I had someone
look at it, they were like,

385
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:50,082
"What the fuck is wrong with
you? You almost lost your toe."

386
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,900
- So, yeah, shoes.
- (LAUGHTER)

387
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,071
Okay, that was interesting.

388
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:59,741
Um, yeah, personal anecdote,

389
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,409
is always... you know, I feel like in a,

390
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,161
in an environment like this, however...

391
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:04,930
I get what we're trying to
do here. It's unnecessary.

392
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:07,832
- What's not necessary?
- This is. I have a job.

393
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:10,001
You have a job? Rainey,
we're talking about

394
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:11,419
what's next for you.

395
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,046
- Your next chapter.
- My next chapter?

396
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:15,214
My whole fucking book is
over there. All right, Craig?

397
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,401
Look, this is just an exercise
to help you acclimate...

398
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,778
- I understand what it is, and it's ridiculous.
- What's ridiculous?

399
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,554
- This, bro. You...
- WALTER: Chill, Rainey.

00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,890

Shrier pulled me off.

406
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,986
HEIDI: Okay, then what happened?

407
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,030
WALTER: Then nothing. Counselor sent us

408
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,841
back to our rooms and then
they told me to come here.

409
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,241
HEIDI: How do you feel about that?

410
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:43,451
WALTER: About what?

411
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,078
About what just happened.

412
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,039
I guess embarrassed.

413
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:49,457
Why?

414
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:52,043
Well, because I lost control of myself.

415
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,586
- But he hit you.
- No, he didn't.

416
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:56,881
No, he did. Says right here, uh,

"Cruz confronted Rainey,
who struck Cruz... "

Yeah, I know, but...

it just doesn't feel like
me, to react like that.

And that worries you.

Yeah, it does.

422
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,811
I mean, you know,
Rainey's obviously dealing

423
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,021
with his own shit, and
so it came out sideways.

I... I wouldn't really do this, but...

434
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:41,676
there's this desk in my room.

435
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:46,264
It's wooden and it's
got these sharp corners

436
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,349
and when I first got here,

437
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,268
I don't know why, I just imagined myself

438

sitting down in a chair
and leaning all the way back

439

into the corner of the table.

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,018
it's just a little too quiet, you know?

473
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,770
So we could ask around.

474
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:19,023
Okay. Maybe.

475
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:20,691
Maybe Shrier.

476
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,360
Yeah, I'd be okay with that.

477
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,070
That's allowed?

478
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,696
Of course.

479
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,458
We're here to help you
make this transition.

480
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,034
Whatever supports that,
that's what we're gonna do.

481
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:35,915
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

482
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,500
Got two minutes.

483
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,811
I appreciate your cooperation...

484
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:40,419
Back away from the door a little bit.

485
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:43,172
- Sure.
- Thanks.

486
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,299
(HEIDI SIGHS)

487
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:48,636
- So?
- Yeah, so...

488
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:52,390
You... you did work at
Homecoming, at the Tampa facility?

489
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:53,933
Yeah. Years ago. I... I said that.

490
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,518
What... what's this about?

491
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,020
Well, my department, we
field and review complaints,

492
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:59,832
and I'm currently following
up on certain allegations...

493
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,816
- About me?
- The...

494
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:04,318
No.

495
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,736
(CHUCKLES): Okay, so then...

496
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,422
But you were an
administrator there. Correct?

497
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:09,991
I was a counselor.

498
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,618
A counselor. All right.

499
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,913
Um, and why did you leave that job?

500
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:18,457
I quit.

501
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:21,002
- Why?
- My mother got hurt

502
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,837
and I had to come home
and take care of her.

503
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,673
So you quit the job in Tampa
'cause your mom got hurt

504
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,092
and now you work here
at this restaurant?

505
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:29,862
Well, I, you know, it's...
it's what I could get.

506
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:31,429
But I had to come back home and...

507
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,890
- 'Cause your mom got hurt.
- Yes.

508
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,284
And is your current
employer, are they aware...

509
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:37,018
What does that have to do with anything?

510
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,146
I'm just... You didn't
want to talk inside.

511
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:41,522
- DARA: Yo!
- Yes.

512
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:42,940
You okay?

513
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,942
- HEIDI: Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

514
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,861
Yeah. I'll be back in just a second.

515
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,322
- Okay.
- Thanks.

516
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,324
It's a little embarrassing, okay?

517
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:53,385
I had this whole career,
and then I had to come back,

518
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,369
and now I do this. All right?

519
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,371
What were your duties there?

520
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,415
I was a counselor. I told you.

521
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:01,042
And what did that involve?

522
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,836
Um, I worked with soldiers,
their mental health.

523
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:06,422
Honestly, I don't remember
much about it. Okay?

524
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:09,300
I was... it wasn't a good fit for me.

525
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:10,927
Are we done?

526
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:13,554
Ms. Bergman, I'm simply trying to get

527
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:15,473
some basic information
about the program.

528
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:17,099
It's not my intention to agitate.

529
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,477
I am not agitated.

530
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:24,023
C... can you tell me if
your clients were there

531
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:26,067
on a voluntary basis, or... ?

532
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:28,569
I don't know.

533
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,446
You don't know?

534
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:33,282
Do you have a badge?

535
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,035
Do you have some kind of identification?

536
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:40,665
Uh, I have a business card.

537
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:47,129
As I explained, we received a complaint.

538
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:49,966
This was four years ago,
during your time there.

539
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:53,094
Specifically, that one...

540
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:57,098
"One of the soldiers, he wants to leave,

541
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,268
h... he wants to go home,
but they won't let him."

542
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,563
My question is, were the
men there voluntarily?

543
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:07,358
I answered your question. I
really need to go back inside.

544
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,026
Is there a reason why you're refusing...

545
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,778
I'm not refusing.

546
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,780
I don't remember.

547
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:16,200
You don't remember
anything about your work?

548
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:18,369
I already told you.

549
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:25,501
What about the name Walter Cruz?

550
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:29,338
Do you remember him?

551
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,215
No.

552
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:49,859
? ?
