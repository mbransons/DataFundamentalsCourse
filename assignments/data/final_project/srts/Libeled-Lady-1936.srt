1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,153
Press Room.

3
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:53,908
Okay.

4
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,172
Hold everything for a new front page!

5
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,259
We're jimmying the Allenbury yarn.
Hey, Mack, hold everything.

6
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,385
Wait for a makeover.

7
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:14,387
- What happened, Allen?
- Don't load anymore.

8
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,556
- Hold it, boys.
- Unload all of them.

9
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,185
We're trying to kill a story.
Have any trucks gone out?

10
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:20,979
- How about it, Joe?
- Number 7.

11
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:22,063
Call him back.

12
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:24,858
But he's gone.
Times Square and Columbus Circle.

13
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,609
Rush a motorcycle after him. Hurry up!

14
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,737
We've got to get those papers back.
Every one.

15
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,531
Pete, get on your machine
and stop truck number 7.

16
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:32,657
Okay.

17
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,869
Phone all the stands on that route
not to sell any papers.

18
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,582
Are you ringing Haggerty?
All right, all right! Try him again.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,753
- Go to Haggerty's apartment. 52nd Street...
- I know where he lives.

20
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,381
Won't he be at church?
Isn't he getting married at noon?

21
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,425
You grab a taxi to the church.
Bring him here.

22
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,927
- I can't ruin his wedding.
- Then it'll be our funeral.

23
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,512
Step on it! Keep on ringing him.

24
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,562
Don't answer it. I've had enough gags
pulled on me this morning.

25
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,731
Maybe Miss Benton again. I'm afraid...

26
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,859
You're afraid? I'm marrying her,
and you're afraid.

27
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:06,943
That's loyalty.

28
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:10,491
She say before, "If you're late,
she going tear down church."

29
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:12,075
Even that won't stop it.

30
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:15,496
No, Ching, I promised I'd meet her
at the altar at the stroke of 12:00.

31
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,165
And there'll be no reprieve
from the governor this time.

32
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:22,127
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Yes, said the spider to the fly.

33
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:25,005
- Very pretty.
- I'm the groom, not the bride.

34
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,549
Take my advice, Ching.
Don't ever get married.

35
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:32,389
Maybe not so bad, Mr. Haggerty.
My mother and father, they get married.

36
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,766
You're kidding.

37
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,060
Here's to the last mile.

38
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,146
A merry marriage
and many happy comebacks.

39
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:41,357
Mr. Haggerty!

40
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,444
- What's wrong?
- You're wanted at the office right away.

41
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,780
Good old governor. Good old office!

42
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,991
Run to the church
and tell Miss Benton I've been delayed.

43
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:52,660
It's awful to bust up your wedding.

44
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,453
Never mind the wedding.
Something break?

45
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,247
- The story they had to kill.
- What story?

46
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,084
The London correspondent
cabled last night.

47
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,669
A swell story on the Allenbury girl.

48
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,379
Connie Allenbury? What kind of story?

49
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:03,631
She was mixed up
in some scrape at a garden party.

50
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:05,341
Tried to steal another girl's husband.

51
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:06,759
- Not Connie Allenbury?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:07,802
All right, what happened?

53
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,054
Jackson cabled this morning.
It was all a mistake.

54
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,139
It was somebody else.
She wasn't at the party.

55
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,350
And we printed the story?
Holy mackerel! Come on.

56
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,852
Wait. You said not to stop for anything...

57
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,354
but you've got to have your pants.

58
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:19,939
Yeah, yeah. I gotta have my pants.

59
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,070
Can't I stay away for one day
without somebody pulling a boner?

60
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:26,447
You call yourself a newspaperman.
Where's your nose?

61
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:27,490
- My nose?
- Yes, your nose!

62
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,075
That thing fairly reeks of alcohol!

63
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,536
Jackson was drunk.
You got to smell things like that.

64
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,788
You don't need any brains.
All you need is a nose!

65
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:36,666
- I knew the boss hated her father...
- And her father hates us!

66
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,584
He'd blow us up,
and you hand him dynamite.

67
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,045
The one girl that we should handle
with kid gloves...

68
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,297
and you spread her name
over the front page! What?

69
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:45,341
- What'll we use for a headline?
- I don't care.

70
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,384
"War threatens Europe!"

71
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,971
- Which country?
- Flip a nickel!

72
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,014
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,890
The boss is here. He wants you right away.

74
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,101
Does he want me or my job?
Have you got a drink?

75
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:56,021
There's a fresh bottle on your desk.
I thought you'd need one.

76
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,605
I'll need it, and how.

77
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,156
I knew I'd find you
with a drink in your hand.

78
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,742
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

79
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:09,951
What? Didn't Ching tell you?

80
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,956
Yes, Ching told me, and I told him,
and now I'm telling you.

81
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,499
I won't stand for it.

82
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,210
You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty.
Not to me!

83
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,755
First it was a fire at sea.
Then it was a kidnapping.

84
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,132
- What's the gag this time?
- Darling, there's no gag.

85
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:25,135
- The newspaper's made a mistake.
- So has little Gladys.

86
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:29,055
Engaged to a newspaperman.
Joe Simpson never treated me like this.

87
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:32,142
- Then why did you divorce him?
- I've asked myself that many times.

88
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,019
Gladdie, after all, you got no kick.

89
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,021
I haven't?
First, you said a trip to Bermuda.

90
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:38,942
- You went to Bermuda.
- But alone. Then it was Europe.

91
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:42,029
If I wait another year,
it'll be Little America. I won't.

92
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:45,866
- I tell you, I can't get away.
- It's not Europe. It's the church.

93
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,743
It only takes 20 minutes to get married.

94
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:50,454
- But, Gladdie, the trip.
- I'll take Battery Park.

95
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,332
I'm going to take you
on the greatest trip a girl ever had...

96
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,000
just as soon as we settle the suit.

97
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,462
Nothing doing. For two years
I played second fiddle to this paper!

98
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,547
But the boss is waiting for me.

99
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,510
The preacher's waiting, too. Get your hat.

100
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:03,594
I can't go...

101
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,888
the paper's in a jam!
We're facing a libel suit!

102
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:09,683
You're facing a breach of promise suit!
If you don't want to marry me, say so!

103
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:12,228
Gladdie, you're getting yourself
all upset, darling.

104
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:15,064
- A little drinkie, maybe?
- Not today I don't.

105
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,565
Today, I get married!

106
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,360
- Well, I...
- Didn't they say I wanted to see you?

107
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:21,820
Say, what is this?

108
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,490
Do I own a paper or a lunatic asylum?

109
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:28,621
- You just took the words out of my mouth.
- Mr. Bane, my future wife.

110
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,414
Nonsense! I'll be in my office!

111
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:31,958
Get rid of this woman!

112
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,460
Take it easy, that's the owner of the paper.

113
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:37,588
I don't care who he is. Nobody talks
to me like a house detective.

114
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,549
How do you know
how a house detective talks?

115
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:44,011
Don't you think I read? Where are you...
No, you don't. If you think that you can...

116
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,014
Gladdie, darling.
Now, you tell the preacher to wait...

117
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:51,018
and I'll phone you just the minute I'm free,
and we'll get married today.

118
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,522
Now, that's a promise.

119
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,732
Tomorrow at this time,
you'll be a married woman.

120
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,734
I swear to it. Joe, come here.

121
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,987
Will you show Miss Benton to a taxi?

122
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,365
And this is supposed to be
the happiest day of a girl's life.

123
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:03,574
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,913
Why doesn't London answer?

125
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:13,876
I want J. B. Allenbury.
This is terrible, Haggerty.

126
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,546
- A mistake like that can ruin...
- What do the lawyers say?

127
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,343
An open-and-shut case. Pure libel
and slander. We haven't a leg to stand on.

128
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,513
And now, I've got to get on my knees
to Jim Allenbury...

129
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:27,058
a man I fought for 20 years,
never giving an inch.

130
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,686
They're ready with London, Mr. Bane.

131
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,022
Wait a minute. Let me talk to him.

132
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,399
You know how he hates you.
I'll take all the blame.

133
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,484
You know nothing,
not even that I'm phoning.

134
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,361
- Then if I fail...
- You mustn't.

135
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:39,779
Tell him it was just a mistake.

136
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:43,869
Maybe he doesn't know anything about it.
Only 50 of those papers got away.

137
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,163
Hello? Hello, London? Yeah, we're ready.

138
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,165
Hello? Hello, Mr. Allenbury?

139
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,960
This is Warren Haggerty
of the <i>New York Evening Star.</i>

140
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,712
You know the <i>Star?</i>

141
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:59,426
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way
about us, Mr. Allenbury.

142
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,595
Yes. I realize that we've
fought in the past...

143
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:04,097
but it's always been a good, clean fight.

144
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,891
No. Nothing serious.

145
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,147
But the early edition of the paper
carried a little item about your daughter.

146
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,735
Not that the item was serious at all,
but I just thought I'd phone you...

147
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:18,989
Yes. Yes, that's it, exactly.
The spirit of fair play.

148
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,242
I appreciate that spirit of fair play,
Mr. Haggerty...

149
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:25,704
but you see, my office cabled me
a copy of your little item.

150
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:27,664
What?

151
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:30,667
Yes, indeed.
Hardly what I'd call innocent...

152
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,924
but typical of Hollis Bane and everything
that his newspaper stands for.

153
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,261
No, I'm not interested, Mr. Haggerty.
You can discuss that with my attorney.

154
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,930
Now, hold on a minute.

155
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:44,850
This is Charles Archibald,
of Archibald, Davis, and Wingert.

156
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:47,728
We're filing suit immediately
through our New York office.

157
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:51,232
- You'll receive the papers tomorrow.
- Just a minute, Mr. Archibald.

158
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:54,193
Don't forget to mention
the amount we're suing for.

159
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:56,320
That should interest them.

160
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,991
By the way,
you might inform your Mr. Bane...

161
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:02,286
Miss Allenbury
is asking damages for $5 million.

162
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,045
$5 million.

163
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,797
She's insane, she's mad.

164
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,174
There never has been
a libel suit for $5 million.

165
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,676
There ain't that much money.

166
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,261
She's got all the money in the world now.

167
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:19,979
It's not money they're after.

168
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:23,485
It's the paper. It's me.
For 20 years, I've fought Allenbury.

169
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:24,652
Kept him out of the senate.

170
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:27,322
And when they wanted
to make him ambassador, I stopped it.

171
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,408
- $5 million.
- Their chance to strike back, and they are.

172
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:31,743
The paper will go.

173
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:34,245
Look what a lawsuit did
to <i>New York Daily</i> last year.

174
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,705
That's not going to happen to us.

175
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,792
We haven't begun to fight yet.
We've been sued before, big suits.

176
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,919
They were after money
and were glad to settle.

177
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:43,630
Allenbury will settle, too,
when we get through with her.

178
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,756
Remember the Farrell girl?

179
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,925
That was open-and-shut,
till we got busy on her.

180
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,136
You can't do that here.

181
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,972
There's never been a word of scandal
about Connie Allenbury.

182
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,642
Not yet, but she's human
and I'm gonna throw a man at her.

183
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,976
You're not suggesting a frame?

184
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,812
No. But we've got to get to this girl...

185
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:59,231
and I'm gonna bring in
the best man we ever had.

186
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,273
Who's that?

187
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,484
A guy that will beat
anybody in the world...

188
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,319
from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler.

189
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,862
Bill Chandler? Yes.

190
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:09,074
Now, you fired him,
the best man we ever had on libel.

191
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:11,868
- You admit it, and you fired him.
- Yes, and I'd do it again.

192
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:14,873
He was a vain, double-crossing heel.
Tried to run the paper.

193
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,626
- Thought he knew more about it than I did.
- And was right.

194
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,087
He's the only man
who can swing this case.

195
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,130
Get him!

196
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,631
I'll have him here in an hour.

197
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,758
Long distance.
New York calling Mr. Adams...

198
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,468
of <i>The Chronicle</i> at Washington, DC.

199
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:28,345
All right, put Haggerty on.

200
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:31,265
Hello, Haggerty. This is Adams of
<i>The Washington Chronicle.</i>

201
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:34,226
Chandler left here over a year ago,
headed for Denver.

202
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:35,269
Try <i>The Courier.</i>

203
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,023
Sure, I know him.
Chandler left Denver four months ago.

204
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:41,193
And the boss's wife
almost followed him to San Francisco.

205
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:42,778
That guy is dynamite.

206
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:52,538
He worked here, but he wasn't
with <i>The Express</i> two weeks...

207
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,373
when he quit and left San Francisco.

208
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,793
One of the girls here received
a Christmas card from Singapore.

209
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:02,758
Anyone in this great settlement knowing
the whereabouts of William Chandler...

210
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,804
will please communicate
with station ZHM, Singapore.

211
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,934
Keep the lines open. If anything comes in,
let me know. I'll be here.

212
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,062
He left Singapore three months ago.
How about Australia?

213
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,773
I can try Sydney.
He was always crazy about the races.

214
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,693
Okay, but rush it. Send another SOS
to the syndicated press...

215
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,111
and cable London and Berlin.

216
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,614
- Do anything, but find him.
- Maybe that guy's dead.

217
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,619
It would be just like him
to die at a time like this.

218
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,661
Hello.

219
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:32,790
In case you don't know it, it's 2:00
in the morning, and I've been asleep.

220
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:36,669
What do I do? Put the dress
in mothballs for another trip?

221
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:40,048
Change it for a straitjacket
and order one for me.

222
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,766
- You ought to get some sleep, boss.
- No. This coffee will fix me up all right.

223
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:53,271
I press suit up quick.
Maybe you try him again this afternoon.

224
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:56,191
- Throw him in the nearest ashcan.
- One trail leads to Sydney.

225
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,484
The other one to Shanghai.

226
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,528
Both report the whereabouts
of Bill Chandler unknown.

227
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,865
Call up that detective agency,
see if they can find him.

228
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,825
Chandler? You mean Mr. Chandler...

229
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,619
- the fellow who used to work here?
- Yes.

230
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,287
- I know where he is.
- What?

231
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,830
Sure, he's a good friend of mine.

232
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,832
Just last week,
he gave me $10 for my mother.

233
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:14,542
- She's been sick.
- What's his address?

234
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:15,794
He's at the Grand Plaza.

235
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:19,049
The Grand...
No, that can't be the Chandler we want.

236
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,467
Don't you mean Bill Chandler...

237
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,302
who was always giving you the raspberry?

238
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:25,681
Yeah! That's the fellow!
Tell the cable office we found him.

239
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,391
- Right under my nose!
- Shall I get him?

240
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,519
No, I want to talk to him personally,
feel him out a little.

241
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:33,814
So he's living at the Grand Plaza.
He must be in the money.

242
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,629
Warren Haggerty.
From Brooklyn to Bombay...

243
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,673
a stab in the back spells Haggerty.

244
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:00,342
I never stabbed you in the back,
Chandler, and I want...

245
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:03,220
After all, that was a long time ago,
and we should...

246
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,847
Bury the hatchet. Or was it a knife?

247
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:07,893
- Now get this, Chandler, I didn't knife you.
- You only tried to.

248
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,478
That was two years ago. We should...

249
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,815
- Let bygones be bygones.
- Why, sure. Whatever happened...

250
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,067
Is all over now. Goodbye.
It was nice to see you.

251
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:18,696
Good morning. Cigarettes, please.
Give my regards to the boys at the office.

252
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:21,740
You still at the <i>Star?</i>
Old man hasn't gotten wise to you yet.

253
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:23,242
Soon, you'll be out on your ear...

254
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,202
then the <i>Star</i> will be a first-class sheet.

255
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,829
Listen here, Chandler. If you're...

256
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,748
By the way, what are you
doing for yourself, Bill?

257
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:32,253
I just finished writing a book, Warren.

258
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:35,089
All about my early hardships,
the newspaper business...

259
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,591
and the rats I met running about.

260
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,260
- Lf you mention me in that book...
- Sue me for libel.

261
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,137
How is the libel these days?

262
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,889
You got a good man on the hush stuff?

263
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:44,432
Yeah, we get along.

264
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,809
Where did you go when you left us?

265
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,686
The intelligence department, Warren.

266
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,022
I always did like contrast. Cheerio.

267
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:53,107
- What's your hurry?
- Breakfast time.

268
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:55,860
- It can wait. I got an idea.
- I'll take breakfast.

269
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:57,238
I want to talk to you.

270
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,365
Warren, you weren't like that when I left.

271
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,409
- This is a proposition.
- Not before breakfast.

272
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:04,287
- I haven't got time for breakfast.
- That's too bad. Goodbye.

273
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,206
- Good morning, captain.
- Good morning, sir.

274
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:07,790
- Table for one.
- Table for two.

275
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,918
Very well, sir. This way, please.

276
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,589
- More coffee, sir?
- No, thanks.

277
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,926
Now, Warren, what's on your mind?

278
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,471
I've been thinking, Bill. After all,
you're a darn good newspaperman.

279
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,183
Maybe I was a little hasty when I...

280
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:25,185
You don't mean to give me back my job?

281
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:26,978
- That's it.
- Wait a minute.

282
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:29,981
You want to talk business?
All right, I'll talk.

283
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:32,859
You're in a jam over the Allenbury girl.

284
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,236
You printed a hot story
and she's suing you.

285
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,697
- Who told you?
- Elementary, my dear Watson.

286
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:41,242
I read the story. First edition only,
carried by no other paper.

287
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:44,329
That, says I,
is the fine Italian hand of Haggerty...

288
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,247
the bull in the china shop.

289
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,419
- What's she asking?
- $5 million.

290
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:52,589
Who does she think she is?

291
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,466
Just one of the richest girls in America.

292
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,009
Yes, I know all about her.

293
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:59,596
Title-crazy, with a fatheaded
old father to buy her in and out.

294
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,182
America's international playgirl.
That's her rep...

295
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:04,184
and she thinks it's worth $5 million.

296
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:06,561
When I get through with her,
she'll take five cents.

297
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:09,898
- Done. You're on the payroll.
- No, Warren. No philanthropy.

298
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:14,321
During the six months that I was on
the <i>Star,</i> I saved you, all told...

299
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,657
some $300,000. What did I get?

300
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,410
$125 a week.

301
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,913
That's the proposition, drawn yesterday.

302
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,791
I've been expecting you for 24 hours.

303
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,961
$5,000 down and $45,000 more
when you... Why, you're crazy.

304
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,922
No other reporter gets
that much money. It's robbery.

305
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,717
All right. Forget it.
You read any good books lately?

306
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,264
- Now, be reasonable, Bill.
- Take it or leave it. Wait a minute.

307
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,183
On second thought,
I don't want the job at any price.

308
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,394
I got all the money I need right now.
Look here.

309
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,020
I just got this from my publisher...

310
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,565
offering to advance me
$5,000 for a second book.

311
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:50,484
- Let's just forget about this.
- Now, wait a minute.

312
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,618
You ought to be arrested for extortion.

313
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,373
You must have dropped this, sir.

314
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,463
- What is this?
- That is a letter.

315
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:09,881
I get it.

316
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,467
So your publisher is going to send you
a $5,000 advance?

317
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,719
$700 behind with the hotel, you mean.

318
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,138
- Not now, I'm not.
- I knew I was a sap to believe...

319
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,308
That's right, you were.
But you'll get your money's worth.

320
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,851
Now, here's the plan.

321
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,769
Allenburys are in London.

322
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:25,271
So I sail for England at once.

323
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,856
But they're coming back in 10 days.

324
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,985
That's why I'm sailing,
to come back with them.

325
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,404
Five days on a boat.
Anything can happen on a boat.

326
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,907
I meet the girl.
Perhaps she comes to my cabin...

327
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,701
- No. Not this girl.
- Only for a cocktail.

328
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,746
Perfectly innocent to her, me,
and everyone on the boat.

329
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,624
Except our private detective,
who radios my wife.

330
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:46,085
- You got a wife?
- No. This is a setup, not a confession.

331
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:49,255
But we hire some attractive girl
to marry me...

332
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,299
and when the time comes...

333
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:54,471
she stages a pretty little scene
over her erring husband...

334
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,514
and sues Connie for alienation of affection.

335
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,141
That's it, that's it.

336
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,769
The <i>Star</i> called Connie a husband-stealer.
She denies it.

337
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,813
We duplicate the situation.
This time, she does steal a husband.

338
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,106
This time, we're right.

339
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:08,485
Let her go to bat with a libel suit
and see what she collects.

340
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,071
But how about a girl to marry you?
Do you know anybody?

341
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,530
Now, that's tricky.

342
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,658
We've got to find someone we can trust.

343
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:16,660
I've got the girl, the very girl!

344
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,460
Hello.

345
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,129
What happened to you?

346
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,925
Do I want to get married?

347
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,762
What do you think?
I'll call the preacher right away.

348
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,393
The city hall?
Then I can't wear my wedding gown.

349
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,691
I won't ask any questions.
And don't keep me waiting.

350
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,903
Tiny? Tiny, come here.

351
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,990
I'm so happy. Today is my wedding day.

352
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:53,200
What, again, Miss Gladys?

353
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,329
You can't do this to me,
Warren Haggerty. Not to me!

354
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:58,872
Let me out of here.

355
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,208
For two years, you've had me
on a merry-go-round...

356
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,919
waiting for that gold ring,
but this is where I get off...

357
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:05,629
- and stay off!
- Be quiet.

358
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:06,964
I won't be quiet!

359
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,677
The things I've taken for that newspaper...

360
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,888
but this gets the blue ribbon,
trying to marry me off...

361
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,390
to that baboon!

362
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:17,018
Let's not deal in personality.

363
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,979
But, darling, it's only for a month,
maybe less.

364
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:21,355
Then six weeks in Reno.

365
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:24,066
And, Miss Benton, they've got
the loveliest place in Reno.

366
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,986
You'd love it.
You can play craps there every night.

367
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,362
That's right, that's right.

368
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,072
I'll come the moment you get divorced.

369
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,870
But I don't want a divorce.
I want to get married and stay married.

370
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,580
If you don't want to marry me, say so.

371
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:38,624
Of course I want to marry you,
but don't you understand, Gladys?

372
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,169
This comes first. It's our only chance.
I'll get fired.

373
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:42,920
There isn't a newspaper in the world...

374
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,423
that would hire me as an office boy.
Would they, Bill?

375
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,717
- Not if they know you like I do.
- What do you mean?

376
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,552
You remember poor Ed Glover?

377
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,554
You remember after he lost that libel suit?

378
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,974
They found his car gone over a cliff
and a revolver in his hand.

379
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:00,523
- Do you want me to kill myself?
- Did you change your insurance?

380
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,442
Would I ask you to do this thing for me...

381
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,444
if I didn't consider you
practically my wife?

382
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,238
Would you ask your wife
to hook up with that ape?

383
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,615
The ape objects.

384
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,743
Darling, you're not marrying him, really.

385
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,996
A wedding ceremony,
six hours in a hotel apartment...

386
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,333
during which time I'll never leave you,
and then he leaves for Europe.

387
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:22,171
- Don't talk to me. I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. I'm leaving. The deal is off.

388
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,466
Here's your contract. $50,000.

389
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,429
- I wouldn't hook up with her for $1 million.
- Now, Bill, you know the spot I'm in.

390
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,973
That's your tough luck.
You'll have to get a new boy.

391
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,601
- You mean you're walking out on him?
- That's it, sister.

392
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,561
You know what the <i>Star</i> means to him...

393
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,938
you're a newspaperman. You know.

394
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:42,108
It'll ruin his life. It'll ruin his career.
A fine friend you are.

395
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,905
- Lf you put it that way.
- I'm putting it that way.

396
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:50,869
- Good. I'll get the guy.
- The things I do for that newspaper.

397
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,998
"And I pronounce you man and wife."

398
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,711
Aren't you going to kiss the bride?

399
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:01,922
Yes! Sure.

400
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:05,842
May I?

401
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,804
Why not?
Everybody else seems to be doing it.

402
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:11,473
Aren't you going to kiss me?

403
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:12,643
Sure, sure.

404
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:19,817
An old friend of the family.

405
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,235
Yes.

406
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:22,778
Darling.

407
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,158
Very old friend.

408
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,912
I hope you'll be very happy...

409
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:34,581
and don't forget to invite me
to your silver anniversary.

410
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:37,168
It'll have to be within the next six weeks.

411
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,548
Goodbye, and good luck.

412
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,508
Goodbye. Good luck to you.

413
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,054
- Take his arm.
- I'm taking your arm.

414
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:50,141
Yes.

415
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,437
Send it up, and send a waiter, please.

416
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:58,357
Right away? Thanks.
That's the wire you sent me.

417
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:02,488
There will be a bellboy and a waiter
to witness the very tender scene...

418
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:04,282
when we learn that I'm called to Europe.

419
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:06,617
Now, remember, won't you?
You're all broken up.

420
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,203
He is torn from your arms,
the bridegroom of an hour.

421
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:12,040
- That's too long for me.
- To my little bride.

422
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,583
I hope you choke on it.

423
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:15,043
- Darling.
- Don't call me that.

424
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,586
You know what my name is.

425
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,756
- Of course, Mrs. William Chandler.
- I'd just as soon have a number.

426
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,675
- Come on, now. You mustn't fight.
- Why not? We're married.

427
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,385
You're supposed to be happily married.

428
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,429
You're supposed to be in love
with each other.

429
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:29,350
I must have been crazy to let you
marry me off to another guy.

430
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:31,269
But let me tell you this, Warren Haggerty.

431
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:34,272
From now on, you've got
to forget the paper and take me places.

432
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:37,275
I can't take you places,
you've got to stay in the apartment.

433
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,402
You can sew, sleep, and play the radio.

434
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:42,447
- Maybe you could learn to read.
- You're not going to take me out?

435
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,240
Honey, I can't take you out.

436
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:46,534
You can't be seen running around
with another man.

437
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,245
You're supposed to be married.
You've got to look married.

438
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:50,663
Maybe twins would help.

439
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,417
Now, remember, remember.

440
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,634
- Yes?
- Telegram for Mr. Chandler.

441
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:03,220
- Just wait. Clear the table, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

442
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,931
Bill, there's a telegram for you.

443
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,309
Thanks, sweetness.
Would you open it for me, honeykins?

444
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,564
Bill.

445
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:18,612
- What is it?
- Read it.

446
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:21,782
- What does it say?
- It's from the office.

447
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:25,452
"Lmperative you sail <i>Queen Anne</i> tonight
for director's meeting in London.

448
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,288
"Reservations arranged.
Anderson will meet you. Bon voyage."

449
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:31,333
You can't leave me.
Bill, you mustn't leave me!

450
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,295
Baby, this is terrible,
breaking into our honeymoon like this.

451
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,465
But what am I to do, honey? I'll have to go.

452
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:39,508
You can't.

453
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,802
It's only for a couple of weeks,
Mrs. Chandler.

454
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:44,473
But a couple of weeks
are a couple of weeks!

455
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:48,769
- I'll miss my little Billikins.
- And I'll miss my little fuzzy-face.

456
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:53,148
I'm afraid you'll have to hurry
if you're gonna make that boat.

457
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,734
Yes, that's right. Here, boy.

458
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:59,238
Just take my grips here.
These leather ones are mine.

459
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,699
Sure was a lucky thing
that I didn't unpack.

460
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,701
Waiter, thank you very much.

461
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,790
Darling, I'll miss you every minute.

462
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:09,375
Every second!

463
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,920
Hold it. They've gone.
Save it for the elevator.

464
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:18,301
- Well, for the...
- Here comes the elevator.

465
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,437
The bride and groom.

466
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,320
Darling, I'll miss you every minute.

467
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:36,988
Every second.

468
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:42,869
Goodbye, old man.

469
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:46,039
He's gone.

470
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,125
The maid.

471
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:51,961
Why, he'll come back, Mrs. Chandler.

472
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:12,233
- How do you do, Mr. Chandler?
- Hello.

473
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:15,904
- Sailing back with us so soon, sir?
- I only came to London for three days.

474
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,074
- Lf there's anything I can do, sir.
- Thank you.

475
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,496
Everything is set.
Palmer's gonna take the smack.

476
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:25,248
Fine. Tell the boys to lay it on heavy.

477
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,210
Here they come. Beat it.
I'll see you on the boat.

478
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:31,421
Boys. Here they come now.
Chandler says lay it on heavy.

479
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,260
Mr. Allenbury, excuse me, sir.

480
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,429
There's been a bit of a mix-up
on your baggage.

481
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,264
- Come with me.
- Shall I attend to it?

482
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:44,601
I'd better go with you, Graham.
Wait here, Connie.

483
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:47,523
Will you make a statement for the press?

484
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,483
Are you suing for L1 million?

485
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:52,111
- What are your chances of winning?
- I've nothing to say.

486
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:54,696
Miss Allenbury, you must be able to
tell us something.

487
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,282
- No, nothing.
- Surely, you'll make a statement.

488
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,700
Will you please let me go?

489
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:01,453
- You can't afford to ignore the press.
- Can't I?

490
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,080
Turn her around, Palmer.

491
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,790
Take your hands off of me!

492
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,959
Watch the dicky bird, ducky.

493
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:09,753
Just a minute.

494
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:12,633
Obviously, the young lady
doesn't wish to be photographed.

495
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:14,468
That's none of your affair.

496
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:18,305
Now, clear out, all of you!

497
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,559
Hello.

498
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,979
Connie, are you all right?

499
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:26,689
Yes, dear, I'm all right.

500
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,567
This is an outrage.
You men ought to be arrested.

501
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,319
We'll fix him.
That was William Chandler, the author.

502
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:35,531
- Remember that name, Graham.
- Yes, sir. William Chandler.

503
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:39,495
I ought to have charged that blighter
L10 instead of L5.

504
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,279
Come in.

505
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,865
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

506
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,158
Mr. Allenbury's compliments.

507
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,328
Will Mr. Chandler join him
for cocktails before dinner?

508
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,872
- Mr. Allenbury?
- Mr. J.B. Allenbury.

509
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,501
The lady you rescued from those reporters
today is Mr. Allenbury's daughter.

510
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,506
Yes. I'll be delighted to have cocktails
with Mr. Allenbury.

511
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,551
- 7:30, the Grill Room bar.
- 7:30. Thank you.

512
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,849
- You rang, sir?
- Yes. Steward...

513
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:41,311
do you know if they have any
books in the ship's library on angling?

514
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:44,356
- Angling, sir?
- Yes. You know, trout fishing?

515
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:47,359
Yes. We have several.
Shall I fetch you one, sir?

516
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,819
Yes, just bring me all of them.

517
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:52,156
- All of them, sir?
- Yes.

518
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:57,204
The best rainbow-trout fishing
is found in Lake...

519
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,461
Taupo. Lake Taupo, New Zealand.

520
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,882
The best rainbow-trout fishing
is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.

521
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,926
Lake Taupo.

522
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,513
The best rainbow-trout fishing
is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.

523
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:19,061
Now, the best rainbow-trout fishing
is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.

524
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:20,229
Yes.

525
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:25,067
Mr. Allenbury has been delayed
by a ship phone call from America...

526
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,778
- but he asked that you order. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

527
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:31,240
We appreciated what you did
this morning. Most unfortunate.

528
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:33,951
- Here's Mr. Allenbury.
- Sorry to be late, Mr...

529
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:36,286
- Chandler.
- Chandler. Have you ordered?

530
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:39,289
- A dry martini, please.
- The same.

531
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:41,417
Now, if you'll excuse me.

532
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,588
- Did we hear from the bank?
- Complete accounting.

533
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:47,007
And Jennings, shall he meet you
in Washington?

534
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,718
No, he'd better come to New York
and fly down with me.

535
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:53,055
That's the only time that I'll have.
Be sure that the plane is ready.

536
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,307
- It's ordered for noon.
- Good.

537
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,477
Now, young man, I want to thank you...

538
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,398
for what you did this morning,
both for my daughter and myself.

539
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,276
- Quick thought on your part.
- I rather enjoyed it.

540
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,948
As a matter of fact, newspapers and I
are not very good friends.

541
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:12,410
One time in Chicago,
I sent a reporter to a hospital.

542
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:15,163
- My publishers never forgave me.
- Publishers?

543
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:17,373
Yes. I'm a writer.

544
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:18,916
Indeed?

545
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,794
Just now, I'm doing some fishing yarns.

546
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:23,921
Really?

547
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:27,091
Yes.

548
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,676
Well, Father?

549
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,511
Connie, my dear, I wasn't...

550
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,016
- I want you to meet Mr...
- Chandler.

551
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:35,810
Mr. Chandler.
The man who saved your life.

552
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:38,354
Yes, indeed. Thank you so much.

553
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,732
I thought you were with
those people from Plymouth.

554
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:44,527
I ran out on them. I simply can't be
bothered with people you meet on boats.

555
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:47,196
I'm glad that we met on the dock.

556
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,948
- A mint frappé.
- Yes, miss.

557
00:28:49,032 --> 00:28:51,868
I should apologize for the scene I caused.

558
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,203
Waiter, never mind. I won't have any.

559
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,414
Mr. Charmers...

560
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,711
- Chandler.
- Mr. Chandler is a writer.

561
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:02,297
How amusing. What do you write?

562
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:05,675
Father, guess who's with us.

563
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:09,220
Mrs. Burns-Norvell,
and that dreadful daughter of hers.

564
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:12,265
We elude them in Europe,
and now we meet them on the same boat.

565
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,684
Now we're in for it.
They'll be asking us to dinner.

566
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:17,896
Not if we see them first.
I've been ducking them all day.

567
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:19,940
Are you having fun, Mr...

568
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,320
My plane. Father, did you
cable about my plane?

569
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:26,573
- Leave it in storage. I've chartered one.
- But I want my own.

570
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,059
I'm dying to feel the stick
in my hands again.

571
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:32,311
Do you fly, Mr. Charmers?

572
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,190
Chandler. Oh, yes, I've...

573
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:39,569
I've flown across with Lindbergh
a couple of times.

574
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,330
But my favorite sport is fishing.

575
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,875
Sorry, Mr. Allenbury, it's 7:30.

576
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,586
Thank you for joining us.

577
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,880
If ever we need your help again,
I hope you'll be on hand.

578
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,800
It's been so nice to see you.

579
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,053
Good evening.

580
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,307
Here they are, Mother.

581
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,392
Connie! Connie, my dear!

582
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,686
We've been looking for you
all over the boat.

583
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,899
My dears! It's so nice
to see you both again.

584
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:17,652
Bert will be so pleased
that we're crossing together.

585
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:21,656
- How are you, Mrs. Burns-Norvell?
- And you're joining us for dinner.

586
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,074
I won't take no.

587
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,618
It's my birthday, I'll be 21 at midnight.

588
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:28,455
- I'm very sorry.
- No, no excuses.

589
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,791
We'd love to, but you see, Connie...

590
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,670
I'm sorry if I'm late, J.B.,
but I had to send a very important wire.

591
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:37,881
Shall we go in to dinner now?

592
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:42,346
- Yes.
- We're dining with Mr. Charmers.

593
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:46,433
Mrs. Burns-Norvell
and her daughter, Barbara.

594
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:47,851
How do you do?

595
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:50,062
Can't we all have dinner together?

596
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:54,900
- They're going to talk business.
- Yes.

597
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,152
You see, I'm a writer...

598
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:00,072
and Mr. Allenbury and I
are doing a book together.

599
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:03,952
But too wonderful!
You must tell me all about it tomorrow.

600
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,997
- I'm always up for lunch.
- Yes.

601
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,459
Well, we're indebted to you again. Thanks.

602
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,920
That was fast thinking.

603
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,257
I suppose we'll have to have
dinner together now. Shall we?

604
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,219
Three, sir?

605
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,930
Father, you're in luck.

606
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:25,265
Your favorite fish, brook trout.

607
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,270
Do you care for trout?

608
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,814
Do I care for trout?

609
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,441
The one thing in the world
that I care for is trout...

610
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:33,859
in any shape or form.

611
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,778
Especially on the end of a line.

612
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,446
You're an angler?

613
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:39,698
I'm on my way now to Glen Arden...

614
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:42,660
all set to prove they'll rise
to a Parmacheene Belle.

615
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:45,371
No, not this early.
A Royal Coachman, perhaps.

616
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:49,125
Or maybe a Pink Lady by visible,
but not a Parmacheene Belle.

617
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,585
- I've caught them.
- Not at Glen Arden.

618
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,923
I know. I've fished Glen Arden. I've tried it.

619
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,633
Father...

620
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,261
shall we say trout?

621
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:08,980
What a sport.

622
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,815
To feel the trout on your line...

623
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:13,734
to play him, to reel him in.

624
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:16,946
- There's no thrill in the world like it.
- Just one that beats it.

625
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,449
When you first see him.

626
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,077
Not yet on your hook,
but rising to the bait.

627
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,162
I stand corrected.

628
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:27,625
I remember once, in the high Sierras,
I was using a Wickham's Fancy.

629
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:30,295
- No, a grizzly wing.
- Father...

630
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:33,172
for two hours we've had nothing but fish.

631
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:36,134
My dear, I was only telling him
about my trip to the Sierras.

632
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:38,511
Perhaps you'd like to dance? Shall we?

633
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:42,599
- Did you ever fish the Rockies?
- Have I?

634
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:45,145
Fisher Falls. Gluckman's Point.

635
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,563
Gluckman's Point?

636
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,194
I'm afraid that dancing
isn't exactly my line.

637
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:55,947
I should say it was part of your line.

638
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,869
- May I be frank, too?
- Why not?

639
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:02,829
You dance superbly.

640
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,790
I was hoping for something original.

641
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,296
Dear, life is so full of disappointments.

642
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:13,383
- Sorry.
- Just the lurch of the boat.

643
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,010
Afraid I wasn't concentrating.

644
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,637
It was your eyes.

645
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,722
Beautiful, aren't they?

646
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,557
They remind me...

647
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,309
Yes, I know.

648
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:25,896
Sparkling diamonds, deep sapphires.

649
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,984
No, they remind me of angry marbles.

650
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:35,491
Connie, darling! You must have
luncheon with us tomorrow, promise?

651
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,117
I've a bone to pick with you.

652
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:38,243
I'm afraid I...

653
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:41,330
I'm sorry, but we can't work
on our book without Connie.

654
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:42,998
She's our inspiration.

655
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,878
I thought that was rather clever.

656
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,255
Yes. I thought you thought so.

657
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,050
Don't I get a vote of thanks?

658
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,593
Oh, by all means.

659
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:57,429
It just dawned on me
that I seem to have made myself...

660
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,767
a permanent member of your party.

661
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,727
Yes. It's dawned on me, too.

662
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,230
Shall we sit down?

663
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,694
So, you've fished Gluckman's Point?
You're an angler, all right.

664
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,572
I should say Mr. Chandler
is quite an angler.

665
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:16,826
Will you both excuse me? I'm quite tired.

666
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,287
- See you tomorrow.
- I think not.

667
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:22,540
I'm going to read books
the rest of the trip.

668
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:24,585
- You're not ill, my dear?
- Oh, no.

669
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:27,422
That'll give you a chance
to talk fish till New York.

670
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:30,466
I could talk fish from here to Shanghai.

671
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,301
Couldn't you, Mr. Chandler?

672
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:34,887
Yes, yes, and back again.

673
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:37,390
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, dear.

674
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:38,933
Good night, Mr. Chandler.

675
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:41,978
Don't keep father up
too late with your fish stories.

676
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,939
Gluckman's Point?

677
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:49,487
Glasses?

678
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:53,449
How do I look?

679
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,326
Nobody in the world will know you.

680
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,203
Fine. That's the idea.

681
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,686
Catching up on your reading?

682
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:24,774
Remember me?

683
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:27,235
Oh, yes. I just left Father.

684
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,321
He's enjoyed his three-day fish fest.

685
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:30,614
So have I.

686
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:34,200
- He's waiting for you.
- He won't mind waiting.

687
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:35,994
You don't know Father.

688
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:38,248
You know the man. I know the angler.

689
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:41,627
It's nice you have so much in common.
I won't detain you.

690
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,337
Goodbye, Mr. Chandler.

691
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:46,423
Goodbye.

692
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,385
You've got to help me.

693
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:53,013
I'm in a bit of a jam
with the Burns-Norvells.

694
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:55,933
I've been trying to duck them,
but they finally caught me.

695
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:57,601
Cocktails and dinner tonight.

696
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,895
How nice. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

697
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:02,898
Wait a minute, now.
It's your turn to come through for me.

698
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,235
After all, I inherited them from you.

699
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:08,697
I'm going to tell them
that you and your father...

700
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:11,075
will also join me for cocktails
before dinner.

701
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:13,619
Mr. Chandler, you think of
the sweetest things.

702
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:15,663
Now when the Burns-Norvells arrive...

703
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:18,916
- you come in without your father.
- Father gets all the breaks.

704
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:21,418
And announce that he wants
to see me right away.

705
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,337
A brilliant idea for our book...

706
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,714
and that we'll have to work
the whole evening.

707
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:27,925
See, could you do that?

708
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,806
Good, then cocktails
in my stateroom at 7:00.

709
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,183
- In your stateroom?
- Yes.

710
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,769
You see, the bar is
too near the dining room.

711
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,479
Oh, I see.

712
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:41,107
- Your stateroom at 7:00?
- That's right.

713
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:43,150
- Splendid.
- All right. Until then.

714
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,789
7:00. She'll be alone
with me in my stateroom.

715
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,250
Give us about 10 minutes.

716
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,210
Swell. How did you manage it?

717
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:02,255
She thinks I've invited
a lot of other people.

718
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:21,025
How do you do? Are we late?

719
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,318
Late?

720
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,696
So sweet of you to send
a message by Connie...

721
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,656
asking us to have cocktails with you.

722
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,283
She asked you to...

723
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:31,369
She said that you were
too bashful to ask us yourself.

724
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:36,666
Where is Miss Connie now?

725
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:40,587
- We needn't worry about Connie.
- We forgot to tell you.

726
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,300
Connie isn't coming.
She has another headache.

727
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:48,597
Mr. Chandler? Where are you?

728
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:58,565
- Hello.
- The inevitable Mr. Chandler.

729
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:01,359
- How was the cocktail party?
- Delightful.

730
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:04,905
So sorry I couldn't come.
I trust the Burns-Norvells consoled you.

731
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:06,573
I found them very charming.

732
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:09,703
Far superior to many people
one meets on boats.

733
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:14,541
Yes. Babs is one girl in a million.
And so rich, too.

734
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,961
- Or didn't you know that?
- At least she has good breeding.

735
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,547
Then...

736
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:23,675
- Everything went off all right?
- Oh, yes.

737
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,511
In fact, I'm glad now that you didn't come.

738
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,888
You are?

739
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,473
Why this change of heart?

740
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,183
You're so fragile.

741
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:33,562
- Fragile.
- Yes, you damage so easily.

742
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,066
- Damage?
- Sues for $5 million.

743
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,235
That fascinates me.

744
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,071
Asks $5 million damages.

745
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:45,324
- So the Burns-Norvells told you.
- It gave me a new light on you.

746
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:49,036
Who is this marvel, I said,
Florence Nightingale? Jeanne d'Arc?

747
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:51,789
What has she done to earn
such a precious reputation?

748
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:56,168
- Found a cure for death and taxes?
- Aren't you being a little absurd?

749
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,549
- Aren't you?
- Wait a minute, you don't understand...

750
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,927
Do be careful. It might break.

751
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,931
I'm not accustomed to handling
anything so delicate, so valuable.

752
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:10,059
That should be touched only by royalty,
dukes or earls.

753
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,688
As a matter of fact,
you should be kept under glass.

754
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:31,958
And that is the last I saw of Miss Connie
until we reached New York.

755
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,293
Five days on a boat,
and she slaps your face.

756
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:37,046
- That's fine progress.
- So the wonder boy lays an egg.

757
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,341
- Would you hush your girlfriend?
- Say, listen, nobody's hushing me.

758
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,386
I've got my ticket to Reno,
my reservations at the hotel...

759
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:45,304
- and even my lawyer.
- Postponed only.

760
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:47,515
A million-to-1 we'll never see them again.

761
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:50,395
You lose. He's already invited me
for a weekend of fishing.

762
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:51,604
Just you and the father?

763
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,690
What do I do, bust in on you
and the old man?

764
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,276
Connie will be there.
I'll take bets on that, too.

765
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,610
That wasn't any farewell slap.

766
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:59,487
- When?
- We're driving up tomorrow.

767
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,990
Perfect. Alone in the mountains,
away from the world.

768
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:04,951
The next night, Gladys and I...
No. I'd better stay away.

769
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,244
- Just Gladys.
- What, alone?

770
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:08,246
And a detective.
Connie rushes from her room.

771
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:09,998
You come from yours, follow her down.

772
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,500
- What'll I wear?
- Flashlights! The case is in the bag.

773
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,379
Nice work. I knew you'd deliver.

774
00:40:14,463 --> 00:40:17,132
I think I'll wear the pink.
I look awful cute in pink.

775
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,176
- There's only one hitch.
- Hitch?

776
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,677
- Fish.
- Fish?

777
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:23,430
I've told him fish stories
that would curl your hair...

778
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:25,307
and I've never even had a rod in my hand.

779
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,810
- I'll have an instructor here in the morning.
- In the morning?

780
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,979
Him? Here? Where am I supposed to be?

781
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,772
Now, it'll be all right, Gladys.

782
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:35,400
- You're gonna leave me here alone?
- I'm here.

783
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,819
It'll be all right.
It's just a business arrangement.

784
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,574
It's mighty funny business, if you ask me.

785
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:42,534
Where are you going?

786
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:45,204
To get some bedclothes.
I'm sleeping out here.

787
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:47,706
You see, it'll be all right.

788
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:49,291
Bill out here and you in there.

789
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:52,836
Do you mean to tell me
that you're willing for me, your fiancée...

790
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,546
- the girl that you love...
- Please.

791
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,632
I've done plenty for you and the <i>Star...</i>

792
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:59,384
but there's a time to draw a line,
and I'm drawing it.

793
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,887
I trust Bill like he was a brother.

794
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,767
Yeah, but he isn't my brother.
He can't even speak politely.

795
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:09,063
- He insults me with every breath he takes.
- Pipe down. You'll hurt his feelings.

796
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:14,026
Bill, I'll have that fisherman here
the first thing in the morning.

797
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:16,654
The first false move, I'll leave.

798
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:19,198
Unless I'm cuckoo,
I'll be out before midnight.

799
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:22,368
It'll be all right, darling.
Good night, Bill, good night.

800
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,954
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, old man.

801
00:41:53,987 --> 00:41:55,280
Hello?

802
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:00,368
Flowers?

803
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:03,121
On the way up?

804
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:05,873
Oh, yes. Thanks.

805
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:18,722
Open the door, will you?

806
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,557
There are some flowers on the way up.

807
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,101
We gotta get these bedclothes out of here.

808
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:31,735
Hurry up!

809
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,363
I've lost the keys.

810
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:49,713
Good morning.

811
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:53,008
Where did you get that key?

812
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,635
The front-door key always fits both doors.

813
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:59,514
- You mean that key was there all night?
- Naturally.

814
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:08,776
- For Mrs. Chandler.
- Of course, just wait a minute.

815
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,320
For me, Billikins?

816
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:13,655
Yes, my little fuzzy-wuzzy.

817
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:20,704
They're lovely. Thank you, sugar pie.

818
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:31,381
How did you know white roses
were my favorite flowers?

819
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:32,466
What?

820
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:35,387
Haggerty sent those.

821
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,890
Haggerty never sent me flowers before.

822
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,643
No? It's all part of the plan.

823
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,686
I'm gonna get some breakfast.

824
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:45,564
I thought the plan was to stay here
and look married.

825
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:48,234
- Lf you don't mind.
- I don't mind if you don't mind.

826
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,861
I don't mind if you... Who started this?

827
00:43:50,903 --> 00:43:52,571
What do you want for breakfast?

828
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:55,032
Breakfast. You know, fruit...

829
00:43:58,746 --> 00:44:01,165
Will you have some more coffee, Bill?

830
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:03,125
No.

831
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:10,591
This certainly looks married,
a little too married to suit me.

832
00:44:14,804 --> 00:44:17,056
I'm sorry. Here, have a piece.

833
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:19,517
- Try the funnies.
- No, I wanna talk.

834
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:21,477
You do?

835
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,773
Well, all right, let's talk.

836
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:27,986
- Who goes first?
- I'll start.

837
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:31,322
You are a strange egg.

838
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:35,118
- I bet you say that to all the boys.
- I'll get it.

839
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:41,666
- Good morning. Mrs. Chandler?
- Yes.

840
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:44,210
I'm Evans from
the Angler Supply Company.

841
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:46,754
- I've bought some supplies.
- Bring them right in.

842
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:49,384
And this is Mr. Chandler.

843
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:50,760
Good morning, Mr. Evans.

844
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:53,305
I've brought everything, a complete outfit.

845
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:56,141
You'll have no trouble learning
to fish with this equipment.

846
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,396
No, sir. The elbow low and close.

847
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:03,523
Muscle has nothing to do with it.

848
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:06,443
It's the natural spring of the rod, sir.

849
00:45:06,526 --> 00:45:09,279
Too bad I'm not fishing for curtains.
I'd be sensational.

850
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:12,073
Now suppose you break your leg,
then you can stay home.

851
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:13,869
That's what I call constructive.

852
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:15,412
I was just trying to help.

853
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:18,248
Now, a little patience, sir.
Try again. And remember...

854
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,460
- the elbow low and close.
- Low and close.

855
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:27,632
Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar.

856
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:30,344
I don't quite seem to get it.

857
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,472
It's your wrist, sir. Keep it easy and fluid...

858
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:35,849
like rippling water. This way, sir.

859
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,696
Darling, don't you want
to powder your nose or something?

860
00:45:47,738 --> 00:45:50,616
And miss this?
Not for the world, sweetheart.

861
00:45:50,741 --> 00:45:53,744
Pretend there's a 5-pound beauty
in yonder pool...

862
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:55,704
just behind the jutting boulder.

863
00:45:55,746 --> 00:46:00,209
Mrs. Chandler, would you mind stepping
down here to the corner of the table...

864
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:04,298
- and bending over?
- Now I'm a jutting boulder.

865
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:07,551
I'll be a tall, spreading
tree just behind you.

866
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:08,928
Don't forget the wrist.

867
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:11,055
Remember, there's a man on second.

868
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:14,892
I know I'm never gonna get this.
I was never cut out to be an angler.

869
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,436
Look, this is the way I would do it.

870
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:22,817
- You did it, sir.
- I'll say he did it. And how.

871
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,277
That cast, sir. Why, not one angler in 50...

872
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:27,571
can master the underhand stroke.

873
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:30,284
- Underhand is right.
- You mean it's all right?

874
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:32,578
It's perfect, sir. Could you do it again?

875
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,832
- Not with this boulder, he can't.
- Like a backhand at tennis.

876
00:46:35,915 --> 00:46:38,125
- Perfect, sir.
- Yeah?

877
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,894
This is what makes life worth living.

878
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,982
A breath of this early morning air
is worth all the medicine in the world.

879
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,568
Certainly is.

880
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:04,404
We're not keeping you up, are we?

881
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:07,782
Me? No. I'm always up
at the crack of dawn.

882
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:14,080
Here we are, Chandler. My favorite spot.

883
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,874
How do you like it?

884
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,087
Fine, splendid.

885
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,424
Very much like the Lake Taupo country,
New Zealand.

886
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,677
Go ahead, we'll give you the first cast.

887
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,971
Yes.

888
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,642
I tell you. I think I'll go on up the way...

889
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,479
where the ripples are faster
and the brush is sparser.

890
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,818
This is going to be good.

891
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,655
I still bet he can't fish.

892
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,950
Nonsense. He's the best-informed man
on angling I've ever met.

893
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:50,120
- Father, darling, you're a sucker.
- Now listen to me, young lady.

894
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:52,664
I know a first-class angler when I see one.

895
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:54,666
Yes, and a first-class man, too.

896
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,295
- Lf he's first-class, I'll travel steerage.
- What did you come up here for?

897
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,339
You had a weekend all planned in town.

898
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,216
I didn't want to see my favorite father
tossed to a wolf.

899
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,928
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about that.

900
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:10,476
He's after something, and it isn't fish.
Look at those new togs.

901
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,061
A new rod.

902
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,313
Watch this.

903
00:48:22,738 --> 00:48:24,531
Great guns!

904
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:31,246
I take it all back. He's good.

905
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,919
Good? He's magnificent.
I wish I could master that underhand cast.

906
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:39,590
I've got one.

907
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:41,509
A beauty.

908
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:44,887
So have I. I've got his brother.

909
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,559
Another one!

910
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,313
Not having much luck, are you,
Mr. Chandler?

911
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:10,623
I'm surprised you're not catching
any fish, Mr. Chandler.

912
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,251
It won't be long now.

913
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:57,863
I wonder if Mr. Chandler's having any luck.

914
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:01,367
Don't worry about him.
He's a real outdoor man.

915
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:18,117
Dad, look!

916
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:24,583
Walleye! He's hooked Walleye!

917
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:27,502
But he'll never land him.
He'll never land him.

918
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:31,548
Reel him. No.
Let him play. Give him some line.

919
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:34,551
Reel him out. Reel him.

920
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,137
Here, hold his head up.

921
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:46,523
Don't net him.

922
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:53,405
Don't net him. You did!

923
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:57,034
Boy, what a beauty.

924
00:52:57,993 --> 00:53:01,538
- How'd you do it?
- I just followed the book. The hook.

925
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:05,626
Walleye. You've got Walleye.

926
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,502
- Who?
- Walleye.

927
00:53:07,586 --> 00:53:10,341
The biggest, most elusive trout
in Glen Arden.

928
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:13,344
We've been fishing him for two years
and you got him.

929
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:16,639
- It was nothing.
- Nothing, you say?

930
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,475
But I'm ashamed of you, spoiling his sport
with a net.

931
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,727
Nine-tenths of the fun is reeling him in.

932
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,688
I know. I'm sorry. I was so excited.

933
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,440
Unhook him.

934
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,067
- What?
- Yes.

935
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,070
- Unhook him.
- Yes.

936
00:53:31,236 --> 00:53:32,905
That is, no!

937
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:37,828
You invited me up here,
so you should have some of the glory.

938
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:41,666
- So you unhook him.
- I don't like to spoil your fun.

939
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:44,710
No. That's quite the contrary.

940
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:48,089
There's plenty of glory to go all around.

941
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:50,424
It's mighty sporting of you
to let me do this.

942
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:51,509
Not at all.

943
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,471
I think a toast is in order,
if you don't mind.

944
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:58,518
Hear, hear. To Walleye, king of trout.

945
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,853
How have the mighty fallen.

946
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:02,980
Undone by a Parmacheene Belle...

947
00:54:03,064 --> 00:54:05,066
and I thought his weakness
was a Pink Lady.

948
00:54:05,149 --> 00:54:06,859
Another batch coming up.

949
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:09,237
Say, you certainly have a way
with the griddle!

950
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,323
- She's a remarkable girl.
- I'm beginning to think you're right.

951
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:15,368
- I resent the understatement.
- Just a spoiled brat.

952
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:18,579
- Service.
- Yes, sir. Coming up.

953
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,499
Bulls eye!

954
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,420
Never miss. Queen of the flapjacks.

955
00:54:23,503 --> 00:54:25,588
- Father?
- I must think of my figure.

956
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:29,759
A 20-minute walk, if you can spare me,
then eight hours of sleep.

957
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:33,221
- But we need help, Father.
- No more for me.

958
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:35,515
Where's my pipe? Alex?

959
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:39,728
Lmagine, you and a flapjack.
How'd you ever get together?

960
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:42,647
And they laughed at me
when I sat down on the griddle.

961
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:44,649
I still think it's a trick.

962
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:46,901
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing up my sleeves.

963
00:54:46,943 --> 00:54:49,448
I know. It's all done with mirrors.

964
00:54:49,573 --> 00:54:52,117
Young man, there are many sides
to my nature.

965
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:54,286
Depths you'd never dream of.

966
00:54:54,786 --> 00:54:56,621
- I'll make a study.
- Do.

967
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,208
- How'd you like a swim in the moonlight?
- Swim?

968
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,294
Later on. You do swim?

969
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:04,421
Yes. Almost as well as I dance.

970
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:05,964
Then you'll drown.

971
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:10,093
- Isn't it awfully cold?
- Extremely. Do you mind?

972
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:15,017
What, me mind? My intimates call me
"Polar Bear" Chandler.

973
00:55:30,365 --> 00:55:33,535
We're only 20 miles from the place.
We'll be there in 45 minutes.

974
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,954
But I'm not supposed to show up
until midnight.

975
00:55:35,996 --> 00:55:40,002
What's the difference? You'll bust in
on them a half an hour earlier, that's all.

976
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:42,254
You'll find cigarettes over there
under the lamp.

977
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,297
Thanks.

978
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,550
- Say, you're pretty palatial up here.
- Like it?

979
00:55:46,675 --> 00:55:49,762
- I think it's grand.
- I always come down for a plunge.

980
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:51,972
I've even stayed here all night. No, thanks.

981
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:55,351
- What? Here, alone?
- Yes, there's nothing to be afraid of.

982
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:58,187
Pretty neat.

983
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,648
I like music with my moonlight.

984
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,861
You know, you're a funny kid.

985
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,697
That's what you seem like up here, a kid.

986
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,617
Very different from
the girl I met on the boat.

987
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,160
I feel different.

988
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,330
This place, it's all tied up
with my childhood.

989
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,334
The trees, the air, the water.
Even the frogs.

990
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,544
I'm mad about frogs.

991
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,507
I love it. We've always
had heavenly times up here.

992
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,593
Every minute completely filled, like today.

993
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:32,058
- Yes. It's been perfect.
- It has, hasn't it?

994
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:34,811
Almost too perfect.

995
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:38,106
And it's costing me a fortune, young man.

996
00:56:39,065 --> 00:56:40,149
What?

997
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:43,277
I'm paying dearly for this day of fun.

998
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:44,487
Meaning?

999
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:47,448
It's my own fault
for daring to bet with Dad on men.

1000
00:56:47,532 --> 00:56:49,242
I'm a rotten judge of men.

1001
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,248
Well, aren't we all?

1002
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:58,253
I bet him a new plane that you'd
tip your hand in the first 24 hours.

1003
00:56:59,045 --> 00:57:01,798
It's rather sporting of your father
to back a dark horse.

1004
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:06,177
Dad's a grand judge of character.
He placed you right away.

1005
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:10,015
Impetuous, friendly,
enthusiastic, guileless.

1006
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:11,558
Guileless?

1007
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,853
Not so sure about that.
What's your analysis?

1008
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,814
Well, I said it first on the boat.

1009
00:57:17,897 --> 00:57:22,154
Just another fortune hunter
chasing $50 million on the hoof.

1010
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:23,613
Then?

1011
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:26,283
And then you told me off
for being fragile...

1012
00:57:26,366 --> 00:57:30,912
but I still said, he's got something
up his sleeve he wants to sell.

1013
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:34,833
An oil well, an invention,
or an emerald mine.

1014
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:38,587
The last young man we took on
had an emerald mine.

1015
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,798
And will you believe it,
I even bet you didn't fish?

1016
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,844
And you lost.

1017
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:48,015
"Live and learn, Connie, my angel," I said.

1018
00:57:49,057 --> 00:57:51,226
"Next time, don't bet on men."

1019
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,940
What are you thinking?

1020
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:02,404
I haven't hurt you, have I?
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1021
00:58:02,488 --> 00:58:06,408
It was just my way of saying
I hope we can be friends.

1022
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:12,333
That's about the nicest thing
that's been said to me this lifetime.

1023
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:16,504
- Friends?
- Yes, please.

1024
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:18,964
Then you do forgive me?

1025
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:23,552
Don't apologize for suspecting people,
Connie. Keep right on.

1026
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:26,347
Ring every coin you meet.

1027
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:30,893
There are lots of wooden nickels
in circulation.

1028
00:58:33,231 --> 00:58:35,066
Come on.

1029
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,318
No, I want to talk.

1030
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:39,570
You're the first person in years.

1031
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:42,782
You're in for it, my lad.
The story of my life.

1032
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:46,577
The kitten who died when I was six,
and my great-aunt Matilde...

1033
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:51,123
and all those twisted newspaper stories
you read about my romances...

1034
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:53,543
and why they weren't romances.

1035
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:56,170
There aren't going to be any more
twisted stories.

1036
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:58,550
What do you think a paper
could make of this?

1037
00:58:58,591 --> 00:59:03,054
And couldn't they just?
You, me, here alone on a raft?

1038
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:06,933
<i>Single note of the chime
indicates exactly 11:00.</i>

1039
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:09,644
11:00. Lights out.

1040
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:12,438
And who are you, Cinderella's brother?

1041
00:59:13,022 --> 00:59:17,527
- What happens at the stroke of 12:00?
- You'll never know. I hope.

1042
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,154
- Come on, I'll race you.
- All right.

1043
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:33,420
Connie Allenbury, you've taken from me
the one thing in the world I love...

1044
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,297
my husband.

1045
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,257
- How is that?
- Great.

1046
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:40,719
- Next week, <i>East Lynne.</i>
- You just don't appreciate art.

1047
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,597
- Look, what's that?
- What?

1048
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:46,933
It's a holdup.

1049
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:48,979
- Chandler.
- What the...

1050
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:50,188
Why, Bill.

1051
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:52,399
I had to stop you before
you got to the lodge.

1052
00:59:52,441 --> 00:59:53,567
- She's gone.
- What?

1053
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,069
You mean we aren't
gonna finish it tonight?

1054
00:59:56,111 --> 00:59:58,572
She only came to put the place in order...

1055
00:59:58,613 --> 01:00:01,116
- then she went right back to town.
- Why didn't you call?

1056
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,201
They don't have telephones
in trout streams.

1057
01:00:03,285 --> 01:00:05,120
I'd better go.
Somebody might see you here.

1058
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:06,830
Aren't you going with us? Move over.

1059
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:08,874
I can't disappear
in the middle of the night.

1060
01:00:08,957 --> 01:00:12,127
What a lady-killer you are. One look
at you and the gal disappears.

1061
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,882
Say, don't worry.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

1062
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:17,009
It didn't cost $5 million, either.

1063
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:20,846
We had a nice, long ride.

1064
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,566
What are you talking about?
We can't miss.

1065
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:26,610
- The setup is perfect.
- The setup is crazy. We haven't a chance.

1066
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:28,863
At the end of the 10th round, it's a draw.

1067
01:00:28,946 --> 01:00:30,614
The girl was there in the mountains?

1068
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:32,950
- But only for one night.
- One night is enough.

1069
01:00:32,992 --> 01:00:35,744
You told your wife you'd been
called to Washington, remember?

1070
01:00:35,786 --> 01:00:37,121
Yes, like it was yesterday.

1071
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:39,750
Yeah, but you lied.
You didn't go to Washington.

1072
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,420
You went to Allenbury Lodge
for a rendezvous with Connie.

1073
01:00:42,461 --> 01:00:44,630
Our private detective
will swear he followed you.

1074
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:46,632
- But her father was there.
- That was a blind.

1075
01:00:46,716 --> 01:00:50,011
- She left the following morning.
- Sure. A guilty conscience.

1076
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:52,888
- You're insane.
- What a mind.

1077
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:55,766
Now I know where you get those
stories about working nights.

1078
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:58,436
Then you come home,
you're indifferent to your wife.

1079
01:00:58,519 --> 01:00:59,604
You fight with her.

1080
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:01,981
It's as neat a case
for alienation of affection...

1081
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:04,068
as I've ever seen,
and we slap it on tomorrow!

1082
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:06,112
- No, we don't.
- Why don't we?

1083
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,323
Because you can't get away with it.

1084
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:11,451
They'd throw that case out of
any court in the world. You, too.

1085
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:13,870
Not if I wear blue.
I'm awfully appealing in blue.

1086
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:17,832
A: I was Allenbury's guest, not Connie's.
B: I was never alone with her. C...

1087
01:01:17,915 --> 01:01:21,377
- I know the alphabet.
- But you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1088
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:22,837
Take it easy, will you?

1089
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,714
I'm getting a real in with the family...

1090
01:01:24,797 --> 01:01:26,674
and I'm developing an open-and-shut case.

1091
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,511
We're gonna file suit tomorrow.

1092
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:32,349
Be at Britton & Britton's office at 9:00,
and I can catch that noon edition.

1093
01:01:32,432 --> 01:01:35,560
You'd make your crippled grandmother
do a fan dance for that paper.

1094
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,145
Now, Gladdie.

1095
01:01:37,187 --> 01:01:38,480
Wait a minute.

1096
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:41,816
Give me one week and I guarantee
to put her in a real spot.

1097
01:01:41,858 --> 01:01:44,527
Not a chance. She's walked out
on you twice already.

1098
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:48,031
You know, Bill, I'm beginning to think
you've lost your touch.

1099
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:51,868
- Goodbye, Gladdie. Don't be late.
- Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

1100
01:01:54,373 --> 01:01:55,332
Well.

1101
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,210
That's Warren for you.

1102
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:01,338
Crazy about me,
but boy, how he conceals it.

1103
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,843
- What's the matter with you?
- I just can't make him out.

1104
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:10,722
I can understand
he's tossing me to the dogs for the paper.

1105
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:14,476
- But to do it to the girl he loves...
- Who's tossing whom to what dogs?

1106
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,770
If he goes through with this
in the morning...

1107
01:02:16,853 --> 01:02:18,774
by tomorrow night, we'll all be in jail.

1108
01:02:18,857 --> 01:02:20,317
- Jail?
- Jail.

1109
01:02:20,901 --> 01:02:23,487
I don't get you.
It's the plan we've had right along.

1110
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,740
Yeah, but we haven't enough evidence
to convince a backward child.

1111
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:29,785
If we spring this, the Allenburys are bound
to smell a frame-up!

1112
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:32,246
- Do you really think so?
- I'm sure of it.

1113
01:02:32,788 --> 01:02:35,374
But to think that he'd do this to you.

1114
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,670
A beautiful girl who loves him,
who's doing everything in the world...

1115
01:02:39,962 --> 01:02:42,464
Believe me, kid. You've put up with a lot.

1116
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:44,969
You know, you're one girl in a million.

1117
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,595
You don't know the tenth of it.

1118
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,597
You wouldn't believe what I've stood for.

1119
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,807
I know.

1120
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,059
The night I met him,
he stood me up for two hours.

1121
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,562
For what? A woman in Jersey
had quadruplets...

1122
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:56,605
and it's been that way ever since.

1123
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,107
I know. It's tough.

1124
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,359
Fine, sensitive girl like you.

1125
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,361
That's love for you.

1126
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:05,406
- The things I could tell you...
- I'd like to hear all about them.

1127
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,909
- Let's have a bite to eat.
- All right.

1128
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:18,379
- You dance divinely.
- Thanks.

1129
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:20,381
There have been complaints.

1130
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:23,426
Then you must have been out
with amateurs.

1131
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,928
I hope Warren won't mind
our dancing like this.

1132
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,471
What? Him.

1133
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,266
After all, it's perfectly innocent. Just fun.

1134
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:33,771
Sure. Certainly a girl can dance
with her own husband...

1135
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:36,733
- and you are my husband.
- Yes, quite.

1136
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:40,445
Besides, this is our last night.

1137
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:42,322
What do you mean?

1138
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,033
If you're going to file suit tomorrow...

1139
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:48,411
I'll have to move out of here
to prove that we're alienated.

1140
01:03:49,245 --> 01:03:52,123
- You know, I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

1141
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:55,793
- You're a swell kid, Gladys.
- You're not such a cluck yourself.

1142
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:59,382
I hate to see you get mixed up
in that mess tomorrow.

1143
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:02,886
Look, you don't want me to file that suit,
do you?

1144
01:04:03,011 --> 01:04:04,721
No, I don't. For your own sake.

1145
01:04:04,804 --> 01:04:08,308
Then I don't. I don't start anything
until you tell me to.

1146
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,477
It'll mean a row with Warren.

1147
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,521
It won't be the first one.
Let's dance some more.

1148
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:17,651
It's pretty late. 2:00.

1149
01:04:17,859 --> 01:04:20,904
I could dance all night with my Billikins.

1150
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:23,867
My little fuzzy-wuzzy's got to
get some sleep though.

1151
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,869
You're kind of cute when you say that.

1152
01:04:25,911 --> 01:04:29,247
So I'm going to say good night,
Mrs. Chandler.

1153
01:04:29,706 --> 01:04:31,667
- I'm off to get some air.
- Air?

1154
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:34,920
Yes, I haven't been able to sleep
for the last two or three nights.

1155
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:36,088
Must be insomnia.

1156
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:38,298
I can fix that. My father used to have it.

1157
01:04:38,382 --> 01:04:42,094
When he did, I'd rub his head
with cologne, like that.

1158
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:44,513
I'll go get the cologne.

1159
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:48,394
It isn't that kind of insomnia.

1160
01:04:48,435 --> 01:04:51,355
You know, different people
respond to different things.

1161
01:04:51,397 --> 01:04:55,317
Some people respond to rub-a-dub
on the forehead. Others drop off to music.

1162
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:58,153
Now, me...

1163
01:04:58,737 --> 01:05:01,615
- I'm a horse's hoof man.
- A what?

1164
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,785
A horse's hoof man.
That's what it takes to put me to sleep.

1165
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:09,289
The sound of a horse's hoof. Hoof, hoof.

1166
01:05:09,998 --> 01:05:11,750
You know? Hoof, hoof.

1167
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:31,105
Good?

1168
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,776
Are you amenable to reason?
Then you will come to my charity bazaar.

1169
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:37,319
No.

1170
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:40,658
You turned me down for the horse show.

1171
01:05:40,741 --> 01:05:42,326
But I ride with you every morning.

1172
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,579
You scorned my bid to a concert.

1173
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,832
But I strum my guitar
'neath thy window each eve.

1174
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:50,793
And now you refuse my invitation
for tomorrow night.

1175
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,588
But I'm dining with you and Father
this evening.

1176
01:05:53,713 --> 01:05:56,757
It's your last meal, my lad.
I'm beginning to tumble.

1177
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:59,218
I do very well for the back streets...

1178
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:01,512
but you're ashamed
to be seen with me in public.

1179
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:04,601
Certainly. A gal who smears
mustard all over her chin.

1180
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:06,060
Thanks.

1181
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,771
- Beautiful now?
- No, just clean.

1182
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:11,399
Stop turning my head.

1183
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:15,528
Now, for the purpose of the record,
what time will you arrive at the bazaar?

1184
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:18,114
Once and for all,
I am not attending the bazaar.

1185
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:19,949
Bill, what is it?

1186
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:21,242
What is it?

1187
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:22,660
It is a horse.

1188
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:29,294
Let's stop clowning.
There's something wrong.

1189
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:31,630
- Tell me. What is it?
- I can't.

1190
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:34,341
Why? Please.

1191
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,968
I swore I'd never mention it again.

1192
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:38,678
The libel suit?

1193
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,599
What's that got to do
with your coming to my party?

1194
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:43,934
Plenty.

1195
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:47,520
Connie, drop the suit, will you?

1196
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:50,273
I know you feel that the paper
hit you deliberately.

1197
01:06:50,357 --> 01:06:52,609
Of course it was deliberate,
to hurt my father.

1198
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:55,864
- So you're striking back.
- And you think I'm heartless.

1199
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:57,532
No, just foolish.

1200
01:06:57,658 --> 01:06:59,743
You think you're gonna end all publicity...

1201
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:02,829
but instead, you'll be smeared
over every paper in the country.

1202
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:07,501
And I don't care, because...
Let's not go all over it again.

1203
01:07:07,584 --> 01:07:08,627
You asked for it.

1204
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,630
That's why I won't be seen with you
in public.

1205
01:07:11,713 --> 01:07:14,174
All you need now
is one more good scandal.

1206
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:16,718
Why is there any scandal
in my being seen with you?

1207
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,223
Because you're in the public eye
more than ever.

1208
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,892
If the gossip columns link your name
with a man's now...

1209
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:24,812
don't you see that it's going
to make you light, cheap?

1210
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:27,815
You're taking this
much too seriously, darling.

1211
01:07:27,898 --> 01:07:31,735
- After all, it's my fight.
- And that makes it mine.

1212
01:07:32,403 --> 01:07:33,737
You're sweet.

1213
01:07:33,779 --> 01:07:36,699
If I had $5 million,
I'd give it to settle this thing.

1214
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:40,160
Shall I drop it, Bill?

1215
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:44,542
- Will you?
- I'll tell you tomorrow at the party.

1216
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,794
Now you'll have to come.

1217
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:49,630
How about the Athletic Club? Try the Yale.

1218
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:52,216
Try it again! I've got to get him!
Two hours late.

1219
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:55,261
This guy is driving me mad.
He hasn't seen her in 10 days.

1220
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:57,346
I can't make it out.
It's not the old Chandler.

1221
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,764
Hello? Try his apartment.

1222
01:07:58,848 --> 01:08:00,766
No use.
Mrs. Chandler was calling from there.

1223
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,017
She's looking for him, too.

1224
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:04,228
- Didn't you tell her I was here?
- She wanted him.

1225
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:07,106
She's afraid he's offended at something
she said this morning.

1226
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:08,234
She wanted to apologize.

1227
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,986
Gladys wanted to apologize?

1228
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:11,946
He was to meet her at lunch
and didn't come.

1229
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:14,574
She wanted us to try the morgue
in case of an accident.

1230
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,743
She never tried the morgue for me.

1231
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:20,288
- Say, what's going on here?
- Maybe he's working on the wrong girl.

1232
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,457
Working on the...
What are you talking about?

1233
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,792
After all, she's his wife.

1234
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:27,879
She may be his wife,
but she's engaged to me!

1235
01:08:28,963 --> 01:08:32,008
The boss wants to see you right away,
Mr. Haggerty.

1236
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:33,553
Yeah. All right.

1237
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,181
His wife.

1238
01:08:42,312 --> 01:08:45,899
What about this fellow Chandler?
I thought he was supposed to be clever.

1239
01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:48,943
He's clever, all right.
A lot cleverer than I thought he was.

1240
01:08:48,985 --> 01:08:50,403
What are you talking about?

1241
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:52,447
He hasn't seen
this Allenbury girl in 10 days.

1242
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:55,074
Do you call that being clever?
Great scott, man.

1243
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:56,826
Do you realize what this means?

1244
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,371
More than you know.

1245
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:00,832
It's your business to find out
what he's been doing.

1246
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:02,125
That's just exactly it.

1247
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:04,294
I'm going to take
the matter into my own hands.

1248
01:09:04,377 --> 01:09:06,338
I'm going to see
Connie Allenbury personally.

1249
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:08,048
Why do you think she will see you?

1250
01:09:08,131 --> 01:09:10,592
Mr. Bane, when I was a reporter,
I'd get into places...

1251
01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:12,969
that even a second-story man
couldn't break into.

1252
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:15,513
All right, try it. Make her see.
Appeal to her reason.

1253
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:18,850
She has none. This is Connie Allenbury,
international playgirl...

1254
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:21,353
the spoiled daughter
without a brain in her head!

1255
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:23,148
But I know how to handle her kind.

1256
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:26,318
I'm gonna throw myself on her mercy
and appeal to her heart.

1257
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:28,654
I'm going to give her all the sob stuff!

1258
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,616
You know, Miss Allenbury,
this situation has outgrown a petty fight.

1259
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:35,035
We've got to consider
the humanitarian aspect.

1260
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:37,371
I must appeal to your social conscience.

1261
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:40,791
Thanks. I didn't know your paper
thought I had one.

1262
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:42,334
Now, now.

1263
01:09:43,377 --> 01:09:45,337
If you go through with this case...

1264
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,966
it's going to throw 500 people
out of employment.

1265
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,803
Men and women, jobless,
walking the streets...

1266
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,723
women like yourself,
tired, cold, and hungry.

1267
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:59,144
- Driven to drink and ruin.
- You write the editorials, don't you?

1268
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,648
Yes. Now, I know what you're thinking.

1269
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,609
You're saying to yourself,
it's not my fault if people starve.

1270
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:08,404
- It's the fault of the paper.
- Isn't it?

1271
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,906
No, it's my fault, it's my mistake.

1272
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:14,286
And all my life I shall be faced
with the knowledge...

1273
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,373
that I have wrecked
the lives of 500 people.

1274
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,836
That's all I care about, Miss Allenbury.

1275
01:10:22,545 --> 01:10:24,714
Those poor, unfortunate souls.

1276
01:10:27,216 --> 01:10:29,260
After all, they shouldn't suffer for...

1277
01:10:29,343 --> 01:10:32,596
You're right, they shouldn't suffer
for your mistakes.

1278
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,225
Miss Allenbury. Thank you.

1279
01:10:36,475 --> 01:10:38,438
I knew you'd feel this way.

1280
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,942
- They must be taken care of.
- Heaven bless you, Connie. Miss Allenbury.

1281
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:47,071
And you, too, for calling it to my attention.
I shall see to it personally...

1282
01:10:47,113 --> 01:10:50,575
that the whole $5 million
goes into a trust fund for them.

1283
01:10:50,992 --> 01:10:53,453
You mean you're gonna
go ahead with the case?

1284
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:57,999
I must, to get the $5 million.
Now I shall push it doubly hard.

1285
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,042
Now I have a cause.

1286
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:03,465
But the paper will go under. It will fold.

1287
01:11:03,548 --> 01:11:05,925
Yes, I know,
but you said that was secondary.

1288
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:08,970
The main thing is to take care of
these poor men and women.

1289
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:12,974
Yes, I know, but there
are other considerations.

1290
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:18,062
Is there anything in this house
for a hungry man?

1291
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,315
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hello, my sweet.

1292
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,069
Excuse me.

1293
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:29,785
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

1294
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:34,331
Dear, Mr. Haggerty of the <i>New York Star.</i>

1295
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:35,540
Mr. Chandler.

1296
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,668
Well, not William Chandler, the writer?

1297
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,546
Yes, I'm William Chandler.

1298
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,256
He writes travel books.

1299
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:46,843
That takes you to a lot
of interesting places, doesn't it?

1300
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:48,386
Yes.

1301
01:11:48,678 --> 01:11:51,014
Of course, it's all in the day's work.

1302
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,852
I'm just becoming familiar with your work.

1303
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:55,229
Yes?

1304
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:58,273
I thought perhaps
you might do something for our paper.

1305
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:01,318
It'd be a little change
from what you're doing now.

1306
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:06,031
I'm afraid that I'm pretty full up.

1307
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:10,118
- Up to your neck, I suppose.
- I object. No more work.

1308
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:12,371
- Do sit down, Mr. Haggerty.
- Thank you.

1309
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,540
I only see him now once a day.

1310
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:17,709
Connie, you mustn't exaggerate.

1311
01:12:19,046 --> 01:12:23,259
If we must be factual,
twice a day sometimes, maybe three.

1312
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:26,053
You'll give Mr. Haggerty
the wrong impression.

1313
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:27,721
After all, he's a newspaperman.

1314
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:31,100
- Don't worry about impressing me.
- And besides, he's not a columnist.

1315
01:12:31,183 --> 01:12:34,562
He didn't come to discuss gossip.
He came to discuss the case.

1316
01:12:35,187 --> 01:12:37,856
Yes, the case. By all means.

1317
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:40,484
- Yeah, that's right.
- And it's all settled.

1318
01:12:40,943 --> 01:12:42,736
You mean you're dropping the suit?

1319
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,574
No, but thanks to Mr. Haggerty's
social conscience...

1320
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:48,035
all of the employees will be taken care of...

1321
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:50,454
with the $5 million
I shall win from the <i>Star.</i>

1322
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:53,040
That was all he cared about,
wasn't it, Mr. Haggerty?

1323
01:12:53,124 --> 01:12:55,835
Absolutely all. And now that you've
been so generous...

1324
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:57,753
I think I'll say thank you and run along.

1325
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:00,923
Please don't hurry.
You spoke of other considerations.

1326
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:02,925
They really don't matter at all.

1327
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:06,053
Just so long as those poor men
and women don't starve.

1328
01:13:06,137 --> 01:13:08,725
You've taken a great load off my mind.

1329
01:13:08,808 --> 01:13:10,101
- Have I?
- Yes, indeed.

1330
01:13:10,184 --> 01:13:12,437
I don't think there's
another thing to discuss.

1331
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,938
There certainly is not.

1332
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:17,567
I'm Warren Haggerty, the managing editor
of the <i>New York Evening Star.</i>

1333
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,652
I know. The butler told me you were here.

1334
01:13:19,736 --> 01:13:23,406
- He'll show you to your car.
- Then I won't keep him waiting.

1335
01:13:23,448 --> 01:13:25,575
And you can tell your owner,
Mr. Hollis Bane...

1336
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:28,911
we're not entertaining anyone
from his yellow rag in this house.

1337
01:13:28,953 --> 01:13:30,413
I'll make it a point to tell him.

1338
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:33,418
You're entertaining no representatives
of the <i>Evening Star.</i>

1339
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,589
Thank you. Good night.
Miss Allenbury, good night.

1340
01:13:41,009 --> 01:13:44,721
It's a surprise, Mr. Chandler,
but a great pleasure seeing you here.

1341
01:13:57,817 --> 01:13:59,404
Hello? Hello, Gladys?

1342
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,031
Yes.

1343
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:03,617
What?

1344
01:14:04,493 --> 01:14:06,661
You just saw him there a minute ago?

1345
01:14:07,496 --> 01:14:09,372
He's been seeing her every day?

1346
01:14:09,456 --> 01:14:11,249
Sure. He's been protecting her.

1347
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:13,668
He's in love with her.
That's why he's stalling us.

1348
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,670
But we got him now, and the case, too.

1349
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:18,048
How long will it take you
to get to the Allenburys'?

1350
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:20,091
A half hour? Perfect.

1351
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:21,468
Sure, he'll be there.

1352
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:24,681
He can't get away.
He was just going in to dinner when I left.

1353
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:28,310
Thattagirl. Tear the roof off.
And get in touch with me at the office...

1354
01:14:28,393 --> 01:14:31,480
as soon as you've done your stuff.
Right. Bye-bye.

1355
01:14:32,856 --> 01:14:35,692
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be dining on shipboard.

1356
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:40,697
- What? Where do you think you're going?
- I'm having dinner with my publisher.

1357
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:43,534
He's sailing on the <i>Victoria</i> tomorrow,
the 8th.

1358
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,202
Today is the 8th.

1359
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,538
No, tomorrow is the 8th. Friday the 8th.

1360
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,583
No, Bill. Today is Friday.

1361
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,960
Today?

1362
01:14:51,544 --> 01:14:53,754
- What?
- Of course. Friday the 8h.

1363
01:14:55,464 --> 01:14:57,132
This is terrible.

1364
01:14:57,216 --> 01:15:00,135
He has a contract waiting for me to sign.
I've got to see him.

1365
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:02,429
What time does the ship sail?

1366
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:05,474
- 11:00, from Brooklyn.
- You can make it.

1367
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:08,435
- I'll drive you in.
- No, you finish your dinner.

1368
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:12,106
I have my own car here.
I'm so sorry. This is terrible.

1369
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:28,791
Mr. Chandler's apartment, please.
And would you rush it?

1370
01:15:35,673 --> 01:15:36,799
Yes?

1371
01:15:37,758 --> 01:15:40,555
Don't you "Hello, Gladdie" me,
Bill Chandler.

1372
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:44,017
So you were having dinner
with your publisher.

1373
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,312
You've been handing me a line
of pretty talk for the past 10 days...

1374
01:15:47,395 --> 01:15:49,981
and all the time
you've been seeing Connie Allenbury.

1375
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:51,733
You can't do that to me.

1376
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:53,651
Don't forget you're my husband...

1377
01:15:53,735 --> 01:15:56,362
and I'm telling that
to Miss Allenbury tonight.

1378
01:15:56,446 --> 01:15:59,824
Now, Gladys, that doesn't sound like you.

1379
01:16:01,826 --> 01:16:05,498
I don't blame you for being upset,
but I can explain everything.

1380
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:09,461
Will you meet me
at the Paradise Roof in 20 minutes?

1381
01:16:09,544 --> 01:16:13,298
All right, I'll meet you.
But nothing you can say will stop me...

1382
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:16,676
from telling that Allenbury gal tonight.
Remember that.

1383
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:22,974
Here's the headline proof
on the Allenbury yarn.

1384
01:16:31,193 --> 01:16:32,611
Swell, elegant, magnificent.

1385
01:16:32,652 --> 01:16:35,280
We'll write in the gory details
when we hear from Gladys.

1386
01:16:35,322 --> 01:16:37,282
What's keeping her? It's after 12:00.

1387
01:16:37,324 --> 01:16:39,743
The old man's probably trying to bribe her.

1388
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:41,495
Say, that'll make a swell subhead.

1389
01:16:41,578 --> 01:16:44,331
"Rich father tries to bribe wronged wife."

1390
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,000
I wonder where that
skunk Chandler is now.

1391
01:16:47,084 --> 01:16:49,753
He probably ducked
to China or Africa or something.

1392
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:51,379
Hello, Warren.

1393
01:16:52,506 --> 01:16:54,635
- Where have you been?
- Dancing.

1394
01:16:55,219 --> 01:16:58,138
- What did you say?
- Dancing.

1395
01:16:58,388 --> 01:16:59,723
You know...

1396
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,811
You mean you didn't go
to the Allenburys'? You didn't...

1397
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:07,231
- No, we decided against it.
- Why you...

1398
01:17:07,314 --> 01:17:09,983
Self-control, Warren.
Very important for a man your age.

1399
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:12,152
Here. Throw this out. Go on.

1400
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,321
Now what have you got
to say for yourselves?

1401
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:18,869
- Don't shout, Warren. We're not used to it.
- Are you going to tell me what happened?

1402
01:17:19,411 --> 01:17:22,206
You'd better tell him, Bill.
His blood pressure...

1403
01:17:22,248 --> 01:17:23,833
Yes. Perhaps you're right.

1404
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:26,127
Warren, what would you say if I told you...

1405
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,046
that I had almost persuaded
Miss Allenbury to drop the case?

1406
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:32,341
I'd say you were a dirty,
double-dealing liar, and I'd be right.

1407
01:17:32,383 --> 01:17:35,261
I won't stand here
and listen to you being insulted.

1408
01:17:35,344 --> 01:17:36,512
Come on, Bill.

1409
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:38,556
Is that so? Wait. Listen to this.

1410
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:41,392
Not four hours ago,
I heard your two-timing Romeo...

1411
01:17:41,433 --> 01:17:44,230
whispering sweet nothings
into the ears of Connie Allenbury.

1412
01:17:44,313 --> 01:17:45,356
What do you think of that?

1413
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,402
Bill told me all about it. That's technique,
Warren. You wouldn't understand it.

1414
01:17:49,443 --> 01:17:51,946
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing Connie Allenbury?

1415
01:17:52,029 --> 01:17:54,031
Sure, and have you spoil
all my good work...

1416
01:17:54,073 --> 01:17:55,700
as you did tonight, barging in...

1417
01:17:55,741 --> 01:17:57,869
just as I'd about convinced her
to drop the case.

1418
01:17:57,952 --> 01:17:59,662
We didn't need any charity from her.

1419
01:17:59,745 --> 01:18:01,706
All Gladys had to do
was bust into the house.

1420
01:18:01,747 --> 01:18:05,001
As Bill says, and have you
smear our names all over your paper...

1421
01:18:05,084 --> 01:18:06,335
you headline hunter.

1422
01:18:06,419 --> 01:18:08,882
Believe me, this way is better and cleaner.

1423
01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:12,051
Tomorrow evening, the Allenburys
are giving a party. I'll be there.

1424
01:18:12,135 --> 01:18:13,678
Go right ahead, Bill. I trust you.

1425
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:16,848
And what's more, I'll get her to drop
this case, once and for all.

1426
01:18:16,931 --> 01:18:18,892
That is, unless you decide
to barge in again.

1427
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:21,936
You're so obvious, Warren.
Why can't you be subtle, like Bill?

1428
01:18:21,978 --> 01:18:23,605
Are you gonna listen to him or me?

1429
01:18:23,688 --> 01:18:26,190
I'm going to listen to Bill. He knows best.

1430
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:29,903
How do I know
that you can get Connie to drop the case?

1431
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:32,238
You'll have to take my word for that.

1432
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,783
That's good enough for me.

1433
01:18:33,867 --> 01:18:36,786
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is the best way.

1434
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,288
Now you're talking sense.

1435
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,249
All right, go ahead.
I'm sorry I blew up, old man.

1436
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,001
Think nothing of it.

1437
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,587
Now you see how silly it was
to get excited, Warren.

1438
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,173
After all, I do want you boys
to be good friends.

1439
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,508
- Come on, Bill. Good night, Warren.
- Good night.

1440
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,261
- Good night, old man.
- Good night.

1441
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,941
What's up?

1442
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:06,485
That low-down, conniving rat...

1443
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:08,487
making Gladys believe
he's in love with her.

1444
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:10,530
- He won't get away with it.
- Can you stop him?

1445
01:19:10,614 --> 01:19:13,700
I'm going to wash up the Allenbury case
and Mr. Chandler with it.

1446
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:18,497
Gladys may be eating out of his hand now,
but before I get through, she'll be biting it.

1447
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:24,380
Here, son. Tell Douglas to print up
one copy of the evening edition.

1448
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:26,715
Put that item at the head
of the society column.

1449
01:19:26,799 --> 01:19:28,467
- One copy?
- That's what I said.

1450
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:31,053
Our circulation is certainly falling off.

1451
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:35,891
I'll be right back.

1452
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:41,814
Gladdie!

1453
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:44,525
What are you doing here?
Can't a girl have any privacy?

1454
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,527
I had to see you. I got great news.

1455
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,586
It better be good,
bursting in on me like this.

1456
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:52,061
It's about Bill. Say, I certainly had
that guy all wrong. He's a wonder.

1457
01:19:52,074 --> 01:19:54,452
Congratulations. When did you come
out of the ether?

1458
01:19:54,493 --> 01:19:56,120
I was a sap to ever doubt him.

1459
01:19:56,162 --> 01:19:57,872
He just called me a minute ago.

1460
01:19:57,955 --> 01:20:00,917
Told me he's getting Connie
to drop the suit tonight.

1461
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,586
Then off he goes on
an around-the-world cruise...

1462
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:05,755
ending up at the altar...

1463
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:08,299
spliced to an eight-figure fortune.
What a man.

1464
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:09,842
What are you talking about?

1465
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:12,889
You know he's got those Allenburys
right in the palm of his hand.

1466
01:20:12,972 --> 01:20:16,142
"It seems the charity bazaar
at the Allenbury house tonight...

1467
01:20:16,184 --> 01:20:18,311
"is something in the way of
a farewell party.

1468
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:21,481
"J. B. Allenbury and his attractive
daughter, Connie, are sailing...

1469
01:20:21,564 --> 01:20:25,068
"for a four-months, around-the-world
cruise on the <i>S.S. San Ramone.</i>

1470
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:28,446
"Accompanying them on this cruise
will be Connie's current favorite...

1471
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:29,864
"William Chandler.

1472
01:20:29,948 --> 01:20:31,741
"Do we hear wedding bells?"

1473
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:34,786
- How do you like that?
- Let me see that paper.

1474
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:38,208
I have to run. Just thought
you'd like to hear the good news.

1475
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,002
Somebody get me out of here!

1476
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,004
Get me out of here!

1477
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,509
Have a photographer
at Allenbury's home at 9:00.

1478
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:50,011
- There's gonna be fireworks there tonight.
- Right.

1479
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:12,411
Step this way for the great game of skill.

1480
01:21:12,494 --> 01:21:14,955
Darto. Throw a dart
and win a beautiful prize.

1481
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,624
$1 a dart, and cheap at half the price.

1482
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,626
Woo lady luck at the wheel of chance.

1483
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,963
Pick the winning number
and win a priceless prize for the lady.

1484
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,339
Come one, come all.

1485
01:21:24,423 --> 01:21:27,050
Look, ring the neck of a bottle
and win a baby doll.

1486
01:21:27,092 --> 01:21:30,556
No trick, no deception.
Pure, unadulterated skill.

1487
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,599
Yes, sir. How many?

1488
01:21:32,683 --> 01:21:34,643
Where's Connie? I must see Connie.

1489
01:21:34,727 --> 01:21:37,229
I'm so anxious to tell her
about Mr. Chandler's wife.

1490
01:21:37,312 --> 01:21:39,148
- Mr. Chandler's wife?
- Yes.

1491
01:21:39,606 --> 01:21:42,985
You know Chandler, the fish man
on the boat? We met his wife.

1492
01:21:43,068 --> 01:21:44,945
A most amazing creature.

1493
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,947
But nonsense. He's not married.

1494
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:48,532
We never dreamed he was married.

1495
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:51,285
He didn't look married
and he certainly didn't act married.

1496
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:52,872
The married ones never do.

1497
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:54,373
I'm sure there's a mistake.

1498
01:21:54,457 --> 01:21:57,585
No, there isn't. We saw him this afternoon
coming out of the hotel.

1499
01:21:57,626 --> 01:22:01,088
We called him, both of us,
but he was getting into a taxi.

1500
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:03,215
Let's have a drink.

1501
01:22:03,299 --> 01:22:05,968
I had to run half a block,
trying to make him see me.

1502
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:09,096
But he'd gone. So we went into the hotel
to leave a message.

1503
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,724
The clerk asked
if we wished to speak to his wife.

1504
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:15,269
I said, "Naturally." He said that
she was in the beauty shop.

1505
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:19,442
We saw her. My dear, she's a case.
A psychopathic case.

1506
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:22,945
She was in a booth, and she kept
screaming, "Let me out of here!"

1507
01:22:22,987 --> 01:22:25,406
Before we could speak to her,
she rushed past us.

1508
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,533
Look, there's Connie
and Mr. Chandler now.

1509
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:29,327
All ready. Hold still, please.

1510
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,871
Why, grandma, what big muscles
you've got.

1511
01:22:31,954 --> 01:22:34,123
The better to sock you with, grandpa.

1512
01:22:34,207 --> 01:22:35,750
Hold still.

1513
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:39,462
You wait here. I'll get them.
We'll make a party of it.

1514
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:43,176
Waitress. Mary,
champagne cocktails for five, please.

1515
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:44,427
I'll be right back.

1516
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,970
Queen of the air.

1517
01:22:50,558 --> 01:22:53,228
Now, now. One at a time, please.

1518
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:55,271
Connie, I must see you.

1519
01:22:55,355 --> 01:22:56,564
What is it, dear?

1520
01:22:56,648 --> 01:22:58,524
I can't talk to you here.

1521
01:22:58,566 --> 01:23:00,485
- But Bill...
- He'll keep.

1522
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,196
Thank you.

1523
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:07,701
Connie?

1524
01:23:11,248 --> 01:23:12,415
I've been robbed.

1525
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:17,712
Driver, can't you go any faster?

1526
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:20,215
I can, lady, but the cab can't.

1527
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,635
Now, what is it?

1528
01:23:23,718 --> 01:23:27,555
I haven't seen you this worried
since I stole your favorite fishing rod.

1529
01:23:27,597 --> 01:23:30,558
Connie, how much does
Chandler mean to you?

1530
01:23:30,642 --> 01:23:34,022
- Not jealous, are you?
- Are you in love with him?

1531
01:23:34,064 --> 01:23:35,232
Terribly.

1532
01:23:36,066 --> 01:23:38,402
More than I ever dreamed
I could care for anyone.

1533
01:23:38,443 --> 01:23:39,861
You're sure?

1534
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:43,657
I'm sure. Why? You like him, don't you?

1535
01:23:43,824 --> 01:23:45,242
Of course.

1536
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,828
Then what are you
being so mysterious about?

1537
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:49,371
What is it, Dad?

1538
01:23:50,455 --> 01:23:52,666
The Burns-Norvells say he's married.

1539
01:23:56,628 --> 01:24:00,050
I don't believe it.
You know the Burns-Norvells.

1540
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:03,262
I'm afraid it's true, Connie.
They've even met the woman.

1541
01:24:05,264 --> 01:24:08,976
No. I don't believe it. I won't.

1542
01:24:09,518 --> 01:24:11,020
Now, Connie, please.

1543
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:13,647
And yet it explains so much.

1544
01:24:14,398 --> 01:24:16,900
Why we've always had to meet alone...

1545
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:20,404
It's hideous suspecting him...

1546
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:23,784
- and yet...
- We've got to know.

1547
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:26,287
- Roberts?
- Yes, sir.

1548
01:24:26,454 --> 01:24:29,582
- Ask Mr. Chandler to come here, please.
- Very good, sir.

1549
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,626
- But let me ask him, Dad.
- No, Connie.

1550
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,962
Please. It's my problem.

1551
01:24:35,421 --> 01:24:37,381
Let me handle it my own way.

1552
01:24:37,465 --> 01:24:39,675
You're sure you don't want me to...

1553
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:43,304
You'll ask him point-blank
so that he can't misunderstand?

1554
01:24:44,305 --> 01:24:48,519
Yes. I'll ask him
so he can't misunderstand.

1555
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:53,399
Go on, darling. I'm all right.

1556
01:25:03,826 --> 01:25:07,038
And so the flying princess,
tired of this Earth...

1557
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:09,165
flew back to her home, the moon.

1558
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:12,001
- There isn't any princess.
- No?

1559
01:25:12,879 --> 01:25:14,380
There isn't any moon.

1560
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:16,841
Just Connie. That's all right with me.

1561
01:25:16,966 --> 01:25:19,844
Say, I'm glad you ducked out.
It's much nicer here.

1562
01:25:20,803 --> 01:25:24,140
Bill, there's something I've got to ask you.

1563
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:26,643
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

1564
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:30,522
It's just...

1565
01:25:31,231 --> 01:25:33,066
I don't know where to begin.

1566
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:36,819
What is it, darling?

1567
01:25:38,073 --> 01:25:41,952
We've had such fun together,
such happy times.

1568
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:45,789
But, Connie, darling, what's the matter?
What's happened?

1569
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:48,959
There's a question.

1570
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:50,961
Well?

1571
01:25:52,796 --> 01:25:55,298
It's the most important question
I'll ever ask.

1572
01:25:55,382 --> 01:25:58,718
Just answer yes or no, but don't explain.

1573
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:00,845
If it's no, don't explain.

1574
01:26:02,222 --> 01:26:04,393
Well, go ahead.

1575
01:26:06,436 --> 01:26:08,230
Wait till I catch my breath.

1576
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:13,235
Bill, have you been proposed to much?

1577
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,280
Have I been what?

1578
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:18,365
You know, proposed to?

1579
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,617
Your hand in marriage.

1580
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:24,663
Well, not enough to turn my head.

1581
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:28,502
- Why?
- I'm asking you to marry me.

1582
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,131
What?

1583
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,678
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1584
01:26:38,095 --> 01:26:39,805
Will you marry me?

1585
01:26:40,556 --> 01:26:42,516
Well, Connie...

1586
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:45,602
Will you?

1587
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:49,857
What do you think?

1588
01:26:52,609 --> 01:26:54,697
- When?
- When?

1589
01:26:55,323 --> 01:26:56,490
Now?

1590
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:58,951
Now? You mean soon?

1591
01:26:59,285 --> 01:27:01,037
I mean now, tonight.

1592
01:27:01,328 --> 01:27:02,455
Tonight?

1593
01:27:03,622 --> 01:27:06,250
- Will you, Bill?
- Will I?

1594
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,253
Is there a preacher in the house?

1595
01:27:09,545 --> 01:27:12,798
- Not here. We'll take the car. We'll drive...
- To the moon.

1596
01:27:14,508 --> 01:27:16,927
- Awfully glad you've enjoyed it.
- Thanks to you.

1597
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:19,140
- Pardon me, Mr. Allenbury.
- What is it, Roberts?

1598
01:27:19,223 --> 01:27:22,435
There's a person here who claims to be
Mrs. William Chandler.

1599
01:27:22,477 --> 01:27:25,229
She wants to see
Mr. Chandler immediately.

1600
01:27:25,354 --> 01:27:26,355
Where is she?

1601
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:29,317
I took the liberty of asking her
to wait on the terrace, sir.

1602
01:27:29,358 --> 01:27:31,444
Thank you, Roberts. I'll see her.

1603
01:27:36,074 --> 01:27:38,242
Good evening. I'm Mr. Allenbury.

1604
01:27:38,326 --> 01:27:42,664
Yes? I'm Mrs. William Chandler,
and I can prove it, too.

1605
01:27:42,748 --> 01:27:45,543
- You'll have every opportunity to do so.
- I'll say I will.

1606
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,295
I want my husband. Where is he?

1607
01:27:47,378 --> 01:27:50,465
Your husband will be returned
to you intact, Mrs. Chandler.

1608
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:51,925
Just as soon as I can find him.

1609
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:53,760
- I'll go with you.
- No.

1610
01:27:53,843 --> 01:27:56,262
I think it would be wiser
if you stayed here.

1611
01:27:56,346 --> 01:28:00,683
- So, you're afraid I'll make a scene.
- On the contrary, I'm looking forward to it.

1612
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:03,144
I'll bring your husband to you directly.

1613
01:28:15,492 --> 01:28:17,619
- Follow that roadster.
- I got it.

1614
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:20,163
Perfect. Don't lose them,
and try to get pictures.

1615
01:28:20,247 --> 01:28:24,042
- Right. I won't lose them.
- I'll be getting the special edition ready.

1616
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:46,608
William Stevens Chandler.

1617
01:28:47,526 --> 01:28:49,194
Ever been married before?

1618
01:28:49,236 --> 01:28:50,862
Not to speak of.

1619
01:28:52,447 --> 01:28:55,284
My wife will be the witness.
She'll be down in a minute.

1620
01:28:55,367 --> 01:28:56,868
Here she is now.

1621
01:28:57,452 --> 01:29:00,624
- Are they sober?
- I think so.

1622
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:02,668
This is love, not liquor.

1623
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:04,712
Join hands, please.

1624
01:29:07,298 --> 01:29:10,384
William, do you take Constance
to be your lawful wife...

1625
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:13,053
to have and to hold, in sickness
and in health...

1626
01:29:13,137 --> 01:29:14,888
to love, honor, and cherish...

1627
01:29:20,811 --> 01:29:22,563
- Did you get Gladys on the phone?
- Sure.

1628
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:23,608
What did you say?

1629
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:26,319
That I was looking for you
with some important information.

1630
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:27,987
- And?
- She fell like a log.

1631
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:30,865
She asked me what information I had,
so I dropped the bomb.

1632
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:34,577
I told her I was driving by the Grand Plaza
and saw Connie and Bill go in.

1633
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:38,789
On investigating, I found they'd been
assigned to suite 805 and 807...

1634
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,333
as man and wife.

1635
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,793
- What did she say?
- What didn't she say?

1636
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,962
You know, I've been thinking...

1637
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,423
that was a justice of the peace
they called on.

1638
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:51,054
- Maybe he really did marry her.
- How could he? He's got a wife already.

1639
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:53,264
- I know, but...
- There's Gladys now.

1640
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,517
Okay, buddy.

1641
01:29:57,477 --> 01:29:59,604
We're off to the races. You wait here.

1642
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:16,289
So?

1643
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:23,129
- Gladys, this is a surprise.
- I'll bet it is.

1644
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:26,800
I'm sorry to break into your little party,
Miss Connie Allenbury...

1645
01:30:26,841 --> 01:30:29,177
but this man happens to be my husband.

1646
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:33,139
This is the lady I told you about,
a Miss Gladys Benton.

1647
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:36,851
- "Mrs. William Chandler" is the name.
- Yes. How do you do?

1648
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:41,108
- I said, "Mrs. William Chandler."
- I've been looking forward to meeting you.

1649
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:44,820
- Bill's told me so much about you.
- He told you about me?

1650
01:30:44,986 --> 01:30:47,072
Yes. Won't you sit down?

1651
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:51,576
No, you don't.
You're not getting out of here!

1652
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:54,913
I'm not leaving.
I just don't want Warren to miss anything.

1653
01:30:56,915 --> 01:30:58,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

1654
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:01,878
Could you hear all right,
or shall we start over?

1655
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,842
Hello, Mr. Haggerty. Do come in.

1656
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:08,720
So nice to see you. Let's all sit down.

1657
01:31:08,887 --> 01:31:10,097
Yes, let's.

1658
01:31:10,556 --> 01:31:12,224
What are you doing here?

1659
01:31:12,391 --> 01:31:15,686
- Naturally, she didn't expect you.
- I didn't know he was out there.

1660
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:19,189
This has nothing to do with you
or your newspaper, so you keep out of it.

1661
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:22,150
As Mrs. William Chandler, I demand...

1662
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:24,695
There must be some mistake.

1663
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:27,531
You see, this is Mrs. Chandler.

1664
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:28,826
- What?
- What?

1665
01:31:28,909 --> 01:31:30,494
Yes. And has been for a whole hour.

1666
01:31:30,578 --> 01:31:32,872
- Yes, we were just married.
- Have you gone crazy?

1667
01:31:32,913 --> 01:31:36,041
If you think you can excuse this
by pulling a marriage gag...

1668
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,918
But we are married. Really.

1669
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:43,048
Yes. I always carry
our marriage certificate right with me.

1670
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:49,471
- They're married, all right.
- But that's arson.

1671
01:31:49,555 --> 01:31:51,307
You mean it's bigamy!

1672
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:54,312
What a story.
Connie Allenbury marries bigamist.

1673
01:31:54,395 --> 01:31:57,815
Print that in the paper, you'll have
another libel suit on your hands.

1674
01:31:57,899 --> 01:32:00,318
- I'm not a bigamist.
- You married me, didn't you?

1675
01:32:00,401 --> 01:32:03,279
- That one doesn't count.
- What are you talking about?

1676
01:32:03,362 --> 01:32:07,408
About a certain Mr. Joseph Simpson,
your lawfully wedded husband.

1677
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:10,328
What are you trying to hand me?
I've been divorced...

1678
01:32:10,411 --> 01:32:13,289
You got your divorce in Yucatán, by mail.

1679
01:32:13,414 --> 01:32:17,836
Three years ago,
all Yucatán divorces were declared illegal.

1680
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,214
I found that out yesterday
in the Hall of Records.

1681
01:32:20,298 --> 01:32:22,133
I also consulted my attorney.

1682
01:32:22,216 --> 01:32:24,594
Then you and Gladys
were never really married?

1683
01:32:24,636 --> 01:32:28,056
- That's right.
- But I made an honest man of him.

1684
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:31,100
Dear, don't forget the letter.

1685
01:32:31,309 --> 01:32:33,144
Yes.

1686
01:32:35,313 --> 01:32:37,857
This is from Mrs. Chandler, for you.

1687
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:41,736
Warren, she was so touched by your pity...

1688
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:45,742
- for your 500 starving employees...
- You've dropped the suit!

1689
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:50,955
- But I...
- Connie. Miss Allen... Mrs. Chandler.

1690
01:32:50,997 --> 01:32:53,708
How can I ever...
I just can't thank you enough.

1691
01:32:54,793 --> 01:32:58,296
Connie Allenbury marries author.
What a story! What a scoop!

1692
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,840
Mr. Haggerty, you've forgotten something.

1693
01:33:01,132 --> 01:33:04,177
- Yes. My hat. Excuse me.
- Your hat and Mrs. Simpson.

1694
01:33:04,386 --> 01:33:06,971
Mrs. Simpson? Gladdie, of course.

1695
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:10,894
That "Mrs. Simpson" gets me, Gladdie.

1696
01:33:10,977 --> 01:33:14,856
I've got to run along to the office.
You phone me there in the morning.

1697
01:33:16,066 --> 01:33:19,778
Just a minute. You want a real scoop?
I'll give you one!

1698
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:22,322
I found out my Yucatán divorce
was no good...

1699
01:33:22,406 --> 01:33:25,409
so I got a second divorce
from Joe Simpson in Reno.

1700
01:33:25,492 --> 01:33:26,868
- What?
- What?

1701
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,497
- Then, we're not...
- I don't believe it.

1702
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:32,667
Then try the Reno Hall of Records.

1703
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,711
- But...
- That's quite right.

1704
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:36,588
Now where do we all stand?

1705
01:33:38,465 --> 01:33:41,802
Let's all sit down
and talk things over quietly.

1706
01:33:41,885 --> 01:33:45,347
You and I will have plenty of time
to talk this over on our world cruise.

1707
01:33:45,389 --> 01:33:48,725
I'm sure Miss Allenbury won't mind
turning her ticket over to me now.

1708
01:33:48,767 --> 01:33:51,228
Ticket? World cruise?
What are you talking about?

1709
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:53,355
You're getting all excited.
Now come along...

1710
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:54,565
What about this?

1711
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:57,317
- It's nothing, Bill.
- Yes, what about this?

1712
01:33:57,735 --> 01:34:00,698
I can explain that thing.
I had to use it as a little gag...

1713
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:04,034
So it's just one of your little gags
to get me here!

1714
01:34:04,076 --> 01:34:05,786
I'm here, all right.

1715
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:08,622
Before I'm through,
you'll all be sorry you ever saw me.

1716
01:34:08,706 --> 01:34:10,583
You were all terribly smart, weren't you?

1717
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:12,877
You were all building up
to a nice happy ending.

1718
01:34:12,918 --> 01:34:15,754
Haggerty wins his case.
Chandler wins his girl.

1719
01:34:15,768 --> 01:34:17,228
Where do I stand?

1720
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:19,485
I'll tell you where,
right behind the eight ball.

1721
01:34:19,568 --> 01:34:22,782
You thought it was a lot of fun, didn't you,
making me fall for you?

1722
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,242
Well, I did fall.

1723
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,786
But I'm picking myself up,
William Chandler.

1724
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:29,414
You can't fool me any more with your
hoof, hoof, hoof...

1725
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,457
or your insomnia or your publisher.

1726
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,710
You're a pretty poor sample of a husband.

1727
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,796
But nobody else is gonna get you,
not if it kills both of us.

1728
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:39,424
- Now look, Gladys...
- You're 10 times worse than he is!

1729
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,759
At least he had some excuse
for kicking me around.

1730
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,386
He was in love with another woman.

1731
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,013
But you double-crossed me
for the sake of a newspaper!

1732
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:49,477
Marry the paper and be the proud father
of a lot of headlines!

1733
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:51,438
That's all you're good for anyway.

1734
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:54,524
I suppose this is all very distasteful
to you, Miss Allenbury.

1735
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:56,443
You're not accustomed
to hearing the truth.

1736
01:34:56,526 --> 01:34:58,987
You've had money to protect you
from it all your life!

1737
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:01,531
You spent your entire life
buying anything you want.

1738
01:35:01,614 --> 01:35:05,577
My husband isn't for sale.
You can't buy him at any price!

1739
01:35:06,953 --> 01:35:09,706
- Will you let me go?
- You can't walk out on me like this!

1740
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:11,374
Gladdie!

1741
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:14,045
Wait a minute. Wait.

1742
01:35:14,129 --> 01:35:16,757
Let me handle this.
You two diplomats have done enough.

1743
01:35:20,677 --> 01:35:23,930
- I'm afraid it's locked.
- Then please give me the key.

1744
01:35:23,972 --> 01:35:26,558
- Not yet. I want to talk to you.
- I've talked enough.

1745
01:35:26,641 --> 01:35:27,684
Right. Now it's my turn.

1746
01:35:27,767 --> 01:35:30,103
- You can't offer me money...
- I wouldn't think of it.

1747
01:35:30,145 --> 01:35:31,646
Pleading won't do you any good.

1748
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,899
- I'm sure.
- What else is there to talk about?

1749
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:35,358
- You.
- Me?

1750
01:35:35,692 --> 01:35:38,363
I've a pretty fair notion
of what you've been through.

1751
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:41,950
- What do you mean by that?
- Any woman can be starved by neglect.

1752
01:35:42,034 --> 01:35:45,037
The little attentions
Bill paid you seemed so much greater...

1753
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,122
because you weren't getting them
from Haggerty.

1754
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:49,791
The only time he sent me flowers,
he signed it "Bill."

1755
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,920
Exactly. He probably never noticed
the clothes you wore...

1756
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:55,464
never told you how
lovely you looked, the way Bill did.

1757
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:57,549
That's right. How did you know?

1758
01:35:57,966 --> 01:36:00,344
Women can't fool women about men.

1759
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,973
- You don't want Bill.
- Oh, no?

1760
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:06,143
I know you've got him now,
in name anyway.

1761
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:07,811
But I have his love.

1762
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:11,482
You can't build a life
on hate, or a marriage on spite.

1763
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:13,484
Marriage is too important.

1764
01:36:13,525 --> 01:36:17,279
- Mine only lasted an hour, but I know.
- I'm not gonna listen to you!

1765
01:36:17,655 --> 01:36:21,992
A fine mess you made of this,
and all because you tried to steal Gladys!

1766
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:26,705
I wouldn't steal Gladys
if she were the last female on earth.

1767
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:28,542
Female? That does it!

1768
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:30,836
You can't stand there and insult Gladdie.

1769
01:36:30,878 --> 01:36:32,964
You've had this coming for a long time.

1770
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:35,174
Yes, and I've been looking forward to it!

1771
01:36:35,258 --> 01:36:37,760
- We'll settle it right now!
- With interest.

1772
01:36:37,927 --> 01:36:39,845
I don't love Warren Haggerty.

1773
01:36:39,887 --> 01:36:42,223
I'll never love him!
I never want to see him.

1774
01:36:42,265 --> 01:36:44,725
I never want to hear his name! I hate him!

1775
01:36:45,226 --> 01:36:47,603
- They're fighting!
- Warren!

1776
01:36:49,897 --> 01:36:51,315
Wait a minute!

1777
01:36:53,528 --> 01:36:55,029
Don't be a sucker.

1778
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:56,656
You hear who she is calling?

1779
01:36:56,739 --> 01:36:58,366
Now, are you satisfied?

1780
01:36:58,741 --> 01:37:00,326
Say, I got an idea.

1781
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:03,955
She'll feel sorrier for you
if I punch you in the nose.

1782
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:09,085
Warren, darling!

1783
01:37:09,711 --> 01:37:11,421
Why, Bill!

1784
01:37:11,546 --> 01:37:14,048
I treated you terribly
and now you are hurt.

1785
01:37:14,215 --> 01:37:15,842
It's my fault, darling.

1786
01:37:15,925 --> 01:37:18,805
I'm just a mug, Gladdie, but I love you.

1787
01:37:20,432 --> 01:37:21,808
Let me see.

1788
01:37:22,225 --> 01:37:23,768
You're bleeding!

1789
01:37:24,352 --> 01:37:27,814
You big coward, you must have hit him
when his back was turned.

1790
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,025
How dare you?

1791
01:37:32,152 --> 01:37:33,611
Are you all right?

1792
01:37:33,653 --> 01:37:35,780
What is this? What's going on here?

1793
01:37:35,864 --> 01:37:37,157
Hello, Father.

1794
01:37:37,282 --> 01:37:39,200
I got your telephone call. What's this?

1795
01:37:39,284 --> 01:37:40,452
Now be calm, please.

1796
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:43,957
- I can explain everything.
- You'd better explain fast!

1797
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:46,918
- You mean to tell me you married him?
- Yes, Father.

1798
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:50,422
- Who is this woman?
- That's Bill's wife.

1799
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:51,548
What?

1800
01:37:56,762 --> 01:38:00,015
Quiet, will you please be quiet!

1801
01:38:01,305 --> 01:39:01,615
