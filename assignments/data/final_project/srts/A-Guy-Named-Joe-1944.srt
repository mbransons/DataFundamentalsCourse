1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,397
It's Pete Sandidge's squadron.

3
00:01:57,398 --> 00:02:00,677
I'll bet you he's the best
flyer in the whole world.

4
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:02,364
He's a grand-standing windbag.

5
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,982
You can't trust him with a motorcycle,
much less an airplane.

6
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:08,532
The report says "only one
plane slightly damaged."

7
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:11,725
Every time they cross the channel,
it's the same old story.

8
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,785
Here's the squadron. I got a
chance to get a little sleep-

9
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:18,539
but no. Sandidge and Yackey are
up there somewhere playing tag.

10
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,196
And to think I once turned down a chance

11
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,814
to transfer to the quartermaster corps!

12
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,576
Another routine complaint about him
from headquarters this morning.

13
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,316
- What did it say?
- The usual.

14
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:28,531
What does headquarters think
these guys came over here for,

15
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,769
a sewing circle?

16
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,228
They're playing for keeps!

17
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,237
Cops and robbers
with rocks in the snowballs,

18
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:34,762
brass knuckles and lead pipes

19
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:37,579
and a roughneck conviction that
can lick any man in the world.

20
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,132
So headquarters in London
complains... so what?

21
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,101
Look, look, here comes one on fire!

22
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,677
I think they're coming in now.

23
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,733
Those undisciplined hooligans.

24
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:54,463
If they've ruined another ship,
I'll kill 'em!

25
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:57,294
Every time they go up, there's
nothing but trouble, trouble, trouble!

26
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:00,197
You'd think b-25s grew on trees!

27
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,699
Look at that ship!
A 3-alarm fire!

28
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:11,456
It's going to make a crash landing!

29
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:21,173
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,709
Any bloody noses down there?

31
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,111
We're all right, skipper.

32
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,638
You all right?

33
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,254
We're o.K., sir.
That was one swell landing.

34
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:41,307
- Good shooting.
- Thank you, sir.

35
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:50,079
- You o.K., Pete?
- Sure, I'm o.K. Gimme a cigarette.

36
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,112
You know, you just did make it, pal.

37
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,848
Thanks for herding me in.

38
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,076
Boy, boy, I never seen so much black

39
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,929
in one place
in my life, did you-

40
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,848
- good morning.
- Morning, sir.

41
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,919
Mission completed, sir.
All planes safe.

42
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,572
Yes. Yes, thanks.

43
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:23,335
Boy, you set this crate down
like a ladybug on a toadstool.

44
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,264
I thought for a minute you was
going to have to bail out, Pete.

45
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,663
Can't afford to lose a plane
in good shape like that.

46
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,331
Make a report to intelligence.

47
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,299
Pick me up in about an hour.

48
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,748
Sandy?

49
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,324
Yes, sir.

50
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,874
Looking over your ship, I -

51
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,516
yes, sir. I was gonna make the report.
I got a date. See you later.

52
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:43,802
- I'll make the report, sir.
- Mind if I walk with you?

53
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:45,836
No, sir.

54
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,257
Lucky the other man got
off so easily, isn't it?

55
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:52,218
You know I always bring 'em back.

56
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,402
Just a day for a little
bad luck, that's all.

57
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,153
And yesterday was your day, too,

58
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,501
and the flight before that.

59
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,158
Yeah. Been havin' a
lot of luck, haven't I?

60
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,292
What a beautiful day.
Look at that sun.

61
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:05,004
Makes a guy feel good.

62
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,351
How high were you when you
went in for your bombing run?

63
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,117
Now, look, Nails, Al is making out a report.

64
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,382
I got a date, and she's
gonna get mad if I'm late.

65
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:15,586
I gotta shave and wash and everything.

66
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,569
Why don't you wait for the pilot's report?

67
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,308
O.K. Tell Dorinda for me she's
lucky you got back at all.

68
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,802
What are you trying to
do, break up my romance?

69
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,501
Just trying to keep you alive.

70
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:27,492
Leave that to me,
Nails. I'll be seeing ya.

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,617
Yeah.

72
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:29,867
Soon.

73
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:31,384
There he is! You call him.

74
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:32,885
No. I did it yesterday.

75
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,745
Just holler, "hey, Joe"
like the Americans do.

76
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,492
But his name isn't Joe.

77
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:40,078
Don't you know anything about slang?

78
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,868
In the American Air Forces,

79
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:45,497
anybody who's a right chap
is a... a guy named Joe.

80
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,836
That's very foolish,
Peter. I'll call him.

81
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,602
No, Elizabeth. I will.

82
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,786
- Pete!
- Yeah.

83
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:52,912
We're very glad you got back safe.

84
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:55,314
Could you settle an argument for us?

85
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,815
Could you, please?

86
00:05:56,816 --> 00:06:00,219
Yeah, sure. I guess
that could be arranged.

87
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,796
Well, now, what's the beef this morning?

88
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:09,581
Well, cyril says the
spitfire's a better plane

89
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,582
than the American p-38,

90
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,688
and I say the p-38's better.

91
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,832
I didn't say it was all the way better.

92
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,922
I just said it was mostly better.

93
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,672
We shouldn't have any trouble about that.

94
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,782
The p-38 is a little faster,

95
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,205
and the spitfire is a
little more maneuverable.

96
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,707
They're both good planes.

97
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,073
You see?

98
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,344
I told him, talking all the time

99
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,211
about the spitfire being better

100
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:33,714
was bad for British and American relations.

101
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:36,051
Well, I've got an uncle in America.

102
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,529
That's more than you have.

103
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,299
Everybody has an uncle in America.

104
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,792
Pete, what would happen
if you went way, way up high

105
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,185
and forgot to turn your oxygen tank on?

106
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,525
Well, you'd get weak. You'd
get dizzy, and short of wind.

107
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,390
You wouldn't be able to think
properly. You couldn't coordinate.

108
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,214
I mean, you might tell
yourself to do one thing,

109
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,074
and you'd find yourself
doing something else.

110
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:58,571
Gosh!

111
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,728
Pete, tell us how it feels

112
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,805
to be up alone in a plane all by yourself.

113
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:04,853
Again?

114
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,095
Please.

115
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,643
Do tell us, Pete.

116
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,471
We're nuts to hear you tell it.

117
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,241
All right.

118
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:16,570
Well, when you're up there
all alone in your ship, you...

119
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,006
Say...

120
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:22,357
You kids don't ever mention
any of this stuff I tell ya,

121
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,560
do ya?

122
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,226
No! Never.

123
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,416
Well, don't.

124
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,994
We won't.

125
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,231
Well, when you're up there,

126
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,766
you're-you're all alone.

127
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,854
It's just you and your ship and the sky.

128
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,992
And you don't want
anybody up there with you.

129
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:39,113
You don't want anybody to spoil it.

130
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,323
Everything's kinda still.

131
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:45,317
You have the feeling that
you're halfway to heaven.

132
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,237
You don't even seem to hear
the sound of your own motor,

133
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:49,862
just a kind of a buzz,

134
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:52,042
like the sky was calling you...

135
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:54,516
Like the sky was singing you a song.

136
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,721
Gosh.

137
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,362
Yeah.

138
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,761
And somehow it's never
8:00 up there.

139
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,003
It's... it's always now.

140
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:04,187
And the earth is so far below you

141
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:05,689
that it just doesn't matter anymore.

142
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,873
The sky is the thing that's important.

143
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,563
The sky is your pal.

144
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:13,215
You feel like nudging it and
saying, "hi, sky. How are you today?"

145
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:16,902
And how's the old moon
the last time you saw him?

146
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,471
The wind drift comes
straight off the morning star,

147
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:22,210
and beautiful white
clouds drift towards you.

148
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,448
And they're like old friends,

149
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:27,560
friends you never
want to say good-bye to.

150
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:30,339
And you see a patch
of clear area between 'em,

151
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,222
and you duck in and out like a porpoise

152
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,123
rolling in the ocean.

153
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:36,662
And then you say to yourself, "boy, boy",

154
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:39,630
"this is the only time
a man is really ever alive,

155
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:43,366
the only time he's really ever free."

156
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,886
The old sky smiles back at ya

157
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:49,656
and says, "boy, you're
right. You're dead right."

158
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,669
What happens when your motor conks out?

159
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,239
Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

160
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,743
how did you ever get into this gang?

161
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,045
Hey, Pete, come on, will ya?

162
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:02,079
Where've you been?
I've been waiting for ya.

163
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,256
You kids run along.

164
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:05,281
Can we come by and see you tomorrow, Pete?

165
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,158
Yeah, but not a word about this to anybody.

166
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,741
This is just between us now, us pilots.

167
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,856
Gosh!

168
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,976
Well, that Dorinda is
certainly crazy about me.

169
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,190
She's an hour late already.
Our first day off in 3 weeks.

170
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,845
Maybe she figures it'd do you good

171
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,709
to be held up once in a while.

172
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,219
It kinda keeps a fella's interest alive.

173
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,085
One of these days I'll put
that dame across my knee-

174
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,581
you're not even listening to me.

175
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,900
That gal's flown stuff all
over these here British isles.

176
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,474
Bet she could teach you a
thing or two about a ship.

177
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:43,287
Then she's late on
purpose. That's worse.

178
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,779
What does she think I am?

179
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,219
I reckon she's got a pretty good idea.

180
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,291
What's the matter?
You oughta be feeling good.

181
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,381
Why?

182
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,106
Foolin' Nails. We talked
ourselves outta that one

183
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,890
slick as anything I ever did see.

184
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,668
He didn't have a thing to say.

185
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,806
Are you kidding?
That's just what I'm worried about.

186
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,078
That's why I wish she'd show up

187
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,157
so we could get outta
here! Gimme a cigarette.

188
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,833
Why don't you ever buy
a package of cigarettes?

189
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:12,689
Hey, I hear a puddle jumper now.

190
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:18,714
Yeah, that's her, all right.

191
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:21,750
Yeah... yeah.

192
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:26,387
Nobody else in the world
would try a landing like that!

193
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:30,536
I can't watch this. Let
me know if she makes it.

194
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:33,028
I've branded steer calves
that make less fuss than you

195
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,461
when that gal's in the air.

196
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,592
Look at her. Pretty a
landin' as you ever did see.

197
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,795
- Are you kidding?
- No, look!

198
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,146
How many times do I have to tell ya

199
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,616
to quit slipping this maytag
messerschmitt when you're in a turn?

200
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,145
Now you know when I saw you down
here I had to kill that altitude.

201
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:55,057
You killed more than the altitude.

202
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,658
You don't even know how to level off!

203
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,488
Is that so? Well, I always
manage to come in on 3 wheels.

204
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,723
So does a tricycle.

205
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,511
- And another thing.
- Another thing.

206
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,123
What? How'd you get
your face so dirty?

207
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,559
I waited around for an hour.

208
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,515
No other guy would wait an hour...
Grumble, grumble.

209
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,282
To watch a girl make a bad landing.

210
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:16,985
- Now, darling-
- don't darling me!

211
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,686
You oughta be grounded.

212
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:19,669
One of these days,

213
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,923
you're gonna spin in and
break that scrawny little neck.

214
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:24,173
- Not scrawny!
- It's a Turkey neck.

215
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,943
A Turkey neck. Who's talking?

216
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,373
Why, Pete! You were worried!

217
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:32,816
Did you ever stop to think
what one of those crates cost?

218
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,375
Hah! That's a cover-up.
You love me.

219
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,375
I love airplanes.

220
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,451
That's the same thing.
Hello, Al!

221
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:40,412
Say, you pretty near scared
our hot pilot here to death

222
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:41,813
comin' in like that.

223
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,715
Well, he's probably got a
crush. They get over it, though.

224
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:45,726
Least all mine do.

225
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,587
Get in before I do break your neck.

226
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,388
Pete. Sorry.
Nails wants to see you.

227
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,356
Aw, now, cliff, be a good fellow.

228
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,545
When you got here, we were
gone. It's a kind of mystery.

229
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:58,951
Yeah, but a mystery where the
detective is always the fall guy.

230
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,865
Besides, I said I was sorry.

231
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,678
See, this wouldn't have
happened if you'd been on time.

232
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,866
Come on, come on.

233
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,710
If you hadn't pulled some fool stunt,

234
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,515
he wouldn't be out here hunting for you!

235
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:09,925
What have you done now?

236
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:13,697
Nothing. You know they can't
run this show without me, honey.

237
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,366
You get all dressed up and be
at the inn for dinner at 8:00.

238
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,976
It's possible I won't be there.

239
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:21,014
If you're not, I'll have somebody
else... better-lookin', too.

240
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,472
You do and I'll scratch your eyes out.

241
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,458
You sent for me, colonel?

242
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,108
Yes. Yes... let's see, what-

243
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,635
sit down, major.

244
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,373
Thank you, sir.

245
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,991
I know what it is.

246
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:47,290
I got a problem here you can help me solve.

247
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,661
Is that so, sir?

248
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:51,671
Yes. Knowing how interested
you are in photography.

249
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,424
You must be thinking
of someone else, colonel.

250
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm not interested in photography,

251
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:57,626
especially on my day off.

252
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,228
This won't take very long.

253
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,952
I happened to run across photographs

254
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,537
of the raid this morning.

255
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,741
Very, very interesting.

256
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,328
Here. Have a look.

257
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,531
Yes, sir.

258
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,618
Do you, see it, major?

259
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:15,303
How high, or rather, how low would
you say that plane was flying?

260
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,184
I wouldn't know that, colonel.

261
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,936
My guess would be about a thousand feet.

262
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,423
That's exactly what I would say, major!

263
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,626
Exactly! A thousand feet.

264
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,881
Captain Yackey's report said the squadron

265
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:29,264
bombed at, 12,000 feet.

266
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,733
I was just wondering

267
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,982
whose plane could have
come in at a thousand?

268
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,741
And another thing...

269
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:38,123
Have you any idea what that is, major?

270
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,392
No, colonel, I haven't the faintest idea.

271
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,110
That is an engine whistle-

272
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,232
you know, off a locomotive-

273
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,758
toot toot.

274
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,822
It was blown right through
the fuselage of your ship.

275
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,558
Amazing, isn't it, major?

276
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:55,121
Would you like me to say

277
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:56,624
of course!

278
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,233
Of course I would, major!

279
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,218
You know, after all these
years of being buddies,

280
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,119
why should we suddenly allow rank

281
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,610
to come between us and the truth?

282
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,846
Speak up, Pete!

283
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,930
You said to take care of
the roundhouse, didn't ya?

284
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,326
Well, the squadron missed it,
so I went in and took it out!

285
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,827
I've been under the impression
this is a war we're fighting!

286
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,615
Of course, I could be wrong-

287
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,036
don't get excited. Of
course we're fighting a war.

288
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,620
But you seem to want to end
it in the next 3 days, alone!

289
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,654
Come on, Nails, let's get this over with!

290
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,623
All right! When you're
with your squadron,

291
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:25,681
you lead the squadron, not lone wolf it.

292
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,956
You control a lot of lives and planes.

293
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,661
I expect you to stay where you belong!

294
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,630
You said to take out the roundhouse!

295
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,732
You can't take out the
roundhouse at 12,000 feet!

296
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,168
Then make a report, and we'll
put it on special assignment!

297
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,319
When a tough job comes
up, I won't make a report!

298
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,712
And I won't assign it to somebody else -
I'll do it myself!

299
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,242
So long as I'm in command,

300
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,108
I don't want any squadron commander

301
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,257
playing hide 'n' seek
among the chimney stacks!

302
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:50,021
- Are you trying to be a hero?!
- Aw, wait a minute, Nails!

303
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:55,799
Where were you when you got
that dfc, playing mumblety-peg?

304
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,038
O.K., o.K.! You didn't catch
up to your squadron for-

305
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,035
well...

306
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:10,242
I suppose you've got me right
where you want me, haven't you?

307
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,816
Well, you know, Nails,

308
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,308
the guy in the air has always got it

309
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,762
on the man on the ground a little.

310
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:18,136
I suppose it'll always be that way.

311
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,925
Make me a promise, will ya, Pete?

312
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:20,774
Sure.

313
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:23,210
Promise me you'll be a little more careful.

314
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:24,850
Sure, Nails, I promise.

315
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,526
And look, I'm sorry I took up your time.

316
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,872
That's all right, Nails.

317
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:30,138
- Have a nice time this afternoon.
- Thank you. Thank you.

318
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,521
And Pete...
No hard feelings.

319
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:35,288
No, no, colonel.
You know better than that.

320
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,424
Atta boy.

321
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,896
Get me headquarters in London.

322
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,396
I want to talk to general Sloan.

323
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:44,943
Yes, sir.

324
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,696
And, ask miss Dorinda Durston

325
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:50,092
of the ferrying command if
she'll stop in and see me.

326
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,361
Yes, sir.

327
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,557
She's got a funny look in her off eye, Pete.

328
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:05,645
Hello, Dorinda.

329
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:07,559
Hello, honey. We've been
waiting dinner on you.

330
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,573
I hope you two have been having fun.

331
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:10,805
Will you have a little snort?

332
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:13,968
No, I don't feel like drinking this evening.

333
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:16,433
A lot of people criticize
a lot of other people

334
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,567
for doing a lot of things
a lot of other people do

335
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:22,469
which aren't nearly as bad as the things
a lot of people are doing themselves.

336
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,782
You stay right where you are, Al Yackey.

337
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,995
Don't think you can crawl out of this.

338
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,269
Why don't you wipe that
smiling killer look on your face

339
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,798
and tell us what's the matter?

340
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,998
All right. When are you going
to stop being a dime-store hero?

341
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,032
You got me! This is for you.

342
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,739
Never mind that. Answer me.

343
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,542
Well, I'd like to, but
you don't make any sense.

344
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,012
Well, let me tell you something.

345
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,056
I saw the pictures of your plane

346
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:46,426
flying low enough to scrape
paint off the rooftops.

347
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,286
Nails showed them to me.
What's more, I saw the plane-

348
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,253
them pictures-

349
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:51,728
you keep out of this!

350
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:53,309
What are you yelling at him for?

351
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,629
Shut up! You're such a low-down,
no-good heel, any woman...

352
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,965
Look, darling, this is
a little gift for you.

353
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,709
I'm very fond of you, honey,

354
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,691
but take this or I'll
wrap it around your neck!

355
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,918
Don't talk to me like that!
Who do you think you are?

356
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,803
If you want to risk your darn fool neck,

357
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,271
go ahead. I can get along.

358
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,941
Only don't sit there like a
drooling farm boy with a package-

359
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:14,576
drooling? I'm not drooling.

360
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:18,012
You're drooling and you're trying
to buy yourself off with a present.

361
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:21,757
You can take this, whatever it is,
and throw it in the garbage!

362
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,660
In the garbage? This?

363
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,549
In the garbage it goes.

364
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,326
Of all the trouble-making,
back-stabbing,

365
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,061
poison-shooting
dames I ever saw!

366
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,387
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

367
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:47,157
Yeah. Pete! Girl clothes!

368
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:48,839
From London.

369
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,687
Yeah. I've never seen ya
in a real dress, remember?

370
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:56,243
Then you didn't get it just to make
up for what happened this morning.

371
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:58,166
- You didn't have time.
- That's right.

372
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,271
Why didn't you tell me
before I lost my temper?

373
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:03,165
You didn't give me a chance.

374
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,206
But, Pete, you're such a fool,

375
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,710
and you've no right to be.

376
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,283
But you're kinda sweet.

377
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:11,055
Go on upstairs and put that
thing on, see if I recognize you.

378
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,892
If you don't, you big
lug, you'll break my heart!

379
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,795
- Lot of woman, Pete.
- Lot of woman.

380
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,244
Could be.

381
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,863
2 with soda.

382
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,926
Bad luck.

383
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,317
Make it 3.

384
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:28,499
One with poison.

385
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,914
I thought I'd find you hot pilots here.

386
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,092
We've been pining away for you, Nails.

387
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,641
Will you have a drink, colonel?
I mean lieutenant-colonel?

388
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,729
Yes, thanks.

389
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,468
That was a very funny trick
you pulled on me this afternoon.

390
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,429
Let's have a drink on that.

391
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,899
Good. What trick was that?

392
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,387
Showing Dorinda those pictures.

393
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,223
You almost got me in a lot of trouble.

394
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,839
That wasn't a trick. I was
simply trying to prove to her

395
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,691
what a solid
14-carat hero you are.

396
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,981
We're even now, Nails?

397
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:56,474
I guess so. Incidentally, Pete,

398
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:58,212
I don't believe you realize,

399
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,649
but headquarters is pretty
impressed with your record.

400
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,479
They feel you're wasting your
talents as a squadron commander.

401
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,977
They want you to be a group commander.

402
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,810
No, Nails! That's great!

403
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,181
You'd be a lieutenant-colonel at least!

404
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,436
Maybe a full colonel. A couple of
chickens wouldn't look bad?

405
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:15,760
More dough, too. Course,
I'd hate to rank you, Nails.

406
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:18,031
Ho ho ho!

407
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:21,671
They're shoving the active fliers
ahead pretty fast these days.

408
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,947
I'm afraid there wouldn't be
any advance in rank at first.

409
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,991
Not until we see how you work out.

410
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,360
Purely routine, of course.

411
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,390
Yeah, sure.
At least I won't be

412
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:32,272
pestered with you for a while,
so let's drink to that.

413
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,388
Good idea. May be your
last before you go.

414
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,751
Before I go where?

415
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:36,712
Scotland.

416
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,271
Scotland? That's reconnaissance.

417
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,010
You can't do that to me, Nails.

418
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,283
Reconnaissance is important.

419
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:43,492
There's nothing to do there.
It's like being retired.

420
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,675
There is an element of rest in it.

421
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:48,209
You've been trying to do
this to me for a long time.

422
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,905
You won't get away with it.

423
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,392
I'll go over your head to general Sloan.

424
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,016
This is funny.

425
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:55,780
Because here's an order
signed by general Sloan

426
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,331
that says you are going to Scotland.

427
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,365
Nails, you can't do this to Pete.

428
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,440
We've been flying
together ever since-

429
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,184
isn't this touching?

430
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:05,686
And really in the best
tradition of the air force.

431
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,804
Just so you don't feel
you've been forgotten, Al,

432
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:11,855
the general doesn't want any
broken hearts in the outfit.

433
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,382
Air transport'll have
a ship waiting at 5 a.m.

434
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:15,524
O.K. We'll be there.

435
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,404
That's awfully good of you, major.

436
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,707
Good night.

437
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:24,346
And thanks for the drink.

438
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,274
He won't get away with this.

439
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,544
Sometimes I wonder who he's
fighting, us or the Nazis.

440
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:33,171
He's just like all the rest
of these armchair pilots.

441
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,750
He hasn't flown anything faster
than a bathtub for 30 years.

442
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,528
He's afraid to walk upstairs without
a parachute strapped to his back.

443
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,547
Well, I'm going to beat this rap.

444
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:44,418
I'll beat it if I
have to go to the-

445
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,889
say... look at that!

446
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,391
That's o.K.

447
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,610
You like it?

448
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,224
Dorinda, you're as pretty as
a pair of yellow shoes.

449
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:22,021
Thanks, Al.
And you, Pete, my boy?

450
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,177
Gosh.

451
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,375
Have a drink.

452
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:27,178
I want to dance.
Come on. Let's dance.

453
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,026
It's a lovely dress, Pete.

454
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,646
Yeah, it's pretty.

455
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,607
Makes me realize you're a girl

456
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,163
instead of a sky-flying cowboy.

457
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:43,915
I feel like a girl, too.

458
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,902
I feel like my 16th birthday

459
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,244
and the time I graduated from high school

460
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,615
and the first time I flew
solo all wrapped up in one.

461
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,508
Do you?

462
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,144
That's a pretty large order.

463
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,348
Yeah. How do you feel?

464
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,450
I feel fine.

465
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:01,037
Did you pick out this dress all by yourself?

466
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,287
What? Me pick out a dress?

467
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,595
Are you crazy?

468
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,542
Did they model it for you?

469
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:07,597
The girls?

470
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:08,565
No!

471
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,365
I wish I'd been there.

472
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:14,394
- Why, what's so funny about it?
- Nothing, I suppose.

473
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:15,970
Pete.

474
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,573
How'd you know what size shoes to get?

475
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,490
Do you want to dance or talk?

476
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:21,071
I wanna bite your ear.

477
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,444
Let me bite your ear.

478
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:23,745
Stop that. People are looking.

479
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:26,048
Let's just dance. Come on.

480
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,169
You know that guy?

481
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,247
Pete, old man, I never
saw him before in my life.

482
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,045
Did you smile at him?

483
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,564
- I think I did.
- Yes.

484
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:50,102
Yes, I did.

485
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,170
Why?

486
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,671
Because I'm so happy.

487
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,631
That was a pretty stupid thing to do.

488
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:56,106
Why, Pete, you're jealous.

489
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:57,178
I am not jealous.

490
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,716
Don't want you giving the
guy the wrong impression.

491
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:03,477
Pete.

492
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:06,464
Did I ever give you the wrong impression?

493
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,766
Why?

494
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,763
Well... don't watch me
blush, but...

495
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,654
I tried to once or twice.

496
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,137
Say, look...
Do you feel all right?

497
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:16,187
You haven't got spots in front of your eyes?

498
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:16,898
No, no, no.

499
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,368
No, I feel wonderful.
I feel marvelous.

500
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,300
Mighty fancy. Mighty fancy.

501
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,470
Brother, you ain't seen nothin'.

502
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:41,235
Sing it again.

503
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:58,770
Pete...

504
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,679
Let's dance all night through, shall we?

505
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,038
I've never done it.

506
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,578
I read about it once.
It sounded wonderful.

507
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,554
No go.

508
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:05,681
Why not?

509
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:08,504
Al and I are shoving off at 5 a.m.

510
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:10,535
What do you mean,
shoving off? For where?

511
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,661
For Scotland.

512
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:12,734
Scotland?

513
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:15,086
Yeah. Nails
assigned us to Scotland.

514
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,439
- But he promised he wouldn't!
- He what?

515
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,251
Well, he told me he was thinking

516
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:20,744
about sending you up there,

517
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,825
and I said that 10 days'
leave would do the job better,

518
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:26,084
and we argued,
then finally he said o.K.

519
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,719
He promised me!

520
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,737
You been sticking up for me?

521
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,573
I always stick up for you.

522
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:34,835
- Pretty crazy for me, aren't ya?
- Don't fool, Pete!

523
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:38,554
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- Not as long as Nails thinks.

524
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,986
Pete.

525
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,760
You realize something?

526
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:46,686
What?

527
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,478
You realize that you and I

528
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:50,647
have never been up in a plane together?

529
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,184
Alone, I mean?

530
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,137
Yeah. I realize that.

531
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:56,361
Why don't you take me up with you tonight?

532
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:58,100
Kind of a good-bye
flight. It'll be fun.

533
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:00,254
- Yeah. It'd be fun, wouldn't it.
- Yeah.

534
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,397
You know, you're a sweet girl,

535
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:05,540
but when I fly for fun, I like to fly alone.

536
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,937
That's not fair.

537
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:08,653
It's just the way I feel.

538
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:10,326
Please, Pete, please.

539
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,162
The minute you got out of that uniform,

540
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,375
you sure became a woman.

541
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:14,876
Please, please!

542
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:17,007
You're taking awful
advantage of a pretty dress.

543
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:19,212
But I've never flown with you, Pete.

544
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,278
Dorinda, cut it out.

545
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,919
You're dancing too close.

546
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,055
Give up?

547
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,746
Do we fly?

548
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,036
Do we?

549
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,830
I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

550
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,620
You know how I feel about
women in the air, don't ya?

551
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:38,118
Promise me you'll get a desk job,

552
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,267
and I'll take you up.

553
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,960
Wrong gal, Pete.

554
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:48,664
Wrong place. Wrong time, too.

555
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,644
Pete.

556
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:58,167
Why don't you be a good guy and marry me?

557
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,843
Why don't you run upstairs

558
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,806
and skin outta that graduation number?

559
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:05,175
- Al and I are leaving in a minute.
- O.K. Give me a kiss.

560
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,088
I wonder what kind of kids we'd have.

561
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,576
Are you crazy?

562
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:14,096
Cute, I'll bet.

563
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:15,840
Not a brain in their heads, of course,

564
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,442
but they'd have fun.

565
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,765
What a fog.

566
00:28:47,954 --> 00:28:49,954
Plane's been buzzing around overhead

567
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,885
for the last half hour.

568
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:53,821
Must be like trying to find your way

569
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:55,423
through the inside of a cow.

570
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,490
I never did see such a country!

571
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,924
Even the birds are walkin'.

572
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:02,009
Routine search area "a"-

573
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,441
Fog.

574
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:07,062
Does anything ever happen up here?

575
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,678
Jack says he hit a seagull

576
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,401
about 14 miles north of here this morning.

577
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,171
Tell him if he can hit a pelican,

578
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,300
I'll put him in for the
congressional medal of honor.

579
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:17,470
Did I tell you what that kid of mine hit?

580
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:18,788
No, what did he hit?

581
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,273
I just got a letter from my wife.

582
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:23,241
The kid was hunting rabbits
one morning for about an hour.

583
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:25,938
Back he come running yelling for her
to come out and see what he's killed.

584
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:28,181
So she went out.
Know what it was?

585
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:30,544
A cow. Deader than $700.

586
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:34,281
How's that for a kid 8
years old? A full-grown cow!

587
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,556
Sometimes I think you're daffy!

588
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,963
You do?

589
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,388
Well, everybody's entitled
to their own opinion, Pete.

590
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:43,234
You know what I think of you, don't ya?

591
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:44,830
I think you're gettin' kinda edgy.

592
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:47,998
Nothing the matter with me
that a few drinks won't cure.

593
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:50,700
What a way to win a war.

594
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,717
I reckon maybe you're missing
Dorinda little bit?

595
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,184
You reckon, do you?

596
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,362
Me, too.

597
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:02,173
Just don't seem like we can hardly
get along without her, does it?

598
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:05,013
I never been so lonesome for
another guy's gal in all my days.

599
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:06,766
Where do you figure she is now, Pete?

600
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,284
How do I know?

601
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:11,395
Probably listening to some tall
talk from that jukebox commando.

602
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:13,386
I suppose you think she's doing that.

603
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:14,720
Maybe.

604
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:16,805
You can talk mighty foolish sometimes, Pete.

605
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:18,980
Why shouldn't she?
There's no law against it.

606
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:21,749
She's not married to me or anybody else.

607
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:24,268
You know, Pete, back where I come from,

608
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:28,173
folks call that love stuff
quick poison or slow poison.

609
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,407
If it's quick poison, it
hurts you all over real bad

610
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,032
like a shock of electricity.

611
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,449
But if it's slow poison,

612
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,006
it's like a fever that aches in your bones

613
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,372
for a thousand years.

614
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:41,221
Slow poison love's what you
and Dorinda got..

615
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:44,748
Yep, that's what you got,
little case of slow poison.

616
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:49,420
Hey, that guy must have
found a hole in the sky.

617
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,613
Transport.

618
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,828
Hi, cowboy.

619
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,705
Hiya. Say, you guys
really put on fog up here.

620
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:07,960
Yeah!

621
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,631
Guy around name of Sandidge?

622
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:10,557
That's me.

623
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,394
I have a package for you, sir.

624
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:14,763
Package?

625
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,136
Dorinda!

626
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,164
Well, hamstring me for an old steer!

627
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,547
How are you, honey?

628
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,203
Hello, Al. Surprised?

629
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:24,359
You bet I'm surprised.

630
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,561
You look shiny as a new propeller!

631
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,626
Shut 'em off.
We'll give you a toddy.

632
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:31,517
No, thanks. I've got my
clearance, and I'm an hour late.

633
00:31:31,518 --> 00:31:35,474
- Good luck.
- Thanks a million, ray!

634
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:44,311
I've got the most
wonderful news in the world.

635
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:47,759
Only first, give me
another kiss, you big moose,

636
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,895
a real one.

637
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:52,231
You know, Al, I think
she's really glad to see us.

638
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:54,569
Maybe it's a good idea we came up here?

639
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,888
She appreciates us.

640
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:57,790
Could be.

641
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,148
Pete.

642
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,799
Is that your plane?

643
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,376
The b-25 over there
that looks like a ghost?

644
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:06,979
Sure it's my plane. Why?

645
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,896
Nothing. Nothing.

646
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:11,184
- What do you mean?
- Let's get out of this soup.

647
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:12,832
How long you gonna hang around here?

648
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:13,899
24 hours.

649
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,283
Correction, 22.

650
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,104
What's all this big news
you're bustin' with, honey?

651
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,728
Something you lugs are going to jump at.

652
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,406
Yeah. And I know what it is, too.

653
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,149
You do? What?

654
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,479
Nails has finally decided
if he's gonna win this war,

655
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,948
he needs a little less
reconnaissance and more fighting.

656
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,724
Now, it's much better than that.

657
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:32,815
Nails is going back to the states,

658
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,006
and most of the old gang with him.

659
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:36,585
Seems they need instructors back there

660
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,984
who've had combat service,

661
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:41,272
and Nails says you two can
come along if you want to.

662
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:42,733
Do we have to go?

663
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:45,628
No, it's purely voluntary,
but Nails wants you to.

664
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,592
Now isn't that sweet of him?

665
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,916
So he sent you to try to talk us into it?

666
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,939
If you want to put it that way, yes.

667
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,060
You think I'm gonna go back and
start teaching a lot of kids to fly?

668
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,246
That's all right for a lot
of guys, including Nails,

669
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:58,120
but not for me.

670
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,035
Sit around in some officer's
club in Kansas City?

671
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:02,762
I'd go crazy!
Besides, I hate kids.

672
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:05,572
But you're liable to be
up here for the duration!

673
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:08,145
No, no. They'll get in
trouble soon then send for us.

674
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:10,223
You haven't got good sense, either of you.

675
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:13,063
You've got a chance to
go home and do a real job.

676
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:15,917
But no, you'll stick around here
till you're both knocked off.

677
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,218
We could crawl under the
bed for the duration, too.

678
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:19,276
There's the Jeep.

679
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,850
I'll get it and take you over to the inn.

680
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:24,287
Hey, sergeant! Sergeant!

681
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:30,538
What are you all steamed up about, Dorinda?

682
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,913
I've got to get him out of here, Al.

683
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:34,893
Out of here?

684
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:36,473
Yeah.

685
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,989
What for?

686
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,601
Because his number's up.

687
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,650
I could tell it the minute I saw that plane.

688
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:43,480
Aw, his number ain't gonna be up

689
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,003
for a good, long time, honey.

690
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:47,271
He'll probably slip in a
bathtub and break his neck

691
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:50,062
when he's 80 or so. He's
a lucky guy. You know that.

692
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,570
I tell you, I felt it.

693
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,655
You remember just before
Joe Bailey went down.

694
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,619
You could tell it the
minute you looked at him.

695
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,197
You told me so yourself.

696
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:58,322
That's right.

697
00:33:58,323 --> 00:33:59,862
And he washed out.

698
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:03,831
Well, that's just the way
I feel about Pete right now.

699
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,467
Well, there don't appear to be much

700
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:09,435
I can do about that, honey.

701
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,001
Yes, there is, Al.

702
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:12,901
If I can persuade him
to go back to the states,

703
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:13,987
will you go along?

704
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,515
If you feel that way about it, sure.

705
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,359
Then be ready to go in the morning.

706
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,904
How are you gonna go about convincing him?

707
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,430
You hungry? I'm going to-

708
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:22,634
as a wolf!

709
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:25,085
As a wolf? Well, then
come on. See you later, Al.

710
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:27,087
Yeah.

711
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,842
Fell asleep.

712
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:55,619
What did you do?

713
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,012
I listened to you snore

714
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,186
and looked at your legs.

715
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:00,740
I don't snore,

716
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,387
and you're a lecherous old man.

717
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:04,623
That's your fault.

718
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:07,054
Pete, you're pulling your eyebrows again.

719
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,522
She loves me...
She loves me not.

720
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,227
Well, stop it. Stop it, stop it.

721
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,235
I'm resigned to your being bald some day,

722
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:16,126
but a bald man without eyebrows

723
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,580
looks just like an egg.

724
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:21,032
Don't mention eggs. Haven't
seen an egg for 6 weeks.

725
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,720
What's wrong with eggs, anyway?

726
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,263
They have no character.

727
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:25,810
Do you know something?

728
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:28,789
I have no character, either.
Does that surprise you?

729
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,257
No..

730
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:34,253
But... I'll bet
I can surprise you.

731
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:35,855
How?

732
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:37,768
I'm applying for a transfer tomorrow.

733
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,779
- Where to?
- Australia.

734
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,714
Australia? You're crazy.

735
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:42,907
No, it's true, Pete.

736
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,265
Aw, don't be silly. Get
that out of your head.

737
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,451
Well, it's my business, isn't it?

738
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:48,551
Whose is it?

739
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:51,589
It's my business, and I won't let ya do it.

740
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,704
Well, wait a minute, my buckaroo.

741
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:55,666
How do you plan to stop me?

742
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,970
Just by saying no.

743
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,874
That sounds like an order, Pete,

744
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,940
and I don't like orders very well.

745
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,328
All right, then I'll ask ya.

746
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,351
Dorinda, don't be
a pig-headed fool.

747
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,401
Sweet, sweet, irresistible Pete.

748
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:08,879
Gentle, tactful, clever.

749
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,340
Wait a minute. Don't
laugh at me. I'm serious.

750
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:14,407
So am I serious. Now you
listen to me for a change.

751
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:16,414
I'm willing to offer you a fair deal.

752
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,859
You've always wanted to get
me out of the air, haven't you?

753
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,288
Here's your chance. You go back
with Nails tomorrow morning,

754
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,381
back to the states where
they need you and want you,

755
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,802
and I'll take ground service.

756
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:26,597
Otherwise, I'm off to Australia,

757
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:29,994
and it's that or nothing, Pete.

758
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,930
It is?

759
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,191
Well, I'm afraid then it's nothing.

760
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,043
Quick as that.

761
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,970
All right. Let's talk
about something else.

762
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,560
Yeah. You know you got
feet like a monkey's.

763
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:44,084
I bet you could pick up a dime-

764
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,252
Pete, please,
please go back! For me!

765
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,633
Why should I?

766
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,951
Because your number's
up, and because I like you

767
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:52,624
in spite of the fact you're such a lug!

768
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:56,112
You know, Dorinda, the madder
you get, the prettier you are.

769
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,524
You've been a flyer long enough to know

770
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,460
that when a guy's number is up, it's up.

771
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:03,780
Wouldn't I look swell cracking
up in a plane outside of dubuque?

772
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,098
What about me?

773
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,342
I remember a poem I learned once.

774
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:09,183
I had to learn it, as a matter of fact.

775
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:13,925
"Men must work
and women must weep."

776
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,908
I remember that women must weep part.

777
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:18,230
So that's the way you figure it.

778
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,052
Women must weep. What claptrap!

779
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:22,313
When you crack up, I'm
supposed to sit around wet-eyed

780
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:23,809
like an old man with asthma

781
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,644
and mumble prayers the rest of my life.

782
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:27,246
What a surprise you're going to get.

783
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,158
You might at least crack out with a bottle.

784
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,711
- Do you know what I'll do?
- Sure, cry like every dame.

785
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:34,793
I'll not cry. I'll find
myself a man with good sense.

786
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,429
- You'll never find as good a flyer.
- I won't, hey?

787
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,053
Don't kid your what makes
you think you're a flier?

788
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:43,135
You belong back in 1925 in a flying circus.

789
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,256
I can just see you now
out at the fairgrounds

790
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:46,398
doing loop-de-loops.

791
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,675
You never stayed with your squadron.

792
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:51,224
You're a lone wolf in a
service where men fly together.

793
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,976
You've got hero hunger,

794
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:55,933
and better men than you come a dime a dozen!

795
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,997
You'll never have as much fun with anybody.

796
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:01,256
Fun! What's fun about
knowing you're asking for it

797
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:02,998
every time you take off?

798
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:07,269
You think I like being sick
inside all the time?

799
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:08,832
Waiting?

800
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,182
Being afraid when a telephone rings?

801
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:14,091
Being afraid when it doesn't?

802
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,793
Aw, now, don't talk nonsense, Dorinda.

803
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,053
You're not going to settle
down with anybody else,

804
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:19,994
and you know it.

805
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:24,866
What makes you think I'm
not, you-you conceited ape!

806
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,122
Because I'm going back to the
states with you, with you and Nails.

807
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:33,081
Pete.

808
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,941
Yeah. You're gonna
stay on the ground,

809
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:37,604
and I'm gonna teach some of those
supermen how to fly an airplane.

810
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,841
Pete... you mean I win for once?

811
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,160
You mean it?

812
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:45,443
In a deal like this, you
only have to win once.

813
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:47,936
And I guess this is your round.

814
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:49,175
Pete.

815
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:52,845
Of course, you might
figure that I'd won, too.

816
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,690
Fun's over, kids.
Just got a report

817
00:38:56,691 --> 00:39:00,010
there's a big convoy from the
states about 300 miles off the coast,

818
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:02,007
and they think the Nazis'll
sneak a carrier out.

819
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,816
- A carrier?!
- Yep. That's what they think.

820
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:05,904
We'll just have to go
out and sink that carrier.

821
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:07,589
Can't you send somebody else out?

822
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,193
No, they're all on detail.

823
00:39:09,194 --> 00:39:12,164
Besides, I never saw a
German carrier, did you?

824
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:14,241
- Come on, Pete, we gotta go.
- I'll be right with ya.

825
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,310
See you later, honey.

826
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:21,643
You still my girl?

827
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:22,871
Most of me.

828
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:25,172
Drink to it.

829
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,506
We got a lot of things
settled tonight, didn't we?

830
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:36,760
Pete. We never seem
to get a break, do we?

831
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:39,355
What are you talkin' about?
Meeting you was a break.

832
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:40,879
- No, don't kiss me.
- Why?

833
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,208
I just don't want to kiss you.

834
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,504
What's the idea?

835
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:45,671
I'm afraid if I say good-bye,
it might mean good-bye.

836
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:48,463
A kiss can't say it.
Words can't either.

837
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,352
What are you talkin' about?

838
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:53,737
I'm not gonna say good-bye
to you for a thousand years.

839
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:55,754
But if there were
anything like good-bye,

840
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:58,958
there's be a kiss to say it.

841
00:40:02,563 --> 00:40:04,181
You sleep here all night.

842
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:05,937
I'll wake you up with a hot cup of coffee

843
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:08,940
when I come back.

844
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:16,609
Pete!

845
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,969
You don't belong back in
1925 in a flying circus.

846
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,287
You're the best cockeyed
pilot that ever lived

847
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:23,571
or ever will!

848
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,540
Sure.

849
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,405
There she is.

850
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,781
Look at that flock of destroyers with her.

851
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,361
We got enough bombs here to
give those guys some trouble.

852
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:52,980
Yeah, it'd be fun, wouldn't it?

853
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:56,888
No. This is a job for
headquarters to figure out.

854
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:00,625
What are you trying to do, be a hero?

855
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:03,386
He's waitin' for a turn!

856
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,270
Well, how do you like that?

857
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,622
2 weeks ago, he'd have
gone after the whole fleet.

858
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:10,591
He must be gettin' some brains.

859
00:41:57,478 --> 00:41:59,414
Hey!

860
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:02,162
No use keepin' that radio dead.

861
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:03,728
Radio the carrier's position.

862
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,365
We may have to bail out.

863
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,130
We're bailing out, boys.

864
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:23,920
Give cap the position.

865
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,636
02295.

866
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:27,529
5 positions. We're bailing out.

867
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,257
Navigator, mark this position.

868
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,659
Radio, notify base.

869
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,422
Hurry up.

870
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,365
When are you comin'?

871
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,696
Right away. Go on. Get out.

872
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:46,665
Get out!

873
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,300
Well, Dorinda-

874
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:41,065
don't tell me, Al.

875
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:44,002
Don't tell me. I know.

876
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,852
Maybe I better fix us up a cup of coffee?

877
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,923
No!

878
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:57,929
They picked up the other guys all right.

879
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,266
That's good. I'm glad of that.

880
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:07,500
I dunno why these things
have to happen, Dorinda,

881
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,560
but just seems like
maybe there was something

882
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:10,981
pushing him on and on and on.

883
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,646
I know. His number was up.

884
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:16,291
I knew it all along.

885
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,063
Yep.

886
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:20,394
I told him when he cracked up,

887
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:22,411
I wasn't going to cry.

888
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,978
Not one tear.

889
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:27,719
And I haven't.

890
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,077
Well, I dunno, honey,

891
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:33,716
it just don't seem right
hardly to cry about Pete.

892
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:36,560
He was a flier, and the way I figure it,

893
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:38,781
fliers may crack up once in a while, sure,

894
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:42,064
but they never really die.

895
00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:44,065
That's not true, Al.

896
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:46,299
That's not true.

897
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,936
Because... I just have.

898
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:51,644
Hey!

899
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:58,755
Hey! Dick Brumley!

900
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,880
Hiya, Pete!

901
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,149
Well, it's Pete himself!

902
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,984
Yeah!

903
00:46:01,985 --> 00:46:03,610
Hey, you had yourself quite a little show

904
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,035
with that carrier, didn't you?

905
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:06,329
Sure, sure. You know me.

906
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,734
Come right out of a cloud,
and there she was.

907
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:12,781
4 destroyers right around her.
Doing about 22 knots.

908
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:15,243
We didn't want to radio our
position, so we headed for home.

909
00:46:15,244 --> 00:46:16,754
Boy, then it happened!

910
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:18,844
Her fighter escort swarmed all over us.

911
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:21,914
Al was about 6 miles away-

912
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,378
so, he wasn't very much help, and...

913
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,006
Say, there's something cockeyed here.

914
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:30,081
What?

915
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,359
You don't belong here.

916
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,289
Well, I certainly don't
belong anywhere else.

917
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,672
You're Dick Brumley, aren't ya?

918
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:36,092
Yes.

919
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,775
I saw you shot down.
Your plane was on fire.

920
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,818
- Nobody coulda got out of it.
- That's right.

921
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:41,970
But you got out of it.

922
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:44,570
No, I rode her down, Pete.

923
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,827
Wait a minute. Take it easy.

924
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:48,859
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

925
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,694
Well, you're not crazy, Pete.

926
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:53,262
You mean, I'm dead?

927
00:46:53,263 --> 00:46:55,403
Yeah!

928
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:57,819
I'm...

929
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:01,774
You mean...

930
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:04,905
- You mean this is for good?
- You guessed it.

931
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,889
You mean I went out and
let them knock me over?

932
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,296
- That's about it.
- And now I'm...

933
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:15,366
You-you mean I'm dead?

934
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,758
Yep.

935
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:19,114
You mean... dead.

936
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:21,336
- How do ya like that?
- I don't mind it at all.

937
00:47:21,337 --> 00:47:22,529
I don't feel any different.

938
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,923
It's pretty much the same
once you get the hang of it.

939
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:26,558
This is great.

940
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,264
I never played a harp in my life.

941
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,781
There's not much time
for harp playing up here.

942
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,697
There's plenty of work to
do and good men to do it.

943
00:47:32,698 --> 00:47:34,198
Come on, let's get moving.

944
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:36,233
I want you to meet the boss.

945
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:38,955
- You got a commanding officer up here?
- Yeah, and a good one.

946
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,691
Well, let's make it short and sweet.

947
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:43,810
Hey.

948
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:45,654
What's wrong?

949
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:47,326
That Dorinda girl.

950
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:49,419
She sure called the turn on this one.

951
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,192
Well, that happens, too.

952
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:52,522
How is Dorinda?

953
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:54,783
She's fine.

954
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:57,256
- Poor kid.
- Why?

955
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,224
This is certainly gonna be tough on her.

956
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:00,935
For a while, but she'll get over it.

957
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,435
What do you mean, she'll get over it?

958
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:03,691
The girl is crazy about me.

959
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:05,693
She was, but good-looking
girl like Dorinda

960
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:07,911
doesn't have any trouble making new friends.

961
00:48:07,912 --> 00:48:10,459
I don't mind if she has a couple of friends.

962
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,079
That's very generous of you.

963
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,067
I think she should have a good time.

964
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:16,635
You know, nothing serious,
but I think she oughta

965
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:19,116
have some fun once in a while.

966
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:21,239
She will.

967
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,685
Is he our commanding officer?

968
00:48:33,686 --> 00:48:35,525
Sure.

969
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:37,416
One of the greatest flyers that ever lived.

970
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,919
Sure. We got 'em all up here.

971
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:42,924
These guys know I'm up here?

972
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:45,326
They will.

973
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,572
What a flyer he was.

974
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:53,087
Too bad he never had a chance
to fly any of the modern stuff.

975
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,064
I'd like to give him a ride
in some of the real hot stuff.

976
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,634
You may go in now, sir.

977
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:06,638
Sir, this is major Peter Sandidge

978
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,240
of the United States army air force.

979
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:10,041
At ease.

980
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:12,928
- Glad to know you, Sandidge.
- Thank you, sir.

981
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:15,845
We've been expecting you here for some time.

982
00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:18,216
Thank you, sir.

983
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:20,892
Is that so, sir?

984
00:49:20,893 --> 00:49:24,254
Yeah. I've been
studying your record.

985
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,959
It isn't much.

986
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,846
Well, I agree with you about that.

987
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:32,189
You can fly fairly well if you obey orders.

988
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,768
"Fairly well"?

989
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:36,397
I do things with a plane
the designer didn't even think of.

990
00:49:36,398 --> 00:49:38,733
That's just the point, Sandidge.

991
00:49:38,734 --> 00:49:41,102
We work here on the general lines

992
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,917
of trying to do things with the plane

993
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:44,737
the designer did think of.

994
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:46,485
Well, I can do that, too, sir.

995
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,726
I hope so.

996
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,489
You know our work here, of course.

997
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,844
No, sir. I don't think so.

998
00:49:50,845 --> 00:49:52,354
It's pretty simple.

999
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:53,813
We operate on the principle

1000
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:55,843
of helping the other fella.

1001
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:58,340
If a flyer down below
needs a little assistance,

1002
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:00,453
we assign a man to ride with him.

1003
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:02,453
I see. Sure.

1004
00:50:02,454 --> 00:50:04,585
Well, it's not much like the old days.

1005
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,450
I'll never forget the day I soloed.

1006
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:08,274
30-mile cross wind blowing.

1007
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,330
Motor wouldn't turn up.
I was just taking her off-

1008
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:11,829
you're not under the impression

1009
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,332
that you learned to fly
all by yourself, are you?

1010
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,367
Well, if I didn't, sir,

1011
00:50:16,368 --> 00:50:17,668
I'd like to know who helped me.

1012
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:20,004
Well, I guess I can tell you that.

1013
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,540
You were helped by every man
since the beginning of time

1014
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,697
who dreamt of wearing wings,

1015
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:28,840
by pioneers who flew pieces of wire

1016
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:32,269
and paste board long before you were born,

1017
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,618
by every pilot that ever
crashed into the ground

1018
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:38,620
in order that others
could stay up in the sky.

1019
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:39,911
I see, sir.

1020
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,923
Now it's your turn to pass
that along to the next man.

1021
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:43,891
Yes, sir.

1022
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:45,393
That'll be all for now.

1023
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,253
Brumley will break you in
and stay with you for a while.

1024
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,804
I think you'll like it
after you get the hang of it.

1025
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:52,146
Yes, sir.

1026
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:55,702
Well, good luck boys, and do a good job.

1027
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:58,137
Thank you, sir.

1028
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:35,242
Don't they ever salute in these parts?

1029
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:38,010
Not if they don't see you, they don't.

1030
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:40,809
- Can't hear us either?
- No.

1031
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,942
I got a hunch you and I

1032
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:44,156
are going to get awful
sick of our conversations.

1033
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:46,658
Not if we keep busy.

1034
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,106
Kind of makes you feel like nothing.

1035
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:54,402
It's going to take a little
time to get used to this.

1036
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,598
Hey, buddy.

1037
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,942
You realize there are a lot of things

1038
00:51:56,943 --> 00:52:00,179
going on around you that you
don't know anything about?

1039
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,262
You're a pretty silly-looking
guy, you know that?

1040
00:52:02,263 --> 00:52:05,861
And don't answer me back, neither one of ya.

1041
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:11,850
This thing has its points, at that.

1042
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,840
I just hope I run across
Nails Kilpatrick once

1043
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,908
before I die.

1044
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:19,401
Well, I hope I run across him.

1045
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,706
What's the layout here?

1046
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:22,847
Well, these boys have had
their 9-weeks' ground work,

1047
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,980
their 9-weeks' primary training.

1048
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:25,482
They're starting basic training now

1049
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:27,950
so you can figure out they're
a pretty nervous bunch of kids.

1050
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:30,031
We get the problem children of the outfit?

1051
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:31,333
Something like that.

1052
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:32,879
How do we know which one of these

1053
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,761
new-fangled flyers
we're gonna work on?

1054
00:52:34,762 --> 00:52:36,918
You'll see.

1055
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:37,986
You wanted me, sir?

1056
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:39,653
You realize you cleared that water tower

1057
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:41,089
by less than 6 feet?

1058
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,662
I was trying to see how accurately

1059
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:43,789
I could judge my distance.

1060
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,336
Well, isn't that fine.

1061
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:46,856
Well, when I want a fool maneuver like that

1062
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:48,103
I'll ask for it, understand?

1063
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:49,984
Very well, sir.
I was just remembering

1064
00:52:49,985 --> 00:52:51,939
that major Sandidge sank a German flattop

1065
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,523
with a maneuver like that.

1066
00:52:53,524 --> 00:52:55,883
Now, there's a great little
kid and a great little flyer.

1067
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:57,469
That will quite possibly go down

1068
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,035
as the luckiest incident in
the history of world war ii.

1069
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:01,401
Lucky? Listen to that guy.

1070
00:53:01,402 --> 00:53:02,580
He reminds me of Nails.

1071
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,315
But he did sink the carrier, colonel,

1072
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:05,932
and they gave him a d.S.C.

1073
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,511
You hear that? I got a d.S.C.

1074
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:10,354
Unfortunately, it came
too late for him to wear.

1075
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,397
We're not training you men to die.

1076
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,067
We're training you to live.

1077
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:15,752
The first budding hero I catch among you

1078
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:16,967
will be washed out.

1079
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:18,588
I don't like that guy's attitude.

1080
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,462
- Randall?
- Yes, sir?

1081
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,525
You and Rourke seem to be
having a little trouble.

1082
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:26,620
Take your ships up, and maybe I
can find out what's the matter.

1083
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,778
Yes, sir.

1084
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:29,908
That's all, boys.

1085
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:32,121
Come on. Let's take a
look at those 2 flyers.

1086
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:35,224
I don't think I'm gonna be very happy here.

1087
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:54,031
Strange feeling that's my man.

1088
00:53:54,032 --> 00:53:55,529
Boy, you got trouble.

1089
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,532
That's what I'm here for.

1090
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:07,106
What's he waiting for?

1091
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,441
Give her the gun.
More, you dope.

1092
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:14,333
No, no.

1093
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,668
How can a guy do that to an airplane?

1094
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,576
Why don't he get it off the ground?

1095
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:21,544
What's he afraid of?

1096
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:23,079
That's your problem, not mine.

1097
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,494
What do you mean by that crack?

1098
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,887
You picked him up.
He's your baby.

1099
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,298
If I ever learn to keep my mouth shut...

1100
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,300
Have you forgotten when you were having

1101
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,669
your first trouble with a plane?

1102
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,036
Say, listen-

1103
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,027
the point is, from here on out

1104
00:54:36,028 --> 00:54:38,052
the only way you can fly a plane

1105
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,517
is through that man
or somebody else like him.

1106
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,205
From the take-off I just saw,

1107
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:43,172
there is nobody else
like him. Look at him now.

1108
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:45,137
What kind of a guy
is he? Is he an idiot?

1109
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:47,160
Aw, he's a nice guy. So's mine.

1110
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,618
Yours got his m.A. From Boston
tech in combustion engines,

1111
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,774
and mine's an all-American
guard from usc.

1112
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:53,734
You mean to tell me a guy
can learn all about engines

1113
00:54:53,735 --> 00:54:55,624
and do what he's doing
to one of 'em right now?

1114
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,766
He knows what makes 'em tick.
He can't make 'em fly.

1115
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:01,540
He's nervous. Might be the
result of inheriting $4 million.

1116
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,255
$4 million?

1117
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:07,369
You know what I'd do with
all that dough if I was him?

1118
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,652
I'd spend it all on life insurance.

1119
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:12,208
I can't watch this. Come on.

1120
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:16,708
So, this is where they sleep?

1121
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:17,846
Where do we sleep?

1122
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,325
On the floor.

1123
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:20,544
That's cozy.

1124
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,571
One thing about our branch of the service,

1125
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:25,219
we'll never go soft from
good living, will we?

1126
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,779
Well, here's your man.
Get a load of that.

1127
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,109
Look at him-all spread out
on that nice soft bed.

1128
00:55:33,244 --> 00:55:37,796
How can you sleep like that
after what you did today?

1129
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:40,934
There's money bags.

1130
00:55:40,935 --> 00:55:43,103
He's not asleep yet.

1131
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:45,998
Why don't you close those big blue eyes?

1132
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:47,525
What's the matter with ya?

1133
00:55:47,526 --> 00:55:50,228
Are you a worrier?

1134
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:52,900
How do you like this guy?

1135
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,877
4 million bucks, and he's got insomnia.

1136
00:55:55,972 --> 00:55:57,903
What'll I do, let him
roll and toss like this,

1137
00:55:57,904 --> 00:55:59,504
or shall I rock him to sleep?

1138
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:01,739
Leave him alone.
He's the thoughtful type.

1139
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,274
What are you thinking about?

1140
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:04,876
It can't be financial worries.

1141
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:08,198
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you go to sleep?

1142
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,747
Look at that guy.
Look at that kisser.

1143
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:14,092
4 million bucks.

1144
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:15,885
Come to think of it,

1145
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:18,137
I never did see a guy that
inherited a lot of dough

1146
00:56:18,138 --> 00:56:20,181
that was any good.

1147
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:23,072
Good night, sweetheart.
Sweet dreams to you.

1148
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:24,486
I might as well tip you off to this-

1149
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:26,158
I don't think I'm gonna like ya.

1150
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:28,759
Like him or not, you start
flying with him tomorrow morning.

1151
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,695
Come on.

1152
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,292
You scared?

1153
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:40,629
If he's not, I am.

1154
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,434
Scared? What do you
think I'm humming for?

1155
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:44,063
This colonel Sykes is one tough baby.

1156
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:45,425
Good luck.

1157
00:56:45,426 --> 00:56:47,220
Looks like today or never.

1158
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:50,156
You're first. So long!

1159
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:57,219
Well, here we go,
against my better judgment.

1160
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,891
You can't see me or hear me,

1161
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:01,093
but they tell me I can get through to ya.

1162
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:04,228
Personally, I doubt it.

1163
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:06,964
No, no, no.
Don't hug the ground.

1164
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,065
Give her the gun.

1165
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:09,964
Relax, you got nothing to worry about.

1166
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:13,634
Remember, with all that cash
you got a lot to live for.

1167
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:19,928
Just sit back and let the ship fly herself.

1168
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:21,913
Remember, this airplane
knows more about flying

1169
00:57:21,914 --> 00:57:23,767
than you'll ever know.

1170
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:25,471
I said relax.

1171
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:27,515
I'm too stiff.

1172
00:57:27,516 --> 00:57:29,951
I gotta take it easy.

1173
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:33,020
Now, listen, buddy.

1174
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:34,488
There's a few corny ideas

1175
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:35,989
you gotta get out of your head

1176
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,681
if you're gonna fly an airplane.

1177
00:57:37,682 --> 00:57:40,029
Most things are just the reverse
of what people think.

1178
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,024
The higher you are, the safer you are.

1179
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,162
The earth down there, that's your enemy.

1180
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:46,588
Once you hit that boy, you splatter.

1181
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:50,147
Now, take it easy. Relax.

1182
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:52,713
Enjoy it. Get a kick out of it.

1183
00:57:52,714 --> 00:57:55,268
There. That's pretty good.

1184
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:58,005
That's better.

1185
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,377
Take a look around.

1186
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:02,697
Kinda pretty up here, isn't it?

1187
00:58:02,698 --> 00:58:04,648
Pretty nice.

1188
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,320
Take your turn in traffic, Randall.

1189
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:09,023
Hold your proper altitude.

1190
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:19,524
All right, come
on. Let's ease her down.

1191
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,712
Don't stiffen. Don't stiffen.

1192
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,739
Down we go.

1193
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,970
Down...

1194
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:37,105
Down, down, down.

1195
00:58:37,106 --> 00:58:39,890
Take it easy, now.

1196
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,849
Remember, you're a soap bubble.

1197
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,410
You're a feather.

1198
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:48,247
Easy...

1199
00:58:49,843 --> 00:58:53,613
Easy, easy, easy...

1200
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,982
That was fine.

1201
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:59,186
And how you ever got by primary training

1202
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,820
I'll never know!

1203
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,756
They must be hard up for pilots.

1204
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:12,237
Just think-all that dough

1205
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:14,167
and you're gonna be a flyer to boot.

1206
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:16,312
But don't ever forget that
I'm the guy that did it.

1207
00:59:16,313 --> 00:59:18,080
That was swell work, Ted.
Really great.

1208
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:19,482
Boy, I almost grounded.

1209
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:20,949
Every time I hit the dirt,

1210
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:21,950
I think the show's over.

1211
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:23,585
Yeah, that's usually my trouble.

1212
00:59:23,586 --> 00:59:25,552
But today I seem to get the hang of it.

1213
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:27,325
Hey, it looks like you
got a flyer on your hands.

1214
00:59:27,326 --> 00:59:28,535
Yeah. Not bad?

1215
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:29,832
Yeah, you're pretty proud of yourself.

1216
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,942
It's kind of fun

1217
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,993
punching some brains in that guy's head.

1218
00:59:32,994 --> 00:59:33,994
When does your guy go up?

1219
00:59:33,995 --> 00:59:35,129
Right away. He does?

1220
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,096
Say, did you tell me
he was a football player?

1221
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:39,212
- Yeah, that's right.
- I could do a lot with him.

1222
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:40,501
Well, take him. You don't mind?

1223
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:42,069
No. That's what we're here for.

1224
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,097
- See what you can do with him.
- Thanks.

1225
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:45,885
My mama done told me

1226
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,440
when I was in knee pants...

1227
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:48,856
Cut that out.

1228
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:51,184
My mama done told me

1229
00:59:51,185 --> 00:59:53,160
when I was in knee pants

1230
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:55,365
son

1231
00:59:55,974 --> 00:59:57,758
that's better.

1232
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:00,574
In the first place, your
mammy didn't told you enough.

1233
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:03,479
In the second place,
from now on, I'm telling you.

1234
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,168
Now listen, you big ape.

1235
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:07,561
Give her the gun, and execute a forward pass

1236
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,539
over that first line of trees.

1237
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:14,391
Come on, now.
Let's see you do it.

1238
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:18,734
You don't want it that way?

1239
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:21,036
Change signals then.
Make it a punt,

1240
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:23,272
make it a drop kick.
Make it anything,

1241
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:25,640
but get this baby into the air!

1242
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:31,246
Get it over the trees!
Get it into the air!

1243
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:35,471
You must have been a sensation

1244
01:00:35,472 --> 01:00:38,417
on the football field.

1245
01:00:39,082 --> 01:00:42,151
Make your turn in traffic, Rourke.

1246
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:49,199
That's better, Rourke.

1247
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,558
There, you hear that?

1248
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,006
The coach likes you.
He thinks you're good.

1249
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,211
Now, here's the way to figure this thing.

1250
01:00:55,212 --> 01:00:56,730
When you were playing guard,

1251
01:00:56,731 --> 01:00:58,745
the quarterback was doing all the thinking,

1252
01:00:58,746 --> 01:01:00,414
and he was getting all the credit.

1253
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:01,922
Now all that's changed.

1254
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,950
On our team, you're the quarterback.

1255
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,965
You do the thinking.
You're the whole show.

1256
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:09,187
Just think of those headlines, boy.

1257
01:01:09,188 --> 01:01:11,924
Think of those headlines.

1258
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:13,948
All right, Rourke.

1259
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:15,949
Into the traffic pattern for a landing.

1260
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:18,151
Keep an eye open for other planes.

1261
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:20,287
Our side's gonna attempt a drop kick,

1262
01:01:20,288 --> 01:01:21,918
and remember, you're holding the ball.

1263
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:26,701
And you're holding it with
your fingertips. You get that?

1264
01:01:26,702 --> 01:01:29,344
Now, take it easy. Easy!

1265
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:32,532
Don't fumble now, you big ox.

1266
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:36,536
Remember, there's 60,000 fans
in those stands watching.

1267
01:01:36,537 --> 01:01:39,239
Easy now!

1268
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:41,122
Set her down like that.

1269
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:45,559
Easy on the controls-
with your fingertips.

1270
01:01:46,117 --> 01:01:48,952
Your fingertips!

1271
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,850
Right between the goal posts!

1272
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:55,171
What a pouf!

1273
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:56,828
Yeah, what a pouf.

1274
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:58,212
Good comeback.

1275
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:00,135
Yeah, I've seen it happen before.

1276
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:03,000
A man who seemed hopeless
suddenly gets the hang of things.

1277
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:05,260
He may not be as good as this tomorrow,

1278
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,892
but he'll never again be
as bad as that first run.

1279
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:10,628
He's-he's feeling it.

1280
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,434
I'm a ding-dog daddy from dumas

1281
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,835
and you wanna see me do my stuff

1282
01:02:14,836 --> 01:02:16,303
that was great, powerhouse.

1283
01:02:16,304 --> 01:02:17,630
There's nothing to it.

1284
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:19,305
- You know what I figured out?
- What?

1285
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:21,247
I'm a lot better when I'm up there alone

1286
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:24,331
than when I've got one of these
instructors riding with me.

1287
01:02:24,332 --> 01:02:25,440
How do you like that guy?

1288
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,759
You know what I found out?
This is a cinch.

1289
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,253
It's just like football.

1290
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:30,491
Football?!

1291
01:02:30,492 --> 01:02:32,168
Yeah. Reminded me of the day
we beat Pittsburgh.

1292
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,368
We pulled a fake reverse.
I cut over center,

1293
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:36,780
and I opened up this hole
as wide as the second front,

1294
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,682
but the dumb quarterback dropped the ball.

1295
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:40,632
So as quick as a flash, I picked it up,

1296
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,157
and the rest is history.

1297
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,625
72 yards for a touchdown.

1298
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,876
I heard it over the radio.

1299
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:46,651
Everybody heard it over the radio!

1300
01:02:46,652 --> 01:02:48,985
Now look at that. All this
life going on around him,

1301
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:51,778
and he sits there reading a book.

1302
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,351
I have 2 tickets to the
majestic theater tonight.

1303
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:12,136
Would you like them?

1304
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:14,373
No.

1305
01:03:16,562 --> 01:03:18,759
Hey. You know, you've
got the rest of your life

1306
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,827
to read that book.

1307
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:22,281
Why don't you step out there

1308
01:03:22,282 --> 01:03:25,599
and ask one of those dolls to dance?

1309
01:03:25,673 --> 01:03:27,701
Or does a guy with your kind of dough

1310
01:03:27,702 --> 01:03:30,336
only dance with society dames?

1311
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:34,617
Look at that girl over there.

1312
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:37,357
Look at her, you dope.
She's a honey.

1313
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:39,164
She's a dish.

1314
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:42,598
Maybe you'd like to dance?

1315
01:03:42,837 --> 01:03:44,894
No.

1316
01:03:44,925 --> 01:03:47,234
That girl is lonesome.

1317
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:49,327
Why don't you go over there and tackle her?

1318
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:51,945
Tell you're lonesome.
Tell her you want to dance.

1319
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:53,509
Tell her she reminds you of your sister.

1320
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,961
Tell her anything.

1321
01:03:54,962 --> 01:03:57,037
Why don't you try spending
a couple of bucks?

1322
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:59,910
You can't tell, you might like it.

1323
01:04:06,223 --> 01:04:07,903
Wouldn't you like a sandwich

1324
01:04:07,904 --> 01:04:10,244
or a candy bar or something?

1325
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:11,435
No. I...

1326
01:04:11,436 --> 01:04:13,482
good evening.

1327
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:14,783
Hello.

1328
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,351
I... I came over
because...

1329
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:21,340
Because she reminds you of your sister.

1330
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:24,451
Well, you remind me a
great deal of my sister.

1331
01:04:24,452 --> 01:04:25,645
How nice.

1332
01:04:25,646 --> 01:04:27,224
Would you like to dance?

1333
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:29,560
Thank you very much.

1334
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,707
My name is Ellen bright.
What's yours?

1335
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:34,804
Randall, Ted Randall, and
I'm delighted to know you.

1336
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,766
That's more than I can say
for that boy at the counter.

1337
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:39,553
What's the matter with him?

1338
01:04:39,554 --> 01:04:40,838
Homesickness. Just comes in

1339
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,895
and stares like that every night.

1340
01:04:42,896 --> 01:04:45,146
I guess homesickness can be pretty bad.

1341
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,373
Yeah, I imagine it can.

1342
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:47,832
I remember my first year at college.

1343
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:49,425
I used to get so lonesome

1344
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:50,718
for somebody from home,

1345
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:51,948
I could almost cry.

1346
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:54,317
Guess that's the way he feels right now.

1347
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,091
You know who he is or where he comes from?

1348
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,503
You can't help knowing.

1349
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:00,270
He talks about it all the time.

1350
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,567
His name is Sanderson.

1351
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:05,449
He comes from a little town
called twin hooks, Rhode Island.

1352
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,899
And from what he says,
twin hooks, Rhode Island

1353
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,535
is just about 5 times
as beautiful as paradise.

1354
01:05:18,183 --> 01:05:20,319
Would you mind waiting for me for a minute?

1355
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,497
No, of course not.

1356
01:05:21,498 --> 01:05:23,831
I'll be right back.

1357
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,667
Well, I got him off to a good start.

1358
01:05:27,668 --> 01:05:28,597
You did?

1359
01:05:28,598 --> 01:05:29,915
And after we'd won the game,

1360
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,472
we'd all sit around the dressing room

1361
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,755
where we'd sing the old fight song.

1362
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:34,400
You'll love this.
It went like this.

1363
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,994
Fight on for old u.S.C.

1364
01:05:36,995 --> 01:05:39,705
Come and fight on to victory

1365
01:05:39,706 --> 01:05:44,489
telephone call for Sanderson.

1366
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,953
Sanderson?

1367
01:05:46,954 --> 01:05:48,314
For who?

1368
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:49,678
Telephone call for Sanderson.

1369
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,394
Is that you?

1370
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:53,282
Must be some other Sanderson.

1371
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,529
Come on.

1372
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:59,001
Nobody'd be calling me.

1373
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:06,837
Hello?

1374
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,083
Who?

1375
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,988
I don't under...

1376
01:06:12,748 --> 01:06:15,049
Mom!

1377
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:19,428
It's my mom!

1378
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,688
That was swell of you.

1379
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,105
You know, that's a funny thing.

1380
01:06:35,106 --> 01:06:36,307
He's a nice guy.

1381
01:06:36,308 --> 01:06:39,244
Knows how to spend his money too.

1382
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:43,793
All I know is what people around town said.

1383
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:46,922
When Hank was a boy, you know,
no bigger than this,

1384
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:49,027
he worked at the sawmill down by the river.

1385
01:06:49,028 --> 01:06:50,580
And one day, he fell into the saw

1386
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:51,971
and cut off his big toe.

1387
01:06:51,972 --> 01:06:53,457
That's terrible.

1388
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:56,526
Not for Hank. His folks
didn't even call in a doctor.

1389
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,969
And afterwards, when people
asked about the accident,

1390
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,738
Hank said it didn't bother him a bit,

1391
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:02,828
that he'd just grow a new toe.

1392
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:04,378
Are you kidding?

1393
01:07:04,379 --> 01:07:06,296
This guy's a bigger liar than I was.

1394
01:07:06,297 --> 01:07:08,801
The only difference is,
he gets away with it.

1395
01:07:08,802 --> 01:07:10,302
Well, why can't you and Ted

1396
01:07:10,303 --> 01:07:12,208
come over to the house tomorrow night?

1397
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:14,559
Because we're on 24 hours notice.

1398
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,497
That means that by
tomorrow night at this time,

1399
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:18,687
we may be a long way from San Francisco.

1400
01:07:18,688 --> 01:07:20,655
We don't know where we're going...

1401
01:07:20,656 --> 01:07:23,147
What do you mean, "bring Ted over," anyhow?

1402
01:07:23,148 --> 01:07:24,148
He's cute.

1403
01:07:24,149 --> 01:07:25,389
How long have you known him?

1404
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,997
- Who?
- Ted.

1405
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:29,139
We've been buddies for over a year now.

1406
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,872
Same class. We got
our wings together.

1407
01:07:30,873 --> 01:07:32,532
Go on with the story.

1408
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:36,170
Well, about a year before I left home,

1409
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,629
Hank was working at the same sawmill,

1410
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,669
and he fell into the same saw.

1411
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,566
Only this time it cut off his foot,

1412
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:44,133
about up to here.

1413
01:07:44,134 --> 01:07:45,167
I don't believe it.

1414
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:47,689
He was growing himself a new foot.

1415
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,331
What happened?

1416
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:52,302
Well, some folks said that first
there'd be a full-grown foot.

1417
01:07:52,303 --> 01:07:55,408
Then the rest of the leg would grow
till the foot touched the ground.

1418
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,542
Others said that they'd
grow the leg out first,

1419
01:07:57,543 --> 01:08:00,213
and then the heel with
the toenails last of all.

1420
01:08:00,214 --> 01:08:01,587
And then there were those who said

1421
01:08:01,588 --> 01:08:04,818
that there'd be a tiny
little foot and ankle,

1422
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,464
and then it would grow till
it got to be full sized.

1423
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:10,063
Don't you think that's a very
interesting scientific problem?

1424
01:08:10,064 --> 01:08:11,904
I think it's just fascinating.

1425
01:08:11,905 --> 01:08:14,280
It's just the most wonderful
thing I've ever heard of.

1426
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:16,372
There's a dame that's headed
for the booby hatch.

1427
01:08:16,373 --> 01:08:18,336
Finally they decided it's downright immoral

1428
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:21,400
for a guy to grow a foot without
them knowing anything about it.

1429
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,058
So they go up to Hank's house.

1430
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:25,447
And they yell up that if Hank
doesn't let them in,

1431
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:27,519
they're gonna set fire to the place.

1432
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,338
Well, Hank lets go from his bedroom window

1433
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,020
with a double-barreled shotgun.

1434
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:33,177
So they set fire to the back porch.

1435
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:35,478
Well, the place got hotter and hotter.

1436
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,412
Thank you.

1437
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,847
Wait a minute.
Let me look at you.

1438
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:41,396
This is really amazing.

1439
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:43,593
You know, you remind me of my sister?

1440
01:08:43,594 --> 01:08:46,463
We're all brothers and sisters, aren't we?

1441
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:51,358
First time in 6 months
that line hasn't worked.

1442
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:53,724
O.K. Thanks.

1443
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,161
Well, this is it.

1444
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:56,441
I'm sorry, girls.

1445
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:58,500
If you're still hungry,
you'll have to finish alone.

1446
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,599
But why? What's happening?

1447
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,606
- But Ted, what about the fire?
- I'll tell you on the way out.

1448
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:06,822
You know, that thing
about the foot-

1449
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,214
if that's a line, it's no good.

1450
01:09:08,215 --> 01:09:11,351
And if he believes it himself, he's crazy.

1451
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,724
Guy couldn't grow another foot, could he?

1452
01:09:13,725 --> 01:09:15,003
You got me, pal.

1453
01:09:15,004 --> 01:09:17,502
Here, take these girls
wherever they want to go.

1454
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:18,794
But what about Hank?

1455
01:09:18,795 --> 01:09:21,171
Hank? Hank.
Well, the place burned down.

1456
01:09:21,172 --> 01:09:22,486
But what happened to Hank?

1457
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:23,988
Well, nobody knows.

1458
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:25,833
Did he get out of the house or didn't he?

1459
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:28,162
- He never got out.
- What about the foot, you dope?

1460
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:29,909
Did he grow a new foot?

1461
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,201
They never found out.

1462
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:32,777
All they found was a little bridgework.

1463
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:36,515
Gold, you know. Nothing
else. Nothing at all.

1464
01:09:38,015 --> 01:09:41,016
Well, I didn't say it was a funny story.

1465
01:09:41,017 --> 01:09:42,485
It smells.

1466
01:09:42,486 --> 01:09:44,720
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

1467
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:47,189
Well, so long, Greg.

1468
01:09:54,114 --> 01:09:56,845
I wonder if this is that wartime immorality

1469
01:09:56,846 --> 01:09:59,714
they're always talking about.

1470
01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:04,454
'Bye, Ted.

1471
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:16,308
Who do we take out next?

1472
01:10:16,309 --> 01:10:18,476
Nobody. We're gonna
ride along with them.

1473
01:10:18,477 --> 01:10:20,194
- With them?
- Those guys can fly.

1474
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:21,290
That's only half the job.

1475
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,756
We gotta see how they hold up in combat.

1476
01:10:23,757 --> 01:10:25,652
Do I have to keep on looking at that guy?

1477
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:28,703
You can't give us a hint
of where we're going, can you?

1478
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:30,725
Well, I can tell you that where you're going

1479
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,529
I don't think you'll find anybody

1480
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,729
who reminds you of your sister.

1481
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,260
You got all that consignment
of spare parts aboard, sergeant?

1482
01:10:37,261 --> 01:10:38,323
Yes, sir. 23 cases.

1483
01:10:38,324 --> 01:10:40,526
Good. Take her up.

1484
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:42,806
We made it.

1485
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,917
I sure hope that new outfit coming in

1486
01:10:47,918 --> 01:10:49,590
brings plenty of spare parts with them.

1487
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:50,772
Yeah. What's the matter?

1488
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:53,371
Blown out. Blown out?

1489
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:57,472
Reminds me of the last
letter I got from my wife.

1490
01:10:57,473 --> 01:10:59,415
You know what that kid of mine did?

1491
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,613
No, sir.

1492
01:11:00,614 --> 01:11:02,320
Well, he's trying to be a chemist,

1493
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:04,171
and he's out in the barn
one day fooling around

1494
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:06,329
mixing stuff together-a
little potash, a little sulfur-

1495
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,022
and maybe a little Nitroglycerin.

1496
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:09,326
You know what happened?

1497
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:10,282
No, sir.

1498
01:11:10,283 --> 01:11:13,051
He blew the barn up-
the whole cockeyed barn.

1499
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:14,552
Just blew it up!

1500
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:16,535
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever heard?

1501
01:11:16,536 --> 01:11:18,736
Yes, sir.

1502
01:11:19,298 --> 01:11:21,124
That sure is funny, colonel.

1503
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,752
You know, that reminds me of my kid.

1504
01:11:23,753 --> 01:11:24,744
He's only 4-

1505
01:11:24,745 --> 01:11:26,673
aw, you wait till he's 9, Henderson.

1506
01:11:26,674 --> 01:11:28,172
Then's when they're really fun.

1507
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:30,258
Yes, sir, but as I as saying-

1508
01:11:30,259 --> 01:11:32,530
aw, great things, kids.
Great things.

1509
01:11:32,531 --> 01:11:34,713
Let me know when you get
this tub finished, will you?

1510
01:11:34,714 --> 01:11:36,782
Yes, sir.

1511
01:11:39,312 --> 01:11:40,608
Al?

1512
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:41,730
Yes, sir.

1513
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,608
What time's that gang
from the states get in?

1514
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:44,646
About an hour, sir.

1515
01:11:44,647 --> 01:11:45,958
See that they're fixed up.

1516
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:47,156
Sure will.

1517
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:49,282
Old friend of yours got in from Sydney.

1518
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:51,149
- Yeah, who's that?
- Dorinda Durston.

1519
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,110
Are you kidding?
Where is she, Nails?

1520
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:54,146
Over in 4.

1521
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:55,105
Holy smoke!

1522
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:56,733
Give her my regards, will you?

1523
01:11:56,734 --> 01:11:58,767
You bet I will.

1524
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:12,490
Hello, Dorinda.

1525
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:15,531
Al! Al Yackey!

1526
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:20,084
They told me you just pulled in, honey.

1527
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,007
It's good to see you.

1528
01:12:22,008 --> 01:12:24,820
It's good to see you, Al.

1529
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:26,527
Hey, hey, hey. What's this?

1530
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:27,583
Just hold on.

1531
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:30,687
It'll leave in just a minute.

1532
01:12:32,873 --> 01:12:35,097
Let me look at you.

1533
01:12:35,098 --> 01:12:37,328
- Why, Al, you're a colonel!
- That's right.

1534
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:38,831
Everybody gets promoted these days.

1535
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:40,163
You ought to see Nails.

1536
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:41,926
He's a brigadier, my boss here.

1537
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:44,968
Colonel Al Yackey.

1538
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,734
Aw, gee.

1539
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:48,484
Can you imagine how Pete'd cuss,

1540
01:12:48,485 --> 01:12:50,297
having to salute me?

1541
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:52,182
Yeah.

1542
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:55,181
He sure would, wouldn't he?

1543
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:57,403
Sit down, Al.

1544
01:12:57,404 --> 01:13:00,447
I was just starting to unpack.

1545
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:05,225
I did that on purpose, Dorinda.

1546
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:06,952
I had to find out how you were doing.

1547
01:13:06,953 --> 01:13:09,096
Not so good, not so good.

1548
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,519
I manage to keep busy.

1549
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,459
Yeah, I know. They tell me
you're trying to win this war

1550
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,783
all by yourself.

1551
01:13:14,784 --> 01:13:16,115
Nobody ever sees you anymore.

1552
01:13:16,116 --> 01:13:17,652
All work and no play.

1553
01:13:17,653 --> 01:13:19,704
Makes a girl keep her mind off her troubles.

1554
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,803
You look kind of peaked too, honey.

1555
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:23,257
It don't seem right-

1556
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:25,011
Al...

1557
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:28,848
Please don't make me cry.

1558
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,992
You're gonna have to get over this, Dorinda.

1559
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:40,861
Get over it?

1560
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:44,092
You sound like I had
the measles or something.

1561
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:46,963
You don't get over a thing like this.

1562
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,422
You die from it.

1563
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:50,515
That's not the gal I know, honey.

1564
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:53,213
Too many things to remember, Al.

1565
01:13:53,214 --> 01:13:56,635
You find you've gone over all the
big things a million times or more,

1566
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:59,199
and then you begin to think
of the little things,

1567
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,734
like the time he got to talking to me

1568
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:06,162
and stepped off into a puddle

1569
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:09,136
and I laughed, and he got mad.

1570
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:11,392
And then we forgot all about it,

1571
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:13,628
until out of nowhere at all,

1572
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,500
that little stumble comes
to live with me again.

1573
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:18,677
Remember the time
in the machine shop-

1574
01:14:18,678 --> 01:14:22,258
Yeah, I guess I know what you mean, honey.

1575
01:14:22,354 --> 01:14:25,367
I remember he used to be always
running out of cigarettes,

1576
01:14:25,368 --> 01:14:27,515
bumming them from me, and I'd say,

1577
01:14:27,516 --> 01:14:29,743
"Pete, why don't you buy some.

1578
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:34,482
I'm never gonna save a
dime till I get rid of you."

1579
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,172
Well, I got rid of him, all right,

1580
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:40,809
and I haven't saved a dime yet.

1581
01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:44,339
This is just plain darned foolishness,

1582
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,454
sitting around here moaning like this.

1583
01:14:46,455 --> 01:14:49,011
Look. I'm meeting
a new bunch of boys

1584
01:14:49,012 --> 01:14:50,116
from the states tonight.

1585
01:14:50,117 --> 01:14:53,081
Why don't you come over
to the officer's club with us

1586
01:14:53,082 --> 01:14:54,033
and break a bottle open?

1587
01:14:54,034 --> 01:14:55,068
No, thanks, Al.

1588
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:56,942
I'd much rather stay here.

1589
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:58,578
You'd rather stay here?

1590
01:14:58,579 --> 01:14:59,540
Yeah.

1591
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:00,509
And moan?

1592
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,790
Well, that's my business.

1593
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:05,486
That's right, sure.
That's your business, all right.

1594
01:15:05,487 --> 01:15:07,640
But if you're gonna sit and
grieve all the rest of your life,

1595
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:09,006
why don't you do it right?

1596
01:15:09,007 --> 01:15:10,697
Why don't you get a room

1597
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:13,678
and lock yourself up in it,
and wear black silk dresses?

1598
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,679
And put a little white
handkerchief over your head

1599
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,142
and a pasty look on your face?

1600
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:18,893
I knew a woman back home did that.

1601
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:20,260
She got just what she wanted, too.

1602
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:21,996
Folks felt sorry for her for 30 years.

1603
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:23,329
That's not nice, Al.

1604
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,063
All right, so it ain't
nice. But it's the truth.

1605
01:15:25,064 --> 01:15:27,733
You think you're the only guy
that ever got a kick in the teeth?

1606
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:29,280
You're not.
It's happening every day,

1607
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:31,615
and it's gonna keep right on
happening till this thing's over.

1608
01:15:31,616 --> 01:15:33,791
You can feel sorry for yourself,

1609
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:35,785
or you can come out with me

1610
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:37,476
and see how nice people are
when they're alive.

1611
01:15:37,477 --> 01:15:40,652
Al, I like you better than
anybody on earth, I guess,

1612
01:15:40,653 --> 01:15:42,371
and I know you're trying to help me,

1613
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,135
but this is just something

1614
01:15:44,136 --> 01:15:47,406
I've got to work out in my own way.

1615
01:15:48,196 --> 01:15:50,498
Look, honey.

1616
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:52,489
You see this guy?

1617
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,690
That's Pete Sandidge,

1618
01:15:53,691 --> 01:15:56,192
the best friend I ever had or ever will.

1619
01:15:56,193 --> 01:15:58,495
He's the greatest guy in the world,

1620
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,943
and I miss him more

1621
01:15:59,944 --> 01:16:02,331
than anybody ever missed a guy before.

1622
01:16:02,332 --> 01:16:04,333
But he's dead, and I'm alive.

1623
01:16:04,334 --> 01:16:06,980
I'm gonna put him right where he belongs.

1624
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,983
No, Al! Right there.

1625
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:13,812
I gotta go out to the field, honey.

1626
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:16,552
I'll be back here in half an hour.

1627
01:16:16,553 --> 01:16:18,674
Now, you get yourself all prettied up,

1628
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:20,550
'cause it's gonna be our night to howl.

1629
01:16:20,551 --> 01:16:22,753
Come on, smile.

1630
01:16:24,019 --> 01:16:25,652
Aw, you feel better, maybe?

1631
01:16:25,653 --> 01:16:26,954
Just a little bit?

1632
01:16:26,955 --> 01:16:29,489
Al. You're-you're great!

1633
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,742
You tell that to all the guys.

1634
01:16:31,743 --> 01:16:33,618
I know you.

1635
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:37,072
Now you got just 29 and a quarter minutes.

1636
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:40,040
O.K. O.K., boss!

1637
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,665
Al!

1638
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:31,243
Al Yackey, why you broken down...

1639
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:33,345
Look at those chickens.

1640
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,172
So you're a ground officer?

1641
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:39,376
Look at him, a colonel, fat and sassy.

1642
01:17:39,377 --> 01:17:40,836
The seat of his pants

1643
01:17:40,837 --> 01:17:42,553
shines better than his boots, too.

1644
01:17:42,554 --> 01:17:43,986
How are you, captain Robertson?

1645
01:17:43,987 --> 01:17:45,619
Welcome to new Guinea.
Did you have a good trip?

1646
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,215
Smooth as silk. I brought a great
bunch of pilots for you, too.

1647
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:51,222
Colonel Yackey, this is lieutenant
Rourke and lieutenant Randall.

1648
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:52,437
What are you, colonel?

1649
01:17:52,438 --> 01:17:54,603
The official greeter
for the chamber of commerce?

1650
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:56,717
Randall? That's kind of funny.

1651
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:57,917
I thought for a minute

1652
01:17:57,918 --> 01:17:59,638
you and I'd met up before someplace.

1653
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:01,243
No, sir.

1654
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:03,981
Lieutenant Ridley, this
is captain Robertson,

1655
01:18:03,982 --> 01:18:05,357
lieutenants Randall and Rourke.

1656
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:06,740
Aren't you afraid to go
around without a parachute?

1657
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:08,911
You might fall into a spittoon
in your office.

1658
01:18:08,912 --> 01:18:10,697
Lieutenant Ridley'll show
you fellas to your quarters.

1659
01:18:10,698 --> 01:18:12,221
In case you'd like to have a drink,

1660
01:18:12,222 --> 01:18:13,881
come over to the officer's club.

1661
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:15,393
Sounds like a fine idea.

1662
01:18:15,394 --> 01:18:17,387
I'm gonna be with the
prettiest gal in all new Guinea,

1663
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:19,360
that is, if you guys are
interested in pretty gals.

1664
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,482
We'd be delighted, sir.

1665
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:21,755
That's swell. That's good.

1666
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:23,665
Well, listen to that.

1667
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,991
That big lug talking
about dames and-

1668
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,137
I can't believe it. A colonel.

1669
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,912
I'd have been a 3-star-

1670
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,242
I'd have been a 4-star general.

1671
01:18:45,419 --> 01:18:46,826
- Ginger beer.
- Same.

1672
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:48,296
I don't mind Al being a colonel,

1673
01:18:48,297 --> 01:18:50,257
but when I saw that star on Nails' shoulder,

1674
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,369
that finished me.

1675
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:54,429
Don't they have any privates in this war?

1676
01:18:55,466 --> 01:18:57,408
Yeah, drinking ginger beer,

1677
01:18:57,409 --> 01:18:59,000
laying off the liquor.

1678
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,834
He'll be a captain before long.

1679
01:19:00,835 --> 01:19:03,303
He's my man.

1680
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,037
Here. You nibble on these
while I'm gone.

1681
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:32,837
Dorinda!

1682
01:19:32,838 --> 01:19:34,610
Hey, girl, it's me, Pete.

1683
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:38,180
Dorinda, you gotta listen to me, I...

1684
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,473
Now, look, Dorinda. I
can take a lot, you know,

1685
01:19:40,474 --> 01:19:41,433
and I have.

1686
01:19:41,434 --> 01:19:44,170
Seeing Al and Nails was bad enough,

1687
01:19:44,615 --> 01:19:46,185
but-but I guess
this is the moment

1688
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:48,472
I've been afraid of all along.

1689
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:52,296
I wondered how I'd feel
and how you would look.

1690
01:19:52,297 --> 01:19:54,680
And you look good enough to eat, Dorinda.

1691
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:57,717
You look pretty as a picture.

1692
01:19:59,322 --> 01:20:01,382
I think I'll just stay here a minute.

1693
01:20:01,383 --> 01:20:03,665
You still the same girl?

1694
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,204
You know, Dorinda,

1695
01:20:05,205 --> 01:20:07,514
some people seem prettier
when you dream about them

1696
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:08,656
than they really are.

1697
01:20:08,657 --> 01:20:10,652
But a funny thing about you-

1698
01:20:10,653 --> 01:20:13,422
you're even prettier than the dream.

1699
01:20:13,821 --> 01:20:16,049
Still my girl? Sure you are.

1700
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,124
Sure you are, and you
always will be, won't you?

1701
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,574
You know a funny thing, Dorinda?

1702
01:20:19,575 --> 01:20:21,485
I haven't forgotten one little thing

1703
01:20:21,486 --> 01:20:23,183
that ever happened between us.

1704
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:26,586
I remember how you used to
burn up when I'd ball you out

1705
01:20:26,587 --> 01:20:28,680
about how you
ham-handled a ship.

1706
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:30,924
I remember how you used
to hop out of a ship, too.

1707
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:34,523
Always with a grease spot
on your nose, right there.

1708
01:20:36,471 --> 01:20:39,731
But I'll never forget
the day we met in London.

1709
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:42,296
You were riding on top of
the bus, and it was raining.

1710
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,845
The rain was on your face like on a flower.

1711
01:20:48,186 --> 01:20:50,363
You weren't any too friendly, either.

1712
01:20:50,364 --> 01:20:52,075
So when I busted up to you and said...

1713
01:20:52,076 --> 01:20:53,920
I beg your pardon.
I don't want to intrude,

1714
01:20:53,921 --> 01:20:56,838
but you look exactly like a sister of mine.

1715
01:20:56,839 --> 01:20:58,934
Well, that's a strange
coincidence, isn't it?

1716
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:00,839
An amazing one.

1717
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,537
Because I bear a resemblance
to my own sister, too.

1718
01:21:03,538 --> 01:21:05,705
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- No, not at all.

1719
01:21:05,706 --> 01:21:07,608
My name is Ted Randall.

1720
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:09,526
- Lieutenant Randall?
- That's right.

1721
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,204
I'm Dorinda Durston, ferry service.

1722
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,101
I'm glad to know you, Dorinda Durston.

1723
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:15,599
I admire the women's ferrying service.

1724
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,324
I've always thought it had
such tremendous possibilities.

1725
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:20,029
I hope you won't be disappointed.

1726
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,623
I'm sure I won't be.

1727
01:21:21,624 --> 01:21:23,362
Incidentally, I've only known you 2 minutes,

1728
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:25,238
and already I owe you an apology.

1729
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:26,231
Really?

1730
01:21:26,232 --> 01:21:28,568
Yes. I'm here under
false pretenses.

1731
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:30,114
Why, lieutenant!

1732
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:32,659
It's true. I have no sister.

1733
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:38,225
I felt sure you hadn't.
Neither have I.

1734
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,029
How did you know?

1735
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,478
Well, it seems that
somewhere a long time ago,

1736
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:44,547
that line was used before.

1737
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,105
Listen to this drivel.

1738
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:47,654
That's the trouble with these kids.

1739
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:50,156
You teach them something, and
they don't know how to handle it.

1740
01:21:50,157 --> 01:21:51,623
No judgment of women.

1741
01:21:51,624 --> 01:21:53,630
Colonel Yackey.
Good evening, sir.

1742
01:21:53,631 --> 01:21:55,100
Hello, Randall.
Here you are, honey.

1743
01:21:55,101 --> 01:21:57,560
- I see you've met the lieutenant.
- Yes, I've met lieutenant Randall.

1744
01:21:57,561 --> 01:21:59,387
He says I remind him of his sisters.

1745
01:21:59,388 --> 01:22:00,342
She's wise to him.

1746
01:22:00,343 --> 01:22:01,820
Is that so?

1747
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,025
Sit down, sit down. How
many sisters have you got?

1748
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:06,078
11. Did you say 11?

1749
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:07,587
That's quite a family, 11 sisters.

1750
01:22:07,588 --> 01:22:08,903
All very beautiful.

1751
01:22:08,904 --> 01:22:10,725
And I remind him of every one of them.

1752
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:12,482
Maybe we better get you a drink.

1753
01:22:12,483 --> 01:22:14,514
Hey, waiter. Bring us a drink
for this boy.

1754
01:22:14,515 --> 01:22:16,771
Lieutenant Randall is in my command, honey.

1755
01:22:16,772 --> 01:22:18,827
They tell me he's a pretty hot pilot.

1756
01:22:18,828 --> 01:22:19,940
He stinks.

1757
01:22:19,941 --> 01:22:22,136
You have to be a hot pilot
to be in Al's outfit.

1758
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,470
That's what I hear.

1759
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,228
How about all 3 of us having dinner tonight?

1760
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:26,735
I could cook you a kangaroo steak

1761
01:22:26,736 --> 01:22:28,048
that will drive you crazy.

1762
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:30,514
How do you cook a kangaroo steak?

1763
01:22:30,515 --> 01:22:32,823
With wallaby sauce.

1764
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,177
What a corny routine this is.

1765
01:22:35,178 --> 01:22:36,692
Well, it sounds very interesting.

1766
01:22:36,693 --> 01:22:38,157
I'd love to see it done sometime.

1767
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,541
Well, how about tonight?
A celebration.

1768
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,178
Of what?

1769
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:43,822
Of my meeting you.

1770
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:45,369
Watch this. This'll be good.

1771
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,542
Watch him get set back on his heels.

1772
01:22:47,543 --> 01:22:50,370
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Come on, Dorinda.

1773
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:53,178
You haven't had any fun for a long time.

1774
01:22:53,179 --> 01:22:55,320
She's always like this
when she's on the ground.

1775
01:22:55,321 --> 01:22:56,662
Skittish as a Colt.

1776
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:58,496
Tell him you'll go. Come on!

1777
01:22:58,497 --> 01:23:00,478
Well, all right. Sure, I'll go.

1778
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:01,998
That's better.

1779
01:23:01,999 --> 01:23:05,568
Come on! Let's get outta here.

1780
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:11,995
Al!

1781
01:23:11,996 --> 01:23:13,253
Well, where have you been?

1782
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,319
Sydney, my boy.

1783
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,399
You have?

1784
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,145
Yeah. I just you back
a load of spare parts.

1785
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:20,876
Good. You know, you shouldn't
stay away so long, Dorinda.

1786
01:23:20,877 --> 01:23:23,530
That flyer of yours has just been
pining away since you was gone.

1787
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,212
Me too. Where is he?

1788
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:27,621
- He's up on security patrol.
- How about a coke?

1789
01:23:27,622 --> 01:23:30,290
No, I can't, Al. I've
got to fill out my report.

1790
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:31,578
Yeah, I see.

1791
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:32,936
How's he been doing?

1792
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:34,142
Who?

1793
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:35,095
Ted, you goose.

1794
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:36,785
Him. He's doing all right.

1795
01:23:36,786 --> 01:23:37,969
He got 3 more zeros.

1796
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:39,561
No! Yeah.

1797
01:23:39,562 --> 01:23:42,079
I'll just have to cook him a dinner tonight.

1798
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,704
I'll cook one for you, too.

1799
01:23:43,705 --> 01:23:46,624
I wouldn't want to gum up your party.

1800
01:23:54,418 --> 01:23:57,019
Let's make tracks, baby.

1801
01:24:16,796 --> 01:24:20,420
Holy leapin' loopin' Judas priest!

1802
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:23,322
Where's that security patrol?

1803
01:24:26,948 --> 01:24:30,951
You dirty, no good, stinkin' sprite!

1804
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:47,013
Nails! Look! Here they come!
Here come our kids.

1805
01:24:51,478 --> 01:24:53,064
Get those meatballs.

1806
01:24:53,065 --> 01:24:54,709
Boil 'em in oil.

1807
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,009
Tear 'em to pieces

1808
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,311
and fry 'em for breakfast.

1809
01:24:57,312 --> 01:24:58,391
What'd you say?

1810
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:00,695
I didn't say a thing.

1811
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,966
O.K., boy, it's all yours.

1812
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,962
You're supposed to be
doing something in this war

1813
01:25:04,963 --> 01:25:09,166
besides making wisecracks
to my girl, anyway.

1814
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:11,571
That's it.

1815
01:25:11,572 --> 01:25:14,841
O.K., so you're lucky.

1816
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,980
Watch out!

1817
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:20,979
Easy, Dorinda.

1818
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,204
You don't have to worry
about that fella, honey.

1819
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:28,782
He's just naturally the
luckiest flier I ever did see.

1820
01:25:28,783 --> 01:25:30,036
'Pert near the best.

1821
01:25:30,037 --> 01:25:31,139
If you are good,

1822
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,989
it's because I've been hanging around

1823
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:36,025
to keep you from breaking your fool neck.

1824
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:41,129
Look at that! Another one.

1825
01:25:44,824 --> 01:25:47,878
I gotta admit you're good.

1826
01:25:53,154 --> 01:25:55,289
Robertson.

1827
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:23,694
Hey, look at that! Look at that.

1828
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:27,923
There they go. Look at that!

1829
01:26:27,924 --> 01:26:29,517
We got 6 out of 8.

1830
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:33,160
6 out of 8! Yeah, and lost 1.

1831
01:26:49,108 --> 01:26:51,488
There's nothing unusual
about the shakes, Ted.

1832
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,382
You're just excited after the fight.

1833
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:55,460
I've seen a lot of guys
have worse than the shakes

1834
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:56,619
after a good show.

1835
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,986
Sure, I know.

1836
01:26:57,987 --> 01:27:01,515
I wasn't thinking about the
fight so much as Robertson.

1837
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,255
He was a great guy,

1838
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:05,944
and a darn fine squadron commander, too.

1839
01:27:05,945 --> 01:27:07,602
You know, it doesn't seem possible,

1840
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:09,184
when you stop to think about it,

1841
01:27:09,185 --> 01:27:12,271
that they're not here anymore,
and they're not gonna be.

1842
01:27:12,272 --> 01:27:14,272
Has anything like that ever happened to you?

1843
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:15,187
Yes.

1844
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:16,953
A person's gotta forget, of course,

1845
01:27:16,954 --> 01:27:19,028
but it's not easy at first.

1846
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:20,607
We gotta figure these things

1847
01:27:20,608 --> 01:27:22,931
a little bit different than most people.

1848
01:27:22,932 --> 01:27:25,209
There's something about going out in a plane

1849
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,873
that beats any other way.

1850
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,865
I suppose all the other branches
of the service feel the same,

1851
01:27:29,866 --> 01:27:31,763
but the guy that washes out

1852
01:27:31,764 --> 01:27:33,908
at the controls of his own ship-

1853
01:27:33,909 --> 01:27:35,268
well, he goes down

1854
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:36,848
doing the thing that he loved the best.

1855
01:27:36,849 --> 01:27:39,484
That's a very special way to die.

1856
01:27:39,485 --> 01:27:41,311
I never thought of it that way before,

1857
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,536
but it's true, all right.

1858
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:44,584
Ted, you're not gonna have any eyebrows left

1859
01:27:44,585 --> 01:27:46,297
if you don't stop it.

1860
01:27:46,298 --> 01:27:49,181
Like with a flower.

1861
01:27:49,182 --> 01:27:51,183
Stop it!

1862
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:54,894
Well, I guess we better get on our horse

1863
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,475
before this turns into a wake.

1864
01:27:56,476 --> 01:27:58,312
No, no. It's my fault.

1865
01:27:58,313 --> 01:27:59,669
Don't go, sir.

1866
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:03,638
I need a good drink and a night's sleep.

1867
01:28:04,808 --> 01:28:06,919
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.

1868
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,323
There's nothing wrong
with you. It's me.

1869
01:28:10,716 --> 01:28:13,603
And everything wrong with you, I like.

1870
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:15,939
Good night.

1871
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,099
Breakfast?

1872
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,066
Sure.

1873
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:21,099
Good night, sir.

1874
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,402
Good night.

1875
01:28:33,623 --> 01:28:35,937
Did you see what he was doing?

1876
01:28:35,938 --> 01:28:37,594
Yeah, I saw.

1877
01:28:37,595 --> 01:28:40,340
The things he does,
the way he acts sometimes.

1878
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:42,163
You know, honey, I got a hunch.

1879
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:44,057
You're falling for this guy.

1880
01:28:44,058 --> 01:28:45,195
No!

1881
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:46,716
No? No, no.

1882
01:28:46,717 --> 01:28:51,472
It's not that. It's-well,
it's hard to explain.

1883
01:28:51,473 --> 01:28:53,764
I- I get such a queer feeling sometimes,

1884
01:28:53,765 --> 01:28:54,811
watching him.

1885
01:28:54,812 --> 01:28:57,254
Yeah, I know. I know, honey.
I know just how you feel.

1886
01:28:57,255 --> 01:28:59,583
I gotta go now. Good night.

1887
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,718
Good night, Al.

1888
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,041
Don't let that baby-faced killer

1889
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:20,187
pull the wool over your eyes.

1890
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,490
You know what I mean.

1891
01:29:28,982 --> 01:29:31,182
Or do ya?

1892
01:29:31,887 --> 01:29:34,254
Remember, you're still my girl.

1893
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,789
Lieutenant Randall, it is my privilege

1894
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,233
to bestow upon you

1895
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:55,800
the distinguished flying cross

1896
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:57,848
awarded for bravery, heroism,

1897
01:29:57,849 --> 01:30:00,958
and extraordinary achievement
while in aerial flight.

1898
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:03,753
And upon the recommendation
of your superior officer,

1899
01:30:03,754 --> 01:30:05,660
and with the approval
of your commander in chief,

1900
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:08,161
you have been promoted
to the rank of captain.

1901
01:30:08,162 --> 01:30:10,240
- My congratulations, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1902
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:11,280
They're passing out that hardware

1903
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:12,517
to everybody these days.

1904
01:30:12,518 --> 01:30:13,551
Dismissed!

1905
01:30:13,552 --> 01:30:15,019
Congratulations!

1906
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,447
Thanks a lot, guys.

1907
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,900
I hope you'll excuse me,

1908
01:30:17,901 --> 01:30:19,834
but I got some kind of
special plan for this afternoon.

1909
01:30:19,835 --> 01:30:21,318
All the luck in the world!

1910
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:23,347
Thanks. Everything
all ready, powerhouse?

1911
01:30:23,348 --> 01:30:25,851
Captain, everything's all fixed.

1912
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:29,637
What special thing
could he have planned now?

1913
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:40,605
Come in!

1914
01:30:40,606 --> 01:30:41,826
Out here!

1915
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,661
Hello!

1916
01:30:45,143 --> 01:30:46,251
Aw!

1917
01:30:46,252 --> 01:30:49,456
Ted, you idiot.

1918
01:30:50,135 --> 01:30:51,848
Hey, look, 2 bars.
I'm a captain.

1919
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:53,775
I've got a medal, too.

1920
01:30:53,776 --> 01:30:55,340
Why don't you say something?

1921
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:57,086
Give me a chance.

1922
01:30:57,087 --> 01:30:58,542
You're the prettiest girl in all the world.

1923
01:30:58,543 --> 01:30:59,968
You're prettier than a p-38.

1924
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,684
Ted, I know what's the matter with you.

1925
01:31:01,685 --> 01:31:02,740
You're crazy.

1926
01:31:02,741 --> 01:31:03,976
Not really crazy.

1927
01:31:03,977 --> 01:31:05,545
I've just come to a decision, that's all.

1928
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:07,012
Decision? What?

1929
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:09,649
Dorinda, I'm gonna marry you.

1930
01:31:10,827 --> 01:31:12,238
You're going to marry me?

1931
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,404
That's it, marry you.

1932
01:31:13,405 --> 01:31:15,603
You're gonna be Mrs.
Ted Randall, my wife.

1933
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,212
Me? I'll be your husband.

1934
01:31:17,213 --> 01:31:18,364
Get it?

1935
01:31:18,365 --> 01:31:20,776
It's not the most original idea on earth.

1936
01:31:20,777 --> 01:31:22,450
It's been done before, but...

1937
01:31:22,451 --> 01:31:24,750
Never with 2 people like us.

1938
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:27,034
- You mean you and I?
- That's it, married.

1939
01:31:27,035 --> 01:31:28,733
M- a-double r-i-e-d.

1940
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:31,476
The judge goes so and so and so and so,
and you're married.

1941
01:31:31,477 --> 01:31:33,945
You will, won't you?

1942
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:36,699
Ted, I...

1943
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:39,795
Yes.

1944
01:31:39,796 --> 01:31:41,830
Hooray!

1945
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:47,305
Come on in, guys!

1946
01:31:47,306 --> 01:31:49,106
Surprise!

1947
01:31:51,633 --> 01:31:53,146
Ted, you fool!

1948
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:54,553
Yahoo!

1949
01:31:54,554 --> 01:31:56,616
What took you so long?

1950
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:58,017
Yeah! All the food will be cold.

1951
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:59,084
We thought you'd never say yes!

1952
01:31:59,085 --> 01:32:01,219
Lots of luck. You'll need it with him.

1953
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,837
Play it again! Play it again!

1954
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:04,873
Again!

1955
01:32:08,335 --> 01:32:09,822
Aw.

1956
01:32:09,823 --> 01:32:12,217
Aw, this is the way it's
gonna be from now on,

1957
01:32:12,218 --> 01:32:14,483
you and me and real living.

1958
01:32:14,484 --> 01:32:15,983
When this show is over,

1959
01:32:15,984 --> 01:32:17,952
I'm gonna buy the sweetest
little plane on earth.

1960
01:32:17,953 --> 01:32:19,487
We'll fly together, just the 2 of us,

1961
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:20,955
right over the top of the earth.

1962
01:32:20,956 --> 01:32:22,190
Darling.

1963
01:32:22,191 --> 01:32:24,124
I never used to like to
fly with anybody before,

1964
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:25,814
but I think I'm gonna like it with you.

1965
01:32:25,815 --> 01:32:27,031
Mademoiselle and monsieur?

1966
01:32:27,032 --> 01:32:27,957
Yes?

1967
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,535
Come and get it.

1968
01:32:29,536 --> 01:32:30,945
Dandy.

1969
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:33,110
Where'd you get all this beautiful food?

1970
01:32:33,111 --> 01:32:34,797
It's a military secret.

1971
01:32:34,798 --> 01:32:36,291
Play it again! Play it again!

1972
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:37,300
Again!

1973
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,837
To Mrs. Ted Randall!

1974
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:40,344
Hooray!

1975
01:32:40,345 --> 01:32:41,651
To Mr. Randall!

1976
01:32:41,652 --> 01:32:44,520
Hooray!

1977
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:47,154
Well, what's the matter?

1978
01:32:47,155 --> 01:32:48,699
I was just thinking,

1979
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,069
you were pretty sure of
yourself, weren't you?

1980
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,713
Why, what do you mean?

1981
01:32:51,714 --> 01:32:53,551
What would you have done if I'd said no?

1982
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:57,721
Ho ho. Play the other one, boys!

1983
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,474
No!

1984
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:09,406
'Tention!

1985
01:33:10,213 --> 01:33:11,714
What is this, a convention?

1986
01:33:11,715 --> 01:33:12,982
Carry on, boys.

1987
01:33:12,983 --> 01:33:14,429
Congratulate me, sir.

1988
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:16,040
O.K. What for?

1989
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,575
Dorinda and I are gonna be married.

1990
01:33:17,576 --> 01:33:19,256
- No?
- Yes!

1991
01:33:19,257 --> 01:33:20,920
- Is that right?
- That's right, Al.

1992
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:23,156
That's swell.

1993
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:24,525
Congratulations, Ted.

1994
01:33:24,526 --> 01:33:25,838
Thank you very much, sir.

1995
01:33:25,839 --> 01:33:27,338
I feel a little bit like a late spring frost

1996
01:33:27,339 --> 01:33:28,840
coming in here like this,

1997
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:30,341
but your replacements are here

1998
01:33:30,342 --> 01:33:31,843
and Nails wants you to whip them into shape.

1999
01:33:31,844 --> 01:33:32,844
When?

2000
01:33:32,845 --> 01:33:33,878
I'm afraid right now.

2001
01:33:33,879 --> 01:33:35,345
He didn't know this was gonna happen.

2002
01:33:35,346 --> 01:33:36,650
O.K., o.K.

2003
01:33:36,651 --> 01:33:39,020
Come on, fellas, let's go!

2004
01:33:39,784 --> 01:33:41,317
A lot of firsts for me today.

2005
01:33:41,318 --> 01:33:42,786
First time I ever got engaged.

2006
01:33:42,787 --> 01:33:44,353
The first time I ever led my own squadron.

2007
01:33:44,354 --> 01:33:45,822
Don't forget to keep the wine cold.

2008
01:33:45,823 --> 01:33:47,356
And the food hot.

2009
01:33:47,357 --> 01:33:49,157
Sure thing.

2010
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:52,527
Follow me over to field.

2011
01:33:56,954 --> 01:33:58,234
Wish me luck, darling.

2012
01:33:58,235 --> 01:34:00,669
You won't need it.

2013
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:07,775
And keep my medal for me, will ya?

2014
01:34:07,776 --> 01:34:09,243
Are you sure you trust me with it?

2015
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,579
What do you think?

2016
01:34:14,684 --> 01:34:16,952
Climb in, Romeo.

2017
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:31,662
You know, you're not sitting
as pretty as you think you are.

2018
01:34:31,663 --> 01:34:33,040
You're engaged, all right,

2019
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,510
but you're not married yet.

2020
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:46,710
You really wanna keep her?

2021
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:49,351
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.

2022
01:34:49,352 --> 01:34:51,116
She just loves crazy fliers.

2023
01:34:51,117 --> 01:34:52,687
She always has.

2024
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:55,210
How do you think I ever got her?

2025
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:56,351
Go on,

2026
01:34:56,352 --> 01:34:57,986
put on something fancy, money bags.

2027
01:34:57,987 --> 01:34:59,260
She'd love it.

2028
01:34:59,261 --> 01:35:00,463
So would Nails.

2029
01:35:00,464 --> 01:35:02,313
Why don't you break away from the squadron?

2030
01:35:02,314 --> 01:35:03,822
Tell 'em to keep their eye on you,

2031
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,356
you'll show 'em what the
service really expects of 'em.

2032
01:35:05,357 --> 01:35:07,454
Go on, kid, you won't get into trouble.

2033
01:35:07,455 --> 01:35:08,879
Go ahead. She thinks you're wonderful.

2034
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,381
Don't disappoint her.

2035
01:35:10,382 --> 01:35:12,817
Put on a show for her.

2036
01:35:13,657 --> 01:35:15,195
Lieutenant Rourke,

2037
01:35:15,196 --> 01:35:16,853
assume commander of squadron.

2038
01:35:16,854 --> 01:35:19,133
Tell the new men to keep an eye on me.

2039
01:35:19,134 --> 01:35:22,371
I'll give them a small idea
of what we expect down here.

2040
01:35:22,372 --> 01:35:24,340
Roger.

2041
01:35:33,455 --> 01:35:34,903
What's he doing?

2042
01:35:34,904 --> 01:35:36,870
I don't know, honey.

2043
01:35:36,871 --> 01:35:39,106
But whatever it is, it ain't good.

2044
01:35:51,617 --> 01:35:54,034
This plane'll hold up under
anything. You know that.

2045
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:55,701
Come on, you lady killer,

2046
01:35:55,702 --> 01:35:58,156
fly this crate right down to the wing bolts.

2047
01:35:58,157 --> 01:36:00,482
And don't forget this.

2048
01:36:00,483 --> 01:36:04,119
She once had a guy who really
knew how to fly an airplane.

2049
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:21,807
She can fly this well herself.

2050
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:30,785
Go on, fly it.

2051
01:36:30,879 --> 01:36:34,280
Go on down there and take
the tops off those trees.

2052
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:51,047
Hey, hey, take it easy now, take it easy.

2053
01:36:51,048 --> 01:36:53,850
You don't have to overdo it, you know.

2054
01:36:59,245 --> 01:37:02,078
Nails is going to love that one.

2055
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:03,777
Nice flying.

2056
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:05,779
Yeah.

2057
01:37:15,193 --> 01:37:17,460
Well, from now on, son,

2058
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:20,385
it's between you and your maker.

2059
01:37:20,386 --> 01:37:23,555
I'm stuck, I can't think of anything more.

2060
01:37:25,028 --> 01:37:26,608
Sir.

2061
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:28,710
Thanks, sergeant.

2062
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:31,691
Well, looks like we're gonna do something

2063
01:37:31,692 --> 01:37:34,324
besides play around here
for the rest of the day.

2064
01:37:34,325 --> 01:37:35,578
Colonel Yackey.

2065
01:37:35,579 --> 01:37:38,047
Yes, sir. See ya later, honey.

2066
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,657
Colonel, tell that young
idiot to report to me

2067
01:37:41,658 --> 01:37:42,811
the minute he lands.

2068
01:37:42,812 --> 01:37:44,846
Yes, sir.

2069
01:38:02,568 --> 01:38:04,395
Just what did you do that for?

2070
01:38:04,396 --> 01:38:06,185
I don't know.
I guess I was kind of a fool.

2071
01:38:06,186 --> 01:38:07,626
Yeah, I guess you were.

2072
01:38:07,627 --> 01:38:09,201
You might have been a fool, Ted,

2073
01:38:09,202 --> 01:38:10,701
but you're the kind of fool that knows

2074
01:38:10,702 --> 01:38:11,793
how to fly an airplane.

2075
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:13,507
There's nothing I can do for you now, bub.

2076
01:38:13,508 --> 01:38:16,010
Come on. The boss wants to see you.

2077
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:18,131
This'll cost that guy every leave he'll have

2078
01:38:18,132 --> 01:38:19,594
for the next 6 months.

2079
01:38:19,595 --> 01:38:21,065
He'll have to get married
in the guard house.

2080
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:22,574
Yeah, that's possible.

2081
01:38:22,575 --> 01:38:25,283
By the way, the boss wants to see you.

2082
01:38:25,284 --> 01:38:27,084
Me?

2083
01:38:29,619 --> 01:38:32,184
O.K, but let me see
what Nails does to him.

2084
01:38:32,185 --> 01:38:34,110
After that, I can take anything.

2085
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:37,013
I just wanna see how he takes a demotion.

2086
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:38,562
You go on home.

2087
01:38:38,563 --> 01:38:40,503
I'll be over to see you after I'm through.

2088
01:38:40,504 --> 01:38:41,591
Don't worry.

2089
01:38:41,592 --> 01:38:43,392
It may not be as bad as you think.

2090
01:38:43,393 --> 01:38:45,157
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

2091
01:38:45,158 --> 01:38:48,194
Sergeant, drive
miss Durston to her quarters.

2092
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:51,344
Bye.

2093
01:38:56,771 --> 01:38:58,622
You wanted to see me, sir.

2094
01:38:58,623 --> 01:39:01,317
Yes. I watched that
show you put on up there.

2095
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:03,431
I'm sorry, sir. I
don't know why I did it.

2096
01:39:03,432 --> 01:39:04,981
Guess I went a little overboard.

2097
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:06,382
I know why you did it.

2098
01:39:06,383 --> 01:39:08,041
Don't do those things, captain.

2099
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,334
You're a squadron commander now.

2100
01:39:09,335 --> 01:39:10,514
Yes, sir.

2101
01:39:10,515 --> 01:39:12,596
What's the matter with you?
You going soft?

2102
01:39:12,597 --> 01:39:13,874
This guy should be busted.

2103
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:14,961
You're good, Randall.

2104
01:39:14,962 --> 01:39:17,042
You're so good, I've got a
job here you might go for.

2105
01:39:17,043 --> 01:39:18,402
I'll take it, sir.

2106
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:19,637
Better have a look at it first.

2107
01:39:19,638 --> 01:39:22,138
What is this, a tea par...

2108
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:25,676
I'll still take it, sir.

2109
01:39:25,677 --> 01:39:28,294
You understand, this is no ordinary mission?

2110
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,381
Headquarters
seem to think a p-38

2111
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:32,176
is the ship to do it.

2112
01:39:32,177 --> 01:39:34,278
See that?

2113
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:37,302
That's palibuk, palibuk island.

2114
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:39,405
Right there is the biggest

2115
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,365
enemy munitions dump in the pacific.

2116
01:39:41,366 --> 01:39:43,374
Observation gives us
clear weather all the way.

2117
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:45,467
You'll take off in time to be
over palibuk around midnight.

2118
01:39:45,468 --> 01:39:47,714
Just get your bombs in,
then twist out fast, right?

2119
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:48,951
I understand, sir.

2120
01:39:48,952 --> 01:39:51,081
You must make every effort
to destroy your target

2121
01:39:51,082 --> 01:39:53,583
and then return, understand?

2122
01:39:53,834 --> 01:39:57,253
I'm not eager to have any
dead heroes on my hands.

2123
01:39:57,254 --> 01:39:59,222
That's all.

2124
01:39:59,607 --> 01:40:02,038
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

2125
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:03,966
- Bring your book.
- Get me a3.

2126
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:05,393
Imagine that.

2127
01:40:05,394 --> 01:40:06,727
If that'd been me up there,

2128
01:40:06,728 --> 01:40:09,096
I'd have been sent to Scotland
for the rest of my life.

2129
01:40:09,097 --> 01:40:11,312
That guy draws on the
juiciest job in the outfit.

2130
01:40:11,313 --> 01:40:13,238
A difference in character, I guess.

2131
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:14,799
He's got a pretty tough assignment, at that.

2132
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,003
Well, you got one, too.

2133
01:40:16,004 --> 01:40:17,019
Me?

2134
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,567
The boss wants to see you, remember?

2135
01:40:18,568 --> 01:40:20,770
Yeah. I almost forgot.

2136
01:40:41,357 --> 01:40:43,759
Go on in. I'll wait out here.

2137
01:40:45,346 --> 01:40:47,582
Come in.

2138
01:40:51,013 --> 01:40:52,639
Major Sandidge reporting, sir.

2139
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,848
At ease.

2140
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:57,004
Well?

2141
01:40:57,005 --> 01:40:59,265
Well, there isn't much to say, sir.

2142
01:40:59,266 --> 01:41:00,831
I didn't think it would do any harm

2143
01:41:00,832 --> 01:41:01,841
to put the kid through his paces.

2144
01:41:01,842 --> 01:41:03,368
That's not the truth.

2145
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:05,300
You were jealous of him.

2146
01:41:05,301 --> 01:41:07,615
Why should I be jealous of him, sir?

2147
01:41:07,616 --> 01:41:11,084
I'm a better flyer than he'll ever be.

2148
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:13,242
Sit down.

2149
01:41:13,243 --> 01:41:15,345
Yes, sir.

2150
01:41:18,121 --> 01:41:19,678
I don't think you really grasp

2151
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,030
what our work is all about up here.

2152
01:41:22,031 --> 01:41:23,796
Yes sir, sure I do.

2153
01:41:23,797 --> 01:41:25,832
I know we're supposed to
follow through with these men

2154
01:41:25,833 --> 01:41:27,869
and make better flyers out of them.

2155
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:29,597
That's only part of it.

2156
01:41:29,598 --> 01:41:33,519
I'm sorry it wasn't made
clearer to you at the beginning.

2157
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,663
It isn't just you as an individual

2158
01:41:35,664 --> 01:41:38,362
helping your man as an individual.

2159
01:41:38,363 --> 01:41:40,770
It's all of us working
together for the future.

2160
01:41:40,771 --> 01:41:43,673
Every man that ever flew...

2161
01:41:44,712 --> 01:41:48,429
It's hard for me to put
it into words, Sandidge,

2162
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:50,590
if you don't feel it.

2163
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:52,166
I think I understand, sir.

2164
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:55,680
No, I don't think you understand at all.

2165
01:41:55,681 --> 01:41:58,361
Let's put it this way.

2166
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:02,592
Have you ever been up in
your plane at night, alone,

2167
01:42:02,593 --> 01:42:07,527
somewhere - 20,000 feet above the ocean?

2168
01:42:07,528 --> 01:42:09,169
Yes, sir.

2169
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,939
Did you ever hear music up there?

2170
01:42:12,443 --> 01:42:14,243
Perhaps.

2171
01:42:14,715 --> 01:42:16,776
If you've heard it, you'll remember it.

2172
01:42:16,777 --> 01:42:21,092
It's the music a man's
spirit sings to his heart

2173
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,155
when the earth's far away

2174
01:42:23,156 --> 01:42:26,318
and there isn't any more fear.

2175
01:42:26,487 --> 01:42:31,024
It's the high, fine, beautiful sound

2176
01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:33,968
of an earthbound creature who grew wings

2177
01:42:33,969 --> 01:42:36,474
and flew up high and looked straight

2178
01:42:36,475 --> 01:42:38,440
into the face of the future

2179
01:42:38,441 --> 01:42:40,873
and caught just for an instant

2180
01:42:40,874 --> 01:42:46,951
the unbelievable vision of
a free man in a free world.

2181
01:42:48,647 --> 01:42:50,147
If you haven't heard it,

2182
01:42:50,148 --> 01:42:52,141
there's no way I can talk to you.

2183
01:42:52,142 --> 01:42:54,299
I've heard it.

2184
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,765
I have heard it, sir.

2185
01:42:56,766 --> 01:42:58,589
I used to try to explain it to some kids,

2186
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,874
but I could never find words.

2187
01:42:59,875 --> 01:43:02,486
Children would understand. Sure.

2188
01:43:02,487 --> 01:43:04,659
Because the future belongs to them.

2189
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,801
They're already moving into it.

2190
01:43:06,802 --> 01:43:10,324
They're going to climb
out of the dust and muck

2191
01:43:10,325 --> 01:43:13,031
and lift up their heads and see the sky.

2192
01:43:13,032 --> 01:43:16,314
They're going to fly like
a generation of angels

2193
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:18,912
into the free air and sunlight.

2194
01:43:18,913 --> 01:43:20,528
Yeah, sure.

2195
01:43:20,529 --> 01:43:23,633
Children would always understand.

2196
01:43:24,057 --> 01:43:26,244
Free as the air.

2197
01:43:26,245 --> 01:43:29,779
Men have said that ever since
they've crawled out of caves

2198
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,043
and came down from trees.

2199
01:43:32,044 --> 01:43:34,079
That's what we're fighting for,

2200
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,194
the freedom of the very air we breathe,

2201
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:40,743
the freedom of mankind
rushing to greet the future

2202
01:43:40,744 --> 01:43:43,079
on wings.

2203
01:43:43,249 --> 01:43:44,785
Can you understand that?

2204
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:46,535
Can you?

2205
01:43:46,536 --> 01:43:48,358
Yes sir, I do.

2206
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:50,426
No man is really dead

2207
01:43:50,427 --> 01:43:52,976
unless he breaks faith with the future.

2208
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,499
And no man is really alive

2209
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:57,791
unless he accepts his responsibility to it.

2210
01:43:57,792 --> 01:44:01,002
That's the chance we're giving you here,

2211
01:44:01,003 --> 01:44:04,359
the opportunity to pay off to the future,

2212
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,235
what you owe for having
been part of the past.

2213
01:44:07,236 --> 01:44:08,686
It's just another way of saying,

2214
01:44:08,687 --> 01:44:10,065
"I'm glad I lived.

2215
01:44:10,066 --> 01:44:11,811
"I'm glad I was alive.

2216
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:14,011
Now let me give you a hand."

2217
01:44:14,012 --> 01:44:17,050
You thought you were choosing
between life and death

2218
01:44:17,051 --> 01:44:19,052
when you flew in over that carrier,

2219
01:44:19,053 --> 01:44:20,981
but you weren't.

2220
01:44:20,982 --> 01:44:23,515
You're choosing between 'em now.

2221
01:44:23,516 --> 01:44:26,086
It's up to you, Pete.

2222
01:44:26,574 --> 01:44:28,647
If you please, sir, I'd like to go back.

2223
01:44:28,648 --> 01:44:30,570
I think I can do my job now.

2224
01:44:30,571 --> 01:44:32,348
Very well.

2225
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:34,416
You may go.

2226
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:44,626
Thank you, sir.

2227
01:45:10,902 --> 01:45:12,701
Dorinda.

2228
01:45:12,702 --> 01:45:15,993
Dorinda, I got something to tell you.

2229
01:45:15,994 --> 01:45:18,160
I've been learning a lot, Dorinda.

2230
01:45:18,161 --> 01:45:20,708
I've learned that this thing that's going on

2231
01:45:20,709 --> 01:45:21,898
is bigger than you and me.

2232
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,360
It's bigger than any of us.

2233
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:25,110
We don't count, Dorinda.

2234
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:27,546
We're just nothing.

2235
01:45:28,302 --> 01:45:31,086
And yet, if we do the
job we're supposed to do,

2236
01:45:31,087 --> 01:45:33,321
we could be great people.

2237
01:45:36,804 --> 01:45:40,628
I wish you could hear what
I'm saying to you, Dorinda.

2238
01:45:40,629 --> 01:45:42,292
When I look at you now,

2239
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:44,708
I sure wish I'd been different.

2240
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:46,922
Wish I'd told you a lot of things

2241
01:45:46,923 --> 01:45:50,945
that I thought of but I just
couldn't find the words to say 'em.

2242
01:45:50,965 --> 01:45:52,629
Wish I'd told you how cute your nose is

2243
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:55,977
and how it turns up
at the end all of a sudden,

2244
01:45:55,978 --> 01:45:59,544
and how good the smell of your hair is,

2245
01:45:59,545 --> 01:46:02,998
how your eyes light up when you laugh,

2246
01:46:02,999 --> 01:46:04,774
and how you fit into my arms

2247
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:07,143
just as though you belonged there.

2248
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,618
But I didn't tell you.

2249
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:13,087
It serves me right.

2250
01:46:14,132 --> 01:46:16,735
You know, this guy of yours
is going on a dangerous job,

2251
01:46:16,736 --> 01:46:18,356
as tough as they come.

2252
01:46:18,357 --> 01:46:20,626
And I just want you to know
that I'll bring him back, Dorinda.

2253
01:46:20,627 --> 01:46:24,110
He's going to be all right,
Dorinda. Don't worry about it.

2254
01:46:24,827 --> 01:46:27,494
Do you know what I'm
really trying to tell you?

2255
01:46:27,495 --> 01:46:28,824
I'm trying to tell you something

2256
01:46:28,825 --> 01:46:30,435
I never told anybody before.

2257
01:46:30,436 --> 01:46:31,954
I love you.

2258
01:46:31,955 --> 01:46:33,164
I love you, Dorinda, with all my heart,

2259
01:46:33,165 --> 01:46:35,848
and I want you to be happy.

2260
01:46:35,849 --> 01:46:37,615
And if marrying this guy
is gonna make you happy,

2261
01:46:37,616 --> 01:46:40,151
that's what I want.

2262
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:43,323
I figure I'll hunt myself another assignment

2263
01:46:43,324 --> 01:46:45,739
if I pull this off,

2264
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:48,275
one that's not so close to home.

2265
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,092
Good-bye, Dorinda.

2266
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,784
We'd have made a great pair.

2267
01:47:14,443 --> 01:47:15,961
Hey. The door was open.

2268
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:17,895
Pete!

2269
01:47:18,877 --> 01:47:19,940
Ted.

2270
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:21,831
Dorinda, what is it?

2271
01:47:21,832 --> 01:47:24,514
Nothing. Nothing...

2272
01:47:24,515 --> 01:47:27,483
I just wasn't expecting you, that's all.

2273
01:47:27,729 --> 01:47:29,223
I had a few minutes,

2274
01:47:29,224 --> 01:47:32,159
so I thought I'd come by
and say good night to you.

2275
01:47:38,896 --> 01:47:41,143
What is it, Dorinda. What is it?

2276
01:47:41,144 --> 01:47:42,457
Ted...

2277
01:47:42,458 --> 01:47:43,734
Yes?

2278
01:47:43,735 --> 01:47:46,048
I've got something to tell you.

2279
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:47,771
Go ahead.

2280
01:47:47,772 --> 01:47:51,440
I- I'm not going to marry you.

2281
01:47:52,364 --> 01:47:53,845
But what's the matter?

2282
01:47:53,846 --> 01:47:56,301
I haven't been honest with you, Ted.

2283
01:47:56,302 --> 01:47:57,925
I'm not in love with you, Ted.

2284
01:47:57,926 --> 01:48:00,186
I thought I was, but I'm not.

2285
01:48:00,187 --> 01:48:02,516
I'm in love with a guy named Pete Sandidge.

2286
01:48:02,517 --> 01:48:04,458
- Stop it, Dorinda.
- Yes, I am.

2287
01:48:04,459 --> 01:48:07,007
You're too nice a person to fool, Ted.

2288
01:48:07,008 --> 01:48:10,061
I just realized it, about myself, I mean.

2289
01:48:10,062 --> 01:48:13,178
I guess when a woman loves
once, she loves for keeps.

2290
01:48:13,179 --> 01:48:15,161
Anyway, that's the way it is with me.

2291
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:17,177
But he's dead, Dorinda.

2292
01:48:17,178 --> 01:48:19,355
That doesn't make any difference, Ted.

2293
01:48:19,356 --> 01:48:21,173
That was real love,

2294
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:24,460
like food and drink and air and water.

2295
01:48:24,461 --> 01:48:26,111
There's no substitute.

2296
01:48:26,112 --> 01:48:28,273
You wouldn't want a substitute, would you?

2297
01:48:28,274 --> 01:48:30,630
Because then, you'd
never have the real thing.

2298
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:33,406
You'd only have a cheap imitation, and...

2299
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:35,880
That would hurt us both.

2300
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:37,987
You sure you mean what you're saying?

2301
01:48:37,988 --> 01:48:40,483
Yes, Ted, I'm so sure,

2302
01:48:40,484 --> 01:48:42,715
so sure.

2303
01:48:42,716 --> 01:48:44,754
I haven't got much time.
I have to go right now.

2304
01:48:44,755 --> 01:48:46,489
I wish I could stay and talk with you.

2305
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:49,659
It wouldn't do any good,
Ted. Honest, it wouldn't.

2306
01:48:51,425 --> 01:48:52,940
Well...

2307
01:48:52,941 --> 01:48:55,985
If that's it, that's it.

2308
01:48:55,986 --> 01:48:58,357
It was too good to be true, anyway.

2309
01:48:58,358 --> 01:49:00,630
I really should have known better.

2310
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:02,773
Good night, Ted.

2311
01:49:02,774 --> 01:49:04,674
Bye, Dorinda.

2312
01:49:09,025 --> 01:49:11,184
Do you mind if I hate Pete...

2313
01:49:11,185 --> 01:49:13,687
Just for a little while?

2314
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,301
Dorinda, I'm just on my way to headquarters.

2315
01:49:44,302 --> 01:49:46,236
I had to stop and tell you something,

2316
01:49:46,237 --> 01:49:47,797
something I think you oughta know.

2317
01:49:47,798 --> 01:49:49,562
What?

2318
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:52,876
I've seen you take one
awful hard jolt with Pete.

2319
01:49:52,877 --> 01:49:55,545
Well, I gotta fix you for another one.

2320
01:49:55,546 --> 01:49:57,713
All right, Al, go ahead.

2321
01:49:57,714 --> 01:50:02,018
Well, Ted's got himself a pretty
tough job cut out for tonight.

2322
01:50:02,019 --> 01:50:03,552
A job like what?

2323
01:50:03,553 --> 01:50:06,389
Like blowing up a jap ammunition dump.

2324
01:50:09,357 --> 01:50:11,879
What are his chances, Al?

2325
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,361
Well, I...

2326
01:50:14,362 --> 01:50:16,992
No so good, Dorinda.

2327
01:50:17,032 --> 01:50:19,200
Where is this ammunition dump?

2328
01:50:19,201 --> 01:50:21,467
I can't tell you that.
You know that.

2329
01:50:21,468 --> 01:50:23,002
Military secret?

2330
01:50:23,003 --> 01:50:23,970
That's right.

2331
01:50:23,971 --> 01:50:25,470
What do you mean,

2332
01:50:25,471 --> 01:50:28,041
military secret between you and me, Al?

2333
01:50:28,042 --> 01:50:29,441
You think I've been
crisscrossing this country

2334
01:50:29,442 --> 01:50:30,776
for the last 6 months

2335
01:50:30,777 --> 01:50:32,277
without getting wise to a thing or 2?

2336
01:50:32,278 --> 01:50:34,910
There are only 2 ammunition
dumps that amount to anything.

2337
01:50:34,911 --> 01:50:37,282
One's at palibuk and
the other San laurentia.

2338
01:50:37,283 --> 01:50:38,816
Palibuk's the biggest.

2339
01:50:38,817 --> 01:50:41,119
That's the one, isn't it?

2340
01:50:42,321 --> 01:50:45,890
Al, you think Ted has a
chance of coming back alive?

2341
01:50:45,891 --> 01:50:47,291
It could be done.

2342
01:50:47,292 --> 01:50:48,558
I'm going back with you.

2343
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:49,593
Look, Dorinda...

2344
01:50:49,594 --> 01:50:50,873
I said I'm going back with you!

2345
01:50:50,874 --> 01:50:53,276
I've got to talk to Ted!

2346
01:50:56,507 --> 01:50:58,129
We made it. There's his ship.

2347
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:00,564
Good. I'm glad.

2348
01:51:01,695 --> 01:51:03,606
They're in operations. You
want to wait in my office?

2349
01:51:03,607 --> 01:51:06,043
No. No, you go on in.
I'll wait out here.

2350
01:51:06,044 --> 01:51:09,494
I guess you'd rather see him alone.

2351
01:51:10,791 --> 01:51:12,010
Now, it's all clear to you...

2352
01:51:12,011 --> 01:51:13,680
Yes, sir.

2353
01:51:13,681 --> 01:51:15,579
6 minutes.

2354
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,114
Have a cup of coffee.

2355
01:52:07,442 --> 01:52:09,153
Hi, powerhouse!

2356
01:52:09,154 --> 01:52:10,794
Hi!

2357
01:52:10,795 --> 01:52:13,605
What are you doing here?

2358
01:52:13,606 --> 01:52:17,057
Just getting this flying bomb
ready for that guy of yours.

2359
01:52:17,058 --> 01:52:19,006
Boy, I wish I were going on this trip.

2360
01:52:19,007 --> 01:52:21,583
Maybe you will be.
Nails wants to see you.

2361
01:52:21,584 --> 01:52:23,344
He does?

2362
01:52:23,345 --> 01:52:25,807
Don't cut it.
I'll hold it for you.

2363
01:52:25,808 --> 01:52:27,975
All right.

2364
01:52:34,722 --> 01:52:36,223
Keep 'em revved up!

2365
01:52:36,224 --> 01:52:37,233
O.K.

2366
01:52:37,234 --> 01:52:39,159
And if they get hot, cut 'em.

2367
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,161
Yeah.

2368
01:53:07,424 --> 01:53:08,762
Hey, Dorinda!

2369
01:53:08,763 --> 01:53:11,498
What's that?

2370
01:53:24,348 --> 01:53:26,372
Dorinda, I know what you're
doing and you're wrong.

2371
01:53:26,373 --> 01:53:28,729
Ted and I could have pulled this job off.

2372
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:31,404
Turn around, Dorinda,
turn around and go back.

2373
01:53:31,405 --> 01:53:32,928
Now, Dorinda, you've got to listen to me.

2374
01:53:32,929 --> 01:53:36,365
You've got to turn
around. You can't do this!

2375
01:53:37,337 --> 01:53:39,405
Everything you're doing
is against orders, Dorinda.

2376
01:53:39,406 --> 01:53:41,595
It doesn't make any sense!

2377
01:53:41,596 --> 01:53:43,275
Now look, Dorinda,

2378
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:45,128
I know you're a great little flyer,

2379
01:53:45,129 --> 01:53:46,841
but you're not a fighter pilot.

2380
01:53:46,842 --> 01:53:48,548
You know, a lot more depends on this job

2381
01:53:48,549 --> 01:53:50,628
than just blowing up an ammunition dump!

2382
01:53:50,629 --> 01:53:51,918
Suppose you don't make the grade?

2383
01:53:51,919 --> 01:53:53,556
Did you ever stop to think of that?

2384
01:53:53,557 --> 01:53:55,527
You'll tip off the whole show!

2385
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:57,404
Guys hundreds of miles
from here will be dying

2386
01:53:57,405 --> 01:53:58,463
just because you got scared

2387
01:53:58,464 --> 01:54:01,933
and started running away from yourself.

2388
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:06,635
Dorinda, you're throwing your
life away trying to do a job

2389
01:54:06,636 --> 01:54:08,989
that somebody else could have done.

2390
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:10,458
You're throwing your life away

2391
01:54:10,459 --> 01:54:12,351
because you're afraid to do your own job.

2392
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,826
You're afraid of living.

2393
01:54:13,827 --> 01:54:15,490
You're afraid of life.

2394
01:54:15,491 --> 01:54:17,271
And that's double-crossing
a lot of guys

2395
01:54:17,272 --> 01:54:19,081
who are out there fighting for it.

2396
01:54:19,082 --> 01:54:23,285
You can't do that, not my Dorinda.

2397
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:27,886
Dorinda!
Dorinda, kick that rudder

2398
01:54:27,887 --> 01:54:29,485
and get this crate out of here!

2399
01:54:29,486 --> 01:54:31,571
Dorinda, you've got
to hear me! Listen to me!

2400
01:54:31,572 --> 01:54:33,907
Don't be a pig-headed fool!

2401
01:54:34,016 --> 01:54:35,775
They've spotted us.

2402
01:54:35,776 --> 01:54:37,081
All right, I'm right behind you, Dorinda.

2403
01:54:37,082 --> 01:54:39,452
Open up that hot lead!

2404
01:54:45,994 --> 01:54:48,329
Now, Dorinda!

2405
01:54:53,655 --> 01:54:56,757
Come on, twist her out,
Dorinda, twist her out!

2406
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:00,943
Put her nose up into the moon!

2407
01:55:12,707 --> 01:55:14,247
Now just settle back

2408
01:55:14,248 --> 01:55:16,808
and let this little
sweetheart take you home.

2409
01:55:20,469 --> 01:55:23,077
Got some dirt on your face
again, didn't you?

2410
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:36,645
That's better.

2411
01:55:37,823 --> 01:55:39,378
Now just point her nose in the air

2412
01:55:39,379 --> 01:55:42,313
and climb straight for heaven.

2413
01:55:48,254 --> 01:55:49,950
Higher, Dorinda,

2414
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:52,086
higher.

2415
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:01,968
Listen, Dorinda.

2416
01:56:06,405 --> 01:56:09,174
There it is. You hear it?

2417
01:56:19,597 --> 01:56:22,447
I can tell you now, Dorinda.

2418
01:56:22,448 --> 01:56:25,649
I can tell you everything
I've ever wanted to tell you.

2419
01:56:27,184 --> 01:56:28,827
You're going back and you're gonna have

2420
01:56:28,828 --> 01:56:30,392
a swell life, Dorinda.

2421
01:56:30,393 --> 01:56:32,761
You're gonna have a wonderful life.

2422
01:56:32,762 --> 01:56:36,369
Everything's gonna seem
prettier than it was before.

2423
01:56:36,370 --> 01:56:39,359
The rain's gonna have a
little more smell to it.

2424
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,783
The trees are gonna seem a little greener.

2425
01:56:42,784 --> 01:56:46,621
And the nights are gonna
be all chock full of stars.

2426
01:56:47,617 --> 01:56:49,826
And when you go to sleep, Dorinda,

2427
01:56:49,827 --> 01:56:52,662
you're not gonna have any bad dreams.

2428
01:56:54,855 --> 01:56:58,354
And when that morning
sunlight hits you in the face,

2429
01:56:58,355 --> 01:57:01,323
you're gonna wake up laughing.

2430
01:57:03,518 --> 01:57:05,418
And what's more, you're
going out with people,

2431
01:57:05,419 --> 01:57:07,163
and you're gonna have all
the things that they have,

2432
01:57:07,164 --> 01:57:09,974
including love.

2433
01:57:10,318 --> 01:57:12,260
You know, the only decent
thing I ever did in my life

2434
01:57:12,261 --> 01:57:14,730
was love you, Dorinda.

2435
01:57:15,004 --> 01:57:16,719
But if the memory of that love

2436
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,954
is gonna make you unhappy
all the rest of your life,

2437
01:57:18,955 --> 01:57:21,883
there must have been
something wrong with it.

2438
01:57:21,884 --> 01:57:23,306
It should've been the kind that filled

2439
01:57:23,307 --> 01:57:25,620
your heart so full of love

2440
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,135
that you just had to go out and find

2441
01:57:27,136 --> 01:57:29,075
someone to give it to.

2442
01:57:29,076 --> 01:57:32,575
That's the only real
kind, isn't it, Dorinda?

2443
01:57:32,576 --> 01:57:36,179
That's the only kind that ever lives.

2444
01:57:38,667 --> 01:57:40,297
You know, I find myself wondering

2445
01:57:40,298 --> 01:57:43,332
what kind of kids you two will have.

2446
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,212
I'd like to talk to those kids sometime.

2447
01:57:46,213 --> 01:57:48,915
I think I could tell 'em something.

2448
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:51,332
I think I could tell them about life,

2449
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:53,074
how good it is,

2450
01:57:53,075 --> 01:57:55,577
how good it can be.

2451
01:57:56,238 --> 01:57:59,473
And how the decent things in life never die.

2452
01:58:02,009 --> 01:58:04,367
And how the only kind of love worth having

2453
01:58:04,368 --> 01:58:07,939
is the kind that goes on living

2454
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:09,966
and laughing

2455
01:58:09,967 --> 01:58:13,110
and fighting...

2456
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:15,281
And loving.

2457
01:58:50,829 --> 01:58:53,062
There he is, Dorinda.

2458
01:58:53,384 --> 01:58:55,104
Go on.

2459
01:58:55,105 --> 01:58:57,361
I'm setting you free, Dorinda.

2460
01:58:57,362 --> 01:59:00,564
I'm moving out of your heart.

2461
01:59:01,297 --> 01:59:03,331
Good-bye.

2462
01:59:04,738 --> 01:59:06,806
Good-bye, darling.

2463
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:21,093
That's my girl.

2464
01:59:21,507 --> 01:59:23,941
And that's my boy.

2464
01:59:24,305 --> 02:00:24,247
