1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,269
On behalf of your commanding officer,
I'm sure I can tell Mr. José Iturbi

3
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:50,164
that the officers and crew
of this ship are grateful to him

4
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,567
for coming here to lead
our Navy bands in this ceremony.

5
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:58,364
Along with every other civilian,
it is I who am grateful to you

6
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,200
and to all the men
in the United States Navy.

7
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:04,453
The men who are to be decorated
are present, sir.

8
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:09,291
Joseph Brady,
Gunner's Mate Second Class.

9
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,378
Clarence Doolittle, Seaman First Class.

10
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,883
During the action aboard
the USS cruiser <i>Knoxville</i>

11
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,219
these two men
remained at their stations

12
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:23,055
serving their gun
until the ammunition was exhausted.

13
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:26,183
When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard

14
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,895
Joseph Brady, without regard
for his own personal safety

15
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,773
dived into the sea
and rescued his shipmate.

16
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:38,904
Acting for the secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.

17
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,789
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.

18
00:03:57,089 --> 00:04:00,175
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.

19
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,186
To the men who formally
served on the <i>Knoxville</i>

20
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,314
including those I've just decorated

21
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:16,608
you'll be granted four days' leave,
effective immediately.

22
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,861
Leave your quarter.

23
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,956
Let me through, boys.

24
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,250
Yeah, I'm hopeful.

25
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:44,428
The poor little fellas.

26
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,097
They gotta stay and mind the ship
for the admiral.

27
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,725
- That's right.
- That's it, rub it in.

28
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,144
They don't get to go to Hollywood

29
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,730
where the beautiful dames
grow like oranges.

30
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:58,817
Where all you gotta do is reach out
and pick them right off the street.

31
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:00,653
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.

32
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,529
You'll probably visit the studios

33
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:05,532
if you see those stars,
will you get me some autographs?

34
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,118
Oh, no, not this baby.
After eight months at sea

35
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,288
it ain't a bunch of autographs
I'm gonna wind up with. Here.

36
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:14,333
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans, Joe?

37
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,380
Well, in Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named Lola.

38
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:23,217
Oh, that Lola.

39
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,511
I tell you, she's a...

40
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:30,557
Well, it isn't exactly that,
but it's a...

41
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,978
- No, it isn't that either.
- Tell us about her, Joe.

42
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,688
- Yeah.
- Well

43
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:39,233
notice how different the band
sounded with that guy Iturbi leading?

44
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,443
- That was good.
- Lola's kind of like that.

45
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,113
Put her with the most beautiful dames
in the world

46
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,115
she's the one you'd see, that's all.

47
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:49,493
You mean she's different, huh, Joe?

48
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:51,704
I wouldn't say that.

49
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,749
If you like dames, what's the point of
getting one different from other dames?

50
00:05:55,916 --> 00:06:00,838
No, I guess it's just that whatever
the others have, Lola has more of it.

51
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,339
Does she got a sister?

52
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,009
Hey, what makes you think
this Lola is still waiting?

53
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,927
Dames have been known to wander.

54
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:12,308
From me? Please, sailor,
leave us not talk mutiny.

55
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:17,896
<i>Fall in to the port side of the hangar</i>
<i>deck for special leave.</i>

56
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,942
Oh, do you think
we can tear ourselves away?

57
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,236
Yeah, but it'll be tough.

58
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,823
- We hate to leave.
- We hate to leave.

59
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,910
<i>But when they give you leave</i>
<i>You gotta leave</i>

60
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:35,664
<i>Oh, our hearts bleed</i>
<i>For all of you guys aboard</i>

61
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:38,792
<i>But right now</i>
<i>Sympathy is a thing we can't afford</i>

62
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,711
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

63
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,546
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

64
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,381
<i>Without you guys along</i>

65
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,508
<i>We'll grieve and grieve</i>

66
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:50,262
<i>But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back</i>
<i>Before we're even missed</i>

67
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:53,724
<i>And tell you guys about the countless</i>
<i>Dames that we have kissed</i>

68
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,559
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

69
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:57,436
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

70
00:06:57,603 --> 00:07:01,315
<i>We really hate to leave</i>

71
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,903
You know, Clarence,
I think it's awful, us going ashore

72
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,614
leaving these guys here
in their undershirts

73
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,824
and we gotta go meet beautiful dames

74
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,618
in their soft silk dresses.

75
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,996
Yeah, but duty is duty,
and an order is an order.

76
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,457
You know, I know some guys
that get a thrill

77
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:21,168
out of meeting a gorgeous gal
every night.

78

<i>We hate to leave</i>

79
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,090
<i>We hate to leave</i>

80
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:27,716
<i>But when they give you leave</i>

81
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:29,301
<i>You gotta leave</i>

82
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:33,722
<i>No more pinup gals</i>
<i>That we so enjoy</i>

83
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,059
<i>Tonight, fair boys</i>
<i>We get to meet the real McCoy</i>

84
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,978
<i>We hate to leave</i>

85
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,729
<i>We hate to leave</i>

86
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,731
<i>But we'll be back before</i>

87
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:44,858
<i>The anchors heave</i>

88
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:48,654
<i>We wanna stay, we wanna stay</i>
<i>Our hearts are with the ship</i>

89
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:52,157
<i>But the admiral made us take this leave</i>
<i>He beat us with a whip</i>

90
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,201
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

91
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,120
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

92
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:58,831
<i>We really</i>

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,669
<i>Hate to leave</i>

94
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,811
But, honey, I saved every minute
of my leave for you.

95
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,023
Oh, why shouldn't I have?

96
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:27,818
Oh, you're the only one any place
I wanna see.

97
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,778
What's he doing wrong, Joe?

98
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,822
He's dead, that's all. Watch.

99
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,324
But ho...

100
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,161
But, honey, I don't wanna meet
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.

101
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,496
I wanna meet you.

102
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,875
Well, you'll be sorry.

103
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,338
You'll be sorry.

104
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:53,177
Hello, Ms. Laverne?

105
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,471
Ms. Lola Laverne?

106
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:02,394
Is this the face that launched
a thousand ships?

107
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,273
Yeah. Yeah, it's Joe, all right.

108
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,569
Don't anybody even want
a cup of coffee?

109
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,199
No business.

110
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:18,827
Well, it'll be a couple hours
before I hit Hollywood.

111
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:20,704
Can you wait?

112
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,918
Oh, I know what you mean, baby.

113
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,503
But you just try.

114
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:31,090
Let's decide that later,
after eight months at sea

115
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:36,011
all I wanna do is just look at you
for a long, long time.

116
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,938
Oh, you'll like. For sure.

117
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,445
- Come on, get a move on.
- Come on.

118
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:58,742
Come on, eight months
is a long enough time to wait.

119
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:03,330
Hello?

120
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:07,084
Hello, you beautiful creature.

121
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:12,381
When you hear the tone, the time
will be exactly 6:10 and one quarter.

122
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,258
Buy war bonds.

123
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,345
Thank you, I will.

124
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,432
Hey, you guys,
the buses for Hollywood pulled up!

125
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:24,852
- Get me to Hollywood.
- Here we come.

126
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,146
- Here we go, boys. Come on.
- Hey.

127
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:31,108
- Give my regards to Lana Turner.
- Who needs a house in Hollywood?

128
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:44,163
<i>Anchors Aweigh</i>

129
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,001
<i>Farewell to college joys</i>
<i>We sail at...</i>

130
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,263
Hey, sonny.

131
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,599
- Hello.
- What's the matter?

132
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,142
Nothing. Why?

133
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,311
It's late at night,
where are you going?

134
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:10,272
- To join the Navy.
- Oh, well, you...

135
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,652
- Gonna what?
- I said, I'm going to join the Navy.

136
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,198
- Wait a minute.
- I'm in a hurry.

137
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:21,992
Take it easy. Where do you live?

138
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,161
- Why?
- Well, I wanna take you home.

139
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:28,457
But I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.

140
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,168
What's your name?

141
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,965
Look, it's my job
to find little boys that are lost.

142
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:38,342
Lost is when you don't know
where you're going.

143
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:41,553
And I do know,
I'm going to join the Navy.

144
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,138
- All right.
- Good night.

145
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:46,475
If that's the way you want it, okay.
You're coming to the station.

146
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:49,687
I don't wanna join the police.
I wanna join the Navy.

147
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,797
Stop there.

148
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:04,219
Are you following me?

149
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,436
What's with you?

150
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:14,188
Come on, spill it.

151
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,440
Well, you see, it's like this, Joe.

152
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,567
I've been in the Navy
a year and a half.

153
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,903
Every time we hit port and get liberty

154
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,530
all I do is go to the library.

155
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:26,033
All right, so you like books,
what's the beef?

156
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,411
Well, I thought it'd be fun
to try something different

157
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,246
like going out with girls.

158
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:34,166
- Okay, good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.

159
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,627
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Don't give me that "but."

160
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:39,797
After all, you're no yokel.
You're from Brooklyn.

161
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,800
Even in Brooklyn, things can go wrong.

162
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,426
What do you mean?

163
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,387
Well, right from boys' high school

164
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:49,098
I went to the
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine

165
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:51,308
assistant choirmaster.

166
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,228
And out of there, I went into the Navy.

167
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,897
I wouldn't tell that
to anyone but you, Joe.

168
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,607
Sure, sure, I'll keep it quiet.

169
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,859
What do you want,
a couple of phone numbers?

170
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,237
Oh, no, I'd be too scared to use them.

171
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:06,031
- When you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Lola?

172
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:07,533
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you kidding?

173
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,034
Oh, not what you think, Joe.

174
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,537
I thought I'd like
to string along and learn.

175
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,873
After all, you're the best wolf
in the whole Navy.

176
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,293
Well, you are.
And besides, you gotta help me, Joe.

177
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,297
You saved my life
and you owe me something.

178
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:25,384
I saved your life
so now I owe you something?

179
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,094
Have you gone crazy?

180
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,973
Look, I didn't ask you to save my life,
but you did.

181
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,810
- Now I figure you're responsible for me.
- Well, I don't.

182
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:39,231
What's the sense of having your life
saved if you can't have any fun with it?

183
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:46,030
Look, I got a lot to do
in the next four days.

184
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,740
I don't want anybody tailing me.

185
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:49,658
You say I owe you something.

186
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:52,995
Well, I don't see it,
but if I find a dame for you

187
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,497
and get you started,
will you call it quits?

188
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,003
Okay, let me see.

189
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:09,928
Well, we'll have to do
with what you've got.

190
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,556
First place, fix your hat.

191
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,064
Let me see a sample of your technique.

192
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,983
You're you, see?
And I'm a dame coming down the street.

193
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,860
Pick me up.

194
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:29,782
I'm a dame, see? I'm coming down
the street, now come on.

195
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:32,409
I beg your pardon, miss.
Lady, could I possibly...?

196
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:35,204
Oh, no. No.

197
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,872
You gotta give it more:

198
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:59,186
Listen, Brooklyn, when you're going
hunting it's how you feel that counts.

199
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:02,064
If you feel like a mouse,
you'll be looking for cheese

200
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,942
that's what you'll get.
But if you feel like a wolf

201
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,111
nothing can go wrong,
you're in control.

202
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:10,406
Hey, sailors, one of you guys gotta
come down to station with me.

203
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:13,450
- Any choice? You'll do. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

204
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:15,619
Please, let's not have
any unpleasantness.

205
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:18,706
I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me?

206
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,625
Just when I'm beginning
to feel like a wolf.

207
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,629
The secretary of the Navy
will have a say about this.

208
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:27,256
Washington will hear about it.

209
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,717
Who's in charge here?
That's what I wanna know.

210
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,386
- Ship ahoy!
- Are you the guy that had me pulled in?

211
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,764
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge? What's the idea?

212
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,309
- What are you...?
- If you've been inconvenienced

213
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,810
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:42,604
You see, this young man
thinks he should join the Navy.

215
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:44,315
We think he should go home.

216
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,276
Since he won't tell us where he lives

217
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,862
we thought that maybe a sailor...

218
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,572
See?

219
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,373
So you wanna join the Navy, huh?

220
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,709
Aye, aye, sir.

221
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:07,421
Attention.

222
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,590
- Name?
- Don Martin, sir.

223
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:13,177
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.

224
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,602
My daddy was in the Navy

225
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,313
and he said that when
I was grown up, I could join.

226
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,066
And now I am grown up, so I want to.

227
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:32,029
Well, sure, mate, but...

228
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:35,449
Well, look, it's this way.
There's sort of a rule in the Navy.

229
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:40,496
Before they'll take you, you need a letter
from your mom or dad saying it's okay.

230
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,624
But I don't have
a mother or father anymore.

231
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,212
I live with my Aunt Susie.

232
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,006
You think a letter from an aunt
would be all right?

233
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:55,928
Well, sure, that would be perfect.
Why don't you talk to her about it.

234
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:58,305
One of these guys
will take you home and...

235
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,516
- You.
- But I got...

236
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:05,229
- Gotta be a nursemaid and everything...
- Aunt Susie may not give me the letter

237
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,690
but if you asked her...

238
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:09,984
- You better come along too.
- Oh, no, I can't.

239
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,610
- You come along.
- No, I can't.

240
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:13,404
What am I gonna do about Lola?

241
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,953
I guess Aunt Susie must be asleep, huh?

242
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,956
- She isn't home yet.
- I suppose the door is locked too.

243
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:25,582
Yes.

244
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,460
- But we can get in.
- How?

245
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,921
The way I got out.

246
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:41,181
Look out for my wagon.

247
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:51,650
"Dear Ms. Abbott,
Donald was a very good boy.

248
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,111
He's fast asleep.

249
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,323
So I went home. Mrs. Murphy."

250
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,408
I'll get you some candy.

251
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:02,036
- I know where Aunt Susie hides it.
- Wait a second.

252
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,747
- You think your aunt will be back soon?
- Oh, sure.

253
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:07,875
What do you mean, "oh, sure"?
How do you know?

254
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,169
Well, she lives here.

255
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,756
You know, sometimes he talks like you.

256
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:27,561
Look, fellas...

257
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:32,691
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I don't want you to think I'd walk out...

258
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,737
Well, you gotta stay here with the kid
anyhow and talk to his aunt and...

259
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:40,532
Well, I got a date with a girl,
and there's no sense in all of us just...

260
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:44,453
Well, that's great. That's just dandy.

261
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,165
He's got a date with a girl. What's he
think I've got a date with, a duck?

262
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,709
Goodbye. Thanks, fellas.

263
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,837
Brooklyn, I'm blowing,
the baby's all yours.

264
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:56,090
Joe. Hey, Joe!

265
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,801
You can't leave me here,
what about my being a wolf?

266
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:02,054
- You promised me.
- You promised you'd talk to Aunt Susie.

267
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:07,101
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?

268
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,732
Okay. Okay.

269
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,367
Who's he calling?

270
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,452
A girl.

271
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,498
Lola, baby.

272
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,834
Forgotten you?

273
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,919
Oh, honey.

274
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:37,006
With the picture of you
I've got in my mind?

275
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:40,968
Why, even across the phone,
I can see every...

276
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:45,139
Look, let me tell you what happened.

277
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:49,435
- I found a kid that was lost.
- Joe, I wasn't lost.

278
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,691
So I had to take him home.
I won't be long.

279
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:03,532
As long as I get there?
Oh, honey, you know I'll get there.

280
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:09,955
Look, we better talk
about that later, huh?

281
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:13,792
- Yeah, goodbye.
- What are you going to talk about later?

282
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:17,087
Things, sailor. Things.

283
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:19,006
You'll understand when you get older.

284
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:24,470
- Everybody keeps saying that to me.
- Yeah, they used to say that to me too.

285
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,556
Well, did you understand
when you got older?

286
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:29,391
Nope.

287
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:32,269
I wonder what could be keeping
that Aunt Susie.

288
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,688
What can an old lady
be doing out this late?

289
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,999
Susan, don't you wish
that you were up there?

290
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,087
I've never heard his voice sound so
beautiful. There's something about him.

291
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:02,758
He always gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.

292
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:40,421
Cut it! Print that.

293
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:43,757
Okay, children, you go home now
and thanks very much for the day.

294
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,718
No callback.

295
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:49,179
Good night.

296
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,765
- Mr. Iturbi, I...
- Good night, Susie.

297
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,267
Good night, Tom. I...

298
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:55,769
- How's that for camera?
- Right on the nose.

299
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,856
Tell me, Bill, when are we going
to shoot the boogie-woogie?

300
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:05,696
- Good night. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, dear.

301
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,657
- Good night.
- Good night.

302
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:29,595
Hi, Aunt Susie.

303
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:37,978
Well, what got you home so early,
your feet give out?

304
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,939
- What?
- Dames like you kill me.

305
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,233
Don't you ever think of anybody
but yourself?

306
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,279
Leaving the little kid alone while you're
out chasing around, having a big time.

307
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:49,782
Would you mind telling me
just who you are

308
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:51,408
and what you're doing here?

309
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:54,495
I'm a guy the police called
when they picked this kid up

310
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,830
wandering around the boulevard,
that's all.

311
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:59,667
That wouldn't interest you,
so if you step aside, lady...

312
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,878
- Well, just a moment. I don't...
- Don't apologize.

313
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:05,756
Just clear the deck.
Come on, Brooklyn.

314
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:08,092
But I...

315
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:09,677
- Bye.
- Aunt Susie.

316
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:13,597
- But, Aunt Susie...
- Joe. Hey, Joe. Listen, the kid's crying.

317
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:16,892
Well, if I had to live
with a dame like that, I'd cry too.

318
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,811
I thought she was sort of nice.

319
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:21,647
A dame that leaves a kid
alone that way ain't nice.

320
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:24,233
Wait a minute, please.
You didn't give me a chance.

321
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,068
- Donald explained and...
- Okay, okay.

322
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,112
It was all a mistake, and you're sorry.

323
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,322
But my pal and I got plans
for the night.

324
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:33,033
- We'd like to get going.
- I haven't got a thing to do.

325
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,538
Well, I thought, if you didn't mind,
that you could come back for a while.

326
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:40,582
It's Donald, he's so upset
and it's way past his bedtime.

327
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,295
Well, sure we will.
We didn't even say goodbye.

328
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:48,215
Is something wrong, Joe?

329
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:56,807
I thought you'd gone.

330
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:59,601
Hey, hey, sailor, what is this?
What's with you?

331
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,645
You forgot about me.

332
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:06,191
About what you promised.
You know, the letter.

333
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:09,445
Oh, sure, the letter.

334
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,113
You see, it's this way.

335
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,825
The kid here wanted to join the Navy,
but I told him about the rule.

336
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:18,579
You know, the rule about needing a
letter from your folks saying it's okay.

337
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:21,123
Donald thought
if Joe asked you for the letter...

338
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,293
Oh, Donald, suppose you and I
talk about that in the morning.

339
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:28,797
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.

340
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:31,091
You want me to go with you, don't you?

341
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:35,054
Well, sure, kid, but...

342
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,931
Wait a second,
there are a couple of things

343
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,893
you need beside the letter,
you gotta have a...

344
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,896
Can you read and write?

345
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,609
No, he can't.
He plays hooky all the time.

346
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:50,819
You mean to say
you can't read and write?

347
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:53,197
You think the Navy takes dopes?

348
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:54,698
Not ever?

349
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,788
Well, maybe sometimes. But even the
dopes have to be able to read and write.

350
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:03,540
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.

351
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:06,919
Joe, now what will I do?

352
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:15,094
Well, the first thing you gotta do,
you gotta go to school and study hard.

353
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:17,262
Before you know it,
you won't be a dope.

354
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:20,432
Now, young man,
how about going to bed, huh?

355
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:25,270
All right,
but I want Joe to put me to bed.

356
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:26,772
Oh, really, Donald.

357
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,317
We can't keep these gentlemen any
longer, they have other things to do.

358
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,695
No, they haven't. They're on leave.

359
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:35,823
We'd be very happy to put him to bed,
wouldn't we, Joe?

360
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,909
Oh, thank you,
but you've done enough already.

361
00:26:40,953 --> 00:26:42,287
Joe?

362
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:48,460
Okay, okay, but no stalling.

363
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:53,590
Come on, you helper, you.

364
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:58,679
<i>Anchors aweigh, my boy</i>

365
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,515
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

366
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:06,645
Hey, hit the sack, sailor.
Get in there.

367
00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:10,482
Joe, you're coming back
to see me, promise?

368
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:13,986
Sure, sure, sure, that's a deal.
Come on, now, get in bed. Come on.

369
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:18,907
- All set?
- No, I always get sung to sleep.

370
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:22,911
Look what wants to join the Navy.

371
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:26,248
Hey, listen, bub, do you think
anybody sings us sailors to sleep?

372
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,250
But I'm not in the Navy yet.

373
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:31,211
So it's all right for me to be sung to.

374
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:34,673
Well, he's right. He's right.

375
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:36,884
All right.

376
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,385
You sing to him.

377
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:41,847
After all, you're the choirmaster
around here, not me.

378
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:43,599
Oh, Joe.

379
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:46,268
I told you that
in the strictest of confidence.

380
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:49,355
And you promised never to bring it up.

381
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:08,457
<i>Lullaby</i>

382
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,460
<i>And good night</i>

383
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:18,676
<i>With roses bedight</i>

384
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,222
<i>Bright angels</i>

385
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:29,520
<i>Around my darling</i>

386
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:33,065
<i>Shall stand</i>

387
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:38,153
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

388
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,656
<i>And rest</i>

389
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,369
<i>May thy slumber</i>

390
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:48,789
<i>Be blessed</i>

391
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:53,794
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

392
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:56,422
<i>And rest</i>

393
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:00,801
<i>May thy slumber</i>

394
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:05,514
<i>Be blessed</i>

395
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:28,871
- They're asleep.
- Your friend too?

396
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:32,041
Well, I made some coffee.

397
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,754
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...

398
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,714
Oh, it's nothing.

399
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,471
Is something wrong?

400
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:47,514
Oh, no.

401
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:51,435
- Well, did you have a nice nap?
- Come on, Brooklyn.

402
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:54,563
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, gotta blow. Thanks.

403
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,274
- Well, you've been awful nice.
- Forget it. So long.

404
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,151
Goodbye. Thanks. Thanks again.

405
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:03,656
Hey, Joe, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

406
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,491
I know you're not gonna like this.

407
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:07,493
Remember what you were gonna do for me?

408
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,789
About getting a girl, I mean.
I've seen the one I want.

409
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:17,711
- Oh, no. No, Brooklyn.
- But, Joe, you promised me.

410
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,214
Okay, I promised you,
but not Aunt Susie.

411
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:23,008
I didn't promise you Aunt Susie.

412
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:30,182
Good night.

413
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:41,485
But, Lola, it's not that late.
It's never that late.

414
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:45,614
Oh, baby, I know you're tired, but...

415
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:47,992
What do you mean, it's for my sake?

416
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:51,036
Well, honey,
I wouldn't be disappointed in you.

417
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:54,164
Oh, baby, I couldn't be.

418
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,835
Okay. Okay.

419
00:30:58,002 --> 00:31:01,672
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.

420
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,091
Twelve o'clock?

421
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:06,385
In the morning?

422
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:10,848
Well, all right,
if that's what you want.

423
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:14,018
Goodbye.

424
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:22,776
- Gee, Joe, that's tough.
- Yeah. Hurry up, huh?

425
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:35,914
- What's the Navy coming to, bud?
- I ask myself that.

426
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,292
Say, Joe...?

427
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,462
Joe, I don't wanna
keep messing up your plans.

428
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:44,923
What I mean is, we won't have to look
for a girl for me tomorrow.

429
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,592
We've already found Aunt Susan.

430
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,429
Listen, Brooklyn, I didn't save your life
to hand it over to that character.

431
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,473
I'm gonna get you a dame that's a dame.

432
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,226
Right now we gotta find
a place to sleep, so relax. Come on.

433
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:58,812
Oh, hello, fellas.

434
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,116
Shut up.

435
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,458
- Couple of empties down there, fellas.
- Thanks, pal.

436
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,627
- First night's leave for you guys?
- Yeah.

437
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,128
Well, do you wanna talk?

438
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:25,714
Sure, but we got in trouble,
we picked up a kid.

439
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:28,717
Yeah, yeah,
and what a little kid that was.

440
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:32,179
And what another little kid she had
waiting for us when we got home.

441
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:35,015
Such trouble we should run into
every night of our life.

442
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:37,518
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, Pittsburgh, how are you?

443
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:40,938
- Oh, boy, what a town this is.
- How do you like that?

444
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:45,442
I walk my feet off all night
and end up with a glass of beer.

445
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,069
You don't live right.

446
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:50,072
Oh, never in all my life
have I seen such dames.

447
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,573
This blond...

448
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,660
Not that there was anything wrong
with that redhead of yours.

449
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:59,039
Oh, no. No, no.
She was rather interesting.

450
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:02,209
Oh, interesting.
You should have seen the kid work.

451
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:05,713
- I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
- You took them home.

452
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,424
- Little slow at first. A little slow.
- Little slow.

453
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,467
I asked my girl for a kiss.

454
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,761
- She said no.
- Skip the details.

455
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:15,639
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you.

456
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:19,893
<i>I begged her</i>

457
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,770
That's the way he started.

458
00:33:21,937 --> 00:33:25,858
<i>I pleaded</i>

459
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:28,736
You should have seen this boy.

460
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:34,908
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

461
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:40,581
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

462
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:42,082
What technique.

463
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:45,544
<i>I argued</i>

464
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:48,088
I never saw such a stubborn dame
in my whole life.

465
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:52,301
<i>I threatened</i>

466
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:54,261
And he's got muscles, too.

467
00:33:55,012 --> 00:34:00,851
<i>I said,</i>
<i>"You can't send me home, not like this"</i>

468
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:06,148
<i>And I finally got that kiss</i>

469
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:08,442
Tell them, Brooklyn.
Tell them how it is.

470
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:13,364
<i>She begged me</i>

471
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,199
- True?
- True. True.

472
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:19,495
<i>She pleaded</i>

473
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:21,830
Got down on her bended knee to him!

474
00:34:21,997 --> 00:34:26,627
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

475
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:28,963
Oh, this boy was sensational.

476
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,717
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

477
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:36,095
- Tell them all, Brooklyn.
- I'm telling them.

478
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:39,848
<i>She argued</i>

479
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,976
What like a wildcat.

480
00:34:42,142 --> 00:34:46,397
<i>She threatened</i>

481
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:48,691
Practically drew a gun on the boy.

482
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:54,071
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"You can't send me home, not like this"</i>

483
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:55,572
What happened?

484
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,119
<i>She finally got her kiss</i>

485
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,333
- Look at this.
- Give them the floor, boys.

486
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:10,421
<i>What a time we had tonight</i>

487
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,772
<i>What a dish, what a dream</i>
<i>What a dame</i>

488
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:33,110
<i>And she lives alone</i>

489
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,477
What time is it?

490
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:50,813
Oh, it's early yet.

491
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,983
Yeah, I know, but what time is it?

492
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:06,662
What happened to that clock?

493
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:12,584
The phone! Where's the phone?

494
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:28,058
Hello. Hello, Lola. Listen, honey, I...
Well, then, who is it?

495
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:31,603
Oh, well, listen, this is Joe Brady.
Where's Lola?

496
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:35,274
Did she leave a message for me?

497
00:37:35,441 --> 00:37:38,902
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?

498
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:42,281
Well, that's too bad
about you too, sister...!

499
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:43,949
Hey. Hey, don't hang up on me.

500
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:46,952
Let's leave a note, will you?
Tell her I'll call at 10...

501
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,839
Honest, Joe,
I can explain the whole thing.

502
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:00,758
Just give me a second, I can explain.

503
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:03,886
You were sleeping like a baby,
and I didn't wanna disturb you.

504
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:08,098
I know you need your rest very badly.
I know you don't look good unless...

505
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:10,934
Joe, help! Help! Help!

506
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:12,561
Joe, help!

507
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:16,899
It's against the rules, really,
but we thought just this once

508
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,942
we ought to serve breakfast up here.

509
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:21,487
After all, you've been through so much.

510
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,489
Oh, thanks a lot.

511
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,949
You must appreciate
a buddy like Clarence.

512
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:28,994
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone
make a sound all morning?

513
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:32,373
We just crept around like little mice
so as not to wake you.

514
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:34,249
I never saw such devotion.

515
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:38,963
Oh, don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.

516
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:41,840
Oh, I'm sure Clarence
doesn't expect it.

517
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:45,052
Oh, no. Really, I don't. I'd hate it.

518
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,429
You poor, poor boy.

519
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,391
Forty-eight days and nights
on a raft.

520
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,934
Isn't this thrilling?

521
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,561
If you want any more coffee,
just let us know.

522
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,272
- And he looks so shy.
- I know, he's so sweet.

523
00:39:03,946 --> 00:39:07,282
Joe. Joe, don't you think you ought
to eat some of this food?

524
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,159
It gets cold very quickly, you know.

525
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:11,495
Why don't you try the eggs.
They're very good.

526
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:14,415
Joe, I left you a razor in the shower,
there's a towel...

527
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:17,334
Clarence, you can wait on me
hand and foot.

528
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,087
You can polish my shoes,
you can be my slave.

529
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,756
But, Clarence

530
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,719
it won't do you any good.

531
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:30,431
Because I'm not going to help you
with Aunt Susan. Get it?

532
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:31,974
But, Joe...

533
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,268
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.

534
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,562
You promised him
you'd go back to see him.

535
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,897
Why, it's like breaking
the word of honor

536
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:41,400
of the whole United States Navy.

537
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,278
Clarence

538
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:47,031
I'm not going back to that house!

539
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,418
Look, I get you a date with her,
it washes us up.

540
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:01,420
I don't owe you a thing, right?

541
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:04,923
Okay. Here, take all this stuff.

542
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,259
It'll make an impression.

543
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,847
Let me look at you.

544
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,021
Well, it'll have to do.

545
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:21,315
Now, try, will you?

546
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:23,984
- Hello, Aunt Susie.
- Why...

547
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:27,279
Hello. Won't you come in?

548
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:30,574
We promised Donald
we'd come back and, well...

549
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:33,369
Brooklyn spent the whole afternoon
getting him toys.

550
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:35,788
Oh, that's awfully kind of you.

551
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:38,624
- Let's put them over here, huh?
- Where's he hiding?

552
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,293
Donald? Oh, he's down in school.

553
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,671
Thanks to you,
he went almost willingly today.

554
00:40:43,837 --> 00:40:45,339
Oh, good.

555
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:49,677
Say, aren't you a little young
to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?

556
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:52,805
Well, I'm all the family he has.

557
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:56,183
His mother died when he was a baby,
and then his father.

558
00:40:56,392 --> 00:41:00,688
His father left us this house,
and that helps quite a lot.

559
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,940
You see, I work, and that keeps me

560
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:05,275
from being with Donald
as much as I'd like.

561
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:08,153
I never know when the studio
is going to call me.

562
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,074
- Gee, are you an actress?
- I wanna be a singer.

563
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:14,660
But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.

564
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:17,121
You ever get a chance
to do any singing?

565
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:20,457
No, but there are some
really great musicians.

566
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:24,545
There's Stokowski and José Iturbi and
people like that who work in pictures.

567
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,840
There's always a chance that
I might get to sing for one of them.

568
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,217
- Any luck so far?
- No.

569
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:34,638
That's awful. That's terrible.

570
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:36,890
Thank you, Clarence.

571
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,185
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.

572
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,398
Please forgive me, but I really
should run up and dress now.

573
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,276
I'm sorry you missed Donald,
he'll be disappointed.

574
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:51,572
Well, as a matter of fact, we didn't
come just to see Donald, we...

575
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:56,410
Clarence, I'm going to tell her
whether you like it or not.

576
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,746
Clarence didn't sleep all night,
you know.

577
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:02,166
And do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.

578
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,917
Why, Clarence.

579
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:07,588
I told him that you'd understand
how it is, getting to a strange town

580
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,298
when you've been away at sea.

581
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:11,967
"She'll understand," I said,
"how important it is

582
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:15,054
when you finally do get
a little leave, to meet someone..."

583
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,558
Clarence, do you wanna take me out?
Is that what all this is leading up to?

584
00:42:19,725 --> 00:42:22,936
- "She's a girl with a heart," I said...
- Well, I'd love to.

585
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:25,522
Honest?

586
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:30,402
I wish I could make it tonight,
but I'm busy.

587
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:32,321
- Boyfriend?
- Oh, no.

588
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:34,365
Just someone I met at the studio.

589
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:37,368
He should be here now,
so I really have to run up and dress.

590
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:39,828
You did mean what you said
about my calling you?

591
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:43,415
Well, of course. Any night that
you're free, you just give me a ring.

592
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:47,127
Goodbye.
And thank you again for Donald.

593
00:42:47,294 --> 00:42:48,921
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

594
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,885
You know, I bet she's not so bad.

595
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,262
Gee, I'm glad you like her.

596
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:00,391
I didn't say I liked her,
I said she wasn't bad.

597
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,435
Yeah, but coming from you.

598
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:46,520
Well, I guess if Aunt Susie likes him,
he must be okay.

599
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,898
Gee, that's a nice car, isn't it?

600
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:52,776
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Aren't you even worried?

601
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:56,322
Once she goes out with him,
she'll turn up her nose at any place we...

602
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:58,157
I mean, that you could take her to.

603
00:43:58,324 --> 00:44:01,535
Look, this means nothing to me,
I'm telling you for your own good.

604
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,496
Once she goes out with him,
brother, you're dead.

605
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:07,374
- Gee, you think so, Joe?
- Sure.

606
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:11,879
There isn't anything I can do about it.

607
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,175
Brooklyn, there's always something
you can do about everything.

608
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:17,801
Come on.

609
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,982
Did you want to see Ms. Abbott?

610
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:37,029
- She's upstairs dressing, I'll call her.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that, bud.

611
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:40,574
Susie hates to be bothered
when she's dressing.

612
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,292
Yeah, she hates it.

613
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:06,934
- Something wrong, jack?
- Oh, no. Nothing at all.

614
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:10,354
Well, then squat someplace, jack,
you're making me nervous.

615
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:21,156
My name is Bertram Kraler.

616
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:24,618
Bertram?

617
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,043
Are you good friends of Ms. Abbott's?

618
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:38,215
You might call it that.

619
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,555
- Are you?
- I just met her.

620
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:46,223
I'm taking her to dinner.

621
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,226
Maybe you know
what you're doing, Bertram

622
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:52,313
but I don't think
the boys will like it.

623
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,776
I beg your pardon? The boys?

624
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:03,073
The Navy. I don't think they're
gonna like Susie branching out this way.

625
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,493
But I don't quite...

626
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,912
Ms. Abbott knows
a great many Navy men?

627
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:14,877
Maybe some she doesn't know,
say a dozen or two maybe.

628
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:18,172
It's a funny thing.

629
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:20,716
You get onboard a new ship

630
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:25,054
don't know a soul,
kind of lonesome even.

631
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,517
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"

632
00:46:30,684 --> 00:46:33,270
And right away
everybody's talking about her.

633
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:36,899
You know, it's kind of homey,
if you see what I mean.

634
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:42,988
Yes. Yes, I do. But, well,
she seems such a quiet girl.

635
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,784
Susie? Quiet?

636
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,668
Well, that's not what the song says
when the boys sing about her.

637
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:57,795
They never even mention
the word "quiet."

638
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:00,631
They sing about her?
The Navy's got a song about her?

639
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:03,300
- Sure.
- I don't believe it.

640
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:08,138
- Well, okay.
- All right, let me hear it.

641
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:13,560
Well, I don't think you'd better, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors, see?

642
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:15,688
Yeah. Yeah, it's not
your type of a song.

643
00:47:15,854 --> 00:47:18,190
I insist on hearing it.

644
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,070
All right, Brooklyn,
if the man insists, let's play.

645
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:25,406
But, Joe, I don't think we ought to.

646
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:30,160
- Go ahead. Play that Susie song.
- Well, you start and I'll find you a key.

647
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:33,831
<i>If you knew Susie</i>
<i>Like we know Susie</i>

648
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:37,251
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

649
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:41,088
<i>She's not so choosy</i>
<i>No, not our Susie</i>

650
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:44,758
<i>- Oh, oh...</i>
<i>- Susie is a lollapaloozie</i>

651
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,680
<i>- When Susie kisses</i>
<i>- It never fails</i>

652
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:51,223
<i>When Susie kisses</i>

653
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,933
<i>She takes the wind</i>
<i>Right out of your sails</i>

654
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,145
<i>- So in conclusion</i>
<i>- Beware of Susion</i>

655
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:59,440
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

656
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:04,320
<i>S is for sincerity</i>

657
00:48:05,112 --> 00:48:07,489
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

658
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:11,869
<i>U is for you-know-what-l-mean</i>

659
00:48:12,453 --> 00:48:15,247
<i>- S is for...</i>
<i>- Sincerity</i>

660
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:19,668
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

661
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:25,382
<i>I is for the Irish in her smile</i>

662
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:34,016
<i>Her Irish smile</i>

663
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:39,355
<i>E is for her eagerness to please us</i>

664
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:41,523
<i>That is how she won her Navy E</i>

665
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:45,319
<i>Put them all together</i>

666
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:51,116
<i>They spell Susie</i>

667
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:54,495
<i>The sweetheart of the boys at sea</i>

668
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:57,414
<i>Oh, that Susie</i>
<i>She's a doozy</i>

669
00:48:57,581 --> 00:49:00,292
<i>She's not choosy</i>
<i>You won't lose-y</i>

670
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:03,337
<i>- Don't care who-sie</i>
<i>- I mean you-sie</i>

671
00:49:03,504 --> 00:49:06,674
<i>You'll get woozy</i>
<i>After just one date with Susie</i>

672
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,051
<i>When you take her home about 10</i>

673
00:49:09,218 --> 00:49:12,471
<i>Another gob is waiting there</i>
<i>To take our Susie out again</i>

674
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:15,182
<i>- So in conclusie</i>
<i>- Beware of Susie</i>

675
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:17,059
<i>She belongs to you and you and me</i>

676
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,268
<i>And the U.S. Navy</i>

677
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,980
<i>S, S-U, S-U-S</i>

678
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:27,403
<i>S- U-S-I, S-U-S-l-E</i>

679
00:49:29,446 --> 00:49:31,532
Well, well, well.

680
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:34,451
I don't know what's the matter
with him, do you, Brooklyn?

681
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:35,995
Yes, and I wish I didn't.

682
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:38,914
Will you please tell Ms. Abbott
that Mr. Kraler regrets...

683
00:49:39,081 --> 00:49:42,209
Regrets what?
What on earth is the matter?

684
00:49:43,836 --> 00:49:46,297
What are you two doing here?

685
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,342
Mr. Kraler regrets what?

686
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:52,636
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

687
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:56,056
Knowing your taste as I do now,
I'm sure the kind of evening

688
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,017
I'd planned wouldn't interest you.

689
00:49:58,183 --> 00:50:01,395
S-U-S, S-U...

690
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:03,439
But, Mr. Kraler, I...

691
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:09,361
What did you say to him?

692
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:11,864
- What difference does it make?
- I'd like to know.

693
00:50:12,031 --> 00:50:14,241
- What did you say to him?
- I kind of figured

694
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:17,828
you were stuck with him and...
It wasn't Brooklyn, really. It was me.

695
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,664
I don't understand why you think
I was stuck with him.

696
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:23,917
Well, I thought that you'd be glad
to get him off your hands.

697
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:27,630
- I thought you'd be grateful if I...
- And you thought I'd be grateful.

698
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:32,301
Well, yes, maybe, I...
I mean, if I were a dame and that...

699
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:36,305
If you were a dame and for one solid year
you'd been trying to get someplace

700
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:40,059
and you met a man whose mother
was in the philharmonic society

701
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:43,020
and who could introduce you
to very important people.

702
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:45,606
People like Iturbi. I mean

703
00:50:45,773 --> 00:50:49,068
I think this is the meanest
and the cruelest...

704
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:53,155
Don't cry. Please, don't cry.

705
00:50:57,326 --> 00:50:58,994
Aunt Susie.

706
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:02,414
- Oh, go away.
- No.

707
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:07,127
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush
Bertram off without your okay.

708
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,548
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

709
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,635
Oh, I know you didn't mean it

710
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:18,639
but it's just that
I might never get another chance.

711
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:29,942
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.

712
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:32,861
It's... Well, it's a surprise.

713
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:36,740
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
- Oh, he'd never tell you.

714
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:38,742
That's Clarence all over.

715
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:41,328
You know what he did
before he went into the Navy?

716
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:43,372
- He was the assistant...
- Joe!

717
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:45,207
Joe, remember what you promised me.

718
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:48,961
Okay. At least I can tell her
you were in music, can't I?

719
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:50,754
And he was a big shot too.

720
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:53,632
Why, when you went upstairs
to change, he said to me:

721
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:56,385
"You know, if meeting Iturbi
would do her any good

722
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:59,763
well, after all,
he's a friend of mine and..."

723
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,100
- He is, Clarence?
- They're pals.

724
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,395
As a matter of fact,
I once even heard Iturbi say:

725
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:10,357
"It is I who should be grateful
to you, Clarence."

726
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,861
Remember? At San Diego?

727
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:16,447
Well, you know what Clarence did?

728
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,993
He just went to the phone
and called his pal Iturbi

729
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,456
and arranged for you
to have an audition, that's all.

730
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,877
Oh, Clarence, you didn't.

731
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:33,505
Well, when...? When did he say?

732
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:37,301
- When?
- Go ahead, tell her when, Clarence.

733
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:42,056
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11:15.

734
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:44,058
Oh, Clarence.

735
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,479
I'm sorry.

736
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:53,484
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me and...

737
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,945
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?

738
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:58,030
- What does he...?
- Look, I've got an idea.

739
00:52:58,197 --> 00:52:59,531
No.

740
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:02,368
He has many things to tell you,
why don't you go out

741
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:04,119
have dinner and talk it over.

742
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:08,332
- I think that'd be a wonderful idea.
- Well, you come too.

743
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:09,833
- Please do, Joe.
- Look

744
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,920
you haven't got a thing to do
until 10:00, remember?

745
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,672
- Joe!
- Hiya, sailor.

746
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,549
You came! You came!

747
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:20,135
Don't tell me you've been
at school all this time?

748
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:25,683
Sure, I stayed to tell the teacher
what I had to study for the Navy.

749
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:27,810
She sure doesn't know much.

750
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:29,979
You mean you kept the teacher
until now?

751
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:32,648
- Of course. Hiya, Clarence.
- Hiya, Donald.

752
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,234
Come on, I'm gonna march you
over to Mrs. Murphy's.

753
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,944
- We're going out.
- I'll come too.

754
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:39,697
- Oh, no, you won't.
- But I gotta talk to Joe.

755
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,782
You can just talk to Joe
some other time.

756
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:44,493
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure. Sure.

757
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:46,287
Will you come in school to see me?

758
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:50,708
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay, it's a promise.

759
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,878
Come along, darling.

760
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,589
Hey, you dope.
You wanted a date with her, didn't you?

761
00:53:57,756 --> 00:54:00,426
Wanted to be alone?
What do you wanna drag me along for?

762
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:04,430
Because I don't know
what Iturbi said to me on the phone.

763
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:53,437
It's a wishing well.

764
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:56,565
Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.

765
00:54:57,858 --> 00:55:00,069
Thanks to you, I got my wish.

766
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:02,780
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?

767
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:06,784
You better play it safe.

768
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:19,546
Now it's your turn.

769
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:23,592
No, no, not me. I got a theory called
"Wishing Don't Make It So."

770
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:26,845
You decide what you want
and then you go out and get it.

771
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:29,014
Come on.

772
00:55:33,018 --> 00:55:36,563
- Oh, no, not again enchiladas.
- What else?

773
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,149
Enchiladas for all of us
and all the trimmings.

774
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:40,985
All right.

775
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:45,364
- Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- But you can't spend your money on us.

776
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:47,741
- I'm not.
- What are you gonna do? Wash dishes?

777
00:55:47,908 --> 00:55:49,952
- Polish the silver?
- Scrub the floors?

778
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,872
That sounds reasonable.
Now, listen, you stay right here

779
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:56,709
and no matter what happens, be brave.

780
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:01,213
- You're all set, I'm gonna go.
- You can't leave me alone.

781
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,716
How are you gonna get to know her
if you're never alone with her?

782
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:05,801
Besides, I wanna phone Lola.

783
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,848
We have Ms. Susan Abbott
to sing for you.

784
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,544
<i>Jealousy</i>

785
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:44,298
<i>You constantly hurt me</i>

786
00:56:44,465 --> 00:56:48,010
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>

787
00:56:48,177 --> 00:56:52,264
<i>If this spell that I'm under</i>

788
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:56,226
<i>Can only be a melody</i>

789
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:59,980
<i>For I know no one but me</i>

790
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:03,400
<i>Has won your heart</i>

791
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:09,198
<i>But when the music starts</i>

792
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:11,742
<i>My peace departs</i>

793
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:17,957
<i>From the moment they play</i>
<i>That languorous strain</i>

794
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:21,377
<i>And we surrender</i>

795
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:25,464
<i>To all its charm once again</i>

796
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:28,717
<i>This jealousy</i>

797
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:32,972
<i>That tortures me</i>

798
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,892
<i>Is ecstasy</i>

799
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:42,481
<i>Mysterious pain</i>

800
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:48,821
<i>We dance to a tango of love</i>

801
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:55,953
<i>Your heart beats with mine</i>
<i>As we sway</i>

802
00:57:56,328 --> 00:58:02,209
<i>Your eyes give the answer</i>
<i>I'm dreaming of</i>

803
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:06,964
<i>That soft word</i>
<i>Your cruel lips</i>

804
00:58:07,131 --> 00:58:12,052
<i>Will never say</i>

805
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:18,267
<i>I fear that the music will end</i>

806
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:25,274
<i>And shatter the spell it may lend</i>

807
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:29,028
<i>To make me believe</i>

808
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:33,282
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

809
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:40,372
<i>And it's only the tango you love</i>

810
00:58:59,183 --> 00:59:03,270
<i>To make me believe</i>

811
00:59:03,437 --> 00:59:08,275
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

812
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:13,739
<i>And it's only the tango</i>

813
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:20,829
<i>You love</i>

814
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:33,217
- Where is the phone?
- Oh, right up here.

815
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:37,096
Gee, I thought
you were wonderful, honest.

816
00:59:37,596 --> 00:59:39,181
Joe went to make a phone call.

817
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,350
- He's a busy guy.
- He is?

818
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:43,560
He's the biggest wolf
in the whole Navy.

819
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:46,355
Yeah, they call him the sea wolf.

820
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:49,650
Well, that's what they call him.

821
00:59:50,985 --> 00:59:55,281
Clarence, do you realize
that I don't know anything about you?

822
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:58,534
I mean, other than you're very nice

823
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:01,453
but tell me about yourself.

824
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,207
I'm fine.

825
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:09,461
Well, what sort of work
do you do in the Navy?

826
01:00:10,004 --> 01:00:13,757
- Gun crew.
- Is it interesting?

827
01:00:14,216 --> 01:00:16,218
It's keen.

828
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:35,654
- Well, we missed you.
- Susita

829
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:39,408
it was not bad this time.
It was great.

830
01:00:39,575 --> 01:00:41,285
Well, I have wonderful news for you.

831
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:44,997
Guess for whom I'm going to sing
this Saturday morning at 11:15.

832
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:48,834
José Iturbi. The José Iturbi.

833
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:52,296
- No.
- Yes.

834
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:56,258
Clarence is one of his best friends,
and he arranged it for me.

835
01:00:56,467 --> 01:01:00,512
Wait, I must run. I must tell Mama.
I must tell Pedro. I must tell Manuel.

836
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:03,182
- I must tell everybody.
- But it's only an audition...

837
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,685
It's no use, it'll be all over
the street in five minutes.

838
01:01:08,896 --> 01:01:10,939
Susan, you think
you ought to tell people?

839
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:12,775
I know you have a wonderful voice...

840
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:15,569
Yeah, but what if everything
didn't go just right?

841
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:19,448
Well, you've given me the opportunity,
and I want everyone to know about it.

842
01:01:19,657 --> 01:01:24,453
If I fail, it's... Well, it's right
that they should know that too.

843
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,206
Yeah, I guess she's right.

844
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:31,126
Say, Clarence,
why don't you dance with Susan.

845
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:37,007
Sure. Do you wanna?
I mean, I'd like to if you'd like to.

846
01:01:37,174 --> 01:01:38,509
I'd love to.

847
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:51,438
I only know how to waltz

848
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:53,816
and this isn't a...

849
01:01:55,234 --> 01:01:59,196
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.

850
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:21,218
You know, you're a strange team,
you two.

851
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:24,638
Clarence is so shy

852
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:26,598
and you're so...

853
01:02:28,017 --> 01:02:31,812
Well, you're a sea wolf.
Clarence told me you were.

854
01:02:37,776 --> 01:02:41,030
Yeah, well,
dames are plenty crazy about him.

855
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:42,823
Nice dames, that is.

856
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,327
And not about you?
Nice dames, that is.

857
01:02:46,493 --> 01:02:50,664
Well, I'm an altogether different
kind of a guy. You know, I...

858
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:53,876
Well, I'm never serious about things

859
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:57,004
but, well, Clarence,
he's always on the level.

860
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:07,014
All right, all right,
I know I should have tried, but I didn't.

861
01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:12,061
Okay, so I'm a coward.

862
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,106
I don't know why, you tell me.

863
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:20,903
Gee whiz, why do I freeze
when she looks at me?

864
01:03:21,236 --> 01:03:24,323
What makes people act this way
about people?

865
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,035
What makes anything?

866
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:32,915
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

867
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:36,669
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

868
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:40,339
<i>What makes the tide</i>
<i>Remember to hide</i>

869
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:43,884
<i>And why does it soon rise?</i>

870
01:03:44,969 --> 01:03:48,555
<i>What makes a star fall?</i>

871
01:03:48,764 --> 01:03:51,976
<i>Where does it fall to?</i>

872
01:03:52,476 --> 01:03:56,563
<i>Why does its flight</i>
<i>Make us stop in the night</i>

873
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:00,192
<i>And wish as we all do?</i>

874
01:04:00,943 --> 01:04:08,867
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

875
01:04:11,036 --> 01:04:17,876
<i>What makes the sky so blue?</i>

876
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:22,423
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

877
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:26,218
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

878
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:30,139
<i>Is it my love</i>

879
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:34,435
<i>For you?</i>

880
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:47,656
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

881
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,748
<i>And what makes the sky so blue?</i>

882
01:04:57,583 --> 01:05:01,462
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

883
01:05:02,046 --> 01:05:05,424
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

884
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:08,969
<i>Is it my love</i>

885
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:16,226
<i>For you?</i>

886
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:30,032
Gee, you sing just like a bird.

887
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:33,160
- Brooklyn!
- Yeah, how do you know?

888
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:37,081
- Flatbush.
- Go on. Greenpoint.

889
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:40,334
- How do you like that?
- How do you like that?

890
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:43,379
Imagine meeting a dame
all the way from Brooklyn.

891
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:46,882
Ain't it a small world?
Like my old lady used to say.

892
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:51,303
Hey, mister, you better sit down, huh?
The manager.

893
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:56,767
- Gee, are you all alone?
- No, I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.

894
01:06:01,146 --> 01:06:03,649
Oh, he's my best friend.

895
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:07,945
Okay, maybe you know what you're doing.

896
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:12,950
She's a swell one, all right, that girl.
And what a voice.

897
01:06:13,284 --> 01:06:15,744
Yeah, she's wonderful.

898
01:06:15,953 --> 01:06:18,455
She's just about the loveliest...

899
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:21,834
Only, you know something?
I can never talk to her.

900
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:24,837
I can never talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.

901
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:27,923
What's the matter with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?

902
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,717
Oh, you...

903
01:06:29,883 --> 01:06:32,845
Oh, I mean... I mean, you're different.
You're from Brooklyn.

904
01:06:33,095 --> 01:06:36,181
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

905
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,603
Most girls are so easy
to figure out, see?

906
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:45,941
- They are?
- Yeah, but you are...

907
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:50,029
One time you look kind of as if
you knew all the answers

908
01:06:50,237 --> 01:06:54,158
and then 10 minutes later
you're just like a little kid.

909
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:57,536
Just when a guy starts thinking
he ought to buy you a doll

910
01:06:57,703 --> 01:06:59,747
or an ice cream cone or something

911
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:03,959
then all of a sudden
you're all grown up again.

912
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:06,920
I am?

913
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:09,423
Yeah.

914
01:07:10,883 --> 01:07:16,138
And everything gets all kind of
mixed up and interesting.

915
01:07:21,644 --> 01:07:24,730
I mean... Well, that's what Clarence
said about you.

916
01:07:24,897 --> 01:07:28,025
You know,
he thinks about you all the time.

917
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:30,027
He does?

918
01:07:31,695 --> 01:07:33,197
Yeah.

919
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,991
Yeah.

920
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:37,868
All the time.

921
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:09,191
I guess I'll be seeing you again
tomorrow night at the restaurant?

922
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,446
- If you don't mind going back there.
- Oh, I don't mind. It's a swell place.

923
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:17,616
Well.

924
01:08:17,866 --> 01:08:19,576
Well.

925
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,956
It's been a lovely evening

926
01:08:24,164 --> 01:08:27,126
and I don't know when
I've been so happy.

927
01:08:34,383 --> 01:08:36,176
Good night.

928
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,685
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She's never been so happy.

929
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:47,062
Yeah, and if you stop to think
for a minute

930
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:49,565
maybe you'll figure out why.

931
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,862
- You mean Iturbi?
- Yeah.

932
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:58,073
Why shouldn't she be happy,
with that big, beautiful audition

933
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,575
you fixed coming up?

934
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,563
<i>All of a sudden my heart sings</i>

935
01:09:29,813 --> 01:09:33,776
<i>When I remember little things</i>

936
01:09:34,068 --> 01:09:37,947
<i>The way you dance</i>
<i>And hold me tight</i>

937
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:43,202
<i>The way you kiss</i>
<i>And say good night</i>

938
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:47,790
<i>The crazy things we say and do</i>

939
01:09:47,998 --> 01:09:51,877
<i>How fun it is to be with you</i>

940
01:09:52,628 --> 01:09:57,841
<i>The magic thrill</i>
<i>That's in your touch</i>

941
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:03,681
<i>Oh, darling, I love you so much</i>

942
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:08,519
<i>The secret way you press my hand</i>

943
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:13,482
<i>To let me know you understand</i>

944
01:10:13,691 --> 01:10:18,237
<i>The wind and rain upon your face</i>

945
01:10:18,737 --> 01:10:24,285
<i>The breathless world</i>
<i>Of your embrace</i>

946
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:29,873
<i>Your little laugh and half-surprise</i>

947
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:36,547
<i>The starlight gleaming in your eyes</i>

948
01:10:36,714 --> 01:10:42,845
<i>Remembering all those little things</i>

949
01:10:44,221 --> 01:10:45,723
<i>All of a sudden</i>

950
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:53,272
<i>My heart sings</i>

951
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:09,204
Yes, Mr. Banick, I understand.

952
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:13,584
You've gotta have a pass
to get in, sailor.

953
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:18,881
I'll take care of that right away,
Mr. Banick. Yes, sir.

954
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:26,430
- Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.

955
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:30,476
- Well, I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?

956
01:11:30,893 --> 01:11:34,438
- Well, not exactly.
- Well, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.

957
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:43,155
I gotta talk to him. It's important.
Even just for a minute, can't you?

958
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:47,117
Really, there's nothing I can do. He's
very busy. He's on the stage, recording.

959
01:11:49,745 --> 01:11:52,247
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.

960
01:11:52,665 --> 01:11:55,584
- Roll it, Jim, please.
- Speed.

961
01:14:37,997 --> 01:14:41,625
So the admiral went up on deck,
said to him, he said, "Gunner's Mate

962
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:44,753
Second Class Joe Brady,
what do you think we should do?"

963
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:48,173
So Joe said, "Well, sir..."
Because even in a battle

964
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,843
if you talk to an admiral,
you have to say "sir."

965
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,596
So Joe said...
Joe! Come on, kids, it's Joe.

966
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:56,098
Hi.

967
01:14:56,265 --> 01:14:59,977
- I was just telling them about you.
- Yeah, so I heard.

968
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:03,355
- Where's Aunt Susie? I thought she...
- She had to go to the studio.

969
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:07,818
Listen, Joe, I told the kids you'd tell us
all about your adventures.

970
01:15:10,112 --> 01:15:12,740
Oh, look, I... Honest...

971
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:14,992
All right, all right.
Sit down, sit down.

972
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:17,119
Oh, boy.

973
01:15:19,496 --> 01:15:21,999
Tell us how you got your medal.

974
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:25,336
All right,
I'll tell you how I got my medal.

975
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:27,421
Now, close your eyes

976
01:15:28,464 --> 01:15:32,718
and try to imagine the most
beautiful day you've ever seen.

977
01:15:32,841 --> 01:15:35,552
The greenest grass
and the singing-est birds

978
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:38,763
and the shining-est sun.
Can you see it?

979
01:15:38,972 --> 01:15:40,307
Yeah.

980
01:15:40,473 --> 01:15:44,811
Good. Now, try to imagine me there,
walking along, playing a tin whistle

981
01:15:44,978 --> 01:15:47,522
just as happy as can be.
Do you see me?

982
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:49,316
Yeah.

983
01:15:49,482 --> 01:15:53,069
Good. Of course,
I was in the Pomeranian navy then

984
01:15:53,236 --> 01:15:55,655
<i>and we wore white suits.</i>

985
01:15:55,864 --> 01:16:00,493
<i>With blue stripes and a white hat</i>
<i>with a little red ball on top.</i>

986
01:16:02,662 --> 01:16:06,708
<i>Oh, I was so happy</i>
<i>that I ran and jumped</i>

987
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:11,630
<i>and leaped and played,</i>
<i>just for the fun of it.</i>

988
01:16:13,214 --> 01:16:15,550
<i>My, I felt good.</i>

989
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,638
<i>It was such a wonderful, wonderful day.</i>

990
01:16:19,846 --> 01:16:23,141
<i>When all of a sudden</i>
<i>I stepped into a big hole and fell</i>

991
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,226
<i>right to the bottom of it.</i>

992
01:16:29,648 --> 01:16:32,359
<i>I seemed to be in a long tunnel.</i>

993
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:36,988
<i>Way ahead, I could see light,</i>
<i>so I started towards it.</i>

994
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:45,080
<i>Finally, I reached the end</i>
<i>and found myself in a strange land.</i>

995
01:16:45,246 --> 01:16:46,706
<i>It looked...</i>

996
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:50,794
<i>Well, it looked just like a page</i>
<i>out of a storybook</i>

997
01:16:51,503 --> 01:16:54,589
<i>and everything was hushed and still</i>

998
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:59,302
<i>like your room at night</i>
<i>after you've gone to sleep.</i>

999
01:17:06,393 --> 01:17:08,687
Hello!

1000
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:10,939
Hello!

1001
01:17:11,147 --> 01:17:14,567
Hello!

1002
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:18,905
Is anybody here?

1003
01:17:44,598 --> 01:17:45,932
No music?

1004
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:49,978
I can't sing if I want to?

1005
01:17:57,694 --> 01:17:59,446
Can I dance?

1006
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:11,625
- It's a law. It's a law. It's a law.
- It's a terrible law.

1007
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:18,006
<i>I'll sing and dance whenever I will</i>
<i>No law on Earth can keep me still</i>

1008
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:28,516
Young man, there is such a law.

1009
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:32,604
Our king forbids us to sing and dance.

1010
01:18:32,812 --> 01:18:36,191
Wait. Where dwells
this monster of a king

1011
01:18:36,358 --> 01:18:38,735
whose people may not dance and sing?

1012
01:18:38,902 --> 01:18:43,323
In yonder castle,
but none can reach him.

1013
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:53,291
<i>Trust in me, my honored friend</i>
<i>I'll bring your sadness to an end</i>

1014
01:19:25,907 --> 01:19:28,785
- Hello.
- Hello. Who are you?

1015
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:33,373
- What are you doing here?
- Just a sailor come a-visiting.

1016
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,874
Why are you sad?

1017
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,376
- I'm not sad.
- Yes, you are.

1018
01:19:36,543 --> 01:19:37,586
- I am not.
- You are so.

1019
01:19:37,752 --> 01:19:39,170
- Not.
- Yes, you are.

1020
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:41,506
I'm lonesome.

1021
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:44,676
Well, you deserve to be lonesome.

1022
01:19:44,884 --> 01:19:47,345
Lonesome's too good for you.

1023
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,600
Passing a law like that,
not letting people sing and dance

1024
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:53,935
- aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- I had to.

1025
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:57,397
- What do you mean you had to?
- Well...

1026
01:19:58,273 --> 01:20:02,569
A king's gotta do everything
his subjects do, see? Only better.

1027
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:09,451
Well, I can't sing and I can't dance,
so there had to be a law. I had to.

1028
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:13,496
You can so sing and dance.
Anybody can.

1029
01:20:13,663 --> 01:20:17,667
Well, not anybody that's cranky
and gloomy and grumpy.

1030
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:22,422
But anybody whose heart is big
and warm and happy, they can.

1031
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:26,760
Go on. Try it, just for a minute.
Try being happy.

1032
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:29,179
<i>If you worry, if you worry</i>

1033
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:31,556
- <i>If you bother your head</i>
- I do.

1034
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:33,892
<i>It won't help you, it won't help you</i>

1035
01:20:34,059 --> 01:20:36,102
- <i>It will hurt you instead</i>
- It will?

1036
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:38,521
<i>Grouchers, groaners</i>
<i>Cranks and moaners</i>

1037
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:40,690
- <i>They're so unfair</i>
- I know.

1038
01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:45,028
<i>If you can't be gay and merry</i>
<i>Lock yourself in solitary</i>

1039
01:20:45,236 --> 01:20:47,405
<i>Though it hurts you</i>
<i>Though it hurts you</i>

1040
01:20:47,572 --> 01:20:49,449
<i>Be a pleasanter guy</i>

1041
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:51,826
<i>You may even learn to like it</i>

1042
01:20:51,993 --> 01:20:54,079
- <i>If you give it a try</i>
- I'll try.

1043
01:20:54,245 --> 01:20:57,707
<i>You could laugh and sing and dance</i>
<i>As gaily as an elf</i>

1044
01:20:57,874 --> 01:21:02,337
<i>But don't expect to get much help</i>
<i>If you don't help yourself</i>

1045
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:04,631
- Will you try?
- If you show me.

1046
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:06,466
- I'll show you.
- I'll try.

1047
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:08,009
Good. One, two, three, four.

1048
01:21:08,176 --> 01:21:10,095
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three.

1049
01:21:10,262 --> 01:21:11,596
One, two, three.

1050
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:15,934
- You see?
- It's easy.

1051
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:51,529
Look at me. I'm dancing.

1052
01:23:24,062 --> 01:23:28,650
- That's a beautiful story.
- And that's how I got my medal.

1053
01:23:32,237 --> 01:23:35,156
I'm sorry, recess is over.

1054
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:40,537
Goodbye.

1055
01:23:41,788 --> 01:23:43,206
Joe? Joe?

1056
01:23:43,373 --> 01:23:45,292
What would you like most for a present?

1057
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:49,879
Well, don't tell Aunt Susie
I told you, now, because it's a secret

1058
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,174
and she said that you and Clarence
fixed it up with a man

1059
01:23:53,383 --> 01:23:55,802
for her to get a new job
and make lots of money.

1060
01:23:55,969 --> 01:23:59,306
So she's gonna buy us all the most
wonderful presents in the world.

1061
01:23:59,472 --> 01:24:04,060
Joe, what would you rather have
than anything?

1062
01:24:04,853 --> 01:24:07,522
Well, I'll sort of think it over
and let you know.

1063
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:10,317
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you, now.

1064
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,694
No, no, I won't.

1065
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:20,452
- Hiya, Brooklyn.
- Hello.

1066
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:23,079
Joe. Am I glad to see you.

1067
01:24:23,246 --> 01:24:25,332
Never mind about me.
What about you?

1068
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:28,168
I got a feeling you didn't
get in to see Iturbi.

1069
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,837
We're sunk.
I can't get through that gate.

1070
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:33,548
What do you mean you can't?

1071
01:24:34,507 --> 01:24:37,427
Look, Joe, honest.
I've tried and tried, but it's no use.

1072
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:40,263
You have to have an appointment
or something.

1073
01:24:42,474 --> 01:24:44,184
- Hello.
- Yes?

1074
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:46,978
My name is Joe Brady,
I'd like to see José Iturbi.

1075
01:24:47,145 --> 01:24:49,606
- Is he expecting you?
- Yes.

1076
01:24:49,773 --> 01:24:52,275
Just a minute
and I'll let you talk to his secretary.

1077
01:24:52,442 --> 01:24:54,402
Thank you very much.

1078
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:59,699
Hello, Jean. A Mr. Brady
from the United States Navy

1079
01:24:59,866 --> 01:25:02,118
to see Mr. Iturbi,
says he's expected.

1080
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:06,456
Gee, I don't know, Joe.

1081
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:09,843
Sometimes when I watch you,
I feel that something's wrong with me.

1082
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:13,255
Look, Brooklyn, you just gotta learn
not to get scared, that's all.

1083
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:18,927
Hey, you! You, stop.
Wait a minute.

1084
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:23,807
Hey, I got a pass.
Brooklyn, I got a pass!

1085
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:25,976
Wait a minute. Stop.

1086
01:25:26,142 --> 01:25:29,145
Now, wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

1087
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:32,440
- Stop.
- Brooklyn!

1088
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:48,248
- I guess everybody's out.
- Okay, let's go.

1089
01:25:54,379 --> 01:25:57,048
Pardon me, can you tell me
where Mr. Iturbi's office is?

1090
01:25:57,215 --> 01:26:00,051
- Sure, right over there.
- Thanks.

1091
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:16,192
Mr. Brady?

1092
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:19,195
I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.
Won't you sit down?

1093
01:26:19,362 --> 01:26:20,864
Thanks.

1094
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:26,202
- Have you been at sea recently?
- Yeah, I'm on leave.

1095
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:29,247
I suppose you're having
a wonderful time.

1096
01:26:29,956 --> 01:26:32,709
My name is Susan Abbott
and someone made an appointment

1097
01:26:32,959 --> 01:26:35,879
for me to have an audition
with Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...

1098
01:26:36,046 --> 01:26:40,008
- Ever speak to sailors, lady?
- Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?

1099
01:26:40,216 --> 01:26:43,803
Clarence is off having a little chat
with José and I was waiting for him.

1100
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,472
We can go out and have a Coke.

1101
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:47,599
- I was just...
- Ms. Abbott, I'm afraid...

1102
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:51,061
Hold on, that's all right, Jean.
Tell Mr. Iturbi she'll be back.

1103
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:53,438
- But Mr. Iturbi...
- Don't worry, I'll be back.

1104
01:26:53,605 --> 01:26:55,357
Tell him to wait for me.

1105
01:26:57,859 --> 01:27:00,528
Aunt Susie, you almost made
a terrible mistake.

1106
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:03,448
I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi
if there was any song

1107
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:05,617
that I should prepare for the audition.

1108
01:27:05,784 --> 01:27:07,869
That's just what I thought you wanted.

1109
01:27:08,036 --> 01:27:10,205
Boy, am I glad I was there to stop you.

1110
01:27:10,413 --> 01:27:12,582
Believe me, Aunt Susie,
take my word for it.

1111
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:16,753
You shouldn't go even near that guy
until the very minute you're ready.

1112
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:18,463
But, Joe, why?

1113
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:22,676
Well, look, you go see him now,
you try to talk to him.

1114
01:27:22,842 --> 01:27:25,804
He's polite, but he's busy.
It's just no good.

1115
01:27:26,012 --> 01:27:28,807
But you wait till Saturday
at 11:15

1116
01:27:28,974 --> 01:27:31,726
Iturbi is expecting one
of these big, beefy characters.

1117
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:35,105
Instead, you walk in.
You're all dressed up.

1118
01:27:35,272 --> 01:27:36,982
You look like a million dollars.

1119
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:41,361
Go, Aunt Susie.
Believe me, you'll kill him, huh?

1120
01:27:41,528 --> 01:27:43,446
Come on, sailor, I owe you a Coke.

1121
01:27:45,323 --> 01:27:48,493
You're sort of Clarence's
guardian angel too, aren't you?

1122
01:27:48,618 --> 01:27:50,078
What I mean is...

1123
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:54,666
Well, you're always with him
or talking about him. Why, Joe?

1124
01:27:54,874 --> 01:27:58,837
Well, I... I figured he needed a girl

1125
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:02,090
but Clarence didn't want just any girl

1126
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:05,844
he wanted somebody
he could think about and write to

1127
01:28:06,303 --> 01:28:07,971
and, you know, come home to.

1128
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,851
I guess he found her, huh?

1129
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:16,062
What about you, Joe?
What do you want?

1130
01:28:16,271 --> 01:28:19,107
- Me?
- What kind of girl do you like?

1131
01:28:19,316 --> 01:28:21,026
Why?

1132
01:28:21,234 --> 01:28:23,862
I guess I'm just curious.

1133
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:28,575
Well, the kind of girl I like
is a very definite kind of a girl.

1134
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:31,244
Take for example
the one I know here in Los Angeles.

1135
01:28:31,411 --> 01:28:34,539
- You mean Lola.
- How...?

1136
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:39,961
Well, yeah. Take her, then.

1137
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:42,589
Nothing serious about her...

1138
01:28:43,632 --> 01:28:47,052
I mean, nothing serious,
strictly for laughs.

1139
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:50,472
She sees you, great. If she doesn't,
great, she'll find somebody

1140
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,557
it doesn't tie you down at all.

1141
01:28:52,724 --> 01:28:54,059
I see.

1142
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:56,811
You don't want to be tied down, do you?

1143
01:28:57,062 --> 01:29:00,941
That's for guys like Clarence.
Nice guys.

1144
01:29:01,107 --> 01:29:02,984
What I like is...

1145
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,236
Yes, what do you like?

1146
01:29:06,988 --> 01:29:08,531
Oh, I don't know, Aunt Susie.

1147
01:29:08,698 --> 01:29:12,077
Right now I'm a little confused
about what I like, it's...

1148
01:29:12,285 --> 01:29:15,872
- I have a feeling that everything is...
- Yes?

1149
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:18,458
Back on the set, kids, let's go.
Come on, Susie.

1150
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:21,127
Everybody works in the next shot,
come on.

1151
01:29:21,336 --> 01:29:23,797
Joe, why don't you come down
to the café tonight.

1152
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:25,799
You could bring your girl, you know.

1153
01:29:25,966 --> 01:29:28,802
Well, maybe Clarence
would like to see you alone.

1154
01:29:30,512 --> 01:29:32,138
All right.

1155
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:44,776
Call the Victory Committee
and tell them I'll be at the camp.

1156
01:29:44,943 --> 01:29:47,153
But, Mr. Iturbi,
you have to be at the studio.

1157
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,240
- How are you gonna get to the camp?
- I'll be able to make it.

1158
01:29:50,407 --> 01:29:53,076
Please tell them not to expect me
until the last minute.

1159
01:29:53,243 --> 01:29:55,912
Remember, later on you have
an appointment with Carlos.

1160
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:58,832
Yes, I remember. I'll be there.
And I'll be there on time.

1161
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:01,668
Please, stop worrying.
Give me the Tchaikovsky concerto.

1162
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:04,004
Go and get yourself
a double chocolate sundae.

1163
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,006
- Your next appointment...
- With walnuts.

1164
01:30:06,172 --> 01:30:07,507
With walnuts.

1165
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:54,930
Again?

1166
01:31:20,497 --> 01:31:22,582
- Hello.
- Hello.

1167
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:26,670
- Ahoy.
- Oh, I'm doing fine. Fine.

1168
01:31:32,592 --> 01:31:35,637
You tune pianos or play them?

1169
01:31:35,804 --> 01:31:37,722
A little bit of both.

1170
01:31:51,152 --> 01:31:53,863
Hey, buddy. Hey, I know that song.

1171
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:55,782
- Oh, you do, huh?
- Sure.

1172
01:31:55,949 --> 01:32:01,663
<i>Tonight we love while the moon beams</i>
<i>Down in dreamland</i>

1173
01:32:01,913 --> 01:32:06,293
<i>Tonight we touch the stars</i>
<i>Love was ours</i>

1174
01:32:07,252 --> 01:32:10,839
- Oh, sure, I like that.
- You like Tchaikovsky?

1175
01:32:11,047 --> 01:32:13,300
- Who?
- Tchaikovsky, the composer.

1176
01:32:13,466 --> 01:32:16,011
You must be mistaken, buddy.
Freddy Martin wrote that.

1177
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,972
I heard it on the radio
at least a thousand times.

1178
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:22,601
Well, you know, all those fellows,
they steal from each other.

1179
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:25,895
<i>Meant to borrow</i>
<i>But tomorrow</i>

1180
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:28,523
<i>I forgot the words</i>

1181
01:32:32,652 --> 01:32:35,405
- Yeah, that's nice.
- I'm glad you like it.

1182
01:32:35,614 --> 01:32:37,866
Say, do you know
what I would do if I were you?

1183
01:32:38,033 --> 01:32:41,411
I'd quit this piano tuning,
ain't no future in it.

1184
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:43,705
- You play very well.
- Thank you.

1185
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:47,000
It's very nice to be encouraged.
You seem pretty good yourself.

1186
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:49,461
- Thank you.
- Well, I got to go now.

1187
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:51,296
I have a few more pianos to tune.

1188
01:33:07,228 --> 01:33:08,939
Well, goodbye, sailor. Thanks again.

1189
01:33:09,105 --> 01:33:10,982
- Keep plugging.
- Okay.

1190
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:24,788
Senor Clarence, friend of Susita.

1191
01:33:24,996 --> 01:33:26,665
Senor Clarence.

1192
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:30,669
The whole street is talking
of what you are doing for our Susita.

1193
01:33:30,835 --> 01:33:32,629
Yeah. I got a date with her.

1194
01:33:32,796 --> 01:33:36,508
Oh, how happy she will be
to see you. Come.

1195
01:33:36,758 --> 01:33:39,052
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

1196
01:33:39,261 --> 01:33:42,931
But I must rush
and tell her that you are here.

1197
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,644
Senor Iturbi. He is well, yes?

1198
01:33:47,852 --> 01:33:49,938
Oh, sure. Sure, he's well.

1199
01:33:56,194 --> 01:33:58,363
Well, for heaven's sakes,
look who's here

1200
01:33:58,571 --> 01:34:01,116
- and looking like he's at a wake.
- Hiya, Brooklyn.

1201
01:34:01,283 --> 01:34:02,867
Yeah, I got a date with Susan.

1202
01:34:03,034 --> 01:34:07,998
- What's the matter? Don't you like her?
- Sure, I like her. I think she's wonderful.

1203
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:12,294
Only, I'm gonna be all alone with her.
And I'll sit here like a dope, I know it.

1204
01:34:12,502 --> 01:34:15,630
- I won't even know what to say.
- What are you worrying about?

1205
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:17,465
The first note I heard you sing

1206
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:20,051
I knew you were
the romantical-type fella.

1207
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,763
Quit your kidding. Think I'm just gonna
walk up to her and start singing?

1208
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:27,726
Of course you don't just walk up to her
and start singing. Look.

1209
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:32,230
I'm her.

1210
01:34:32,772 --> 01:34:37,110
I'm just finishing dinner,
toying with my coffee.

1211
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:41,364
The fellas are beating
their brains out playing soft music.

1212
01:34:42,282 --> 01:34:43,783
I'm looking at you

1213
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:46,578
you're looking at me.

1214
01:34:47,329 --> 01:34:49,664
Okay, take it.

1215
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,751
Gee, you're swell.

1216
01:34:54,002 --> 01:34:56,463
Gee, thanks.

1217
01:34:58,089 --> 01:35:01,176
That's right, that's the way.

1218
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:12,020
<i>The charm of you</i>

1219
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:15,565
<i>Is comparable to</i>

1220
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:21,404
<i>A Christmas tree with toys</i>

1221
01:35:23,114 --> 01:35:26,743
<i>With little girls and boys</i>

1222
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:31,122
<i>When first they see</i>

1223
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:34,501
<i>The tree</i>

1224
01:35:34,876 --> 01:35:38,672
<i>The thrill of you</i>

1225
01:35:38,838 --> 01:35:41,716
<i>Is comparable to</i>

1226
01:35:43,009 --> 01:35:48,181
<i>The thrill I felt when I</i>

1227
01:35:48,807 --> 01:35:54,479
<i>First learned the heart could sigh</i>

1228
01:35:55,689 --> 01:36:01,569
<i>And you were the reason why</i>

1229
01:36:02,529 --> 01:36:08,493
<i>And yet, and yet</i>

1230
01:36:09,452 --> 01:36:16,293
<i>If we two had never met</i>

1231
01:36:16,501 --> 01:36:23,174
<i>I'd know your grace</i>
<i>That warms the face</i>

1232
01:36:24,759 --> 01:36:29,764
<i>That only the angels get</i>

1233
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:35,895
<i>And so comparing you</i>

1234
01:36:37,022 --> 01:36:41,901
<i>With all of these things is all</i>

1235
01:36:42,068 --> 01:36:46,865
<i>That I can do</i>

1236
01:36:48,617 --> 01:36:54,998
<i>Because they add up to</i>

1237
01:36:56,082 --> 01:37:02,839
<i>The charm of you</i>

1238
01:37:10,388 --> 01:37:12,807
Gee, I'd give a month's tips

1239
01:37:12,974 --> 01:37:16,019
to have somebody sing
words like that to me.

1240
01:37:16,227 --> 01:37:19,606
Somebody will, Brooklyn.
What do you bet?

1241
01:37:19,814 --> 01:37:23,360
Some girls, when a fella comes
to see her, he brings flowers

1242
01:37:23,526 --> 01:37:27,030
orchids even.
I'm the other type girl.

1243
01:37:27,197 --> 01:37:32,911
Me, a fella brings four bottles of beer.
What's the sense of kidding myself?

1244
01:37:33,078 --> 01:37:36,581
What are you talking yourself down for?
You're a terrific girl.

1245
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:38,583
Oh, go on.

1246
01:37:44,756 --> 01:37:48,051
- I'd better get working.
- Hey, Brooklyn. Hey, I think you're...

1247
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:51,554
Oh, hello, Clarence.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

1248
01:37:51,805 --> 01:37:54,766
- Well, I...
- What did you say?

1249
01:37:55,016 --> 01:37:57,394
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say a word.

1250
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,896
Did you have a nice time
with Mr. Iturbi today?

1251
01:38:00,772 --> 01:38:04,276
I... I saw Joe at the studio
and he said you were there.

1252
01:38:05,318 --> 01:38:07,404
You know, Clarence

1253
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:11,366
I feel as though Saturday
will never come. I can hardly wait.

1254
01:38:11,574 --> 01:38:13,368
Well, it's natural, I guess.

1255
01:38:13,618 --> 01:38:15,036
Until I'm doing it, I...

1256
01:38:15,245 --> 01:38:19,708
I just can't believe that
I'm really going to sing for Mr. Iturbi.

1257
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:22,460
Susan, look,
there's something I've got to tell you.

1258
01:38:22,627 --> 01:38:25,839
It may make a difference in the way
you feel about seeing me, even.

1259
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:27,591
But I've got to tell you.

1260
01:38:27,757 --> 01:38:31,052
Well, please, Clarence,
don't tell me now.

1261
01:38:31,219 --> 01:38:33,221
I like you very much

1262
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:35,974
but we haven't known
each other very long

1263
01:38:36,182 --> 01:38:39,102
and sometimes it's a mistake
to say things too soon.

1264
01:38:39,269 --> 01:38:41,855
- Do you think so?
- Oh, yes, I do.

1265
01:38:43,565 --> 01:38:45,525
Now I feel better.

1266
01:38:46,526 --> 01:38:48,945
I was afraid to tell you anyway.

1267
01:38:50,196 --> 01:38:52,866
By the way, where is Joe tonight?

1268
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:57,454
Joe probably has a date with Lola.
He's crazy about her.

1269
01:38:58,496 --> 01:39:03,668
I mean, she's crazy about him,
and he doesn't seem to mind it.

1270
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:34,366
That's just to hold you.

1271
01:39:34,532 --> 01:39:37,077
Now, don't forget,
I got one wish coming.

1272
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:55,971
Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?

1273
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:17,742
Clarence, you're wonderful.

1274
01:40:30,046 --> 01:40:33,675
You know, Clarence, I can't begin
to tell you how grateful I am.

1275
01:40:33,883 --> 01:40:36,553
Oh, gee, Aunt Susan,
it's really nothing, I...

1276
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,764
But I've waited all my life
for a chance like this.

1277
01:40:40,515 --> 01:40:44,436
- Oh, mister, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. It hardly touched me.

1278
01:40:44,603 --> 01:40:45,937
Wanna come to the kitchen?

1279
01:40:46,104 --> 01:40:48,523
Couple minutes next to that oven
and you'll be dry.

1280
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:50,775
Yes, Clarence,
you'd better go ahead. Hurry.

1281
01:40:52,861 --> 01:40:56,489
So I says to myself,
"Half of every year for 18 years

1282
01:40:56,656 --> 01:40:59,367
your feet get cold,
hands get chapped, nose gets blue.

1283
01:40:59,534 --> 01:41:04,873
Get smart, get out of town," I said.
So here I come to sunny California.

1284
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:10,503
Sure, my nose don't get blue anymore,
but the rest of me is blue all the time.

1285
01:41:11,379 --> 01:41:13,590
You're homesick, that's what.

1286
01:41:13,757 --> 01:41:15,467
Yeah.

1287
01:41:16,509 --> 01:41:19,220
I guess you're dry, I guess.

1288
01:41:20,138 --> 01:41:21,806
I guess.

1289
01:41:25,936 --> 01:41:27,520
Well...

1290
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:40,533
She's gone.

1291
01:41:40,742 --> 01:41:42,410
No kidding?

1292
01:41:42,577 --> 01:41:45,747
Don't worry, she must have gone up
to her dressing room to change.

1293
01:41:45,914 --> 01:41:47,624
She'll be back in a minute.

1294
01:41:48,959 --> 01:41:50,293
You know something?

1295
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,505
With you around, even with
the palm trees and this stuff

1296
01:41:53,672 --> 01:41:55,757
this feels like Brooklyn.

1297
01:41:55,924 --> 01:41:57,801
Gee, thanks.

1298
01:41:57,968 --> 01:41:59,761
You're welcome.

1299
01:42:01,972 --> 01:42:05,350
The customers are sitting in the inside
and the waitress sits outside.

1300
01:42:28,915 --> 01:42:31,209
- Hiya, Joe.
- Oh, hi.

1301
01:42:31,418 --> 01:42:34,462
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you. You having fun?

1302
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:38,300
- Oh, I'm having a swell time.
- Sure. All you needed was a girl.

1303
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:41,177
- Yeah.
- Say, you'd better get back to her.

1304
01:42:41,386 --> 01:42:43,888
What are you doing out here, anyway?

1305
01:42:44,973 --> 01:42:47,309
Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough

1306
01:42:47,517 --> 01:42:50,604
what with the excitement and all
about her audition.

1307
01:42:50,812 --> 01:42:52,772
Don't you think I'd better tell her?

1308
01:42:53,398 --> 01:42:55,525
Oh, that's what I came down
to see you about.

1309
01:42:55,692 --> 01:42:58,945
I thought not getting to Iturbi
might cramp your style with Susie

1310
01:42:59,112 --> 01:43:01,031
so I found out where we could see him.

1311
01:43:01,197 --> 01:43:04,701
Tomorrow, the first thing,
at the Hollywood Bowl.

1312
01:43:04,868 --> 01:43:08,371
So don't worry, everything's gonna be
okay with you and Susan.

1313
01:43:10,165 --> 01:43:12,459
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.

1314
01:43:12,667 --> 01:43:16,129
- Hollywood Bowl.
- Yeah, Hollywood Bowl.

1315
01:47:09,362 --> 01:47:11,573
- Mr. Iturbi is in there, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

1316
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,742
We're friends of his,
we'd like to see him.

1317
01:47:13,909 --> 01:47:16,578
I'm sorry, boys,
I wish I could let you in, but I can't.

1318
01:47:16,745 --> 01:47:18,997
Nobody is allowed in there
during rehearsals.

1319
01:47:23,418 --> 01:47:26,671
I got a dream I dream all the time,
I go up to a cop and he says:

1320
01:47:26,838 --> 01:47:29,257
"Glad to see you, come right in."

1321
01:47:29,424 --> 01:47:32,969
- So we give up, huh?
- So we don't give up, huh.

1322
01:48:52,757 --> 01:48:55,093
Come on, we got him cornered.

1323
01:51:45,055 --> 01:51:47,307
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, all. Goodbye.

1324
01:51:47,474 --> 01:51:49,768
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Hey, where's Iturbi?

1325
01:51:50,018 --> 01:51:56,024
Oh, he just left.
And he's eight minutes late. Oh, dear.

1326
01:51:56,191 --> 01:51:57,609
Hey.

1327
01:51:58,568 --> 01:52:01,112
Even you can be late, Joe.

1328
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:04,991
We just tell Susan the truth.
That's all there is to do.

1329
01:52:08,495 --> 01:52:10,080
Okay, I'll go.

1330
01:52:10,247 --> 01:52:11,706
Joe?

1331
01:52:12,415 --> 01:52:14,000
I'll tell her.

1332
01:52:14,167 --> 01:52:16,628
It's up to me to do it, not you.

1333
01:52:19,714 --> 01:52:24,386
Now, look, I'll go out to the studio
and tell her it's all a phony.

1334
01:52:24,552 --> 01:52:28,181
She'll be good and sore,
but at me, right?

1335
01:52:28,473 --> 01:52:30,475
I'll tell her how I pulled you into it

1336
01:52:30,642 --> 01:52:33,478
and how it all happened
because you're crazy about her.

1337
01:52:33,645 --> 01:52:36,564
What's the use, Joe? We're due
back in San Diego tomorrow

1338
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:39,442
- and our leave is up.
- What difference does that make?

1339
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:41,778
Susan's not a girl just for a leave.

1340
01:52:41,945 --> 01:52:43,530
Well...

1341
01:52:43,738 --> 01:52:46,408
She's the kind you come home to and...

1342
01:52:46,908 --> 01:52:49,327
- Well, this will do it.
- Joe?

1343
01:52:49,494 --> 01:52:50,954
Yeah?

1344
01:52:51,788 --> 01:52:53,748
There's something I've been...

1345
01:52:55,792 --> 01:52:58,253
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right. Okay.

1346
01:53:00,171 --> 01:53:03,091
I'll meet you at that little barn
near Susie's house about 6.

1347
01:53:03,258 --> 01:53:05,677
That way I can tell you
how she took it.

1348
01:53:05,844 --> 01:53:07,762
Unless you wanna come with me.

1349
01:53:10,515 --> 01:53:12,892
Are you just gonna sit here?

1350
01:53:13,685 --> 01:53:16,229
Yeah, yeah, I'm tired.

1351
01:53:34,205 --> 01:53:38,585
<i>I fall in love</i>

1352
01:53:38,752 --> 01:53:44,132
<i>Too easily</i>

1353
01:53:45,759 --> 01:53:49,262
<i>I fall in love</i>

1354
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:52,223
<i>Too fast</i>

1355
01:53:54,267 --> 01:53:57,646
<i>I fall in love</i>

1356
01:53:57,812 --> 01:54:02,025
<i>Too terribly hard</i>

1357
01:54:02,609 --> 01:54:09,366
<i>For love to ever last</i>

1358
01:54:10,742 --> 01:54:17,165
<i>My heart should be well-schooled</i>

1359
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:22,087
<i>'Cause I've been fooled</i>

1360
01:54:23,964 --> 01:54:27,717
<i>In the past</i>

1361
01:54:27,884 --> 01:54:36,434
<i>And still I fall in love too easily</i>

1362
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:47,571
<i>I fall in love</i>

1363
01:54:47,737 --> 01:54:54,494
<i>Too fast</i>

1364
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,556
Brooklyn, I love you.

1365
01:55:14,723 --> 01:55:17,142
Oh, no. No, you love Susie.

1366
01:55:17,309 --> 01:55:19,269
I did, but I don't.

1367
01:55:19,436 --> 01:55:22,480
I know it's awful, but I can't help it.
I love you.

1368
01:55:22,647 --> 01:55:24,816
I don't think it's so terrible.

1369
01:55:24,983 --> 01:55:26,735
Yes, it is.

1370
01:55:26,943 --> 01:55:30,780
There is Joe, off telling Susie
that I want to come home to her

1371
01:55:30,947 --> 01:55:33,491
and here I want to come home to you.

1372
01:55:33,658 --> 01:55:35,827
Gee, I got a feeling I'm...

1373
01:55:35,994 --> 01:55:38,371
I got a feeling I'm fickle.

1374
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,546
You're gonna marry me, aren't you?

1375
01:55:48,048 --> 01:55:50,008
But, Brooklyn...

1376
01:55:50,175 --> 01:55:53,929
Before I say for sure,
there's something I gotta tell you.

1377
01:55:54,095 --> 01:55:56,222
So that everything will be
on the level, see?

1378
01:55:56,389 --> 01:55:59,476
No, no. Whatever happened
before you met me, it doesn't count.

1379
01:55:59,643 --> 01:56:01,978
But this was after I met you.

1380
01:56:02,145 --> 01:56:03,772
It was?

1381
01:56:04,147 --> 01:56:06,358
I don't care.
You still don't have to tell me.

1382
01:56:06,524 --> 01:56:09,277
But I wanna. I gotta.

1383
01:56:10,195 --> 01:56:15,867
Well, last night, when I dropped
the soup on you by accident

1384
01:56:16,034 --> 01:56:18,411
it wasn't no accident.

1385
01:56:18,578 --> 01:56:21,539
I didn't want you
to sit there with her.

1386
01:56:22,707 --> 01:56:24,751
Why, Brooklyn

1387
01:56:24,918 --> 01:56:29,172
that's just about the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me.

1388
01:56:29,339 --> 01:56:31,758
Imagine, you were jealous.

1389
01:56:36,137 --> 01:56:41,017
But, honey, you better tell your pal
to stop fixing it up with Susan.

1390
01:56:41,601 --> 01:56:45,272
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Yeah.

1391
01:56:45,438 --> 01:56:47,983
Because bigamy, I don't believe in.

1392
01:56:50,527 --> 01:56:53,405
Everybody on the set for the morning
at 9:00 sharp.

1393
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:55,282
Susie.

1394
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:57,826
Can I speak to you for a minute?

1395
01:56:58,451 --> 01:57:00,704
What would you like to say?

1396
01:57:01,788 --> 01:57:04,874
- Well, I...
- Perhaps I could tell you.

1397
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:08,461
Clarence is a very fine boy,
that I know.

1398
01:57:08,878 --> 01:57:12,465
You saved his life,
so you owe him something.

1399
01:57:13,133 --> 01:57:15,468
You've decided
that he's just about right for me.

1400
01:57:15,635 --> 01:57:17,512
Does that cover everything?

1401
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,806
No, that doesn't come anywhere near it.

1402
01:57:19,973 --> 01:57:24,644
Oh, I forgot.
You like a very definite type of girl

1403
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:28,023
and I'm very definitely not it.

1404
01:57:28,273 --> 01:57:30,817
Oh, don't be mad, Aunt Susie.

1405
01:57:35,155 --> 01:57:36,573
I'm sorry.

1406
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,491
What is it, Joe?

1407
01:57:41,328 --> 01:57:43,997
Susie, what I wanna say...

1408
01:57:45,665 --> 01:57:48,126
Well, it's not awfully...

1409
01:57:51,212 --> 01:57:53,757
Same thing happens every time
I'm with you.

1410
01:57:53,924 --> 01:57:56,301
I hear myself saying words

1411
01:57:56,968 --> 01:58:00,347
that never have anything to do
with the things I feel about you.

1412
01:58:00,513 --> 01:58:04,768
All I know are the things you say, Joe,
and I don't like them.

1413
01:58:08,104 --> 01:58:10,190
Susan, I've never said to you

1414
01:58:10,357 --> 01:58:13,026
what I really wanted to say because...

1415
01:58:14,861 --> 01:58:18,573
I guess because my way of saying it
just isn't good enough.

1416
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:23,161
- Then there must be some other way.
- Sure there is.

1417
01:58:23,328 --> 01:58:28,750
Comes right out of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
<i>Three Musketeers</i>

1418
01:58:28,959 --> 01:58:31,586
and all the books and poems.

1419
01:58:31,753 --> 01:58:33,630
Those are the words I wanna say, but...

1420
01:58:35,757 --> 01:58:37,509
I can't. You'd laugh at me.

1421
01:58:37,676 --> 01:58:40,136
- I don't think so.
- Well, then I'd laugh at myself.

1422
01:58:40,303 --> 01:58:42,430
Words like that don't go
with sailor suits

1423
01:58:42,597 --> 01:58:45,725
and three-day leaves
and the world we live in.

1424
01:58:45,976 --> 01:58:50,230
They go with that world,
cloaks and swords and...

1425
01:58:50,397 --> 01:58:52,274
Oh, I don't know.

1426
01:58:53,024 --> 01:58:56,069
If you lived in that house,
then I could tell you.

1427
01:58:56,236 --> 01:58:58,446
But I do live in that house.

1428
01:59:02,117 --> 01:59:04,411
If you lived in that house

1429
01:59:05,662 --> 01:59:08,373
in some other time, you'd be...

1430
01:59:08,915 --> 01:59:11,126
You'd be a princess

1431
01:59:11,418 --> 01:59:16,506
and I'd be a bandit chief
who had to hide out in the hills.

1432
01:59:17,215 --> 01:59:20,260
A bandit who had seen the princess once

1433
01:59:20,427 --> 01:59:23,263
and having seen her,
could never forget her.

1434
01:59:23,972 --> 01:59:28,393
Then one night,
he'd risk his life to see her again.

1435
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:33,607
Hiding in a shadow here,
a patch of darkness there...

1436
02:04:29,277 --> 02:04:31,363
Hiya, Clarence.

1437
02:04:32,322 --> 02:04:33,865
- Joe.
- Yeah?

1438
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:35,575
You...

1439
02:04:36,451 --> 02:04:38,161
Nothing.

1440
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:41,373
- Clarence.
- Yeah, Joe?

1441
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:45,043
It's been a hot day.

1442
02:04:46,086 --> 02:04:48,922
Give me a Scotch. A double.

1443
02:04:53,593 --> 02:04:56,012
Are you used to that stuff?

1444
02:04:56,179 --> 02:04:59,766
No, I never touch it.
It cuts down on your wind.

1445
02:05:10,735 --> 02:05:12,445
Yeah.

1446
02:05:12,612 --> 02:05:14,823
It's been a hot day.

1447
02:05:15,073 --> 02:05:18,743
- Look, Joe...
- No, Clarence, you look.

1448
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:24,624
Clarence, sometimes things happen
and you just can't help them, see?

1449
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,128
You meet somebody and you don't think
it's anything, and then

1450
02:05:28,295 --> 02:05:29,963
all of a sudden it is something.

1451
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:32,674
Gee, that's exactly
the way it happened.

1452
02:05:33,133 --> 02:05:35,051
Don't I know.

1453
02:05:35,218 --> 02:05:37,012
It's...

1454
02:05:37,178 --> 02:05:39,306
It's wonderful, though.

1455
02:05:39,472 --> 02:05:41,349
It could be.

1456
02:05:41,516 --> 02:05:44,311
But not when you double-cross a pal.

1457
02:05:46,563 --> 02:05:48,940
When did you find out, Joe?

1458
02:05:49,190 --> 02:05:50,692
Today.

1459
02:05:50,859 --> 02:05:53,987
But I've had a hunch about it
pretty nearly from the beginning.

1460
02:05:54,154 --> 02:05:56,865
- You did?
- Yeah.

1461
02:05:57,824 --> 02:06:00,076
It's funny, I didn't.

1462
02:06:00,243 --> 02:06:03,622
Not for sure. Not till I kissed her.

1463
02:06:04,247 --> 02:06:08,001
Of course, last night
when she dropped her soup on me

1464
02:06:08,209 --> 02:06:10,211
I should have known.

1465
02:06:14,466 --> 02:06:16,134
The waitress?

1466
02:06:16,301 --> 02:06:17,886
Yeah.

1467
02:06:18,345 --> 02:06:20,847
Gee, she's a terrible waitress.

1468
02:06:24,643 --> 02:06:26,728
You mean you're not sore, Joe?

1469
02:06:26,895 --> 02:06:30,857
No, no. I'm not sore.
No, I forgive you.

1470
02:06:32,817 --> 02:06:34,778
Is she sore? Susan?

1471
02:06:35,445 --> 02:06:40,075
Susan? No, I wouldn't say
she acted sore. No, not at all.

1472
02:06:40,242 --> 02:06:43,828
Even when you told her that there
wasn't gonna be any audition?

1473
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:50,126
Joe.

1474
02:06:50,293 --> 02:06:52,545
You mean you didn't tell her?

1475
02:06:54,381 --> 02:06:56,967
Well, what did you tell her?

1476
02:06:57,133 --> 02:07:00,345
What could you be talking about
all this time?

1477
02:07:04,266 --> 02:07:08,520
Just things.
You know how it is with things.

1478
02:07:11,022 --> 02:07:15,277
Joe, you're in love
with Susan yourself.

1479
02:07:21,616 --> 02:07:24,953
- You gonna ask her to marry you?
- Sure.

1480
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,999
Well, when? Before or after
she doesn't have her audition?

1481
02:07:36,339 --> 02:07:37,966
Iturbi.

1482
02:07:38,174 --> 02:07:41,636
Iturbi. I gotta get to Iturbi.

1483
02:07:42,178 --> 02:07:45,181
But where? I don't know where.

1484
02:07:45,348 --> 02:07:48,685
Oh, Clarence, where can he be?
He's gotta light someplace sometime.

1485
02:07:48,852 --> 02:07:51,646
There's gotta be someplace
he calls home.

1486
02:07:53,356 --> 02:07:54,774
Home.

1487
02:07:55,734 --> 02:07:56,943
Home.

1488
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:19,466
Good morning. Well, thank you.

1489
02:08:19,716 --> 02:08:21,593
Can I help you gentlemen?

1490
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,389
Well, we were looking for Mr. Iturbi.
Will he be in this morning?

1491
02:08:26,556 --> 02:08:29,434
He gave a concert
at Bakersfield last night.

1492
02:08:29,601 --> 02:08:32,520
And when he returns
he'll probably go straight to the studio.

1493
02:08:32,687 --> 02:08:34,439
Is there any message?

1494
02:08:35,565 --> 02:08:37,317
Well...

1495
02:08:37,776 --> 02:08:40,779
- No. No, thanks.
- Very well.

1496
02:08:43,865 --> 02:08:46,117
Gee, that's awful.

1497
02:08:49,913 --> 02:08:52,249
What are you gonna do, Joe?

1498
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:59,130
Well, I'll go to her house
and stop her before she leaves.

1499
02:08:59,547 --> 02:09:01,883
Now, look,
don't let this spoil it for you, kid.

1500
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:04,719
You go see your girl,
you haven't got much time.

1501
02:09:04,886 --> 02:09:06,763
I'll meet you at the bus.

1502
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:08,682
You want me to go with you?

1503
02:09:08,848 --> 02:09:10,267
No.

1504
02:09:21,486 --> 02:09:24,531
Joe, I was afraid
I wouldn't get to see you again.

1505
02:09:24,698 --> 02:09:28,118
What, you think I'd go away
without saying goodbye?

1506
02:09:28,285 --> 02:09:32,080
Aunt Susie isn't home.
She went to the studio.

1507
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:42,132
Look.

1508
02:09:42,632 --> 02:09:44,259
Donald.

1509
02:09:44,926 --> 02:09:46,803
I've gotta go back to my ship

1510
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:49,973
and I don't know if I'll get to see
Aunt Susan again or not.

1511
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:53,643
- So will you tell her something for me?
- Sure.

1512
02:09:53,852 --> 02:09:56,980
- Sure, Joe.
- Okay, you tell her that

1513
02:09:57,772 --> 02:10:02,485
I tried awfully hard to make things
come out right and that

1514
02:10:03,612 --> 02:10:06,948
I'm awfully sorry
that it had to end this way.

1515
02:10:07,324 --> 02:10:08,658
You got that?

1516
02:10:16,374 --> 02:10:18,335
- Good morning, Mr. Iturbi.
- Good morning.

1517
02:10:18,501 --> 02:10:20,921
- Here's your coffee and doughnut.
- Thank you, dear.

1518
02:10:35,435 --> 02:10:37,062
Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.

1519
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:39,814
Imagine running into you this morning
of all mornings.

1520
02:10:40,607 --> 02:10:44,027
Do so hope I won't be
a disappointment to you.

1521
02:10:44,194 --> 02:10:48,657
- A disappointment? To me?
- How silly of me.

1522
02:10:48,823 --> 02:10:50,867
You don't even know who I am, do you?

1523
02:10:51,034 --> 02:10:55,580
- Well, I'm Susan Abbott.
- Oh, that's nice.

1524
02:10:56,373 --> 02:10:59,251
You know,
your friends told you about me.

1525
02:10:59,417 --> 02:11:00,794
Clarence and Joe.

1526
02:11:01,461 --> 02:11:04,547
And, well, this is going to be
quite a day for me.

1527
02:11:04,714 --> 02:11:08,468
It looks like quite a day for me too.

1528
02:11:08,718 --> 02:11:12,681
You know, I had rather expected
that Joe would be with you today

1529
02:11:12,889 --> 02:11:16,643
but I'm sort of glad he isn't,
that would make me too nervous.

1530
02:11:17,143 --> 02:11:21,856
- You don't know him very well, do you?
- Not really well.

1531
02:11:22,023 --> 02:11:25,777
You'd love him
because he's really a wonderful person.

1532
02:11:25,944 --> 02:11:28,321
Well, what I mean is that...

1533
02:11:28,488 --> 02:11:34,703
- Well, he's Clarence's best friend and...
- Oh, he's Clarence's best friend?

1534
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:36,830
And I know Clarence very well, don't I?

1535
02:11:36,997 --> 02:11:39,958
You'd hardly be giving me
an audition if you didn't.

1536
02:11:40,333 --> 02:11:42,168
An audition.

1537
02:11:42,335 --> 02:11:44,546
And when is it going to be,
this audition?

1538
02:11:45,213 --> 02:11:50,010
11:15 this morning.
You didn't remember it?

1539
02:11:51,386 --> 02:11:55,223
Well, it isn't exactly
that I didn't remember.

1540
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:57,350
It's that...

1541
02:11:57,601 --> 02:12:01,396
It's that you didn't know
anything about it.

1542
02:12:04,107 --> 02:12:07,527
That there never was really
an audition at all.

1543
02:12:08,069 --> 02:12:14,367
Oh, Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.
See, it's just that Joe and Clarence...

1544
02:12:14,576 --> 02:12:17,829
Joe and Clarence told me
that they had arranged for...

1545
02:12:17,996 --> 02:12:19,956
What I mean is that...

1546
02:12:20,123 --> 02:12:23,627
It is a joke. I can see that now.

1547
02:12:23,793 --> 02:12:25,795
Please forgive me.

1548
02:12:26,379 --> 02:12:29,507
Wait. Wait for a minute.

1549
02:12:30,842 --> 02:12:34,930
These boys,
you like them very much, yes?

1550
02:12:35,138 --> 02:12:37,849
Especially this Joe. Don't you?

1551
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,684
Yes.

1552
02:12:40,226 --> 02:12:44,773
To throw away a friend in anger,
this is not good.

1553
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:48,902
And perhaps, if we talk a little
about this terrible situation

1554
02:12:49,027 --> 02:12:52,197
perhaps it will turn out
not to be so terrible.

1555
02:12:55,533 --> 02:12:58,453
- Camera ready.
- All right.

1556
02:13:05,669 --> 02:13:10,131
<i>From the heart of a lonely poet</i>

1557
02:13:10,298 --> 02:13:14,135
<i>Came a song for the girl he adored</i>

1558
02:13:14,302 --> 02:13:17,681
<i>Though she tried very hard</i>
<i>Not to show it</i>

1559
02:13:17,847 --> 02:13:22,894
<i>She was terribly, terribly bored</i>

1560
02:13:25,313 --> 02:13:29,734
<i>But then the poet asked her</i>
<i>If she'd like a walk</i>

1561
02:13:29,901 --> 02:13:34,739
<i>And her eyes shone</i>
<i>And the moon shone</i>

1562
02:13:34,906 --> 02:13:37,325
<i>And the stars shone</i>

1563
02:13:37,534 --> 02:13:41,621
<i>Up above</i>

1564
02:13:41,788 --> 02:13:47,335
<i>And they walked</i>
<i>Through the evening together</i>

1565
02:13:47,502 --> 02:13:54,301
<i>They were swaying</i>
<i>To the music of a drum and violin</i>

1566
02:13:54,467 --> 02:13:58,263
<i>He held her and told her he'd love her</i>

1567
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:01,975
<i>Till the moon faded above her</i>

1568
02:14:14,821 --> 02:14:18,325
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Though she tried not to show it</i>

1569
02:14:18,491 --> 02:14:25,373
<i>She was certain</i>
<i>She'd fallen in love</i>

1570
02:14:45,727 --> 02:14:50,315
<i>And her eyes shone</i>
<i>And the moon shone</i>

1571
02:14:50,482 --> 02:14:53,485
<i>And the stars shone</i>

1572
02:14:53,652 --> 02:14:58,406
<i>Up above</i>

1573
02:14:58,573 --> 02:15:02,953
<i>And they walked</i>
<i>Through the evening together</i>

1574
02:15:03,161 --> 02:15:09,542
<i>They were swaying</i>
<i>To the music of a drum and violin</i>

1575
02:15:09,709 --> 02:15:13,171
<i>The spell of the moon</i>
<i>Fell upon them</i>

1576
02:15:13,338 --> 02:15:17,092
<i>And the stardust</i>
<i>Breathed upon them</i>

1577
02:15:30,438 --> 02:15:34,025
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Though she tried not to show it</i>

1578
02:15:34,192 --> 02:15:37,946
<i>You could see in her eyes a light</i>

1579
02:15:38,154 --> 02:15:41,825
<i>She was certain</i>
<i>She'd fallen in love</i>

1580
02:15:41,992 --> 02:15:45,287
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Through the thrill of the night</i>

1581
02:16:16,651 --> 02:16:21,031
- Why don't you write her a letter.
- Because there isn't anything to say.

1582
02:16:21,197 --> 02:16:22,991
Well, tell her you're sorry.

1583
02:16:23,158 --> 02:16:25,785
- She knows I'm sorry.
- How does she know?

1584
02:16:25,952 --> 02:16:28,914
Oh, Clarence, will you
write Brooklyn a letter

1585
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:32,500
or wash some socks
or go to sleep or something?

1586
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,506
Carry on.

1587
02:16:38,673 --> 02:16:42,552
You boys were looking for me.
What did you want to see me about?

1588
02:16:43,011 --> 02:16:45,555
Well, I...

1589
02:16:49,768 --> 02:16:52,604
- It's too late now.
- That, of course, I can tell.

1590
02:16:52,771 --> 02:16:54,731
Come, come along. We'll talk it over.

1591
02:16:54,898 --> 02:16:58,151
- Come on, I haven't got much time.
- Go ahead.

1592
02:17:05,492 --> 02:17:08,912
- Brooklyn, what are you doing here?
- Are you complaining, honey?

1593
02:17:10,622 --> 02:17:13,667
Joe, you stay right here.
Don't go away.

1594
02:17:25,428 --> 02:17:30,225
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I invited myself to your concert.

1595
02:17:30,392 --> 02:17:34,396
And because I felt it might be
of special interest to you

1596
02:17:34,563 --> 02:17:39,067
I requested Admiral Hammond to grant
a young artist permission

1597
02:17:39,234 --> 02:17:41,111
to make her debut right here.

1598
02:17:41,653 --> 02:17:43,822
Therefore, allow me to introduce to you

1599
02:17:43,989 --> 02:17:46,908
a singer discovered
by the United States Navy.

1600
02:17:47,075 --> 02:17:48,410
Miss Susan Abbott.

1601
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:02,507
In about five minutes,
I will introduce to you

1602
02:18:02,674 --> 02:18:06,011
a young singer discovered
by the United States Navy.

<i>Anchors aweigh, my boys</i>
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

<i>We sail at break of day</i>
