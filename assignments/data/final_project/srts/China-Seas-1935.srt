1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,656
Stand by for the mail.

3
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,981
We know you're not a pirate.

4
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,977
We know, you'll get your knife
back when we dock in Singapore.

5
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:51,669
Say, you just get on
a phone and call Scranton, PA...

6
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:54,398
- and ask anybody about J. Wilberforce...
- Have you any arms sir?

7
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,870
Just these you see growing out of me armpits.

8
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:58,918
You'll do.

9
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,293
No excuses Mr. Atkins, your
job is to look after this dock.

10
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,343
If I ever find it
in this state again, I'll, I'll...

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,021
How's your wife?

12
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:11,746
She's, she's very much better sir and
thank you very much for the flowers.

13
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:14,481
Oh, don't thank me, my gardener
has to get rid of them somehow.

14
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:15,968
Who's the big shot?

15
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,839
Sir Guy Wilmerding,
managing director of the line.

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,950
Right this way Sir Guy.

17
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,784
Gangway please.
Glad to have you with us again sir.

18
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,668
Oh, none of that mush.
I know how glad you are.

19
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,555
Not bad, not bad at
all for a synthetic stone.

20
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,427
- You ought to know Paul.
- My lovely Olga.

21
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,593
Hey, I bet that lug stops in China.

22
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:55,526
That's the insignia of Wing YuLan, everything
in the archipelago pays dividends to him.

23
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:01,614
Good morning purser.

24
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,011
Good morning Miss YuLan.

25
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:06,110
We've made arrangements to take
your chairs aboard in the after gangway.

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,467
Thank you.

27
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,605
Mr. Dawson sir, here comes the captain.

28
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:24,231
Look at him, with a 3 days
hangover and watch him grouse.

29
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:29,897
Of all the ungrateful, brass hearted
skippers of a rusty old teakettle...

30
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:32,717
who thinks he's still
strutting in the Royal Navy.

31
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,597
Our captain.

32
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:47,041
Oh Alan? Alan Gaskell? I
got some last minute cargo for you.

33
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,199
Oh hello Ken, what you
doing up in broad daylight?

34
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,985
Oh Captain Gaskell. I want you to meet
Charlie McCaleb, the American novelist.

35
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,814
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

36
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,255
Well, Hong Kong seems to have
taken you to her bottom again.

37
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,971
Now wait a minute,
I've seen your face before.

38
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,351
No, don't tell me, it's
right on the tip of my tongue.

39
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,005
- Remember Johnson?
- Johnson?

40
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,517
- Who?
- Johnson.

41
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,308
Oh Johnny old boy,
what you doing way out here?

42
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,781
- Oh, maybe you can tell me.
- No, no, this is Captain Gaskell.

43
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:13,171
- The master of the ship you're sailing on.
- Hiya captain, coming along with us?

44
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,096
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.

45
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,274
He's supposed to be over here gathering
material for a new novel, I've dragged him...

46
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:22,875
through wars, riots and revolutions.
He doesn't even know he's in China.

47
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,503
If you should stir
up anything exciting, why...

48
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,595
shove him in a front
seat and tie his eyes open.

49
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,872
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I'm not running a day nursery...

50
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,406
and I'm not stirring up any excitement just
for the sake of literature, see you later.

51
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:37,028
Don't you worry old fella, I'll be
right there, I'm the old Ringside Kid.

52
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,393
Got an eye like an eagle.

53
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,635
Goodbye Captain
Greshall, had a marvelous trip.

54
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:47,784
Ship ahoy, ship ahoy.

55
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,285
Ship ahoy.

56
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,588
- Are you all right Charley?
- I cover the waterfront.

57
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,173
- Steward.
- Yes sir? Good morning sir.

58
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,393
That's your idea of clean brass?

59
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,983
- Sorry sir...
- You haven't answered my question.

60
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,083
No sir, it isn't my idea clean brass sir.

61
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,060
You've been sampling
my whiskey again, haven't you?

62
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,685
Oh, yes sir.

63
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,965
- Not as good as the last lot, is it?
- No sir.

64
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,223
Then why haven't you done something about it?

65
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,341
- I will sir.
- Thank you.

66
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,069
Thank you sir sir Guy wants to see you sir.

67
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,481
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning.

68
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:30,951
Ah, so there you are.

69
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,552
Good morning Mrs. Aiken.

70
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,035
We were just talking about you captain.

71
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:39,579
Mrs. Aiken tells me you've been sensationally
blotto ever since you went ashore.

72
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,814
- Sir Guy?
- Oh, she does, eh?

73
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:47,391
You don't like my behavior ashore or
aboard ship, you can get a new boy.

74
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,746
In fact, I wish you would.

75
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,115
- You wouldn't go if you could.
- Wouldn't I?

76
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,832
I'm so close to being back to
England now I can hear Big Ben chiming.

77
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,226
I've heard that from men for 50 years.

78
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,041
It's only the weak ones
that sneak out of the China Seas.

79
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,296
It's the bullheads like you that stay on.

80
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,819
What about a little spot
to keep your brain from addling?

81
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,164
No, I haven't the time.

82
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,934
I've got to get the pride
of your fleet underway.

83
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:11,509
Mr. Rockwell, go to the captain's
saloon, check those chronometers.

84
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:12,996
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

85
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,894
Third officer hasn't come aboard yet sir.

86
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,785
Yes, I know, I've just been looking
him over, he's in the Sepoy Hospital.

87
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,146
Tried to clean out
High Spade McQueen's last night.

88
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,999
- Bad sir?
- Yes, knife in the kidneys.

89
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:24,162
Port captain is trying to
find someone to replace him.

90
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:28,592
- What you got in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco sir.

91
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,463
It's bad enough to have a ship like
this and a captain that looks like...

92
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,544
me without having a
chief officer who looks like you.

93
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:34,416
I'm sorry sir.

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,062
Had it in me jaw when I
came on duty and I forgot all about it.

95
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:41,019
Oh Mr.Willet of the Royal
Canada Bank is awaiting to see you sir.

96
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,783
- He's just down there at your quarters.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,494
- Hello Willet.
- Good morning captain.

98
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:53,083
- Gold come aboard yet?
- Yes sir.

99
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,490
- All stowed away as we agreed?
- In the steamroller.

100
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,314
- Good.
- Thank you sir.

101
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,038
Wipe that smile off your face.

102
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,043
Is that your idea of clean brass?
You haven't answered my question.

103
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,561
Did I ask you?

104
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:31,518
A little too big for
you, isn't it Mr. Rockwell?

105
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,165
I apologize sir.

106
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,093
Chief officer sent me down
to check the chronometers.

107
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:37,524
Yeah.

108
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:41,521
- But I don't keep them in my cap.
- No sir.

109
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,591
- What you going to do with that button?
- To button it sir.

110
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:54,761
I was just hoping you
weren't too angry with me sir.

111
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,708
- Oh, carry on.
- Thank you sir.

112
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,747
Excuse me sir.

113
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,332
- Who's in there?
- It's China Doll, a gal that drives men mad.

114
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,918
What the devil are you doing aboard?

115
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:29,710
Nothing lambie, just showering
the dewdrops off the body beautiful.

116
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:36,987
How many hours do we have to spend
saying goodbye before it takes?

117
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,922
That's just the trouble
toots, it took too good.

118
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:42,922
Gee, were sweet to me.

119
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:47,327
Say, I thought maybe you could use all that
money you won at the Tai Fan last night.

120
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh, then we were there?

121
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,253
Yeah, we had a million laughs.
I made 17 straight passes myself.

122
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:52,900
- Get on your horse, we're shoving off.
-

123
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,845
But why you so anxious to get me out of here?
Is that hunk of caviar making the round trip?

124
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,805
What hunk of caviar?

125
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,499
That red headed Russian
princess whose aboard from Singapore.

126
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,020
She isn't a Russian and
she isn't a princess...

127
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,554
and I have my
doubts about her hair being red.

128
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:07,136
I don't care what she is, if she was a
Chinese sextet, it'd be the same thing to me.

129
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:10,610
What I'm trying to get through your numb
skull is that I'm not going to stand by...

130
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,728
Now, wait a minute Dolly.

131
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,592
You and I are friends.
We had a lot of fun together.

132
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,546
And as far as I'm concerned, you're
a number one girl in the archipelago.

133
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:24,886
But I don't remember making any vows
to you nor do I recall asking for any.

134
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,777
Don't you get polite at me, when you
start talking with your high hat on I...

135
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,910
I know you mean it and and scares me.

136
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,648
Say, who do you think you are anyway?

137
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:36,440
- If I had a nickel's worth of pride...
- Alright.

138
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,711
That's the way you feel
about, I'm not standing in your way.

139
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:41,801
That's just the soup I'm in,
I don't feel that way at all.

140
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,284
You, you dog.

141
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,042
Oh, that's more like it.

142
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,481
Come in.

143
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,397
- Pilot tug's alongside sir.
- Alright.

144
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,933
Stand by to single up
your lines fore and aft.

145
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:00,615
Aye, aye sir.

146
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,946
Alright, come on now nuisance, over shore.

147
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,702
Oh but I'm looking, what I'm going to do with
my ticket? It's all paid for and everything.

148
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,524
And I knew you'd something up your sleeve.
Alright, come on, we'll get your money back.

149
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,728
No but I got a job in Singapore.

150
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:12,092
- Honest...
- Oh yes, yes, I know.

151
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,190
I suppose they've elected you mayor.

152
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:16,433
No but it's on the level, Hoffmann sent
me a contract for the rest of the season.

153
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:16,925
No.

154
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:19,563
Look, I know how you feel about it.
I won't come near you. Nobody will...

155
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:20,168
No.

156
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:24,680
Alright toots, you, you win, I...

157
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,325
I hope you have a good trip, goodbye.

158
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:38,399
Alright, alright, if you've got your
ticket and a job, I don't suppose I...

159
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,055
- Lambie.
- Stop wrestling me around.

160
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,593
You turning this skiff
into an excursion launch.

161
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,356
Come on, snap into it
before the fore hold loading.

162
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,852
You just came down to say goodbye?

163
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:58,242
You brought enough of your cigarettes
to last on a voyage to New York.

164
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:02,836
Oh I'll smoke a lot more cigarettes than that
toots, before we ever really say goodbye.

165
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,511
Listen, I told you to...

166
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,243
- Good morning sir.
- Davids, isn't it? Tom Davids?

167
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:20,512
Yes sir.

168
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:24,062
Your port captain told me
to report for duty as 3rd officer.

169
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,848
- Duty as what?
- Third officer.

170
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,432
These rocking chair sailors ashore.

171
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:33,447
Here I am in the middle of the
typhoon season, a tough voyage ahead.

172
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,816
I ask for a fighter,
and they send me a punching bag.

173
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,370
Give me a chance, is the first
one I had for over a year.

174
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:42,538
I know these waters better than most, I've
sailed them as a master for over 10 years.

175
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:45,492
No one had a better
record on this coast than I had.

176
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,973
Then, just because
of an accident, I'm not a coward.

177
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,841
Stow it Davids, you
let pirates scuttle your ship...

178
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,759
and you lost every white
man aboard except yourself.

179
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:56,201
The board of trade
lifted your ticket, I didn't.

180
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,578
Give me a chance please.

181
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:01,789
You got a uniform?

182
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:04,954
Nothing clean sir.

183
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,860
Alright, I'll have the
steward give you one of mine.

184
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,000
- Yes sir.
- Report to Mr. Dawson.

185
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,725
I'll have the uniform
laundered and return it to you.

186
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,692
No, that's all right.
Keep it, you probably need it.

187
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,553
Thank you sir.

188
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:24,294
Well, if it ain't old rough on
rat himself, how are you, Jamesy?

189
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,812
Dolly, you're looking just as
pretty as ever, what you've been doing?

190
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:30,316
- Bidding the big boy goodbye, eh?
- Goodbye nothing, I'm making this voyage.

191
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:31,753
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:34,720
Why, I'm just as happy as if
I'd won the Calcutta sweepstakes.

193
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:37,694
You ought to have the
shekels piled up to the roof by now.

194
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,926
I haven't done so bad, you know...

195
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:43,296
Dolly, I'm still willing
to share it all with you.

196
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,599
Say, there ain't enough dough in all Asia to
make me change the way I feel about one guy.

197
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,598
Still crazy about that Gaskell, eh?

198
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:54,028
Well, whenever you get tired of
running around with an Airedale...

199
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,478
and you want to run around with a
Saint Bernard, why, you let me know.

200
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:00,181
Sure, whenever I get lost
in the Alps, I'll whistle for you.

201
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,684
- Alright, I'll come running, goodbye Dolly.
- See you later.

202
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:08,984
- You'd be easy with them there pigs.
- Well Kingston, you're a wonder.

203
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,936
How you've been able to sail with that...

204
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:13,817
sour bellied Gaskell as
long as you have, I don't know.

205
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,716
- Hello Jamesy.
- Well Captain Gaskell, I was just telling...

206
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,007
Kingston how happy I
was to be sailing with you.

207
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,952
- Hey, stow that on the port side.
- Yes, yes.

208
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,018
You still carrying
that cargo of soft soap, eh?

209
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,592
No, no, really, I mean it. You
don't know what a safe feeling it is to be...

210
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,634
sailing with a captain that's
never been raided by the pirates.

211
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:32,289
Yes, there's not much profit
for pirates in this zoo of yours.

212
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,386
Say, who you swindling
with this scrubby lot, eh?

213
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,140
That's the finest lot of
animals I've ever shipped.

214
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:40,352
Well, they're not as noisy as
that last batch of sopranos you had.

215
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,598
Say now, Jamesy, just between you and me.

216
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:46,437
- What do you give them to keep them quiet?
- I just give them one of these little pills.

217
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,723
And they sleep and dream all
the way across, never lose a pound.

218
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,433
I don't suppose you ever
thought of giving them a little...

219
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,171
gravel just to add a pound though.

220
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:55,522
Why captain, that would be dishonest.

221
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,789
They got big feet for
singsong girls, haven't they?

222
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,811
Well they, they don't bandage the feet
nowadays, these are enlightened days.

223
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,963
Those feet are big even for enlightened days.

224
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:09,563
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Sir Rockwell.

225
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,717
What is a woman do
when you throw something at her?

226
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,545
- A woman?
- She dodges it, a man catches it.

227
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,796
Here, catch. Sergeant of guard.

228
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,359
Take them to shore, charge
them with attempted piracy.

229
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,048
And ask the police commissioner to wireless
me anything he can sweat out them.

230
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:32,278
Hido, Hido.

231
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,376
You go ashore and tell Moray to bail
them out before they start to talk.

232
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,064
Tell Ngah I'll go through with the job as
agreed but he'll need more men, go on.

233
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:50,333
Hey captain, that's good work.
You're the finest skipper on this coast.

234
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,588
Thanks.

235
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,466
- See you on the next trip.
- Goodbye and thank you for all your trouble.

236
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,222
- Take care of yourself dear.
- I will.

237
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,709
- So long Sybil and good luck.
- Thank you so much.

238
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:10,978
- B-39.
- Thank you.

239
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,298
- Don't forget to write Sybil.
- I won't.

240
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:24,020
- Sybil?
- Alan?

241
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:29,518
It is Alan.
Oh, so this is your ship. My, I am lucky.

242
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:34,401
Yes, yes, I'm captain of this tub.
Are you visiting out here?

243
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,682
Just traveling.
You might start to unpack Pether.

244
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:40,450
I've been just traveling for some time.

245
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:46,179
I, I heard about Bart, I meant to write,
but it was so long after he died.

246
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,320
News is slow out here.

247
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:52,525
We spoke of you so often,
wondering what you were doing.

248
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:54,922
Oh, getting into trouble
mostly, then trying to get out of it.

249
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:58,421
Well, you're in for more trouble now,
looking after me for a whole voyage.

250
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,677
I'm in your hands again Alan.

251
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,881
Look here Alan, can't
you get this boat? What's wrong?

252
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:15,272
- Look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- I have.

253
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:24,027
- Gangplank secure sir.
- All clear forward sir.

254
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:29,155
- Cast off your bow line.
- Aye, aye sir.

255
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:36,100
Good morning captain.

256
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:41,440
- Hiya neighbor, the name is Timmons.
- Ah, I can take it or leave it alone.

257
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,424
No, no, the name, Timmons.
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.

258
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,659
I'm the guy that can do it too.

259
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,052
Who is it?

260
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,298
- Who is it?
- It's just me toots.

261
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:14,122
Listen, when I told you to stay out of
here, I wasn't shadowboxing, I meant it.

262
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:17,520
- Oh, I just came in to borrow a book.
- I don't keep them in my bathtub.

263
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,634
I decided to improve my mind.

264
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:22,797
You better take two books,
give yourself an even break.

265
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,896
Now, how about you
doing about 3 turns around the deck...

266
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,804
before dinner
just to work up an appetite, eh?

267
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:33,272
Ok, Ok toots. I know you ain't got
much time to fool around with passengers.

268
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:37,946
- It's your own fault, you wanted to be one.
- Except maybe that English dame.

269
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:42,057
- You're becoming very observant.
- I saw her when she came aboard.

270
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:44,674
She looked like she was
smelling a dead fish or something.

271
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,092
Considering her
surroundings that's highly possible.

272
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:52,435
And I also got a load of you when
you moved her into the royal suite.

273
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,121
Why didn't you lay out
a red plush carpet for her?

274
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,337
Well, that's just a
throwback to my old manners.

275
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,398
The lady happened to know me when
I acted that way for the sheer joy of it.

276
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:03,023
Oh, I get it, a hometown honey.

277
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:08,350
I knew her years ago and her husband.

278
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,050
Married? Oh, being married
don't seem to tie her down none.

279
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,420
He's dead.

280
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,236
So, so she's back in circulation again.

281
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:23,506
Well, maybe it's a good thing you didn't
get hooked up with nobody out here.

282
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:32,202
Thanks but if I'd had a more definite tie,
I might've behaved a bit more decently.

283
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:35,647
Say, if you ain't decent boyfriend, you'll
do until something decent comes along.

284
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:36,941
Out here maybe.

285
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,436
But anywhere else in the world
we'd both be a little bit soiled.

286
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:47,116
Did you ever see an English river Dolly?

287
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:50,715
No, I'm dumb at geography,
just like I am at everything else.

288
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:53,084
Well, it's cool, clear and clean.

289
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:58,604
Put a stream like that alongside
any river out here, dirty, yellow, muddy...

290
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,160
you'll see the difference.

291
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,620
That was only a few years ago.

292
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,410
The pirates killed every white person aboard
except the Capt and then scuttled the ship.

293
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:01,194
Better take care of
these pearls in the case of piracy.

294
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,576
Why? They're artificial,
they're not worth anything.

295
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,650
12 and a half bucks, quite a bargain I'd say.

296
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,948
Where did you get them Mr. Timmons?

297
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,202
- Well, she picked them up...
- I bought them myself in Tokyo.

298
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:13,954
Well you know, it's not
always easy to tell the real from...

299
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:21,805
- I'm sure you didn't pay too much for them.
- Bet your sweet life she didn't.

300
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:24,674
That little woman gets her
money's worth every time, eh Poopsie?

301
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,668
Hey, you see that chess game over there?

302
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:34,598
When I was 4 years old, I played
10 people all at once, blindfolded.

303
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,083
I lost every game.

304
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:45,185
Pirates? Baloney.
Where did you really get those pearls, eh?

305
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,268
- You won't tell Wilbur, will you?
- Twelve and a half bucks to Wilbur.

306
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:58,647
That pirate hooey of yours
is stuff they always tell tourists.

307
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:01,281
I'll bet they don't rate one
through nine with our rum-runners.

308
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,495
Bosh, your rum-runners
learned the game from our pirates.

309
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:08,133
Even the hijacking and that
trick of identifying each other...

310
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:10,754
by matching the halves
of a torn a hundred dollar bill.

311
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:14,485
- Here they use a hundred pound note.
- Sunday paper bunk.

312
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,171
- Hey mate, come here.
- Yes sir?

313
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:23,519
- How are you Mr. Davids?
- How are you Sir Guy?

314
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,703
Tell him that bunk about the
ship they held up and scuttled.

315
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:28,470
Get a load of this, it's terrific.

316
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:33,102
- I don't remember saying anything Timmons.
- You can't get out of it like that.

317
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,642
Tell him about the one white
officer who came out of it alive.

318
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:43,076
What's the matter with that bird?
Was I speaking out of turn?

319
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:48,429
I'm afraid you were, that's Tom Davids.
Captain of the ship I was telling you about.

320
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:55,537
Say, don't look now, well I think
my stomach is full of butterflies.

321
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:26,607
Isabelle.

322
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,449
- Isabel MacCarthy.
- Yes ma?

323
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,865
Would you say that I looked like a lady?

324
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:36,378
No Miss Dolly, I've been with you
all too long to insult you that-away.

325
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,031
Say, what's the difference?

326
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,002
What's that snooty
English dame got that I ain't?

327
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,794
She's more refined like.

328
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,894
She would never wear that dress
with all them shiny beads you got.

329
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,232
That dress is more my type.

330
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,363
You've been hinting
for that dress for a month.

331
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:53,668
Go on and take it, you
spoiled it for me anyway.

332
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,656
You sure got the right feeling though honey.

333
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,187
I got to let this out a smidgen.

334
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:13,246
You sure is got the right instincts
no matter what they all say.

335
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,826
What do they say?

336
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:19,065
Oh, it's just a mite of talk, they say
yous got yourself so hooked on to that...

337
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:22,365
Captain Gaskell that he's
shaking himself like a wet hound dog...

338
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,111
and can't get you loose no how.

339
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:27,505
Yes Miss, they do, like a wet hound dog.

340
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,575
He can't shake me off, I hopped off, see?
And I'm glad I did, do you hear that?

341
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,639
I'm glad, I'm happy.

342
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:38,398
Sure you's happy honey.
But don't you worry, you'll get over it.

343
00:23:56,085 --> 00:24:00,028
Twenty years on the China Seas
and she never lost a spangle.

344
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,818
I had a spangle
once, it was a cockier spangle.

345
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,281
She had a litter of field mice.

346
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:14,670
Good evening Miss Portland, I've
got you the other side of Mr. MacArdle.

347
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:20,160
- Oh well, I get it, where is the big guy?
- You mean the captain miss?

348
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:22,817
He went, that is I believe
he's escorting Mrs. Barclay.

349
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:26,196
Oh, why doesn't she put a ring in his
nose so she can lead him around easier?

350
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:27,364
Excuse me sir.

351
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:29,751
Say, Ah Feng, bring me a
double hooker of scotch quick.

352
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:30,292
Yes miss.

353
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:33,997
Well Jamesy, you old
trambo, long time no see kid.

354
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:36,836
No fault of mine Dolly,
you're the original one man girl..

355
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:39,443
As long as I've got a one gal guy.

356
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,577
I just saw Captain Gaskell
upstairs walking with Mrs. Barclay.

357
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,254
Very lovely looking girl, isn't she?

358
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:51,002
She couldn't take me away from
a girl like you in a thousand years.

359
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,580
Hey, what makes you think she's
taking anything away from me, eh?

360
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,192
Get on the belt line and keep them coming.

361
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,879
I think you know everybody Sybil,
except perhaps Miss YuLan, Mrs. Barclay.

362
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,755
How do you do?

363
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:12,816
- And Miss Portland.
- How do you do?

364
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:14,312
Hello.

365
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:19,104
You needn't be so confoundedly possessive
Alan I knew Mrs. Barclay long before you did.

366
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,269
Say, you had such a start.
I'm only trying to catch up.

367
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,059
Ah, you had your chance
Sir Guy but you spurned me.

368
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,557
At least Alan didn't
meet me till after I was married.

369
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:29,529
That ruins all my guesses.

370
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,467
I had such a romantic
meeting arranged for you two.

371
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:36,586
The squadron ball at Gibraltar,
music, lanterns, uniforms...

372
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,468
Her husband was at sea
so I claimed every dance.

373
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,810
- We walked back to the hotel together.
- With or without moonlight?

374
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,668
Oh, there was a harvest moon.

375
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,524
You've never seen a moon until
you've watched the one over China Seas.

376
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:49,739
It'll be full by the
time we get to Singapore.

377
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:50,760
Oh glorious.

378
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,028
Say, speaking of meetings Jamesy, do you
remember that night in that putang joint...

379
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:56,735
in Saigon when you and
me met up with a certain party?

380
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:57,892
Oh, do I.

381
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:01,163
There wasn't any moon but he had a shiner
on his left eye that lit up the whole street.

382
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,891
A cut on his right leg, why he'd bled to
death if it hadn't been for China Doll here.

383
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:08,637
- My, that was a romantic meeting.
- She saved his life.

384
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,926
And never got a word
of thank for it, I'll be darned.

385
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,898
I wish I could tell you
what she said when I tried it.

386
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:16,022
You never used to be
so particular about your language.

387
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,123
That's right Dolly.

388
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,439
This will be an awful
comedown after the Royal Mail.

389
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,883
Oh, I don't know, there's something very
real and dramatic about this atmosphere.

390
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:29,495
You know, pirates
and machine guns, barricades...

391
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:32,923
Mr. McCaleb, I want you to meet
a literary rival of yours Mrs. Barclay.

392
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,221
Oh, good evening Mr. McCaleb.

393
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:37,255
Thanks, I've got
all the insurance I can handle.

394
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:42,494
And Mrs. Barclay, I'm sure I
saw you in London two years ago.

395
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,387
Why, of course Miss Yu-LAN,
it was at the American Embassy...

396
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,637
and then again at
the Gainsboroughs' in Sussex.

397
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:52,680
Peg, isn't she the most amazing hostess?
It was only two years before that I...

398
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,314
Too amazing for words, there I was, with a
cinder in me eye as large as a paving block.

399
00:26:57,344 --> 00:26:59,901
With the grand duke on one side
of me and the marquis on the other...

400
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:02,463
both trying to get pull
my top lid over my bottom.

401
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:12,263
Miss Portland is a professional entertainer.

402
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,771
No, I am lady or you'd
like me to try something else.

403
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,335
No, I'm afraid you haven't
anything left for an encore.

404
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,153
So you think it's funny, eh?
What are you grinning at?

405
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,277
- You must be very fond of him.
- What makes you think so?

406
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:29,004
To humiliate yourself like this.

407
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:32,704
I'll see you later Alan.

408
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,009
Don't worry, he knows
where the royal suite is and...

409
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,861
so do I, I had it the
first time I sailed on this ship.

410
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:42,063
The more violent the
storm, the sooner it subsides.

411
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:45,623
When I want you to sound off,
golden bells, I'll pull your rope.

412
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,324
I, I apologize for this
exhibition, it's all my fault.

413
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:54,575
And as the man said when they were about
to hang him, this will be a lesson to me.

414
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:01,345
Madam chairman
and ladies of this literary group...

415
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:05,922
it is with sentiments of profound
respect that I address you this afternoon.

416
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:10,725
Because woman is the mother
of all literature, I thank you.

417
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:16,266
Hey look, I'm awful
sorry I blew up. Honest, I am.

418
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,382
But hookers of scotch and the fact that
I'm so fighting nuts about you, I can...

419
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:22,084
You saved me a lot of trouble,
you painted the whole dirty picture...

420
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,468
for her with a nice, truthful brush, thanks.

421
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,362
Gee toots, don't talk to me like that.
I get scared when you put the freeze on me.

422
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:29,312
Look, I'll go to her...

423
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:32,643
- apologize, do anything in the world you...
- You keep as far away from her as you can.

424
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:34,594
And farther away from me.

425
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:51,629
Come.

426
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:55,213
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Well, what's wrong Mr. Rockwell?

427
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,069
Your navigation chart...

428
00:28:58,158 --> 00:29:02,791
Excuse me sir, this navigation
problem sir, I'm having trouble with it.

429
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:04,165
- Trouble?
- Yes sir.

430
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,951
Yes, I should say you are.

431
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,457
If your figures are correct Mr. Rockwell this
ship is in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

432
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,153
Yes sir, it has me worried sir.

433
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,322
Yes.

434
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:16,558
Well, suppose you try
adding here instead of subtracting.

435
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,749
Perhaps that'll put us
back in the ocean again.

436
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:21,406
Yes sir, thank you sir.

437
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:23,888
- Alright.
- Excuse me sir.

438
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:30,210
How's it toots?

439
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,524
Well, go on and play dumb
if you want to, I just came in to...

440
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,973
tell you I'm not going to come
around and pester you anymore.

441
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:37,608
Look.

442
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,424
I'm taking all my cigarettes.

443
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:47,115
You know, it's
moonlight outside. Gee, it's pretty.

444
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:52,157
Ain't it funny, we always fight when it's
moonlight and make up when it's raining?

445
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,287
It's about time for the rainy
season, ain't it toots?

446
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:01,718
Ah, come on out of the trenches, I'm not
going to throw any bombs, I'm harmless.

447
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:04,728
Yes, of course, you're
as harmless as a revolution.

448
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,639
Well, don't forget your cigarettes.

449
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:11,243
I won't, I know an exit line when I hear one.

450
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,625
Well, anyway, it won't be so
lonely while Jamesy is aboard.

451
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:17,448
I hate to hear you talk like that Dolly.

452
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,117
Well, a gal is got to do the best
she can with what's around.

453
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:21,605
You owe yourself more than that.

454
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:26,904
The trouble is boyfriend, there ain't any
male Mrs. Barclay, so charming, so refined.

455
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,690
The real trouble is there aren't
enough female Mrs. Barclay.

456
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:49,186
Don't give it another thought Alan.

457
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,637
You know, I once hoped you'd
know me very well but not that well.

458
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:58,407
But when you once hoped, you,
you weren't in this part of the world.

459
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,353
No, that's true but here I am.

460
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:07,036
- Yes?
- Captain Gaskell.

461
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,527
Mr. MacArdle wants to go
forward to look after his animals.

462
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:12,473
No MacArdle can't look at his animals.

463
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,650
I wouldn't let an admiral
go forward without a guard.

464
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,165
You find it an exciting part
of the world, don't you?

465
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:22,863
Exciting? Nursing and cursing a bunch of
leftovers who are supposed to be officers...

466
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,431
derelicts for a crew?

467
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,196
But ashore, the glamor of...

468
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:30,386
Yes, you saw me this morning after a trip
ashore, did I look particularly glamorous?

469
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,996
Well, I wasn't thinking of backgrounds.

470
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:38,931
- That girl, she's glamorous, surely.
- Sybil, I don't deny her.

471
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,029
But you know why I came out here,
why I resigned from the service.

472
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,027
- It's all I could do.
- Yes, we...

473
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:49,724
I might've cracked up
Bart's life if you'd stayed.

474
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,477
Sybil.

475
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,336
If I thought there
was the slightest chance, I...

476
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:01,555
I'd stumble out with everything
I wanted to say six years ago, I...

477
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:04,162
Alan, I have a confession to make.

478
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:07,495
I'm not just traveling,
I followed a memory, traced you here.

479
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,918
And now that I've found you,
I don't care how you've lived.

480
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,280
I'll always be in love with you.

481
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,425
I'll jump ship at Singapore.
We'll dig up a magistrate or a chaplain.

482
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,063
A Buddhist monk, if there's
none other. We'll go back together.

483
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:25,312
Oh, England.

484
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,911
I've a place in Sussex with
a fireplace you can stand in.

485
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:28,951
Your cocoa sir.

486
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,299
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Come in old man, come right in.

487
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,555
What's the matter? What happened to you?

488
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:36,723
The chef is been at
the vanilla extract again sir.

489
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:39,499
Wait for me with a cleaver.
A cleaver is a new matter sir.

490
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:42,657
Ah yes. Well, give him a quart of brandy to
taper off on, he be alright in the morning.

491
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,876
Sybil, I want you to meet the best
chief steward in the line, Ted Gary.

492
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:49,703
Honest as the day is long.

493
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,473
And he said to Mrs. Barclay, right in front
of me, I was the best steward in the line.

494
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,675
Honest as the day is long.

495
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,278
And never a word about that
last bottle of whiskey I pinched.

496
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,036
No doubt, the old man is going soft.

497
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,449
Relieved me right in the middle of
me watch so I could come to breakfast.

498
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,386
Called me Bertie.

499
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,468
I had a chew of tobacco in my mouth
as big as that and he never even noticed.

500
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:10,362
And he said he'd take me to the races ashore.

501
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,550
Well...

502
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:17,772
That's the way it is with those
two bottle men, I've never seen it fail.

503
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,821
- All of a sudden...
- I knew a man once in Liverpool that way.

504
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:24,592
Davids.

505
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:38,792
- Aren't you going to wait for your coffee?
- No.

506
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:42,595
- It's too stuffy here.
- And smelly too.

507
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,052
May I please have the sugar sir?

508
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:02,175
Thank you.

509
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:09,503
Mark.

510
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,339
- Good.
- Lovely shot.

511
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:15,819
That's a lovely gun.

512
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,437
I hope that they don't leave
them laying around loose.

513
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:21,267
Captain lock them up all the time we no use.

514
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:22,650
- That's good.
- Mark.

515
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,474
- Hiya.
- Ah, good morning.

516
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:28,300
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

517
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:34,670
I guess she's still burned.

518
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:36,113
Mark.

519
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:40,034
I got it then.

520
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:42,284
I'm afraid you're much
too consistent for me Mrs. Barclay.

521
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,604
Oh, not at all.

522
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,252
Mark.

523
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:52,199
I received your
note, really wasn't necessary.

524
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,025
Oh, I'm sorry I acted so crazy.

525
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:59,788
Say Jamesy, how about you and me starting a
little competition for the common people, eh?

526
00:34:59,818 --> 00:35:02,606
- Alright, I, I'll bet you a shilling.
- Ok.

527
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:03,916
Bring us a gun.

528
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,370
There you are.

529
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:10,102
Are you and Captain Gaskell going to
make your home in Singapore or Hong Kong?

530
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,549
Oh, I don't think we're
going to stay out here at all.

531
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:13,996
Did you hear what she said?

532
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:16,027
It's all over the ship that
they're going to get married...

533
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:17,704
the minute they get into Singapore.

534
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:21,854
- That's why Gaskell is turned sunny side up.
- Mark.

535
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:26,003
I think you're very
wise not to stay in the Orient.

536
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,589
We have a saying out here...

537
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:32,095
After the cheap, strong wine,
the most delicate tea has little flavor.

538
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,331
- Oh, be careful.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I...

539
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,384
Quite all right, you had
no idea the gun was loaded.

540
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:42,148
Oh, you don't think I pointed
it at you on purpose, do you?

541
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,108
There's nothing to think about Miss Portland.

542
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:47,886
The gestures of a woman
like you simply do not exist.

543
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:49,423
Mark.

544
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:54,738
It's beautiful the way these ducks
know how to throw the old harpoon.

545
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,426
That's one of the advantages of
a very fine cosmopolitan education.

546
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,808
Come on Jamesy,
let's you and me take a powder.

547
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:10,943
Clay pigeons, that's the thrilling sort of
life you're headed for in England Alan.

548
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,272
Shooting clay pigeons, eh?

549
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:19,549
Exactly and whether you
believe it or not, I'll revel in it.

550
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,519
Greetings boyfriend.

551
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:27,685
Well I, I understand
congratulations are in order.

552
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:31,677
I'd like to be the first
to wish you the best, you'll need it.

553
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,620
One day, you'll say something
nice and never forgive yourself.

554
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:39,997
Look toots, I...

555
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:44,121
Oh gee, I don't blame you for being sore,
I know I've done a lot of stupid gabbing...

556
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,484
but this is on the
level, I wish you all the luck.

557
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:47,973
And that's one baby you'll never have...

558
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,457
to be ashamed of. She's the
real McCoy and she'll make a...

559
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,339
a marvelous wife for you.

560
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:59,179
- I wish you meant that.
- I do.

561
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,782
Well, well, that's better.

562
00:37:03,832 --> 00:37:07,520
Now, let's quit good friends, instead of like
a couple of cabdrivers after a drunken brawl.

563
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,505
Yeah, I guess that's
the way it ought to be done.

564
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:14,039
But I ain't been brought up to do
the right thing like that English dame.

565
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,467
All I can say is what's down inside of me.

566
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:19,085
And I don't care how long you've
been carrying the torch for her.

567
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:21,204
You can't quit me any more than I can quit...

568
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:24,297
you and you can kiss
a stack of cookbooks on that.

569
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,143
- Thank you.
- Well, anyway it'll be quieter in England.

570
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:47,186
- Wait till you get there, if you ever do.
- What's to keep me?

571
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:52,095
Well, I've been trying it for 30 years,
there's something about this place.

572
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:56,884
From my windows I can see
the whole harbor of Hong Kong.

573
00:37:57,448 --> 00:38:03,121
Big ships coming, big ships going, the
China I know, the China I've helped to make.

574
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:08,166
And on quiet nights, off in the hills,
I can hear the sound of distant firing.

575
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:12,926
They were at it when I came
and they'll be at it after I've gone.

576
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:15,505
More guns won't stop them too many of them.

577
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,169
And the only things they
respect are courage and honor.

578
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:23,819
Yes and England's
power, England's place here...

579
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,287
can never be any greater
than the men who represent her.

580
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:28,875
They might be able to use an
Englishman at home sometime, you know.

581
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:31,308
Oh, I was hoping that
someday you'd take my place.

582
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,984
- I had me eye on you for a long time.
- Well, take it off.

583
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,982
I'm quitting the
China Seas as soon as we dock.

584
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:37,852
Well, if you're...

585
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:40,947
- in earnest?
- Dead earnest.

586
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:44,904
I'd better be looking for
somebody to take your command, eh?

587
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,197
What about Dawson?

588
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,532
Dawson? Take my ship?

589
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:53,024
I've always heard you speak highly of him.

590
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,237
Yes. Yes, of course I speak highly of him.

591
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:00,672
Dawson is one of the best.

592
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,560
Absolutely, you couldn't do better.

593
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:08,353
Dawson?

594
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,162
I never forget a name or a face,
now, I've seen you somewhere before.

595
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,429
You've seen me a dozen times a day since...

596
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,579
No, don't tell me, don't tell
me, it's on the tip of my tongue.

597
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:28,985
The name is Timmons,
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.

598
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,380
How do you pronounce that?

599
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:36,336
Timmons, Timmons, Timmons, T- I - M - M...

600
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:42,073
I thought he said Timmons.

601
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,483
I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.

602
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,311
My compliments to Mr. Dawson.

603
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:52,533
- Tell him I'll be up on the bridge shortly.
- I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.

604
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:55,137
Whoopee, are you good Jamesy?

605
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:59,026
- Attaboy Jamesy.
- You called sir?

606
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:02,821
What? Oh, yes, yes. See that all the
staterooms and portholes are secured.

607
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:06,125
- We're in for a blow.
- Will it be a real storm Alan? Terrifying?

608
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:08,315
All seas aren't alike, can't tell much more.

609
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,557
I did hope for your sake,
though, it'd be an easy trip.

610
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,600
That's too much to
expect from the China Seas.

611
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:13,990
Attaboy...

612
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,029
Anything else sir?

613
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:18,508
What? Yes.

614
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,511
Might tell them that anybody
that can't hold his or her liquor...

615
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,465
better lay off until this blows is over.

616
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:28,470
I'm afraid you're a good influence
on him Sybil and I deplore it.

617
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:31,611
- Alright, here we go again.
- I beg your pardon.

618
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:35,945
Here's to the health of
Admiral Puff Puff Puff, three times.

619
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,726
- Ok?
- Perfect.

620
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:53,060
- I think you did one bounce too many.
- Ah, she was all right.

621
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,547
I had my eye on her just like a hawk.

622
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:57,814
My dear fellow,
what do you suppose I was doing?

623
00:40:57,844 --> 00:41:00,106
Oh, there's two against one, two against one.

624
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:03,343
Captain says the weather
is blowing up, a word to the wise.

625
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,449
Come on Jamesy, we're off again.

626
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:13,115
Greatest game in the world, that
makes men remember and women forget.

627
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:17,775
I'll play this game until you can't
remember anything but your little Jamesy.

628
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,855
Here's to the health
of Admiral Puff three times.

629
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,715
Keno, you forgot to say
Admiral Puff Puff Puff.

630
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:27,132
Oh, doggone it anyway, I...

631
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:30,931
- Drink up sir and start all over again.
- Come on, down the hatch.

632
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:36,655
Ah, don't look so sad toots, you doing swell.

633
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:41,978
Have you ever noticed Sir Guy, that a man
is never angry with a woman he doesn't like?

634
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:45,158
- I had not, until now.
- Me either.

635
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:49,653
And I shall be more pleasant
to her after this, shall we?

636
00:41:54,622 --> 00:41:57,529
Good evening
skipper, how's the barometer doing?

637
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:00,948
- Falling to a new low.
- Well, don't let that worry you captain.

638
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,240
Say, where you been
keeping yourself stranger?

639
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,073
Have breakfast with me in the
morning, if you can eat anything.

640
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:09,938
I'll be there, nothing takes my appetite.

641
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:12,513
Say, how about joining
the game that kills all care?

642
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,868
Oh, I'm afraid it
would kill me too, good night.

643
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:18,761
Kill nothing, all you need is a
wooden, hollow leg to play this game.

644
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,777
Here's to the health of Admiral...

645
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:23,876
- Prosit.
- Prosit.

646
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,818
Missed out again Jamesy, sock it down boy.

647
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,468
It's thickening up like mud
sir, we're running right into it.

648
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:45,655
Running into it? We're in it already.

649
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:48,073
Why don't you keep her on her course?

650
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:49,874
What you trying to do?
Write your name in the ocean?

651
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:55,939
Old man is getting back to normal,
good thing with this coming on.

652
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:58,880
Put your oilskins on and get to your
stations, stick her nose right into it.

653
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,743
Yes sir.

654
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,325
Mr. Davids, tell the steward
to look out for his passage...

655
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,054
- better get life belts on them.
- Yes sir.

656
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,633
- Exciting sir, isn't it? My first typhoon.
- Really?

657
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,835
Well, if you live long enough
you may see another one sometime.

658
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:12,308
- Get to your station.
- Yes sir.

659
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:13,857
Excuse me sir.

660
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:24,508
Chief, keep up a full head
of steam, we're in for a twister.

661
00:43:46,677 --> 00:43:48,892
Good old Grandfather.

662
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:17,280
Don't get panicky, just stick by me.

663
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:53,623
Hey, stop showing off, come on up here.

664
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:06,941
Come on lady, slip into this.

665
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:09,718
I really shouldn't you know, with my figure.

666
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,555
Tie it up in the front.

667
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:12,226
Let me help you miss.

668
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,603
You've lost your pearls.

669
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,872
No, I, I broke the
string Mr.Romanoff has them.

670
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,464
Yes, yes, I will restring them
for her as soon as we get out of this.

671
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:21,617
Oh, I never want to see them again.
Throw them away, do anything you please.

672
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,033
Oh, if we only come out of this alive.

673
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:27,857
Now, now, Poopsie, don't let a
little wind blow you off your feet.

674
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,729
Have you seen Miss Portland sir?

675
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:33,677
- Isn't she in her cabin?
- No.

676
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,585
By Jove, if she went out on deck
in the condition she was in...

677
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:39,817
You all, you all don't suppose
she's been washed overboard?

678
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:52,002
Can't find Miss Portland sir, afraid
she may have been washed overboard.

679
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,089
- Keep your hand to it.
- Aye, aye sir.

680
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,052
- Where's MacArdle?
- His door is locked sir.

681
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,701
- Why didn't you break it down?
- Was afraid to without orders.

682
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:23,274
That's the game, you old beachcomber,
I beat you, you hear that? I won.

683
00:46:25,004 --> 00:46:26,184
Prosit.

684
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:32,855
Hey, that's the typhoon,
that's the typhoon Jamesy.

685
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,787
Come on, give me
the other 20 you owe me, come on.

686
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:40,386
Ah, quit stalling Jamesy,
and give me that 20 you owe me.

687
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:44,215
Alright, if you won't
give it to me, I'll take it.

688
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,860
What a twister that was.

689
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,897
Hello Dolly.

690
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,232
Well, where you going?

691
00:47:39,392 --> 00:47:42,743
Winners always go home, don't they?
What's the idea of locking the door?

692
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:44,441
- Caveman stuff, eh?
- Oh no, it's...

693
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:48,028
- It's just a force of habit Dolly.
- Say, are you trying to insult me?

694
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:50,205
Did I ever take anything
that wasn't coming to me?

695
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:54,993
Why darling, you, you know that you
could have anything that I've got, anytime.

696
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:07,845
- Now, come on you, fork that over.
- Alright welsher.

697
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:12,121
There's £200 that I won and I won on the
level, if you ain't a good enough sport...

698
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:15,155
No, you don't, you
know what I'm talking about.

699
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:17,778
You know what I mean.

700
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:24,027
You know, it's pretty stormy out there and
you never know when you might wash overboard.

701
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:25,873
- Say, are you threatening me?
- Dolly, you've seen it.

702
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,265
- I haven't.
- I tell you, you've seen it.

703
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:28,676
I haven't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

704
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:32,255
I'm talking about that half of the £100
note that you just took from my wallet.

705
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,461
I don't know what you're saying
but I'll forget you ever said anything.

706
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,946
Dolly, it would do you
no good to double cross me.

707
00:48:37,106 --> 00:48:39,767
- Oh, this is a hanging matter.
- I don't want to hear another word.

708
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:42,704
If it was anybody else but
you, I'd chuck you overboard.

709
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,650
But I'm so crazy about
you it's eating my insides out.

710
00:48:47,816 --> 00:48:49,259
- You're in with me.
- I don't want to be, I...

711
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:53,572
Dolly, you're in with me, there's a quarter
of a million pounds of gold on this ship.

712
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,656
Your share will make you a rich woman.
We can go anywhere, do anything.

713
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:58,480
Look, I'm no good to you.

714
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,416
- What do you want with me?
- Because you're a smart girl.

715
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,543
You're smart enough to hide that note,
you're smart enough to know what it means.

716
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,581
- Yeah, I'm smart enough to stay out of this.
- Even as much as I love you...

717
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,491
you're in with me from now on or else...

718
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:12,285
I'm going to break that pretty
little neck of yours just like...

719
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,172
- The marines have landed.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

720
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:22,671
Dolly and I were just
sealing a little partnership...

721
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,798
which I hope she'll
never have cause to regret.

722
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,917
Perhaps you better do your sealing in the
main salon where there's lot more witnesses.

723
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:29,596
Maybe you're right captain.

724
00:49:55,977 --> 00:49:57,258
Look out.

725
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,972
- Hold her.
- That was a near thing Alan.

726
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,843
Dawson.

727
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:10,103
- Get some lines, lash this down.
- Come here with that line.

728
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:11,556
Hey, come here.

729
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:20,873
- Cold darling?
- Yeah, yeah, cold, that's it.

730
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,587
You with me?

731
00:50:25,713 --> 00:50:29,043
- It's a tough ocean to try and swim in.
- That's a good girl.

732
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,463
Now, you keep miles away
from that fella Gaskell or...

733
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:35,169
I might think that you're
trying to double-cross me.

734
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,396
Captain Gaskell,
the steamroller is loose sir.

735
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:56,517
It'll mash those
coolies like a lot of turnips.

736
00:50:56,547 --> 00:50:58,117
Oh, the poor devils.

737
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:15,097
Let it go overboard.

738
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:34,200
Come on.

739
00:51:35,878 --> 00:51:37,683
Close up that rail.

740
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:49,783
Davids, lend a hand.

741
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,844
Get the tarps off those winches.

742
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,457
Alright, turn on the steam.

743
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,232
Go to your quarters, you're under arrest.

744
00:54:16,384 --> 00:54:17,520
Well, what do you want?

745
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,533
I want to thank you
sir, for saving my life sir.

746
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,898
- Oh, go to bed.
- Is it all over sir?

747
00:54:25,323 --> 00:54:28,461
Yeah, we'll stand regular watch from now on.

748
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:37,640
Mr. Kingston, what time do you come on watch?

749
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,312
- Eight bells sir.
- You're one minute late.

750
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,680
I'm sorry sir.

751
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:43,774
Keep her half speed and make
your repairs on the port engine.

752
00:54:43,804 --> 00:54:44,790
Aye, aye sir.

753
00:54:46,423 --> 00:54:49,317
- Davids is here sir.
- Yes.

754
00:54:50,508 --> 00:54:51,430
Alright.

755
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,606
I know what I'd do
with him if this was my ship.

756
00:54:55,886 --> 00:54:57,641
Well, wait till you get a ship.

757
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,190
Mr. Davids...

758
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,503
Yes sir.

759
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:12,192
Mr. Davids, for the rest of this
voyage, you'll be relieved of...

760
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,152
duty and confined to your quarters in arrest.

761
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:17,541
When we reach port, I'll have to
turn you in to the board of trade...

762
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,467
for neglect of duty
and disobedience of orders.

763
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:22,041
I don't blame you sir.

764
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,653
But it's funny somehow, during
the year I've been on the beach...

765
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:27,727
I've prayed every day for a chance.

766
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:31,143
And then when I got it, I couldn't make good.

767
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:35,138
I'm just a washout, that's all.

768
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,313
I'm sorry Davids.

769
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:43,848
- Call me when you relieve the watch.
- Yes sir.

770
00:55:48,243 --> 00:55:50,343
This will cost you your ticket.

771
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:18,130
It's me toots, I've been
waiting for you to come off watch.

772
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,732
Get out of here.

773
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,734
Look, I got a mighty good
reason for being here.

774
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:23,300
You've always got a good
reason for anything you're doing.

775
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,918
In fact, I don't know anybody
who could think up any...

776
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,591
more remarkable good reasons
than you can on short notice.

777
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:29,721
Listen to me toots, I took
an awful chance coming here.

778
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:32,569
- I might have got heaved overboard.
- Well, don't run any more risk by staying.

779
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,856
- Get off on the rest of your rounds.
- Toots, you got to listen to me.

780
00:56:34,886 --> 00:56:37,802
- I only came here for one thing.
- I'm quite aware of that.

781
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:40,577
You're always waiting
for a sailor, to comfort him...

782
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:44,795
as only a woman like you can comfort a man
who's too tired or too drunk to care who is.

783
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:47,983
Toots, don't be like that, if you keep that
up you got to talk yourself right out of...

784
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:48,835
I hope so.

785
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,384
Oh, you hope so, do you?

786
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:59,015
Well, you've been begging
for it, now you're going to get it.

787
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,677
You won't be so high and mighty
when I get through with you.

788
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:05,645
You just wait, I'll fix you, you'll be lower
than a coolie, you'll be lower than Davids.

789
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,360
You'll come crawling to me on your knees.

790
00:57:16,428 --> 00:57:19,950
I warned you not to double cross me.

791
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,390
You said you could use the gun.

792
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,738
Well darling, you're a marvel.

793
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,171
You're a real partner.

794
00:57:38,445 --> 00:57:39,689
You know, I thought that you was going...

795
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:43,630
What is it matter what you thought I
was going to do? You got what you wanted.

796
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,508
Ah, don't take it so hard Dolly.

797
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:49,342
Oh, take what too hard?
I got what I wanted too.

798
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:53,863
I guess.

799
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,942
Sparks, Sparks.

800
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:35,669
Look out sir Malays.

801
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:51,021
Oh look, they're bringing them right now.

802
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,709
Got a cigarette Jamesy?

803
01:00:03,115 --> 01:00:04,806
I thought you said nobody get hurt.

804
01:00:06,112 --> 01:00:07,803
You can't expect the boys to stand there...

805
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,906
and take it after someone
cuts loose at them, can you?

806
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:15,410
- I must've been crazy, stark staring crazy.
- Take it easy, take it easy.

807
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,420
Be careful.

808
01:00:30,685 --> 01:00:32,888
What you hiding those pearls for?
They do not worth anything.

809
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:34,030
I don't want to lose them.

810
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,101
You're perfectly right my dear, I've
been through one of these things before.

811
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:38,835
They take everything in sight.

812
01:00:38,997 --> 01:00:40,969
Something funny about
those pearls, I'm going to have...

813
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,467
appraised when we get to Singapore.

814
01:00:42,497 --> 01:00:44,373
Wilbur, don't be insane.

815
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,695
Every one of those guns
came out of our arsenal.

816
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:00,871
- Our arsenal sir?
- Yes.

817
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:03,100
I don't see how they could've
broken down the steel door.

818
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:15,405
An-may in the ife-lay oat-bay.

819
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,025
- Davids.
- Yes Dawson.

820
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,013
- No savvy Malay.
- Do you?

821
01:01:32,308 --> 01:01:34,756
Not enough but MacArdle does, I'm sure.

822
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:37,273
Hey look here, don't any
of these fellows speak English?

823
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,208
No savvy.

824
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:42,298
Now, isn't that just
too bad? Oh, that's terrible.

825
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:43,241
Yes.

826
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:47,303
Look here, whoever
you are, in that lifeboat out there...

827
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:50,541
there are some mills bombs in
the seat locker in my quarters.

828
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:54,793
Yeah, if you're not too badly hurt
watch your chance and try and get them.

829
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,521
I'll hold them here as long as I can.

830
01:01:58,058 --> 01:02:00,428
- No savvy.
- No savvy?

831
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,922
There's your chance Mr. Dawson.

832
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:11,364
- And get those bombs.
- He's crazy, what's the use?

833
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,012
- I'd only be shot at.
- Yes.

834
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,303
I understand Mr. Dawson.

835
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,772
Get out of my way.

836
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:44,454
As far as I can make out, he comes from
a very royal family and is very sorry to...

837
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:48,283
- disturb you like this.
- Why, no disturbance at all.

838
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,792
He wishes to assure you
that no one will be harmed.

839
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:54,224
If you will open the strongbox...

840
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:59,488
he'll willingly take the gold and depart with
only the friendliest feelings toward you.

841
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:04,034
- Open the safe.
- Yes sir.

842
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,585
You haven't lost your ticket ye, old man.

843
01:03:09,924 --> 01:03:13,190
If you want me to, I'll be only too
glad to put in a good word for you.

844
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:07,206
Where's Alan? You don't
think they'll hurt him, do you?

845
01:04:07,236 --> 01:04:12,110
No, no, of course not, my dear, no.
No, they need the captain healthy.

846
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,889
I'm sorry Poopsie, looks
like that guy did the appraising.

847
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:51,591
Why that's sand, you're pretty smart Gaskell.

848
01:04:52,362 --> 01:04:55,957
Well, apparently the bank
patronized some other line.

849
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,478
You can't fool these Malays with
an old trick like the boxes of sand.

850
01:04:59,508 --> 01:05:01,532
Why, whoever is at the
head of this gang is got brains.

851
01:05:01,562 --> 01:05:03,465
They know when there's gold on board a ship.

852
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,848
Why, their spies tell
them about every shipment...

853
01:05:05,878 --> 01:05:07,807
of gold that leaves any bank in Hong Kong.

854
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,456
Listen MacArdle, make it clear to him.

855
01:05:09,486 --> 01:05:11,778
If there was any gold aboard,
he could have it and welcome.

856
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:15,116
Listen man, I'm talking to you
as though I'm your own brother.

857
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:17,306
Save yourself while there's still time.

858
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:22,918
Look here, that's my skipper, you can't...

859
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:26,844
Looks as if the party came too late.

860
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:29,534
Why, it's the boot, the Malay boot.

861
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:33,141
- Why, that's cruel torture.
- Size is 9C.

862
01:05:33,171 --> 01:05:34,996
Why, you're not going to let him torture you?

863
01:05:35,026 --> 01:05:36,386
Have you any suggestions?

864
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,320
- Is that the latest style?
- Don't let them do that man.

865
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,771
Why, you'll never be able to use your...

866
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,487
- foot again.
- Listen Jamesy, you're a fast talker.

867
01:06:10,517 --> 01:06:12,647
Better one I've ever seen,
tell him something, tell him anything.

868
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,700
Tell him the bank fooled
me as much as it did him.

869
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:17,108
I've talked my head off, he won't listen.

870
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:21,805
Tell him where it is, I can't bear it.

871
01:06:21,835 --> 01:06:24,678
It's killing me to stand here
and not be able to help you.

872
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:27,829
- I can't bear it.
- Well, put your fingers in your ears.

873
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,269
Stubborn half-wit.

874
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:13,717
- Gaskell, my boy Gaskell.
- Don't start counting, I'm getting up.

875
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,422
Please tell them where it is Gaskell.

876
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:20,252
Why, it's breaking my
heart to see you suffer like this.

877
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,663
There can't be any gold, he would've talked.

878
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:54,071
Nobody could be that tough.

879
01:07:57,363 --> 01:07:58,733
Come on, club out.

880
01:08:22,662 --> 01:08:23,968
Die you...

881
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,304
Oh, you poor boy, you.

882
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:30,486
I made them understand there's no gold here.

883
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:33,466
It was Jamesy that
saved your poor feet for you.

884
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:34,107
Are they gone?

885
01:08:34,137 --> 01:08:36,732
Yes, it's all right,
they're getting into the junk.

886
01:08:38,051 --> 01:08:41,649
Here, take it easy, there's
nothing you can do. Here Gaskell.

887
01:09:09,367 --> 01:09:10,647
Davids.

888
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,385
- Davids.
- Davids.

889
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,986
Shut your mouth.

890
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,904
- I got the bombs.
- Good, good, let me have this one.

891
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,787
Keep clear while I blow my way out.

892
01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:27,268
And thanks Davids.

893
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:29,321
Can you make it over
and heave it in that junk?

894
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:30,845
I'll try.

895
01:09:33,344 --> 01:09:37,045
Davids, remember after you pull the pin,
you only got five seconds until it goes off.

896
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:43,000
- You're crazy, you'll get us all killed.
- Get back.

897
01:09:59,009 --> 01:09:59,867
One.

898
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:02,147
Two.

899
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:03,517
Three.

900
01:10:04,349 --> 01:10:05,361
Four.

901
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:47,764
Hey, a little less noise please.

902
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:04,567
Captain Gaskell?

903
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:09,690
- What you find?
- Not even a scratch on the door sir.

904
01:11:09,844 --> 01:11:11,934
The arsenal must've been opened with a key.

905
01:11:14,722 --> 01:11:17,066
Tell the chief steward to bring
MacArdle and Miss Porter to my cabin.

906
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:18,206
Yes sir.

907
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:23,777
Listen darling, where did you put
that half of the hundred pound note?

908
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:25,758
- I know it's safe but I got to...
- I hid it.

909
01:11:25,788 --> 01:11:28,849
- Where?
- In Gaskell's cabin, in a tin of cigarettes.

910
01:11:28,879 --> 01:11:31,909
- Well, aren't you a wonder.
- It's safe.

911
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:34,829
He won't find it, he doesn't smoke my kind.

912
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:37,664
- Oh, quit worrying, I'll get it.
- No, you won't.

913
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:40,517
You'll stay right where
you are till this thing blows over.

914
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,390
Now, promise me darling, that
you won't go near the place.

915
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,853
That's easy. I wouldn't
exactly enjoy looking...

916
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,645
Looking at his bandaged feet.

917
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,139
Well, that's too bad.

918
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,883
But what about us?
What about the poor devils he captured?

919
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,550
You know, I wouldn't put it past him
to use the Chinese boot on them.

920
01:11:57,969 --> 01:12:00,553
- If he does, they'll talk.
- Oh, he won't use the boot.

921
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:03,590
- He'd never hit a man below the belt.
- Well, we're not hung yet.

922
01:12:03,809 --> 01:12:06,533
Gaskell may suspect the whole
world but he's got to prove it.

923
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:09,701
- Well, let him prove it, let him prove it.
- Are you out of your mind?

924
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:14,528
Alright, come in.

925
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:18,634
Captain Gaskell's compliments
and will you come to his cabin?

926
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:20,407
And you too Miss Portland.

927
01:12:22,687 --> 01:12:23,725
Just a minute.

928
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:30,510
- Jamesy, that...
- Now, now, now, wait a minute.

929
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,392
It's simply a matter of routine.

930
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:35,984
If it comes to the worst, I'm the only
one that he can prove anything against.

931
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:39,180
So you just sit tight
and keep a stiff upper lip.

932
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:41,029
Alright bozo.

933
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:44,543
Order me an upper and lower
and I'll keep them both stiff.

934
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:47,008
Alright, come on, answer.

935
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:49,553
- After you left my cabin, where you go?
- Back to my own quarters.

936
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,124
- What time was that?
- About half past 11.

937
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:54,010
- Was anybody there?
- Nobody but Isabel, I told her to go to bed.

938
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,041
Your maid says she was asleep
at a quarter after 9, two hours before.

939
01:12:57,071 --> 01:13:00,184
Ah, it's always a quarter after 9 to that
numbskull, it's the only time she knows.

940
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:03,138
- Did anybody come to your cabin later?
- My dates are my own now.

941
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:06,621
The deck watch saw a man leaving your cabin
after 1 o'clock, that was you, wasn't it?

942
01:13:06,651 --> 01:13:09,673
- Look here Alan, that's not...
- I'm conducting this inquiry Sir Guy.

943
01:13:10,288 --> 01:13:11,295
That was you, wasn't it?

944
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:13,477
What do you want me to do?
Blacken the lady's name?

945
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:16,033
- That was Jamesy, wasn't it?
- Well, supposing it was, what then?

946
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:16,955
Why was he in your cabin?

947
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:19,944
He came to borrow a hot
water bottle for one of his pigs.

948
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,320
- Got a cigarette Jamesy?
- No darling.

949
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:25,933
- Here, here you better have one of your own.
- No, never mind, I don't...

950
01:13:25,963 --> 01:13:28,975
No, no bother at all, I know what
these little attentions mean to a woman.

951
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,688
Well I, I don't want one now.
I guess it's just nerves, I...

952
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:36,720
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry you don't feel well, you
rode out the piracy as such a good shape.

953
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:41,432
- Perhaps you'd like one.
- Well, well, thank you.

954
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:46,388
The captain is far more generous with
your cigarettes than you ever were.

955
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:49,000
Too generous. I guess I'll take
them home with me while there's...

956
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,448
still a couple left for myself.

957
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:55,647
- How many tins have you Jamesy?
- One.

958
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:58,925
- Four and one are five, are...
- Lose any?

959
01:13:59,322 --> 01:14:01,256
I thought I left six here.

960
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:04,581
Oh, yes, yes, so you did, I almost forgot.

961
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,622
I don't understand
this cat and mouse business.

962
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:07,877
Is this the one?

963
01:14:08,888 --> 01:14:10,336
Yes, that's it.

964
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:19,581
You won't find what you're looking for,
I've both halves of the hundred pound note.

965
01:14:19,611 --> 01:14:21,934
Oh, what are you browbeating the girl for?

966
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,592
Just a minute MacArdle, your turn is next.

967
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:28,674
One half of the note was found on a
dead pirate, the other half was hidden...

968
01:14:30,237 --> 01:14:31,569
in her cigarette tin.

969
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:34,553
Hello.

970
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:40,072
- These Chinese characters look familiar.
- Yes, they're MacArdle's shipping symbol.

971
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:43,685
Well, that's queer.

972
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,357
If I wasn't sure of it, why, I'd
swear that I wrote those characters.

973
01:14:47,387 --> 01:14:49,700
I'll swear you wrote them
MacArdle before any admiralty court.

974
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,519
Yes? Well, what will your oath prove?

975
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,729
Save your breath MacArdle, we
caught two of your men, they've talked.

976
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:57,641
- You used the Chinese boot on them.
- No, I saved that for you, if I needed it.

977
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:02,304
How did you manage to get the ship's rifles?
You couldn't have done a thing without them.

978
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:06,474
You've answered to all the
questions so far, don't stop now.

979
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:08,133
Alright, I won't.

980
01:15:08,585 --> 01:15:10,106
- You gave him the key to the arsenal.
- Me?

981
01:15:10,107 --> 01:15:10,839
She gave me nothing.

982
01:15:10,869 --> 01:15:13,013
You were the only one who knew where it
was besides myself, you came to my cabin...

983
01:15:13,043 --> 01:15:14,668
- Alright, you lost it.
- Waited till I passed out...

984
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:16,829
- get to the key and handle over to MacArdle.
- That's a dirty rotten lie,

985
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:18,448
I'll sue the line and get plenty too.

986
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:20,405
- Defaming a lady's character...
- Yes, quartermaster.

987
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:23,641
- Yes sir?
- Tell the sergeant at guard to come here.

988
01:15:23,671 --> 01:15:26,688
And send a radio message to the
police superintendent in Singapore.

989
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,203
- Tell him to meet us at the dock, urgent.
- Urgent, yes sir.

990
01:15:29,342 --> 01:15:31,521
And you better send
for a squad of lawyers too if...

991
01:15:31,551 --> 01:15:33,097
you think you going to pin anything on me.

992
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:35,310
- What a dirty little snake you are.
- What's that to you?

993
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,774
Getting into my cabin because I trusted you.

994
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:38,145
- Trust? When do you really trust...
- Waiting for a chance to...

995
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:39,222
- do your double cross.
- I didn't.

996
01:15:39,252 --> 01:15:40,478
- Turning on your own people.
- I didn't, I...

997
01:15:40,508 --> 01:15:43,304
- Sold out every man woman coming on-board.
- Alright then, I did.

998
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:46,742
I stole the key, yes,
I stole it and gave it to Jamesy.

999
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:50,938
But I came to your cabin to warn you about
him, figure it out for yourself why I didn't.

1000
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:53,706
I'd have stood and
fought back to back with you.

1001
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,577
But you taught me
something I didn't even know myself.

1002
01:15:57,026 --> 01:16:01,803
When a woman can love a man right down to her
fingertips, she can hate him the same way.

1003
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:05,345
Now call your cops, call every
cop in the country, I don't care.

1004
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:07,806
If you can dish it out, I can take it.

1005
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:16,138
You fool, you hotheaded, crazy little fool.

1006
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:24,675
And me thinking all the time
that my powers of fascination had won her.

1007
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:28,906
Ah, don't be so tough Gaskell.

1008
01:16:30,072 --> 01:16:32,888
China Doll had nothing to do with it at all.

1009
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:38,441
You think it's as simple as all that?
I'm not the judge, the jury and the law.

1010
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,988
You'll find that out soon enough.

1011
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:45,658
No, I won't. I've fooled them many
a time before and I've done it again.

1012
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:49,568
I've cost you millions,
and I'd still be fooling them...

1013
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:52,165
if it wasn't for the
little yellow haired lass sad...

1014
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,759
that wouldn't even
give me the time of the day.

1015
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:02,740
- What's wrong MacArdle?
- Nothing, nothing.

1016
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:05,829
Nothing at all.

1017
01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:14,135
One of those pills will make
a pig sleep the entire voyage.

1018
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,775
- I'll sleep until kingdom come.
- Get a doctor quick.

1019
01:17:20,006 --> 01:17:21,506
Jamesy.

1020
01:17:23,826 --> 01:17:27,909
I had a chance darling,
to throw you overboard.

1021
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:31,324
If I had, I'd still be safe.

1022
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:37,324
Loving you is the only
decent thing I ever did in my life.

1023
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,322
Even that was a mistake.

1024
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:52,496
- You sent for me sir?
- Take Miss Porter to her cabin.

1025
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,265
Keep a close watch
over her until further orders.

1026
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,380
Aye sir.

1027
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,074
Well, he's out of it anyway.

1028
01:17:59,277 --> 01:18:02,251
- He finished the game the way he played it.
- Yeah, tough.

1029
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:06,814
He didn't yell no dice when they
rolled against him, I won't either.

1030
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:08,852
Good luck toots.

1031
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:28,961
- Singapore.
- So am I, where are you from?

1032
01:18:40,574 --> 01:18:43,877
Lordy, Lordy. Now I got enough
clothes to last me a million years.

1033
01:18:43,907 --> 01:18:46,021
Well, I hope you have
better luck in them than I did.

1034
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,355
Don't you worry
Miss Dolly, I got me a conjure.

1035
01:18:48,726 --> 01:18:51,726
The left hind leg of a black cat
that's been killed by a snakebite.

1036
01:18:51,756 --> 01:18:54,841
Nothing going to touch me
no matter what they does to you.

1037
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:00,941
Yes?

1038
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,936
Well darling, have
you put your house in order?

1039
01:19:03,966 --> 01:19:05,581
No, it's in a worse mess than ever.

1040
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:09,350
Sybil, I should've told you before, I'll
be tied up here for weeks at the hearing.

1041
01:19:09,504 --> 01:19:12,695
Now Alan dear, what are you
trying to tell me? Be frank.

1042
01:19:12,926 --> 01:19:14,093
That's just it...

1043
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:17,489
I want you to escape all the frankness it's
going to be thrown around the next few weeks.

1044
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:20,130
Everybody will know about it, read about it.

1045
01:19:20,283 --> 01:19:22,399
Even at home, for
that matter, the people you know.

1046
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:24,921
But you can live
down a scandal if you want to.

1047
01:19:25,062 --> 01:19:27,625
Yes but this will
have an official stamp on it.

1048
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:30,637
I'll have to get up
in court, tell the whole story.

1049
01:19:31,048 --> 01:19:32,868
I want to Sybil, because I'm involved.

1050
01:19:33,573 --> 01:19:36,354
In fact, I'm as guilty as she.

1051
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:39,915
Guilty? Oh, what nonsense.
How could you be Alan?

1052
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:40,656
I am though.

1053
01:19:41,953 --> 01:19:44,047
She tried to warn me about
MacArdle, I wouldn't listen.

1054
01:19:45,277 --> 01:19:46,820
I nearly threw her out.

1055
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:51,178
With as dirty an insult
as a man could give a woman.

1056
01:19:52,784 --> 01:19:55,204
- That's not like you.
- I don't know why.

1057
01:19:56,264 --> 01:19:59,934
Except, I'd just seen
her in MacArdle's cabin.

1058
01:20:01,277 --> 01:20:03,265
I didn't think she get skid that far.

1059
01:20:08,872 --> 01:20:10,506
And you're really in love with...

1060
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:14,942
this old tub after all.

1061
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:18,174
No, no but it's that too.

1062
01:20:18,904 --> 01:20:20,626
After all you can't pile up 6 years...

1063
01:20:20,656 --> 01:20:22,521
of something and then
just leave in the flash, you know?

1064
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:24,171
No.

1065
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:26,611
No, of course not.

1066
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:34,667
Well, I'm off to the hotel.
I'll take the next boat home.

1067
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:38,916
You know, I came
15,000 miles to find you Alan.

1068
01:20:39,162 --> 01:20:40,931
Now you're further away than you ever were.

1069
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,704
You wouldn't like that fireplace in Sussex.

1070
01:20:44,197 --> 01:20:46,223
I think that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

1071
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:51,891
Sybil, aren't you clinging to
something that I could never be again?

1072
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:54,130
Yes, perhaps I am.

1073
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,017
But I think that's the only
beautiful way it ever could be.

1074
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:02,022
- Goodbye Alan.
- Goodbye Sybil.

1075
01:21:09,643 --> 01:21:12,342
Come on, you large, limping seagull.

1076
01:21:12,637 --> 01:21:14,220
Come to the office and resign.

1077
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,183
Don't worry about that,
I'll resign soon enough.

1078
01:21:16,213 --> 01:21:18,198
All I got to do is scratch
my name on a piece of paper.

1079
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:21,939
Around this madhouse, it's always a million
things to do before you can do what you want.

1080
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,346
- I'll make it easy, honest I will Poopsie.
- Good bye.

1081
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:33,827
Hey, you're just the guy, where can I pick
up a string of genuine pearls for the missus?

1082
01:21:33,857 --> 01:21:36,558
Oh, yes, yes, I'll be
very glad to arrange it for you.

1083
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:39,249
That's a pal, I told you
I'd square with you Poopsie.

1084
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:40,657
You squared it beautifully.

1085
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,071
Bank sent for the gold sir.

1086
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:47,906
- Alright, turn it over to them.
- But there isn't any gold sir.

1087
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,845
- The boxes were full of sand.
- Oh yes, yes, so they were.

1088
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:53,011
The shipment is in
the toolbox of the steamroller.

1089
01:21:54,436 --> 01:21:56,745
Steamroller? Toolbox?

1090
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:02,442
That stumps me sir, I never
would've thought of looking for it there.

1091
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:05,050
No, I was counting on that.

1092
01:22:12,221 --> 01:22:14,854
Oh, so you decided
to make the trip after all?

1093
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:17,998
Yes. Yes, I just came
along looking for local color.

1094
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,949
Local color, phooey. If anybody
could get local color, I can get it.

1095
01:22:29,019 --> 01:22:32,012
These streets are in deplorable condition.

1096
01:22:34,237 --> 01:22:37,977
Quartermaster, fish him out before he
soaks up all the local color in the harbor.

1097
01:22:38,222 --> 01:22:39,174
Aye, aye sir.

1098
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,480
Come in.

1099
01:22:46,614 --> 01:22:49,879
- Is the police superintendent ready?
- He'll be here any minute now, come on.

1100
01:22:50,634 --> 01:22:51,699
Goodbye, Isabel.

1101
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,390
Goodbye Miss Dolly,
you sure been mighty good to me,

1102
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,982
- Skip it.
- Even if they does hang you.

1103
01:23:01,297 --> 01:23:03,311
Well, there's the old Quien-Howe.

1104
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,300
Aren't they ever
going to paint that smokestack?

1105
01:23:05,956 --> 01:23:09,286
Boy, how you used to crab about it
when you were first mate on her.

1106
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:12,666
Seems like a thousand years ago.

1107
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,417
Well, you don't need
to talk if you don't want to.

1108
01:23:15,447 --> 01:23:18,403
I was only doing it for
the benefit of those mugs back there.

1109
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,716
That's what I thought.

1110
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,743
I've never seen the time yet
when you could overlook an audience.

1111
01:23:23,773 --> 01:23:26,950
That's more like it, it's kind of good
to have you barking at me again.

1112
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,862
Always worrying about
your performance, you don't care...

1113
01:23:28,867 --> 01:23:30,643
about anything except, how is the act going?

1114
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:33,682
What you crying for?

1115
01:23:34,262 --> 01:23:35,186
I can't help it.

1116
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:38,326
Get in there and quit that blubbering.

1117
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:45,623
- Now, listen to me numbskull.
- I'm all ears.

1118
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:48,066
My official job ends when I turn
you over to the police superintendent.

1119
01:23:48,346 --> 01:23:49,663
From then on,
I'll be on your side of the fence.

1120
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:52,695
Oh, what's the use? I'll plead
guilty and take what's coming.

1121
01:23:52,725 --> 01:23:55,982
- You're going to tell the whole truth.
- Sure I am, that's the least I can do.

1122
01:23:56,012 --> 01:23:57,609
And I'm going to tell the truth, everything.

1123
01:23:57,639 --> 01:24:00,026
That you tried to warn me,
that, well, that I was drunk.

1124
01:24:00,027 --> 01:24:01,891
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- Yes, I was. Dead drunk.

1125
01:24:01,921 --> 01:24:04,730
Oh, you big cluck, you'll gum up
the works, you'll ruin yourself.

1126
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,428
You'll bust up your
whole career if you do that.

1127
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,284
It's nothing else to do
Dolly, it's your only chance.

1128
01:24:09,314 --> 01:24:12,226
Oh, never mind me, what about her?

1129
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:14,779
She going back to England.

1130
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:18,929
- Back to England? But you still love her.
- She's leaving on the next boat.

1131
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:21,370
Oh, you can't let her do
that toots, you still in love her.

1132
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,159
- Don't start telling me what to do.
- I said, you're still in love with her.

1133
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:27,104
- And don't yell like that, I'm not deaf.
- Oh, you poor sap, you love her.

1134
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:28,303
And don't call me a sap.

1135
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:29,964
- You love her.
- Yes, I love her.

1136
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:33,869
But not the way I do you.

1137
01:24:34,963 --> 01:24:36,251
Oh toots, you can't.

1138
01:24:36,718 --> 01:24:39,016
That ain't fair, ain't
right. A nogood dame like...

1139
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:41,050
me why, I'll always have you in trouble Alan.

1140
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,960
No, you won't.

1141
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:46,062
Married life will slow you down plenty.

1142
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:48,703
You...

1143
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:52,213
You'd marry me?

1144
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:55,249
Well no, not if you're going
to make it such a blasted favor.

1145
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,752
Oh, you, you poor sap.

1146
01:25:00,736 --> 01:25:01,425
Come in.

1147
01:25:02,311 --> 01:25:04,536
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning superintendent.

1148
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,446
- Here's your receipt for the prisoners.
- Yes, all right.

1149
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:11,301
I'll be over as soon as I get through.

1150
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,680
- Anything you want...
- Anything I...

1151
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,742
Toots, I got everything.

1152
01:25:20,702 --> 01:25:23,106
Come on
superintendent, let's get on the horse.

1153
01:25:25,681 --> 01:25:28,563
What about a nip to cool that aching brow?

1154
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:31,094
No, no, fix one for yourself,
I got to get around to court.

1155
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,824
Somebody will have to protect that judge.

1156
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:41,068
Those shoes are disgraceful
on an officer Mr. Kingston.

1157
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,447
- A hose coupling just broke sir.
- Hose couplings shouldn't break.

1158
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,620
Change the hose and
change your shoes Mr. Kingston.

1159
01:25:45,776 --> 01:25:46,482
Yes sir.

1160
01:25:48,262 --> 01:25:50,592
Change your shoes Mr. Kingston.

1161
01:25:51,223 --> 01:25:55,941
A piracy, a typhoon, a disabled ship swung
into port, his sweetheart on her way to...

1162
01:25:55,971 --> 01:25:58,657
jail and all he can
say by way of conversation...

1163
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:02,661
- is change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
- That bark of his is all front.

1164
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:06,714
- He's really pretty sick at heart.
- Sick? The man hasn't got a heart.

1165
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:12,593
Perhaps not Mr. Kingston but
whatever it is he has, it gets things done.

1166
01:26:13,305 --> 01:27:13,848
