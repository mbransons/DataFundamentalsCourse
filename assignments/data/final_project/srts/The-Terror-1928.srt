00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:24,685
I vowed

00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:27,354
that I would never
let my sister's child

186

We took you.

And my father?

A soldier.

191
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,925
He died at war.

How?

197
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:12,533
We feared
the truth would hurt.

198
