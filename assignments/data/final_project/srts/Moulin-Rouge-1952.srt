1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:26,772
There was a boy

3
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:35,573
A very strange enchanted boy

4
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:44,020
They say he wandered very far

5
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:49,618
Very far

6
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:54,893
Over land and sea

7
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,780
Don't be fooled! Evil!

8
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:01,658
A little shy

9
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,537
Turn away from this village of sin!

10
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:07,741
And sad of eye

11
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:11,578
But very wise...

12
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,575
... was he

13
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:20,172
And then one day

14
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,855
A magic day...

15
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,420
...he passed my way

16
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:36,973
And while we spoke of many things

17
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:42,898
Fools and kings

18
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:48,298
This he said to me

19
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:55,701
The greatest thing

20
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:01,411
You'll ever learn

21
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:05,940
Is just to love

22
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:11,697
And be loved...

23
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:16,622
...in return

24
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:20,934
The Moulin Rouge.

25
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,534
A nightclub...

26
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,256
...a dance hall and a bordello...

27
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,423
...ruled over by Harold Zidler.

28
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:39,983
A kingdom of nighttime pleasures...

29
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,294
... where the rich played with...

30
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:47,018
...the young and beautiful creatures
of the underworld.

31
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:52,102
The most beautiful of all these...

32
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:54,539
... was the woman who I loved.

33
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:56,496
Satine.

34
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:01,376
A courtesan, she sold her love to men.

35
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,733
They called her
"The Sparkling Diamond. "

36
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:07,934
And she was the star...

37
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,133
...of the Moulin Rouge.

38
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,497
The woman I loved...

39
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:29,412
...is...

40
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,811
...dead.

41
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:41,062
I first came to Paris...

42
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,897
...one year ago.

43
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:51,139
It was 1899, the Summer of Love.

44
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:55,940
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,
Harold Zidler or Satine.

45
00:04:56,503 --> 00:05:00,655
The world had been swept up in a
Bohemian revolution, and I had...

46
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,581
...come to be a part of it.

47
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:06,578
On the hill near Paris
was the village of Montmartre.

48
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,575
It was not,
as my father said--

49
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,102
A village of sin.

50
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:13,261
--but the center of
the Bohemian world.

51
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,534
Musicians, painters, writers.

52
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:18,098
They were known as
the Children of the Revolution.

53
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:23,732
I had come to live a penniless
existence. I had come to...

54
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:26,377
... write about truth, beauty,
freedom...

55
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,700
...and that which I believed in
above all things: love.

56
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:33,862
Always this ridiculous obsession
with love!

57
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:35,941
There was one problem.

58
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,054
I'd never been in love.

59
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:42,736
Just then, an unconscious Argentinean
fell through my roof.

60
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,656
He was joined by a dwarf
dressed as a nun.

61
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,378
How do you do?

62
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:55,219
My name is Henri Marie Raymond
Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa.

63
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,972
l'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs
rehearsing a play.

64
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:04,299
A play. Something very modern called
Spectacular, Spectacular.

65
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:05,618
lt's set in Switzerland.

66
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,133
The unconscious Argentinean
suffered from narcolepsy.

67
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:12,858
Perfectly fine one moment,
then unconscious the next.

68
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:14,901
How is he?

69
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,858
Wonderful.
The Argentinean is unconscious.

70
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:21,897
Now the play will not be ready to
present to the financier tomorrow.

71
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:26,295
-l still have to finish the music.
-Someone else can read the part.

72
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:29,103
Where on earth will we find
someone to play...

73
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,732
...a young, sensitive
Swiss poet goatherder?

74
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:36,141
Soon I was upstairs, standing in
for the unconscious Argentinean.

75
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:38,733
The hills animate

76
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:42,972
With the euphonious symphonies
Of descant

77
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,061
Oh, stop!
Stop that insufferable droning!

78
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,981
lt's drowning out my words!

79
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:52,253
Just stick to some decorative piano.

80
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:55,575
There were artistic differences
over Audrey's lyrics.

81
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,739
A nun wouldn't say that
about a hill.

82
00:06:57,943 --> 00:07:01,299
How about, "The hills are vital
intoning the descant"?

83
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:03,340
"The hills quake and shake--"

84
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:08,098
"The hills are incarnate
with symphonic melodies"!

85
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,499
"The hills--" "The hills--"

86
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,257
The hills...

87
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,733
...are alive...

88
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:28,214
... with the sound of...

89
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,133
...music

90
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,138
"The hills are alive with
the sound of music." l love it!

91
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,217
The hills are alive...

92
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,699
-...with the sound...
-...of music.

93
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:50,901
lt fits perfectly!

94
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,703
With songs they have sung

95
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,898
For a thousand years

96
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,861
lncandiferous!

97
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:07,659
-You should write the show together.
-Excuse me?

98
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:11,611
Toulouse's suggestion was not
what Audrey wanted to hear.

99
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:12,938
Goodbye!

100
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,303
Here's to your first job in Paris.

101
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,699
Toulouse, Zidler will never agree.

102
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:21,617
Have you ever written a play before?

103
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:22,858
No.

104
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:24,735
The boy has talent!

105
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:26,252
l like him.

106
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,419
Nothing funny.
l just like talent.

107
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,055
"The hills are alive
with the sound of music."

108
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,299
With Christian, we can write...

109
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:38,540
...the Bohemian revolutionary show
we always dreamt of.

110
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,182
How will we convince Zidler?

111
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:41,651
Toulouse had a plan.

112
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:42,812
Satine.

113
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:47,738
They'd dress me in a suit and
say I was a famous English writer.

114
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:51,652
Once Satine heard my poetry,
she'd be amaZed and insist that...

115
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:56,220
...I write Spectacular, Spectacular.
But I kept hearing my father's voice:

116
00:08:56,423 --> 00:09:01,178
You'll end up wasting your life at
the Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer!

117
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:03,943
-l can't write the show!
-Why not?

118
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,976
l don't know if l am
a Bohemian revolutionary.

119
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,935
-Do you believe in beauty?
-Yes.

120
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:10,702
-Freedom?
-Of course.

121
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:11,932
-Truth?
-Yes.

122
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,172
Love?

123
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:15,541
Love? Love?

124
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,973
Above all things,
l believe in love.

125
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,414
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many-splendored thing.

126
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:25,093
Love lifts us up where we belong.
All you need is love!

127
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:30,061
You can't fool us! You're the voice
of the Children of the Revolution!

128
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,254
We can't be fooled!

129
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:36,098
To the writer of the world's first
Bohemian revolutionary show!

130
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,021
It was the perfect plan.

131
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:42,614
I was to audition for Satine
and taste my first glass of absinthe.

132
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,654
There was a boy....

133
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:47,571
l am the green fairy.

134
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,779
The hills are alive

135
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:57,252
With the sound of music

136
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,697
Freedom, beauty...

137
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:11,532
...truth and love

138
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:15,061
The hills are alive

139
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,973
With the sound of music

140
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,299
We were off to the Moulin Rouge.

141
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:28,377
I would perform my poetry
for Satine.

142
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,503
Harold Zidler and his infamous girls.

143
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,695
They called them his "Diamond Dogs. "

144
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:57,533
Hey, sister, go, sister
Soul sister, go, sister

145
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:58,971
If life's an awful bore

146
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,415
And living's just a chore

147
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:04,496
That you do 'cause death's not much fun

148
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,620
I've just the antidote

149
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,415
And though I mustn't gloat

150
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:13,411
At the Moulin Rouge
You'll have fun

151
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:16,451
So scratch that little niggle

152
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,062
Give a little wiggle

153
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,299
You know that you can

154
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,333
Because we...

155
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,422
...can cancan

156
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,460
Don't say you can't can't can't

157
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:30,142
You know you can cancan

158
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,895
Don't say you can't
Because you can

159
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,461
Here we are now

160
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,301
Entertain us

161
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,539
We feel stupid

162
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,779
And contagious

163
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:49,575
Got some dark desire
Love to play with fire

164
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:53,093
Why not let it rip?
Live a little bit

165
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:54,982
We can cancan

166
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:57,535
Don't say you can't can't can't

167
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,540
You know you can cancan

168
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,055
You can cancan

169
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,054
Outside, it may be raining

170
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,174
But in here it's entertaining!

171
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:08,294
If you love love love
To be free free free

172
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:12,138
The Moulin Rouge is the place to be

173
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,097
Because we can cancan!

174
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,222
Yes, we can cancan!

175
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:22,375
Here we are now
Entertain us

176
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,135
Outside, things may be tragic

177
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,971
But in here, we feel it's magic

178
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:35,342
The cancan.

179
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:41,742
Because we can cancan!

180
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,462
Go, sister
Soul sister

181
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,019
Hey, sister, go, sister
Soul sister, go, sister

182
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,942
Because we can cancan!

183
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,292
Yes, we can cancan!

184
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,856
Creole Lady Marmalade

185
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:02,258
Because we can cancan!

186
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:11,777
'Cause it's good for your mind!

187
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:33,091
Mission accomplished.
We've successfully evaded Zidler.

188
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:47,416
lt's her! The Sparkling Diamond.

189
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:59,214
The French are glad to...

190
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,257
...die for love

191
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,734
They delight...

192
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:10,573
...in fighting duels

193
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:14,219
But someone else was to
meet Satine that night.

194
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,660
But I prefer...

195
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:20,259
...a man who lives

196
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,734
Zidler's investor.

197
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,774
And gives expensive...

198
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:29,897
...jewels

199
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:31,702
The Duke.

200
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:48,220
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

201
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:51,176
But diamonds are
A girl's best friend

202
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:56,057
A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental

203
00:14:56,263 --> 00:15:00,893
On your humble flat
Or help you feed your pussycat

204
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:04,653
Men grow cold
As girls grow old

205
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:08,612
And we all lose our charms in the end

206
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:13,221
But square cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape

207
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:15,937
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

208
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:18,702
When will l meet the girl?

209
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:19,852
Tiffany's!

210
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:24,813
After her number. l've arranged a
special meeting, just you and Satine.

211
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,732
Totally alone.

212
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,297
Cartier!

213
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:33,263
After her number, l've arranged
a private meeting.

214
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:37,212
-Just you and Satine. Totally alone.
-Alone?

215
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:40,415
Yes, totally alone.

216
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:45,095
'Cause we are living
In a material world

217
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,774
And I am a material girl

218
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,254
Come and get me, boys.

219
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:00,422
Excuse me.

220
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,298
Black Star! Roscor!

221
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,052
Talk to me, Harry Zidler!
Tell me all about it!

222
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,862
There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer

223
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,619
But diamonds are
A girl's best friend

224
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:23,495
There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer thinks

225
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:25,056
You're awful nice

226
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:28,494
Don't worry. l'll sally forth
and tee things up!

227
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:33,574
-ls the Duke here?
-Liebchen, would Daddy let you down?

228
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,692
Terribly sorry.

229
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:36,932
Where is he?

230
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,412
Toulouse is shaking a hanky at him.

231
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:42,052
Excuse me, Christian. May l borrow?

232
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,775
-Are you sure?
-Let me peek.

233
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,218
l'm ever so sorry! How embarrassing!

234
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:58,492
That's the one. l hope that demonic
little loon doesn't frighten him off.

235
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:01,058
Clean yourself up, you bourgeois pig!

236
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,697
Sorry.

237
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:13,096
-Will he invest?
-Pigeon!

238
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:17,662
After spending the night with you,
how could he refuse?

239
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,582
What's his type? Wilting flower?

240
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:21,818
Bright and bubbly?

241
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,342
Or smoldering temptress?

242
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,542
l'd say smoldering temptress.
We're all relying on you, gosling.

243
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:36,579
Remember, a real show in a real theater,
with a real audience...

244
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,216
...and you'll be....

245
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,619
A real actress.

246
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:47,181
'Cause that's when those louses
Go back to their spouses

247
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:49,101
Diamonds...

248
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:51,616
l have exciting news!

249
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,376
...are a girl's...

250
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,500
...best...

251
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:58,300
...friend

252
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,578
l believe you were expecting me.

253
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,262
Yes. Yes.

254
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,415
l'm afraid it's lady's choice.

255
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,613
l see you've met my English friend--

256
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,461
l'll take care of it.

257
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,897
Let's dance.

258
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:38,901
Hit her with your most modern poem!

259
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,134
To the beat of the rhythm of the night

260
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,895
Dance until the morning light

261
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:45,781
Forget the worries on your mind

262
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,735
You can leave them all behind

263
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:54,892
That went well.

264
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,173
-lncredible.
-He has a gift with the women.

265
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,613
l told you. He's a genius.

266
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,618
That Duke certainly can dance.

267
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:16,540
How wonderful of you to
take an interest in our show.

268
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:20,622
lt sounds very exciting.
l'd be delighted to be involved.

269
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,939
Assuming you like what l do.

270
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:24,815
l'm sure l will.

271
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,857
Toulouse thought we might be able to...

272
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,542
...do it in private.

273
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,540
-Did he?
-Yes, you know, a private...

274
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,502
...poetry reading.

275
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,262
A "poetry reading."

276
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:52,891
l love a little "poetry"
after supper.

277
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,697
Hang on to your hat!

278
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,102
Diamonds

279
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,857
Diamonds

280
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:23,982
Square cut...

281
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,538
...or pear-shaped

282
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,296
These rocks...

283
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:32,018
... won't lose their shape

284
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,578
Diamonds...

285
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,693
...are a girl's...

286
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:42,577
...best....

287
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,133
Satine! Satine! Satine!

288
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,902
l doubt the Duke will get
his money's worth tonight.

289
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:44,940
Don't be unkind, Nini.

290
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,497
You've frightened her away.

291
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:05,857
But l can see some lonely
Moulin Rouge dancers...

292
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:10,818
...looking for a partner or two!
So if you can Hunk Hunk...

293
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,583
...you can Hunkadola with them!

294
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:20,376
Out of my way!

295
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:31,852
Oh, Marie.

296
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:40,141
Oh, these silly costumes.

297
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:42,298
Just a fainting spell.

298
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:45,620
Back out front, girls.
Make those gents thirsty. Problems?

299
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,940
-Nothing to worry about.
-Don't stand around, then.

300
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:05,180
Come out of the garden, baby

301
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:09,535
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girls

302
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,620
They call them the Diamond Dogs

303
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:19,253
Find Zidler.
The girl's waiting for me.

304
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:22,137
That twinkle-toes Duke
took the bait, girl.

305
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:25,341
A patron like him, you could be
the next Sarah Bernhardt.

306
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,780
Do you really think l could be like
the great Sarah?

307
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,655
Why not? You got the talent.

308
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:35,141
You hook that Duke and you'll be
lighting the great stages of Europe.

309
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:38,892
l'll be a real actress, Marie.
A great actress.

310
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:42,652
l'm gonna fly away from here.
l'm gonna fly, fly away.

311
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:45,855
-Duckling, are you all right?
-Of course, Harold.

312
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,291
Thank goodness!

313
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:51,695
You certainly weaved your magic
with the Duke on the dance floor.

314
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:53,302
How do l look?

315
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:54,942
Smoldering temptress?

316
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:58,140
My little strawberry...

317
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,932
...how could he possibly resist
gobbling you up?

318
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:05,818
Everything's going so well!

319
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,738
I'll meet you in the red room

320
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:13,021
Unbelievable!
Straight to the elephant.

321
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:18,772
This is a wonderful place for a
poetry reading. Don't you think?

322
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:23,692
Poetic enough for you?

323
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,541
A little supper?
Maybe some champagne?

324
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:32,096
l'd rather just...

325
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,534
...get it over and done with.

326
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:42,378
Very well.

327
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,302
Then why don't you...

328
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,297
...come down here?

329
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:51,094
Let's get it over and done with.

330
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,814
l prefer to do it standing.

331
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,941
You don't have to stand.

332
00:24:56,143 --> 00:25:00,853
Sometimes it's.... lt's quite long,
and l'd like you to be comfortable.

333
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,461
What l do is quite modern.
lt may feel strange...

334
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:08,292
...at first, but if you're open,
you might enjoy it.

335
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:10,092
l'm sure l will.

336
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,172
Excuse me.

337
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,257
"The sky...."

338
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:23,538
"The sky...the bluebirds...."

339
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,213
Come on. Come on.

340
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:32,742
l think....

341
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:36,053
There might be some shaking.

342
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,332
ls everything okay?

343
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:46,172
l'm a little nervous.
Sometimes it takes a while for...

344
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,381
...inspiration to come.

345
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,095
Oh, yes, yes.

346
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:52,697
Let Mummy help.

347
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:56,057
Does that inspire you?

348
00:25:58,543 --> 00:25:59,612
Let's make love.

349
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:01,855
You want to, don't you?

350
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:06,778
Tell the truth.
Can't you feel the poetry?

351
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:12,137
Come on! Feel it.

352
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,417
Free the tiger!

353
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:20,012
Big boy!

354
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,775
He's got a huge talent!

355
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:26,376
-l need your poetry now!
-All right!

356
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,539
"lt's a little bit funny...

357
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:33,416
...this feeling inside.

358
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:36,501
l'm not one of those who can
easily hide."

359
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,653
ls this okay?
ls this what you want?

360
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:41,852
Oh, poetry.

361
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,976
This is what l want,
naughty words.

362
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:49,977
Naughty!

363
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:53,095
"l don't have much money,
but if l did, l'd buy...

364
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:55,937
...a big house where we both
could live."

365
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,417
Oh! lt's so bad!

366
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:00,422
-"lf l were a sculptor, then again, no."
-You devil.

367
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:03,535
"Or a man who makes potions
in a traveling show."

368
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,017
Don't, don't, don't!

369
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:06,218
Don't stop!

370
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:09,580
-"l know it's not much."
-Give me more! Yes!

371
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:17,256
-"lt's the best l can do."
-Naughty! Don't stop! Yes!

372
00:27:19,743 --> 00:27:22,894
My gift is my song

373
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:30,776
And this one's for you

374
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:35,742
And you can tell everybody

375
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,212
That this is your song

376
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,021
It may be quite simple, but

377
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:48,373
Now that it's done

378
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:52,900
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind

379
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:57,178
That I put down in words

380
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:02,938
How wonderful life is

381
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:07,901
Now you're in the world

382
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,893
I sat on the roof

383
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:16,060
And I kicked off the moss

384
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,616
Well, some of these verses

385
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:22,943
They got me quite cross

386
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,132
But the sun's been kind

387
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,815
While I wrote this song

388
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:33,855
It's for people like you that

389
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:37,097
Keep it turned on

390
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:42,137
So excuse me forgetting

391
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:46,300
But these things I do

392
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:49,173
You see, I've forgotten

393
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,376
If they're green or they're blue

394
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,133
Anyway, the thing is

395
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,097
What I really mean

396
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:03,093
Yours are the sweetest eyes

397
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,773
I've ever seen

398
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:19,420
And you can tell everybody

399
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,491
This is your song

400
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:25,971
It may be quite simple, but

401
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:28,575
Now that it's done

402
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:33,019
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind

403
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:36,738
That I put down in words

404
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,858
How wonderful life is

405
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:46,819
Now you're in the world

406
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,101
Looks like he got the job!

407
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,373
l can't believe it.

408
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,981
l'm in love.

409
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,415
l'm in love with a young...

410
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:20,735
...handsome, talented duke.

411
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:22,937
Duke?

412
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:25,857
Not that the title's important,
of course.

413
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:27,895
l'm not a duke.

414
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:29,702
Not a duke?

415
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,177
l'm a writer.

416
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,255
A writer?

417
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,857
Yes, a writer.

418
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:39,018
Toulouse--

419
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:44,379
You're not one of Toulouse's talented,
Bohemian, impoverished proteges?

420
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,017
-You might say that.
-Oh, no!

421
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:49,136
l'm going to kill him!

422
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:51,334
There might be a small hitch.

423
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:54,213
-What about the Duke?
-My dear Duke--

424
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:55,372
The Duke!

425
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,302
Hide! Out back!

426
00:30:57,543 --> 00:30:59,932
My dear, are you decent for the Duke?

427
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:02,852
Where were you?

428
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:07,622
l.... l was waiting.

429
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:11,259
Dear Duke, allow me to introduce
Mademoiselle Satine!

430
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:15,532
How wonderful of you
to take time out to visit.

431
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:22,135
The pleasure, l fear,
will be entirely mine, my dear.

432
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:25,540
l'll leave you two squirrels
to get better acquainted.

433
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:29,019
A kiss on the hand may be
quite continental....

434
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,058
But diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

435
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:39,542
After tonight's pretty exertions
on the stage...

436
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:42,018
...you must be in need of refreshment.

437
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:44,293
Don't! Don't you...

438
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:47,412
...just love the view?

439
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:50,412
Charming.

440
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:56,213
l feel like dancing.

441
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,499
l should like a glass of champagne.

442
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,178
lt's....

443
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,258
-lt's a little bit funny.
-What is?

444
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:18,380
This...feeling...

445
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:20,936
...inside.

446
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,823
l'm not one of those who can easily...

447
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,742
...hide.

448
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:30,654
l don't have much money...

449
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:33,537
...but if l did,
l'd buy a big house...

450
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,859
...where we both could live.

451
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,974
I hope you don't mind

452
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:48,372
I hope you don't mind

453
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:53,173
That I put down in words

454
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,573
How wonderful...

455
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:03,415
...life is

456
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,612
Now you're in...

457
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:09,334
...the world

458
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:14,741
That's very beautiful.

459
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:20,695
lt's from Spectacular, Spectacular.
Suddenly, with you here...

460
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:23,781
...l finally understood
the true meaning of the words.

461
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:27,612
"How wonderful life is
now you're in the world."

462
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,734
And what meaning is that, my dear?

463
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:35,932
Duke!

464
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:38,498
Don't you toy with my emotions.

465
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:42,218
You must know the effect
you have on women.

466
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:45,418
Let's make love!

467
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:48,612
You want to make love, don't you?

468
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:49,972
Make love?

469
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,095
l knew you felt the same way!

470
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,692
Oh, Duke!

471
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:04,573
You're right. We should wait
until opening night.

472
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,936
Wait? Wait?

473
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:10,338
There's a power in you that scares me.

474
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,335
-You should go.
-l just got here.

475
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:15,216
We'll see each other every day
during rehearsal.

476
00:34:15,423 --> 00:34:18,495
We must wait. We must wait
until opening night.

477
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:19,898
Get out.

478
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:25,539
Do you have any idea what would have
happened if you were found?

479
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,531
Satine?

480
00:34:36,823 --> 00:34:38,779
Let's have a little peekaboo.

481
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:41,900
Right on target.

482
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:00,697
l forgot my hat--

483
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,257
Foul play?

484
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:04,972
Oh, Duke.

485
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:08,221
lt's a little bit funny,
this feeling inside!

486
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,814
Beautifully spoken.
Let me introduce you. The writer.

487
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,422
-The writer?
-Yes.

488
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:16,053
We were rehearsing.

489
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,056
You expect me to believe
that scantily clad...

490
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:24,455
...in the arms of another man, inside
an elephant, you were rehearsing?

491
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,733
How's the rehearsal going?

492
00:35:26,943 --> 00:35:28,581
Shall we take it from the top?

493
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,695
-l hope the piano's in tune.
-Sorry, got held up.

494
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:33,302
Can l offer you a drink?

495
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,822
Oh, my goodness!

496
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,734
When l spoke those words to you,
you so inspired me.

497
00:35:41,983 --> 00:35:47,103
l realized we had much work to do,
so l called an emergency rehearsal.

498
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:49,334
Then where's Zidler?

499
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,936
l didn't bother Harold.

500
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,020
Dear Duke, l'm terribly sorry.

501
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:57,102
Harold! The Duke knows all about
the emergency rehearsal.

502
00:35:57,303 --> 00:35:58,418
Emergency rehearsal?

503
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,376
To incorporate the Duke's
artistic ideas.

504
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,175
Audrey will be delighted--

505
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:04,941
-Audrey left.
-What?

506
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:06,576
Cat's out of the bag.

507
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:09,741
The Duke's a big fan
of our new writer's work.

508
00:36:09,943 --> 00:36:12,138
That's why he's so keen to invest.

509
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:14,061
lnvest? lnvest!

510
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:15,696
Oh, yes. lnvest!

511
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,098
You can't blame me for hiding...

512
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:19,892
...Christian away.

513
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:21,934
l'm way ahead of you, Zidler.

514
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:25,459
Duke, let's go to my office
and peruse the paperwork.

515
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:26,778
What's the story?

516
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:30,695
lf l'm to invest,
l need to know the story.

517
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:33,053
Well, the story's about....

518
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,972
Toulouse?

519
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,855
The story is.... The story's about....
lt's about....

520
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,701
lt's about love.

521
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,012
Love?

522
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:48,142
lt's about love
overcoming all obstacles.

523
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,978
And it's set in Switzerland!

524
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:53,214
-Switzerland?
-Exotic Switzerland!

525
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:55,732
lndia! lndia! lt's set in lndia!

526
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:59,134
And there's a courtesan.

527
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:02,776
The most beautiful courtesan
in the world.

528
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:06,496
But her kingdom's invaded
by an evil maharajah.

529
00:37:06,703 --> 00:37:10,855
To save her kingdom, she has to seduce
the evil maharajah...

530
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,254
...but on the night of the seduction,
she mistakes...

531
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,738
...a penniless...a penniless...

532
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,262
...sitar player...

533
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:22,379
...for the maharajah and falls in love
with him!

534
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:25,859
He wasn't trying to trick her.
He was dressed as a maharajah...

535
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:28,452
...because he's appearing in a play.

536
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,854
l will play the penniless tango-dancing
sitar player.

537
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,571
He will sing like an angel...

538
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,421
...but dance like the devil.

539
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:39,740
Yes, all right.
And what happens next?

540
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:44,656
The sitar player and the courtesan
must hide their love.

541
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,856
The sitar player's sitar is magical.
lt only speaks the truth.

542
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:52,817
And l will play the magical sitar!

543
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:56,173
You are beautiful.

544

You are ugly. And you--

545
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,782
And he gives the game away, eh?

546
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,616
-Tell him about the cancan!
-The Tantric cancan--

547
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:11,062
--is an erotic, spectacular scene that
captures the thrusting, vibrant...

548
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,572

Can describe this great event
You'll be dumb with wonderment

580
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:45,142
The hills are alive

581
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,416

The courtesan and sitar man

588
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:21,142
Are pulled apart by an evil plan

589
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:24,574
But in the end, she hears his song

590
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:29,220
And their love is just too strong

591
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,099
It's a little bit funny

592
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,180

Though the tyrant rants and rails
It is all to no avail

-No one could play him like you.

Zidler had an investor...

606
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:37,661
-...and the Bohemians had a show.
-lt's the end of the century!

607
00:41:37,983 --> 00:41:40,656
The Bohemian revolution is here!

608
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,692
You are a beautiful woman.

l love sex.

610
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:58,059
While the party raged upstairs...

611
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,341
...I tried to write.

612
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:04,013
But all I could think about
was her.

613
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:07,898
How wonderful life is

614
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:11,020
Was she thinking about me?

615
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:14,099
Now you're in...

616
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,257
...the world

617
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:21,933
Duke? I'm not a duke.

618
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,056
I'm a writer.

619
00:42:24,703 --> 00:42:27,900
He wasn't trying to trick her....
It's about love.

620
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:30,294
It's about love...

621
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:34,093
...overcoming all obstacles.

622
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,174

623
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:51,055
...follow...

624
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:54,698
...the night

625
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,936
Can't stand...

626
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:04,023
...the light

627
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:10,222
When will I begin...

628
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:17,933
...to live again?

629
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:24,015
One day I'll fly away

630
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,337
Leave all this to yesterday

631
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:37,659
What more could your love do for me?

632
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:42,420
When will love be...

633
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:45,941
...through with me?

634
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:49,135
Why live life...

635
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,739
...from dream to dream?

636
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:56,175
And dread the day...

637
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,980
... when dreaming...

638
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:03,971

One day I'll fly away

650
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:20,701
Fly...

651
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,652
...fly...

652
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:30,653

for helping me get the job.

656
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:45,301
Of course.

657
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:48,422
Yes, Toulouse was right.

658
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,772
You're...

659
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:52,977
...very talented.

660
00:45:53,903 --> 00:45:55,939
lt will be a wonderful show.

661
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:58,054
Anyway, l'd better go.

662
00:45:58,263 --> 00:46:01,016
We both have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:02,862
Wait.

664
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,701
Please wait.

665
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:11,699
Before, when we were...when we were...

666
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,053
...when you thought l was the Duke...

667
00:46:14,263 --> 00:46:17,096
...you said you loved me,
and l wondered--

668
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:18,941
lf it was just an act?

669
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,542
-Yes.
-Of course.

670
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:23,457
lt felt real.

671
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:27,817
Christian...

672
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:30,860
...l'm a courtesan.

673
00:46:31,743 --> 00:46:35,418
l'm paid to make men believe
what they want to believe.

674
00:46:39,903 --> 00:46:44,579
Silly of me, to think you could
fall in love with someone like me.

675
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:50,731
-l can't fall in love with anyone.
-Can't fall in love?

676
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:54,731
-A life without love? That's terrible!
-Being on the street is terrible.

677
00:46:56,823 --> 00:46:57,938
Love is like oxygen.

678
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:00,898
Love is a many-splendored thing.
Love...

679
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:03,453
...lifts us up where we belong.

680
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:05,022
Don't start that again.

681
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:08,579
-All you need is love
-A girl has to eat

682
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:12,332
-All you need is love
-Or she'll end up on the streets

683
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:15,296
All you need is love

684
00:47:15,823 --> 00:47:17,381
Love is just a game

685
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:22,099
I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me

686
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:25,062
The only way of loving me, baby

687
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:27,219
Is to pay a lovely fee

688
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:31,133
Just one night
Give me just one night

689
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:34,694
There's no way
'Cause you can't pay

690
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:37,696
In the name of love

691
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:41,060
One night in the name of love

692
00:47:41,383 --> 00:47:43,658
You craZy fool

693
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,661
I won't give in to you

694
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:50,021
Don't leave me this way

695
00:47:51,943 --> 00:47:56,061
I can't survive
Without your sweet love

696
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:57,861
Oh, baby

697
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:01,058
Don't leave me this way

698
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:07,140
You'd think that people
Would have had enough

699
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:10,011
Of silly love songs

700
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:14,901
I look around me and I see
It isn't so

701
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,172
Oh, no

702
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:21,853
Some people want to fill the world
With silly love songs

703
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,854
Well, what's wrong with that?

704
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,619
I'd like to know

705
00:48:28,423 --> 00:48:31,813
'Cause here I go again

706
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,734
Love lifts us up where we belong

707
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:38,701
Get down! Get down!

708
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:41,457
Where eagles fly

709
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:44,263
On a mountain high

710
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:48,899
Love makes us act like we are fools

711
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:53,212
Throw our lives away

712
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,460
For one happy day

713
00:48:55,743 --> 00:48:58,416
We could be heroes

714
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:01,220
Just for one day

715
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:04,103
You, you will be mean

716
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,175
No, l won't.

717
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,735
And I...

718
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,933
...I'll drink all the time

719
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,133
We should be lovers

720
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:19,300
We can't do that

721
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:23,820
We should be lovers

722
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:26,219
And that's a fact

723
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:30,658
Though nothing...

724
00:49:30,863 --> 00:49:33,252
... will keep us together

725
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:37,620
We could steal time

726
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:40,781
Just for one day

727
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:44,460
We could be heroes

728
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,735
For ever and ever

729
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:51,341
We could be heroes

730
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:54,581
For ever and ever

731
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:58,055
We can be heroes

732
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:02,574
Just because I

733
00:50:06,223 --> 00:50:10,057
Will always love you

734
00:50:13,903 --> 00:50:17,100
I can't help loving...

735
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:20,815
...you

736
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:24,459
How wonderful life is

737
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:27,977
Now you're in...

738
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:32,652
...the world

739
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,138
You're going to be bad for business,
l can tell.

740
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:03,343
How wonderful life is

741
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:09,253
Now you're in...

742
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:15,341
...the world

743
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:23,978
How wonderful life was,
now Satine was in the world.

744
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:29,102
But in the Duke...

745
00:51:30,063 --> 00:51:33,772
...Zidler had gotten much more
than he had bargained for.

746
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:39,814
Converting the Moulin Rouge into a
theater will cost a fantastic sum.

747
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:44,141
So, in return, l would require
a contract that...

748
00:51:44,463 --> 00:51:46,374
...binds Satine to me...

749
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:47,572
...exclusively.

750
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:53,253
Naturally, l'll require some security:
the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.

751
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:55,657
My dear Duke--

752
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,253
Please! Don't think that
l'm naive, Zidler.

753
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:03,741
l shall hold the deeds. And if there
are any shenanigans...

754
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,582
...my manservant, Warner...

755
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:12,451
...will deal with it in the only way...

756
00:52:12,703 --> 00:52:15,171
...you underworld show folk understand.

757
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:17,101
Satine will be mine.

758
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:19,180
lt's not that l'm a jealous man.

759
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:23,854
l just don't like other people
touching my things!

760
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:30,258
l...

761
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:34,615
...understand...completely...Duke.

762
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:37,292
Good.

763
00:52:37,463 --> 00:52:40,933
Now that we have an understanding,
it appears that...

764
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:45,535
...you have the means to transform
your beloved Moulin Rouge--

765
00:52:45,743 --> 00:52:47,062
--into a theater!

766
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:51,297
l shall woo Satine over supper tonight.

767
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,891
We will have created
the world's first...

768
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,931
...completely modern...

769
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,928
...entirely electric,
totally Bohemian...

770
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,089
...all-singing, all-dancing
stage spectacular!

771
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,138
The show must go on!

772
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,134
Yes, the show would go on.

773
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,777
But Satine would not attend supper
that night or the following night.

774
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,770
Mad with jealousy,
the evil maharajah...

775
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,859
...forces the courtesan to tell the
sitar player she doesn't love him.

776
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,732
"Thank you for curing me of
my ridiculous obsession with love"...

777
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:40,331
...says the sitar player, throwing money
at her and leaving the kingdom!

778
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,818
Brilliant! Brilliant!

779
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,011
A life without love?
That's terrible!

780
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,059
Yes. But the sitar player--

781
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,695
Wait! That's my part.

782
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,289
That's my part, Christian!

783
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,531
Don't you dare!

784
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,618
The magic sitar, who can only
speak the truth, says:

785
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,010
"The greatest thing you 'll
ever learn...

786
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,015
...is just to love
and be loved in return."

787
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,539
A picnic, sweet lady?

788
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,015
Oh, but we have so much work to do.

789
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,499
lf the writer can carry a basket,
you can both do it in my presence.

790
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,858
-So he falls from the roof--
-Yes, l know, l know. Don't tell me.

791
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,656
"The greatest thing you'll ever..."

792
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,139
Still at it, my sweet?

793
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,291
"...master...make...

794
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,250
...contract...."

795
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,816
l've so many lines. l've been
drilling them over and over.

796
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,292
For try as the Duke may,
it was almost too easy...

797
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,413
...for the writer and actress
to invent reasons to avoid him.

798
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,094
Mademoiselle Satine,
l haven't finished the new scene.

799
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,896
The "Will the lovers be meeting at the
sitar player's humble abode?" scene.

800
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,371
May l work on it with you
later tonight?

801
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,408
But, my dear, l arranged a magnificent
supper for us in the tower.

802
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,810
We can work on it tomorrow.

803
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,580
How dare you! lt cannot wait
until tomorrow.

804
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,490
"The lovers will meet at the sitar
player's humble abode" scene is crucial.

805
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,016
We'll work tonight
until l'm completely satisfied.

806
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,933
Dear Duke, excuse me.

807
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,139
l'm sorry.

808
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,175
Nice work, family!

809
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,816
Bright and early tomorrow morning,
we begin on Act Two:

810
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,660
The lovers are discovered.

811
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,015
Zidler.

812
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,216
My dear Duke, everything is arranged
for that supper in the tower tonight.

813
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,218
You can eat it yourself!
Her affections are waning!

814
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,330
lmpossible.

815
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,294
l know her work's important,
but she's always at it with that writer!

816
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,528
lf l don't see her tonight,
l'm leaving!

817
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,496
No, Duke! l'll insist
Satine take the night off.

818
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,778
All right.

819
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,888
Eight o'clock, then.

820
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,058
You'll come tonight?

821
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,255
Yes.

822
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,097
-What time?
-Eight o'clock.

823
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,177
-Promise?
-Yes.

824
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,608
Go.

825
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,689
Are you mad?

826
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,179
The Duke holds the deeds
to the Moulin Rouge.

827
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,537
He's spending a fortune on you.

828
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,932
Given you a beautiful new dressing room.
He wants to make you a star.

829
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,013
And you're dallying with the writer.

830
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,976
-Harold, don't be rid--
-l saw you together!

831
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,175
lt's nothing.

832
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,449
lt's just an infatuation.
lt's nothing.

833
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,254
The infatuation will end.

834
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,409
Go to the boy.

835
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,493
Tell him it's over.

836
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,494
The Duke is expecting you at 8.

837
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,135
If I should die

838
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,170
This very moment

839
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,890
I wouldn't fear

840
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,211
For I've never known completeness

841
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,609
Like being here

842
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,456
Wrapped in the warmth of you

843
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,613
Loving every breath of you

844
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,410
Why live life...

845
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,376
...from dream...

846
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,498
...to dream?

847
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,454
And dread the day....

848
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,976
How could I know...

849
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,897
...in those last fatal days...

850
00:58:12,305 --> 00:59:12,426
