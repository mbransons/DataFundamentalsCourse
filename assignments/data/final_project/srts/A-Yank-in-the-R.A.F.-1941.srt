<i>(narrator) In the early days

00:03:55,041 --> 00:04:00,240
<i>their pilots were ordered to fly the ships
as close as possible to the Canadian border.</i>

7
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:05,600
<i>Democratic ingenuity
and a stout rope did the rest.</i>

<i>(plane approaching overhead)</i>

00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:34,512
Where's he going?
That's another Harvard trainer, isn't it?

10
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,750
Yes.

11
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:34,120
- Hi. Baker's my name. Tim Baker.
- I'm Flight Lieutenant Redmond.

12
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,715
I was told to deliver
this ship here. Here she is.

13
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,838
<i>- You were told to deliver it here?
- This is Trenton?</i>

14
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,798
Yes. Trenton, Canada.

15
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,156
- Canada?
- Yes.

16
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:48,473
Well, what do you know about that?
I was looking for Trenton, New Jersey.

17
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,600
My compass must have gone haywire.
You got a cigarette?

18
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,718
How could I have ever mistaken
Canada for New Jersey?

19
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:59,476
- You'd better come along to the CO.
- OK with me.

20
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,358
Mr Baker, have you ever heard
of the Neutrality Act?

21
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:09,798
- Yes, sir. The newspapers are full of it.
- Then why did you deliberately violate it?

22
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:14,830
What difference does it make whether you
tow it across or whether I fly it across?

23
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:18,311
You get the same aeroplane.
Who does anybody think they're fooling?

24
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:20,835
We won't argue the point, Mr Baker.

25
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:25,233
Nor will we be a party to any action
likely to embarrass a friendly government.

26
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:29,678
I'm afraid you will not be permitted
to ferry any more aircraft. Good day.

27
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:35,672
OK. OK, if you want to keep the war in
low gear, there's nothing I can do about it.

28
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,672
Just a moment, Mr Baker.

29
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,719
If you know of any capable pilots,

30
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:45,033
you might mention that we're in need of men
to ferry bombers across to England.

31
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:49,512
- Pays rather well, you know.
- Just what do you call "rather well"?

32
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,559
A thousand dollars a flight and all expenses.

33
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,359
A thou...

34
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:58,514
Of course, we wouldn't want our aircraft
delivered by way of Berlin,

35
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:02,116
since they are to be employed
in that vicinity eventually anyhow.

36
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:05,113
A thousand bucks a flight
will keep me on my course.

37
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:08,034
Shall I drop a memo
to the flight superintendent?

38
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,431
Drop it by telephone.
I like to take ajob while I'm enthusiastic.

39
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:15,400
- Not a bad idea, Baker.
- Thank you, sir.

40
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:18,518
Oh, by the way, England's to the east, isn't it?

41
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,512
<i>(both laugh)</i>

42
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,349
Well, we're off.

43
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,989
We're on our way.

44
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,519
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

45
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:56,513
If I could fly back to Canada instead of
taking a boat, I could make a trip a week.

46
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,150
You better concentrate on this first time.
There's no beam out here.

47
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:03,278
That's four trips a month. 52 trips a year.

48
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,353
Taking two weeks out for vacation,
that's 50,000 bucks.

49
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,114
- What was that?
- 50,000 bucks.

50
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,590
Boy, what a war.

51
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:15,594
I've tried all the frequency bands.
I can't even get a whisper out of this set.

52
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,478
Why don't you try BBC?

53
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:21,600
When I was flying the mails in America,
I used to always ride in on Kate Smith.

54
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,149
Boy, there's a beam for you.

55
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,197
<i>This was London in the early days of the war,</i>

56

<i>a city of homes and churches

64
00:08:55,961 --> 00:09:00,751

It's against orders to loiter here.

I beg your pardon, but have you seen
anything of a little grey-white cat?

80

Cat? Why, no.

81
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:59,192
She's a gorgeous creature. Been in the
family for years. You know, long, silky fur...

82
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,353
- Hello, darling!
- Hello, dear.

83
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,719
- Friend of yours?
- No, just a man who's lost his cat.

84
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,395
Poor fellow, he must be terribly cut up.

Quickly, everybody inside. Downstairs.

In the underground.

Careful, don't tip that stretcher.

- Don't get excited. It's air-raid practice.

90

Lie down. Be quiet, young man.
You know you're in a very serious condition.

you drivers are responsible for the blankets.

When inspection closes,
return them to the ambulances.

95
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,916
Yes, Lady Fitzhugh.

96
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:31,515
Yes, very good, very good indeed.
Thank you both very much. Thank you.

97
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:36,399
Oh, yes, that's very good. Yes, goodbye.

98
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,279
This bandage is far too tight
and needs a splint.

99
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:43,398
Loosen it, and be sure you keep
your patient well covered.

100
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,156
Yes, very good indeed.
Yes, thank you, goodbye.

101
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,880
Miss Cross! I'm completely mystified.

102

This man's bandage?
And the nature of his injury? Really!

- Tim!
- Hello, honey.

107
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,835
- You worm.
- How was that for a fractured jaw?

108
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:23,550
I didn't expect to see you here.
Or anywhere, if I could help it.

109
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:27,554
That kiss says differently. Besides,
nobody could hold a grudge for a year.

110
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,316
- I can.
- I'm the one who ought to be sore.

111
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,871
I come home to Dallas, find you gone,
and as for that nasty note...

112
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,954
I'd have rigged up a shotgun
pointing at the door, if I'd had any string.

113
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:44,320
How can you say that? Could I help it if I ran
into a snowstorm and had to make a detour?

114
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:48,713
I know all about that "detour".
Her name was Irene.

115
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,158
So that's what you thought. I knew I could
clear it up if I could see you and explain.

116
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:56,950
That's the best thing you do. Explain.
Don't bother. I'm not interested.

117
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:03,719
As far as you and I are concerned, it's over.
You understand? Finished, done. Now scat.

118
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:09,080
That's a fine way to treat a guy who just flew
all the way across the Atlantic to see you.

119
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,719
You flew the Atlantic?

120
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,873
I heard you were in England.
Nothing could keep me away.

121
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,158
- I don't believe you.
- But it's true, honey, so help me.

122
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,835
I've changed. You'll be surprised.

123
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:22,799
- You'll never surprise me again.
- Hey, wait a minute.

124
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:27,193
I'm not gonna take that for an answer
after flying 3,000 miles to be with you.

125
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:29,511
Oh, stop it. I've got work to do.

126
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,793
Oh, my, you make an awful cute soldier.

127
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,271
Great idea, enlisting the chorus.
Funny nobody thought of it before.

128
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:46,357
I'm not in the chorus. And it's not funny,
my trying to help out. At night, I dance at...

129
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:51,833
- Where?
- Never mind where. And keep away from me.

130
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:55,357
There you go again.
Still talking about the old Baker.

131
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:59,878
The new Baker's a pretty steady model. What
harm could there be in giving me a tryout?

132
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,998
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll stay in London. They need fliers.

133
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,517
They need fliers in the RAF.
But that's hardly in your line.

134
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:10,037
If I remember correctly, you black out
at less than a thousand a month.

135
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:15,593
Why don't you give me credit? I have ideals.
I have as many ideals as the next fellow.

136
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:20,152
You've got the wrong word. You're talking
about ideas, and yours isn't going to work.

137
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>- Aw, honey, don't be that way.
- (sighs)</i>

138
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:28,359

- Well, I've looked at other men.

139
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:32,912
Maybe, but not in the same way you looked
at me that first night in Kansas City.

140
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:35,117
Remember?

141
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:39,399
You were going east, I was going west. Then
we saw each other and I was going east too.

142
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,358
That old spark's still there.

143
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:45,912
Sure, we've been off-course a few times,
but we can get back on again. Why fight it?

144
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,561
Young man, what are you trying to do?

145
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,836
I'm trying to kiss her.

146
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,072
Apparently, the seriousness
of our work has escaped you.

147
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,152
I'm sorry, Lady Fitzhugh.

148
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,995
You really should be ashamed
of yourself, young man.

149
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,276
What time do you go off duty, m'lady?

150
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,033
I... Really!

<i>(lively swing music)</i>

152
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,829
I'm sorry, sir. This table is reserved.

153
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,151
- For whom?
- Lord Delby, sir.

154
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh. His Lordship prefers
something less conspicuous.

155
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,796
You might give him the table
you were going to give me.

<i>(d "Hiya, Love")</i>

157
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:05,277
- Frightfully good, isn't she?
- Yeah. Frightfully.

158
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,511
Would you like me to introduce you?

159
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:11,037
Awfully decent of you, old chap,
but I already know her.

160
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,873
Oh.

161
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:16,112
Then would you mind introducing me?

162
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,638
- What are your intentions?
- Nothing good, I'm afraid.

163
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,270
Then you can see how impossible it is
for me to do anything for you.

164
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,397
Absolutely. Would you like a drink?

165
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,870
No, thank you, I'm on my way to call for her.

166
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,521
I envy you. If there's a lull
in the conversation,

167
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:34,593
you might put in a good word
for Flying Officer Roger Pillby.

168
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:38,594
If there's a lull in the conversation,

Thank you.

170
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:54,880
- Darling.
- How are you?

171
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:58,397
- Carl, dear, I'd like you to meet Miss Jones.
- Oh, how do you do?

172
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:00,915
Miss Lynn, may I present Captain Dearing?

173
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:03,913
- Miss Jones, Captain Dearing.
- How do you do?

174
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,601
I, uh... I beg your pardon.

175
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,512
Has Miss Brown come out yet?

176
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:21,992
Well, uh, she must've left some time ago.

177
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,719
Oh.

178
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,190
Uh, just a minute.

179
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,438
- What are your plans?
- I had a tentative engagement, but...

180
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,081
- Something both of us could do?
- I don't mind.

I mean in that uniform.

186
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,034
Oh, I'm just breaking it in
for a friend. Come on.

187
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,557
Didn't I make it clear I don't want
anything more to do with you?

188
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,713
You don't have to have anything
to do with me in a restaurant.

189
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,873
We'll just eat, tip the waiter
and go our separate ways.

190
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:06,718
- How'd you find out where I was working?
- I've a friend in the Ministry of Information.

191
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:13,354
All right. Only cos I wanna know how you got
that uniform. We'll keep the table between us.

192
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:17,229
A splendid idea. We'll have the waiter
put food on it, too, huh?

193
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:22,270
An interesting supper. Every time I moved my
chair closer to yours, you moved yours away.

194
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,750
We must've looked like a merry-go-round.

195
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:29,153
You still haven't told me
what you're doing in that uniform.

196
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,755
Well, that ought to be perfectly clear.

197
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:36,915
I want to go where you go,
do what you do and be where you be.

198
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:40,994
Come on, warm up. We're in the same army.
That ought to make it official.

199
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,560
Driver, right here.

200
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:50,711
- Tim, you needn't bother to get out.
- I'll just see you to your door.

201
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:56,192
- That's all, cabby. Cheerio.
- Thank you, guv'nor.

202
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,273
- Good night.
- I said I'll see you to your door.

203
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,159
There's no harm in that, is there?

204
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:20,156
You said you wanted to say goodbye like a
gentleman. This is your chance. Goodbye.

205
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:25,315
Hadn't I better come in and open a window?
Or, if the windows are open, turn on the heat?

206
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:29,838
You've been turning it on all evening,
but it's not going to do you any good.

207
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:33,960
I give up. Here I am,
acting like a gentleman - the perfect escort.

208
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,509
Thoughtful, considerate...

209
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,635
Oh, gee, but you're beautiful.

210
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:43,592
Goodbye, honey.

211
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,915

- Oh, no, no, I'm sure it was mine.

We shouldn't have backed out

- I trust you're not shaken up.

Oh, no, not at all. I hope I haven't
done you any damage either.

- Of course not. We're perfectly all right.
- Oh, well, thank you.

All right, get in.

224
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,712
Run along without me.
I just remembered I must see Richardson.

- Give him our love. (laughs)</i>

Well, this is a surprise.
Did I forget my dinner pail?

227
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,473
No, I'm here on official business
for Lady Fitzhugh.

228
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,200
Well? Which one's yours?

229
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:51,398
Oh, stop kidding. These are
Lockheed Hudsons. Bombers.

230
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:53,790
Where are all those cute little Spitfires?

231
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,031
That's what I've been trying to find out.

232
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,238
Can you imagine?
They put me in school. Me!

233
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,280
Operational training. Teaching me
to fly under wartime conditions.

234
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:06,751
I've forgotten more about an airplane
than they'll ever know.

235
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:12,040
Didn't you tell them about all the experience
you'd had testing and flying the mail?

236
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:14,510
- Sure, it's no secret.
- Well, what'd they say?

237
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,196
They were very polite about it.
They said that with all my experience,

238
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,512
I wouldn't have any difficulty catching on.

239
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,195
Meanwhile I suppose I won't see you at all.

240
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:28,194
Of course you will. I'll pick you up tonight
after the show, backstage.

241
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,717
Now I'm a schoolboy, I need somebody
to help with my homework.

242
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,315
I can't wait.

243
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:37,473
I better go. I don't want to be tardy.
I'm going to a lecture. Bye.

244
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:41,110
Goodbye. And don't be
too difficult with teacher.

245
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:46,719
This Messerschmitt 109 was shot down last
week. Before I show you its vulnerabilities,

246
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:52,319
I have here a report made by the pilot
of the Spitfire which brought it down.

247
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,995
It seems that he was at 30,000 feet...

248
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:59,233
Mr Baker. If I were you,
I'd listen rather carefully to this.

249
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:02,313
You might want some information
on a 109 in a hurry one day.

250
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, sir. That's all right, go ahead.
I'm listening.

251
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:11,800
<i>(engine churns but does not start)</i>

252
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,753
It'll start better with this in place.

253
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:24,400
- What's that?
- The rotor off your distributor.

254
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:29,430
- Oh, did it fall off?
- No, I took it off. You know the regulation?

255
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:34,549
I know there's one about taking something
off your car so parachutists can't drive it,

256
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,599
but I never knew what it was
you were supposed to take off.

257
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:43,392
This is it. You just lift it out. I did it for you
so the police wouldn't catch you.

258
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:48,680
- That's very nice of you.
- If anyone catches you, I want to be the one.

259
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:52,436
- Do you catch many this way?
- I never tried before.

260
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,513
- Really?
- In fact, I never thought about it before.

261
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:58,798
You couldn't have done better
if you'd spent hours working it out.

262
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,600
You suppose you could put it back as easily?

263
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:03,876
If you insist.

264
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,636
Maybe I'd better watch
so I can do it myself next time.

265
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,997
If you ever lose it, apply to
the nearest German parachutist.

266
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:13,675
They undoubtedly carry duplicates.

267
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,559
- They're quite thorough, you know.
- So I've heard.

268
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:20,429
- I'm afraid I've botched this.
- How far did you expect to get on one rotor?

269
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,399
- I hoped to learn your name.
- Why? I don't know yours.

270
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,440
- I'm John Morley.
- How do you do, Mr Morley? Goodbye.

271
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:32,038
Goodbye, licence BHX 528.

272
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,119
Friend of yours, Morley?

273
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:40,955
My cousin, sir, from Glasgow.
She's going to spend a few days in London.

274
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,157
When your cousin spends
a few days in London,

275
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,314
does she usually dance and sing with eight
beautiful girls at the Regency House?

276
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:52,270
You don't say, sir. I'm afraid
my aunt will be terribly upset.

00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:04,755
Very sorry, sir, but they're all reserved.
I can give you something not too far back.

279
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:08,277
That won't do, Louis. I want to get
a close look at the chorus.

280
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:11,478
That's what everybody wants, sir,
a close look at the chorus.

281
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:14,712
There must be something you can do.
This is an important occasion.

282
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:17,440
There is a flying officer
at one of our best tables.

283
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:21,799
- And I'm a squadron leader.
- So you are, sir. This way, please.

284
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:37,313
Sir, there is a mistake in the reservations.
Would you let me find you another table?

285
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,631
Definitely not.

286
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:44,431
Excuse me, sir, but I'm sure the squadron
leader will consider it a personal favour.

287
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,318
It's rather important to me.

288
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:51,350
I'm afraid you can't use your rank to exert
pressure. I'm not ambitious in a military way.

289
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:55,036
- I'm sorry, sir.
- But if you share my table, I've no objection.

290
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,396
Oh, thank you.

291

00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,958
- Good, isn't she?
- Very good.

294
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,077
- The singer, I mean.
- So do I.

295
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:09,595
Really? Would you like me
to introduce you, sir?

296
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:12,320
- Thank you, but I already know her.
- You do?

297
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,916
How is it everybody knows her but me?
Would you like to introduce me?

298
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:19,198
No. Anyone who creates
competition for himself is an ass.

299
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,910
- I agree, but I thought I'd try.
- Thanks for the use of your table.

300
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,037
- You're going to meet her now?
- Yes.

301
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,193
If opportunity knocks, shove in
a good word for Roger Pillby.

302
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:31,637
If opportunity knocks, I'll be speechless.

303
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:33,359
Thank you.

304
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:38,239
<i>(both whisper)</i>

305
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:45,198
- Hello there.
- Hello.

306
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:47,920
I hate to seem persistent.

307
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:51,755
- Well, let's face facts. You are.
- Yes, so I am.

308
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,594
Now we've run into each other,
we can have supper.

309
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:58,833
Oh, I'd like to very much, but...
I'm afraid my husband wouldn't like it.

310
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,560
Your... Oh, really? You're married?

311
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:04,360
That's the way one usually gets a husband.

312
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:09,640
It's rather stupid of me. I suppose I should've
considered that possibility, but I didn't.

313
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:12,679
He wouldn't like me
dismantling your distributor.

314
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:14,353
No, I'm afraid he wouldn't.

315
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:17,513
There's nothing wrong with what I did.
That car's as good as ever.

316
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,513
Better, now I know its innermost secrets. Bye.

317
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,557
- May I see you home?
- Uh, no.

318
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:25,792
No, thank you,
my husband will be along directly.

319
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:28,793
I see I've made a botch of this all over again.

320
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:31,600
But I've enjoyed meeting
you once more. Goodbye.

321
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,478
- Goodbye.
- However,

322
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:38,715
on second thought, since your husband
isn't here yet, I may as well have a cigarette.

323
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,793
I wish you wouldn't.
He might misunderstand.

324
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:47,513
Oh, I don't see how he could. I'd rather
imagine he'd think the joke was on me.

325
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:50,069
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, no, thank you.

326
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:53,153
- Do you mind if I do?
- Hm? Oh, no.

327
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,389
Perhaps I will have one.

328
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:13,151
He, uh... he might have fallen asleep.

329
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,519
Quite.

330
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:19,916
- He works days.
- Really?

331
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,833
- I'm afraid something's detained him.
- Possibly.

332
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:28,880
- Perhaps I had better run along.
- I'd be delighted to drive you.

333
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:33,034
- No, that won't be necessary.
- Not necessary, but very pleasant.

334
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:35,875
<i>(siren)</i>

335
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:39,590
<i>(man) Air raid. Take cover,
everybody, the alert is sounded.</i>

336
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:43,230
Take cover. Take cover, please. Air raid.

337
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:46,313
- The alert's sounded, sir. Take cover.
- Thank you.

338
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:50,030
Not at all, sir.
Air raid. Take cover.

339
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:53,079
The alert is sounded. Please take cover.

340
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:56,233
Shall we go in that church?
It looks quite unperturbed.

341
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,312
All right.

342
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:03,952
From what I read in the papers,
a church is the one thing they never miss.

343
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:14,071
A few others seem to have had the same idea.

344
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:18,154
There's lots of room in front,
among the sinners.

345
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,993
Shall we sit here? I knew that old boy.
He was quite a stickler.

346
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:31,471
Went to his grave convinced
the Lord made only two kinds of people -

347
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:35,190
his kind, and the rest of the world.

348
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,193
If he were here tonight,
he wouldn't approve of all this.

349
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:41,398
- I take it this is a fashionable church.
- Indisputably.

350
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:45,110
Some of our very best people
have been married here.

351
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:49,035
- By the way, were you married in a church?
- No.

352
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:51,919
- Judge's chambers?
- No.

353
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,593
Registry office?

354
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:56,673
Why all this sudden interest
in my vital statistics?

355
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:59,594
You may as well know, Miss Brown,
I'm vitally interested.

356
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:04,516
- You may as well know I'm not married.
- You don't say.

357
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:09,994
- I only told you that to discourage you.
- Well, it worked perfectly. I was discouraged.

358
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:13,756
Then you might as well also know
I think you're very attractive.

359
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,911
- Ah.
- But a little late.

360
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,151
I see. There's someone else.

361
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:22,439
But there must be some hope.
You say I'm attractive. You aren't married.

362
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:26,639
Unless your wedding's arranged within
the next half-hour, I have a sporting chance.

363
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:29,758
You must be terribly in love with him.

364
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:33,595
- Insane.
- I wonder if he knows how lucky he is.

365
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:36,753
<i>- I... I think so.
- (siren)</i>

366
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:40,196
- There's the all clear.
- Then I must go.

367
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,000
Of course, they... they may come back.

368
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:48,151
General feeling seems to be that they won't.

369
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:52,200
Dull fellows. No feeling
whatever for romance.

370
00:32:58,081 --> 00:32:59,309
Good night.

371
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:02,279
Shall we say the Ivy,
about one on Thursday?

372
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,556
- What for?
- Lunch.

373
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,872
- There's no purpose in it.
- There's no harm in it either.

374
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:10,316
All right. The Ivy at one. Good night.

375
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:15,031
I hope you believe me when I tell you this is
the first air raid I've ever actually enjoyed.

376
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:17,430
No doubt the spiritual effect of the church.

377
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:19,512
Good night, Miss Brown.

378
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,152
Oh, hello.

379
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,880
- It's almost two. I'm due back at school.
- I hope I didn't upset your plans.

380
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:54,351
No, no, it was my fault.
I'm sorry I stood you up.

381
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,433
It's quite all right. How was kindergarten?

382
00:33:57,521 --> 00:34:00,991
Jolly. Some jerk gave us
a lecture on fundamentals.

383
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,232
Over and over again, the same things.
I nearly went nuts.

384
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:07,791
So I came here to take a nap
rather than going to the Regency House.

385
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,238
- It really doesn't matter.
- Now, don't be like that.

386
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:16,109
- At least I wasn't out with anybody else.
- Really?

387
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:19,034
I was. He was very charming.

388
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:22,909
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have asked him in.

389
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:27,910
Oh, so that's it, hm?
Trying to make me burn.

390
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:32,995
Not at all. Just bringing you up to date.
I'm having lunch with him Thursday.

391
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:40,557
Say.

392
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:43,792
<i>I believe you were out with somebody else.</i>

393
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:52,551
I know, honey. I'm a worm.

394
00:34:56,681 --> 00:35:02,278
Gentlemen, you've completed your training
and you're now ready for active service.

395
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,159
And you've got a pretty tough job
in front of you.

396
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:08,358
But I want to thank you all
for the keenness you've shown

397
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,319
that has helped make my job
such an easy one.

398
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:17,397
Your appointments will be posted on the
notice board. Congratulations and good luck.

399
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:40,111
Come in.

400
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,637
- Yes?
- Pilot Officer Baker, sir.

401
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,838
- Oh, the American.
- I've been assigned to your flight, sir.

402
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:55,277
That's right. I'm glad to have you, Baker.
Take a seat.

403
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,158
Thank you.

404
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,631
I've just been going over your record.
It's excellent.

405
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:03,519
If it's so good, why wasn't I
assigned to a fighter squadron?

406
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:08,152
Each man in the RAF is assigned to where
he's most needed and is best qualified to fit.

407
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,278
I think you'll find a bomber has its points.

408
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:14,273
Perhaps, for those who like
that sort of thing, sir.

409
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:19,435
But frankly, grousing along over the Ruhr
in a bomber isn't my idea of excitement.

410
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,638
Aren't you labouring under
a slight misapprehension, Baker?

411
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:26,999
Flying a fighter in a scramble is one thing.
You can go up and get it over with.

412
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:31,359
It's something else to be five hours
in a bomber, making a target of yourself.

413
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:36,071
Maybe, sir. But I'm not, as they say,
constitutionally suited to it.

414
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,756
I'm the nervous type. I don't like
to brood over anything for five hours.

415
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:44,073
We'll try to see you get enough action
in this squadron to keep you happy.

416
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,358
Oh, come in, Wales.

417
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:51,354
This is Pilot Officer Baker, just posted
to our squadron. Flying Officer Wales.

418
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:52,920
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

419
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,674
- I'm sure you'll find itjolly here.
- Yeah. Jolly.

420
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:58,753
Come along. I want you to meet the others.

421
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,758
Gentlemen.

422
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,873
This is Pilot Officer Baker,
our new squadron member.

423
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,431
- Flight Officer Starling-Richardson.
- How are you, Baker?

424
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,989
- Flying Officer Graves.
- How do you do?

425
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,993
- Pilot Officer Thorndyke.
- Baker.

426
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:20,353
And Flying Officer Watson.

427
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:23,274
<i>- (Tim) How do you do, Watson?
- Hello, Baker.</i>

428
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:26,876
- And Flying Officer Pillby.
- Oh, hello.

429
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:29,350
- How do you do?
- I know you.

430
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:34,037
- You wouldn't introduce me to Carol Brown.
- Sure, I remember. How are you?

431
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:37,511
This is remarkable.
Morley wouldn't introduce me to her either.

432
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:40,320
All the men who wouldn't introduce me
in one room.

433
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:42,995
Seems we have more
in common that I thought, sir.

434
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,515
- Apparently.
- Have you known her long?

435
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:48,195
- Not very.
- I haven't seen much of her lately.

436
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:51,876
Been confined with that operational
training they hand you over here.

437
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,713
- How is she?
- Oh, splendid.

438
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,998
Perhaps you'd like to see the place?
This is the Blue Room.

439
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:01,711
And over here is the Hall of Mirrors,
where we hold all our soirees.

440
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:06,511
Let me see, Baker. B-A-K-E-R.
Yes, that'll fit in just nicely.

441
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,752
I do the carving myself.
Rather neat, don't you think?

442
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,593
<i>(phone rings)</i>

443
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,911
I'll take it.

444
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,151
Yes?

445
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:17,959
Yes, sir.

446
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,714
- We're wanted in the Operations Room.
- Let's go.

447
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:26,797
I haven't had a chance to add Wilson's name
yet. He's the lad you're replacing, you know.

448
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:32,521
And your objective tonight is Berlin.

449
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:39,312
Men, you've received your operations orders.
In addition, I want reconnaissance reports.

450
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,154
Observe particularly landmarks, lights,

451
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:45,790
and concentrations of troops and equipment
that are not indicated.

452
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:51,114
Each aircraft will carry 200,000 leaflets
to be scattered thoroughly over the city.

453
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,271
Leaflets?

454
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:56,080
Yes, Baker. Leaflets.

455
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:59,153
Any further questions, gentlemen?

456
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:02,517
Zero hour, 1800 hours.

457
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,513
Synchronise your watches, gentlemen.

458
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:11,510
It will be exactly 15.32... now.

459
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,069
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

460
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,599
No.

461
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:23,674
I'm not in a war.
I'm back carrying the mail.

462
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,836
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, thank you.

463
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,435
But see if there's anything
you can do for Mr Baker.

464
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:38,513
- Mr Baker, sir?
- Yeah, that's me.

465
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:41,320
Bomb aimer, navigator,
second cook and bottle washer.

466
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:44,791
I'm like the friend who went along
on the honeymoon just for the ride.

467
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:49,079
This is a coincidence, you might say,
seeing as how my name is Baker too.

468
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:51,994
Harry Baker. I wonder if we could be related.

469
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,710
- Could be. Do you spell it with a B?
- Oh, yes, sir.

470
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,792
B-A-K-E-R. Baker.

471
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:41,192
- Take over for a while, Baker.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,240
We're nearing our objective. I'll take over.

473
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,319
Corporal?

474
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:13,720
Stand by.

475
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:51,560
- Those guys aren't kidding, even if we are.
- Go aft and give Corporal Baker a hand.

476
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,791
Yes, sir.

477
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,274
Oh, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

478
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,750
That's not the way to do it.

479
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:14,752
You do it like this.

480
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:17,674
Sir, we're supposed to open
them up so they can read 'em.

481
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:21,037
Well, I think they'll make
more of an impression this way.

482
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:29,158
You just pass them to me
and I'll make the deliveries.

483
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:32,472
<i>D I been workin' on the railroad</i>

00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:07,593
- That's all right. That's all. Close it up.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,956
Oh, wait a minute.

495
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,838
No, no, no, sir.

496
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:15,118
That was only supposed
to be used in case of fire, sir.

497
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:17,590
- Close it up.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:31,593
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

499
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:41,080
All right, all right,
I'm hurrying as fast as I can.

500
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,796
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

501
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:49,111
Just a minute, Tim.
Hello?

502
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:53,592
Hello, Tim. Just a minute, just a minute.

503
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:56,195
Just a moment, please.
Hello?

504
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:59,557
Listen, honey, I'm afraid
I'm gonna be a little late.

505
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,155
We got held up by a traffic light in Berlin.

506
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:05,836
I had to have a few hours sleep
so I could look my best. Do you mind?

507
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:09,436
No, no, of course I don't mind.
How long will you be?

508
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,718
45 minutes on the dot. OK?

509
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,393
Of course it's OK.

510
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,551
Attagal.

511
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:20,156
But don't be late, Tim. Bye.

512
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:27,198
Oh! Oh, goodness.

513
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:31,877
- Hello. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- You caught me in the shower, that's all.

514
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,840
Well, give me a minute.
Count three, then come on in.

515
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:37,070
Righto.

516
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:39,880
One, two, three. Here I come.

517
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:44,552
I was only 30 streets away
so I decided to drop in.

518
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,279
- I'll be out in a minute.
- I knew you had no show today,

519
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:53,230
and as I have 48 hours' leave, I hoped you'd
drive to my father's place in Kent with me.

520
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:57,599
Sorry, I would have loved it,
but I already have a date.

521
00:44:57,681 --> 00:45:00,912
Nothing you could ignore?

522
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:03,799
I'm afraid not.

523
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:07,556
Sometimes, being rude at the right moment
makes a social career.

524
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:11,316
- Or wrecks one.
- Well, there's something to that.

525
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:13,596
You've completely ruined my weekend.

526
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,320
- Can't you go anyway?
- No.

527
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:21,359
I hope you'll forgive the way I look,
but I was trying to hurry.

528
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,352
Beautiful.

529
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:29,799
There's nothing for it but to go to the club
and grumble about staying in London.

530
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:33,396
- I'll be getting along.
- Oh, you needn't hurry.

531
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,632
Why should I tantalise myself?

532
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:40,474
It's much better to make it
a quick, clean wound and go.

533
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:43,553
But I'll try again next week... earlier.

534
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,109
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

535
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:55,870
- You're sure you won't...
- Mm-mm.

536
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:00,477
You've no idea how lovely it can be
in Kent at this time of year.

537
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,950
Then I expect it is goodbye.

538
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,271
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

539
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:14,632
<i>- (knock on door)
- Come in.</i>

540
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,838
- Hello, old boy.
- Hello, Roger.

541
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:20,719
- Where are you bound for?
- London.

542
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,076
- To meet her?
- Rather.

543
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:26,312
I'm going to London too.
Is there any possibility...

544
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,437
Not the slightest, old boy.

545
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:31,831
Your esprit de corps
is practically nonexistent.

546
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:34,037
How does a fella get to London in a hurry?

547
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:37,272
Fellows who haven't got cars
walk to the village and get a train.

548
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,716
The journey takes approximately three hours.

549
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:42,838
That's just dandy.
I told her I'd be there in 45 minutes.

550
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:46,834
Then you'll be exactly two hours and
15 minutes late, if the train's on time.

551
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,517
- Well, come on, let's hurry.
- I'm not taking the train. I've a car. Cheerio.

552
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:55,992
Oh boy, a car!
That's what I call a break, you having a car.

553
00:46:56,081 --> 00:47:00,393
No. It won't do you a bit of good
dropping all those hints around, old man.

554
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:05,953
If you won't share your female with me, then
I certainly won't share my Austin with you.

555
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,271
Oh... Now, look here.

556
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:12,036
There's nothing I'd rather do
than introduce you to Miss Brown.

557
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,681
Then I'd be delighted
to drive you to town. Get in.

558
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:16,752
Thank you. I'm in.

559
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:25,119
Hey, Al! Al Bennett!

560
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,351
Tim! Hey, Tim!

561
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:32,879
Stop, Roger. That's Al Bennett, a friend of
mine from America. I want you to meet him.

562
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:34,872
Come on, back up.

563
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:38,390
- Hello, Al.
- Tim! How are you?

564
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,995
- What are you doing in England?
- Ferry service.

565
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:44,915
- At the moment I'm looking for the beam.
- They've another name for it here.

566
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:47,515
- What are you doing?
- I inherited a dukedom.

567
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:51,674
A provision of the will was that I join the RAF.
Roger Pillby, Al Bennett.

568
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,989
- How do you do?
- Swell.

569
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,597
- We oughta preserve this reunion in alcohol.
- It's no coincidence you're outside a saloon.

570
00:47:57,681 --> 00:48:00,241
- They call it "pub" over here.
- Oh. Come on, Roger.

571
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,438
I'd like to some other time,
but we've got an engagement in town.

572
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:06,433
It'll only take a minute.
We'll still beat that train.

573
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:10,116
- When did you get in, Al?
- Yesterday. Pushed up a new record.

574
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:14,194
- Eight hours and 12 minutes.
- Eight hours and... Say, that tops my time.

575
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,435
Look at that. That's a lot of hot air.
They'll never try that again.

576
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,796
- Hello, sister.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

577
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:23,519
- Three Bass beers.
- Yes, sir.

578
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:24,954
Bitter for me, miss.

579
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:27,032
When you ask for whisky, you get Scotch.

580
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:29,316
And when you ask for ice,
you get hot water.

581
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:32,393
- How's it going?
- Still flying them across. Three a month.

582
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:35,279
I'd be a wealthy man
if my wife wasn't attaching my salary.

583
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:38,194
- Yeah, that's good dough.
- How much do you get?

584
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:41,717
- Me? They pay me off in stamps.
- I don't savvy.

585
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:44,190
- One and elevenpence, please, sir.
- Righto.

586
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:48,320
- Shall we say to Miss Brown?
- Brown? Carol Brown? Is she over here?

587
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,518
- You know her too?
- Sure. I knew her when Tim knew her.

588
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:53,831
Everybody in the world knows her but me.

589
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:59,473
But this is my day. I mean night. Tonight,
at last, Miss Brown and I will find each other.

590
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:04,032
- Wait a minute. You're only meeting her.
- I know, but the war being what it is, old boy,

591
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:07,397
if there should be any sudden sadness,
she'll have me to cry on.

592
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:11,315
- She might even receive the Pillby ring.
- What's that, a telephone number?

593
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,518
It's a gold ring in frightful taste,
worth absolutely nothing,

594
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:18,674
but the family tradition is that
it must always go to the right woman.

595
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:21,958
- How do you know?
- I never carry it with me. I don't trust myself.

596
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,714
But it might be in the cards
that Miss Brown gets it.

597
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:29,192
That is, of course, if you cooperate
and don't get silly ideas about living forever.

598
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:30,680
- Three more.
- No, really.

599
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:33,878
He's ordered them.
We might as well drink them.

600
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:37,590
- What's happened to all the boys?
- Still ferrying. All but Heck Newman.

601
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:41,071
- He crack up?
- No, he got food poisoning at a picnic.

602
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:45,393
Did you hear Slip Mason's here? He married
a dame with a title and a lot of money.

603
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:46,880
- Slip?
- Yeah.

604
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:51,000
Gee, I'd like to see him. Slip flew
upside down from St Louis to New York.

605
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:53,675
- You know what the time is?
- I'm on my way there.

606
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:55,956
- You two can drop me.
- No, thanks. Really.

607
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:59,670
- I'd like to, but I've got to get to London.
- It's right on the way.

608
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:03,197
You can just run in and run out.
Slip would be glad to see you.

609
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:06,751
Well, OK, butjust for a minute.
We can still beat that train.

610
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:11,631
- That's what the hare said to the tortoise.
- Oh, is Hare over here too?

611
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:14,080
Here we are.

612
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,675
- You're sure this is it?
- I swear it.

613
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:19,958
- Will it be all right for me to come up?
- Sure.

614
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:25,240
Here it is, 4am and you said it would take
a minute and that he lived on the way.

615
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,596
Slip lives nearer Glasgow than London.

616
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:30,400
We couldn't refuse Slip
when he asked us to dinner.

617
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:34,315
It wasn't dinner. It was telling
the life story of every pilot in America.

618
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:39,395
I didn't know America had as many pilots.
I thought you were unprepared.

619
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,676
- Is this the...
- Shh.

620
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,040
Shh!

621
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,990
Yoo-hoo. Honey?

622
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:39,873
- Carol!
- Shh. She's gone to bed.

623
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:44,273
- But we had a date. Why should she?
- Perhaps she was sleepy.

624
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:48,832
- I'll wake her up.
- Tell her not to go to any trouble for me.

625
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,878
- She's not home.
- Well, she must be.

626
00:52:01,961 --> 00:52:05,078
How do you like that?
Just because we're a little late.

627
00:52:05,161 --> 00:52:07,356
All that hurry for nothing.

628
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:09,716
She couldn't have misunderstood me.

629
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:13,157
I talked to her on the phone.
She knew we had a date.

630
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:16,233
Perhaps she's on an errand.

631
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:18,881
Pardon me. Will you have a drink?

632
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,758
- You gonna have one?
- I am.

633
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:23,639
I wouldn't think of letting you
drink alone, old boy.

634
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:26,235
I can't believe that she'd just walk out.

635
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:29,757
There's usually a simple explanation
everyone laughs at once it's out.

636
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:33,072
But this isn't like her.
She's so dependable.

637
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:35,550
- Is she the coy type?
- What do you mean?

638
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:40,078
- Hiding under the bed.
- No. Nobody could get under her bed.

639
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:59,033
Everything's so lovely down here.
You'd never believe there's a war on.

640
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:03,478
I wouldn't be too sure. Dad and his home
guard might pop out of a bush any moment.

641
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:06,758
<i>- Parachutists, you know.
- (car horn)</i>

642
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:14,670
Shall we take the short cut back?
It's likely to prove the longest way.

643
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:16,752
By all means.

644
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:20,231
I wonder if you can possibly realise
what all this has meant to me -

645
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:23,279
staying in that house that looks as if
it's been there forever.

646
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:27,639
It has. The part you were in
last night's the new part. It was built in 1748.

647
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:32,556
The other wing dates back to the Norman
Conquest. But nobody's been in it for years.

648
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:37,954
- Maybe it's still full of Normans.
- That's always been one of my pet theories.

649
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:48,197
And to think, back home I lived in
the oldest house in town. It was 32 years old.

650
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:52,797
- I'll wager the plumbing was better.
- It didn't have plumbing. It was in Oklahoma.

651
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:57,272
- You must have been through a great deal.
- You don't know anything.

652
00:53:57,361 --> 00:54:03,630
We moved to Kansas and had a lovely house
with hot and cold water and steam heat.

653
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:07,999
And along came a big wind
and blew the roof off.

654
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,390
And there you were, out in the cold again.

655
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,518
Of course, I'm giving you
a one-sided picture of my life.

656
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:16,832
I once had a house in New Rochelle
and nothing happened at all.

657
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,913
It must have been a very wonderful house.

658
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:26,269
Somehow I prefer this one.

659
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:31,875
It's yours if you want it to be.

660
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,116
I mean that, Carol.

661
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:42,632
What is it people say? "This is so sudden"?

662
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:50,710
It would have been suddener if I'd asked
when I wanted to, in that church.

663
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:53,269
Marry me, Carol.

664
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,640
- I can't.
- Why not?

665
00:54:59,721 --> 00:55:02,713
Oh, lots of reasons.

666
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,190
Hold this, will you?

667
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:11,517
What about your father?

668
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:16,436
Does he know that we've seen
each other exactly six times?

669
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,989
That I'm a dancer at the Regency House?

670
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:22,357
Yes. And I must admit he was
a little difficult about that.

671
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:25,513
Kept asking "Is she a good dancer?"

672
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:27,796
And that my family came from Oklahoma?

673
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:31,317
Of course, it might be better
to break Oklahoma to him by degrees.

674
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,995
Does that clear up everything?

675
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:37,310
No.

676
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,437
No, it doesn't.

677
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:41,989
It wouldn't be Baker, would it?

678
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:48,591
- How did you know?
- The best possible source - the man himself.

679
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:51,433
Well, that's it.

680
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:55,309
- Are you going to marry him?
- Oh, let's drop it.

681
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:58,392
<i>(sighs)</i>

682
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:06,870
I don't love him.

683
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,873
I don't know that I ever have or ever will.

684
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,750
But when I'm with him
I can't seem to remember that.

685
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:23,357
Once I didn't see him for a whole year
and I thought that...

686
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:26,112
When I did it was...

687
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,239
just the same.

688
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:31,312
I see.

689
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:41,039
You're the one I ought to love.
You're everything that Tim isn't.

690
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:44,716
Then you should marry me
at once, by all means.

691
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,077
- You still want me to?
- Of course.

692
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:53,997
Baker happened before you knew me.
That's merely poor timing on fate's part.

693
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,072
I couldn't.

694
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,509
When I'm not even sure of myself.

695
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,429
Well, it's about time.

696
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,077
What are you doing here?

697
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:51,598
- We had a date, didn't we?
- Yes. We had a date yesterday.

698
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:54,832
I know, honey. I'm sorry
about standing you up, but...

699
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,912
It's all right.

700
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,432
Here. Let me.

701
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,830
I'll get it.

702
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:07,754
I don't have an excuse either.
I just ran into Al Bennett.

703
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:11,390
We did some hangar flying
and I just lost track of the time.

704
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:14,041
That might happen to anybody.

705
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:17,994
Here, let me. I'll get that.

706
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:29,040
- These are pretty. Where'd you find them?
- In the country.

707
00:58:29,121 --> 00:58:31,919
- You been to the country, huh?
- Mm-hm.

708
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,110
- Alone?
- No.

709
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:40,155
- Did you have a good time?
- Wonderful.

710
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:45,513
- Who'd you go with?
- A friend of mine.

711
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:52,356
Listen.

712
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:57,196
I know I'm a heel and I'm sorry.
Will you forgive me?

713
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:00,830
But there's nothing to forgive.
I've had a lovely time.

714
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:03,435
I just don't want you to feel hurt.

715
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:05,716
But I'm not hurt.

716
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:08,911
I guess I'd better be getting back.

717
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:11,754
Yes, I think you had. It's rather late.

718
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:14,560
- Goodbye, Carol.
- Goodbye.

719
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:42,591
I said I was sorry, didn't I? I crawled.
I apologised. When do I get relief?

720
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:45,957
But what have I said or done?
I'm not mad, really I'm not.

721
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,238
Stop needling me. Why don't you
bawl me out and get it over with?

722
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:52,631
But why should I bawl you out?

723
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:56,760
- I'm glad you didn't show up.
- Look here. What's this all about?

724
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:59,036
Nothing, except we're through.

725
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:03,833
Notjust again, but through for keeps.

726
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,111
Well.

727
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:19,193
- That must have been some weekend.
- It was.

728
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:23,117
He couldn't have spent all his time
picking flowers.

729
01:00:23,201 --> 01:00:27,956
He didn't. He did something
that would never occur to you.

730
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,317
Something you couldn't even understand.

731
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:34,676
He asked me to marry him.

732
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,320
So that's what's bothering you.

733
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,553
Why didn't you say so? If you really
wanna get married, I'll marry you.

734
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:49,235
You mean you'd make
that great sacrifice just for me?

735
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:52,634
Sure. I'll marry you tonight if you say so.

736
01:00:56,441 --> 01:00:59,035
That's awfully sweet of you, Tim.

737
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:04,992
Your proposal was beautiful.

738
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,072
Romantic.

739
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,992
Everything a girl could want it to be.

740
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:19,355
But for your personal and private
information, I'd rather marry a...

741
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:25,919
I'm very grateful, but I can't accept.
Now please go.

742
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,312
Get out!

743
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:42,034
And get that tramp friend of yours
out of my bed!

744
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,357
Did, er...

745
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:50,239
- Did somebody come in?
- No. Somebody went out.

746
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:52,676
- Not her?
- Yes, her.

747
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:55,753
Oh, dash it all. I muffed it again.

748
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:02,320
<i>... sources of large-scale German troop
concentrations along the Dutch frontier.</i>

749
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:06,360
<i>Advices filtering in from the lowlands
appear to confirm the suspicion</i>

750
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:08,830
<i>- that some sudden military action...
- Hello.</i>

751
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:13,073
- Have you fellows heard the news?
- Sure. I could have told you that months ago.

752
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:16,631
- Really?
- American cunning. Positively a genius for it.

753
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:20,555
All leave is cancelled and the flight
commander has orders for us to stand by.

754
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:22,996
You had better let him know you're back.

755
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:26,869
Maybe they're gonna let us drop
welcome mats on the Low Countries.

756
01:02:27,401 --> 01:02:30,199
You look a little faded. Strenuous weekend?

757
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:34,991
If you must know I spent my whole leave
in a certain flat. If you must know.

759

Come in.

760
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:45,237
Wales said you were worried about me, so I
rushed over to say the problem child's home.

761
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:53,793
Then I suggest you do what I'm doing.
Get into uniform.

762
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,711
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

763
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:03,277
We both seem to go in for
the same kind of flowers.

764
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:05,591
Yes, it is, rather.

765
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:09,193
As a matter of fact, we seem to
go in for a lot of the same things.

766
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:11,670
We have more in common
than we've realised.

767
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:15,117
Yeah, that may be,
but Carol's not one of them!

768
01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:18,432
Sir, the CO wishes to speak with you
on the phone right away.

769
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:20,512
Thank you, Roger.

770
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:25,953
There's a flap on. We're wanted at Operations.
Better get changed.

771
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,272
Your objective tonight is the
marshalling yard at Dortmund.

772
01:03:29,361 --> 01:03:33,115
There are heavy concentrations
of mechanised units and material.

773
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:36,750
Undoubtedly, you will encounter
heavy anti-aircraft opposition,

774
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:40,277
and for some of you this will be
the first time under fire.

775
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:43,990
But I see by your faces that
you're not averse to the idea.

776
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:48,711
That's all. The intelligence officer will
give you the latest details from his reports.

777
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:51,110
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

778
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:58,073
Gentlemen, the advance of the enemy
has been far greater than was anticipated.

779
01:03:58,161 --> 01:04:02,712
It appears that the flank of the Peel Line
has already been turned.

780
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:05,918
Your mission, therefore,
is of extreme importance.

781
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:07,870
Yes?

782
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,555
Six minutes on this course
to reach our objective.

783
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:12,552
Right. Corporal?

784
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:15,800
Stand by.

785
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:33,396
I'll try to get below this muck.
We'll make our run-up at 2,000 feet.

786
01:06:58,121 --> 01:07:00,715
- Bomb doors open.
- Right.

787
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:02,790
Right.

788
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:07,432
Steady.

789
01:07:08,481 --> 01:07:10,472
Go on.

790
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:27,914
Nice shooting, Baker.

791
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,520
What's the matter?

792
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:07,761
Pull her up. Climb out of these searchlights.

793
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:13,552
Considering that we're on one engine,
this aircraft is performing exceptionally well.

794
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:18,749
That chap's in trouble down there.
He'll never get out of those lights.

795
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:21,878
I'd better go down
and see if I can't turn one of them off.

796
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:26,637
Old boy, you've been in the spotlight
long enough. I'm coming to give you a hand.

797
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:30,873
Stay out of this, Roger. Stay out!
Job's completed. Return to base.

798
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:33,031
Too late, sir. I'm on my way down.

799
01:08:35,521 --> 01:08:41,471
How bloody considerate of them to keep
those lights on. Never did like the dark.

800
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:46,794
Even as a child, used to complain bitterly.
Regular tantrums.

801
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:51,591
Refused to be put in a room
with the lights out. Never got over it.

802
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:55,390
Probably explains my passion
for nightclub life.

803
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:57,517
Take that, you dirty!

<i>(engine spluttering)</i>

805
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,839
Well, at last we're out of that.

806
01:09:14,921 --> 01:09:17,276
Yes, but Roger isn't.

807
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,035
Bale out, boys, we're in a dead duck.

808
01:09:35,281 --> 01:09:38,512
<i>(Morley) Pillby! Pillby!</i>

809
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:40,398
Pillby!

810
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:43,234
- Do you see him?
- Yes, in flames.

811
01:09:43,321 --> 01:09:47,917
I heard him tell the crew
to bale out, but there wasn't time.

Stand by to bale out.

816

Go up, Baker, with the others,
and get ready to bale out.

817
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:50,319
We're at 2,000 feet. Bale out.

818
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:54,874
After you.

819
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:58,158
- Cheerio.
- So long, matey.

820
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:06,156
- Baker, bale out. We're losing height fast.
- Not me. I'd rather ride than walk any day.

821
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,675
I won't take a chance there's any ceiling.

822
01:11:08,761 --> 01:11:12,993
All right, you bale out. I don't call it a chance
when I can see a perfectly good beach.

823
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:16,756
- What?
- Blimey! There's the seaside, right under us!

824
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,312
Sit down, Corporal.

825
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:10,597
- Jolly good show, Baker. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

826
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:13,149
- Where are we?
- Holland. That's a bloody windmill.

827
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:16,950
There's a stroke of luck,
coming down in a neutral country

828
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:22,161
when I was all ready to be concentrated
in a German concentration camp.

829
01:12:22,241 --> 01:12:24,755
- Get out, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

830
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,834
Stand clear, both of you.
I'll join you in a moment.

831

Look, everything but the tulips.

832
01:12:35,441 --> 01:12:39,878
This is real luck. Boat, sea, and perhaps some
genial Dutchman to steer us to England.

833
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:43,840
Blimey! Look! What's them?

- He asked how we got here.

850
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:55,715
I'll tell him.
It's a tough break, squarehead.

851
01:13:55,801 --> 01:14:01,159
There's a couple of other British planes
down on this beach. General Gort's in one.

852
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:07,838
Just what I thought.
He doesn't understand a word of English.

853
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:12,312
If we can keep him from letting the others
know, we can get to that boat and beat it.

854
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:15,871
You two make a break for it.
Leave him to me.

Oh, so that's it, huh? A hero to the last.

Well, get this - we all go or we all stay.

885
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:41,199
Here are your clothes.

886
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,637
Listen. What happened to that officer
that was brought in with me?

887
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:47,155
- Squadron Leader Morley?
- That's him.

888
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:50,711
He's all right.
He was discharged about an hour ago.

889
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:55,955
Orderly, this bed is available, ready
to change. Hurry and dress, please.

890
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:57,713
What's all the rush?

891
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:02,192
I heard the head lady say how they're
expecting a lot of new ones. Evacuees.

892
01:18:02,281 --> 01:18:05,671
My, this is a handy little garment, isn't it?

893
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:12,472
<i>(knock on door)</i>

894
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:24,595
Tim...

895
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:28,913
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sure, sure. It's nothing at all.

896
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:33,040
Of course, I won't do much elbow-bending
with this broken wing for a while.

897
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:36,033
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, thanks.

898
01:18:41,441 --> 01:18:44,080
Have you seen Morley?

899
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:48,439
No, but he telephoned me.
I'm meeting him at the Savoy for tea.

900
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:52,672
Mind if I sit down?
I'm still kind of shaky, you know.

901
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:57,755
Oh, I'm sorry, Tim. Here, sit over here
in this chair by the window.

902
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:06,877
Here, I'll take it.

903
01:19:06,961 --> 01:19:12,957
- Would you like something under your foot?
- Yes, it might relieve the pressure a bit.

904
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:25,235
- Is that better?
- Yes, that's much better, thanks.

905
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:28,757
Morley said you were still
in the hospital when he left.

906
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:31,560
Do you think you should be
up and around so soon?

907
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:35,873
Oh, just seeing you is doing me a lot
more good than any hospital ever could.

908
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:40,273
You know, it's funny. When I woke up,
the first thing the nurse said to me was:

909
01:19:40,361 --> 01:19:44,673
"You've been raving about a Carol.
Who is she, your wife?"

910
01:19:44,761 --> 01:19:51,200
I don't know why, but I said yes. Maybe that's
because it's what I want more than anything.

911
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:53,272
We're not going into that again.

912
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:57,639
Oh, I can't say that I blame you,
after the way I've acted,

913
01:19:57,721 --> 01:19:59,996
but I can't hurt someone I love so much.

914
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:02,800
- Tim, I've got to go now.
- No, wait a minute.

915
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:07,159
Look, maybe this'll convince you. I had this
for you the other day when you threw me out.

916
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,596
That's why I was so late for our date.

917
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:14,118
Now, I may be dumb, but I'm not that dumb.
You said you were with Al Bennett.

918
01:20:14,201 --> 01:20:17,477
Sure, but I was just covering up
so that I could surprise you.

919
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:21,156
When I got to the store, the jeweller
had closed up. I had to track him home.

920
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:23,835
It's true, honey. Come on, put it on and we'II...

921
01:20:23,921 --> 01:20:27,914
Oop, I dropped it.
Here, wait a minute, I'll get it.

922
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:40,792
Of all the contemptible, dirty,
low-down things you've ever done!

923
01:20:40,881 --> 01:20:42,872
- Listen to me!
- Get out. Get out!

924
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:45,555
I love you. I wouldn't
go to this bother if I didn't.

925
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:47,472
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

926
01:20:47,561 --> 01:20:49,153
Yes?

927
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:52,313
Hello. I'm sorry, I was held up.
I'll be ready in a minute.

928
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:54,995
No, no, Carol, don't. I can't meet you.

929
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:58,835
There's a flap on. All leaves are cancelled.
I've reported for duty.

930
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:01,879
I understand.

931
01:21:01,961 --> 01:21:04,156
I'll be waiting.

932
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,153
Good luck, darling. Goodbye.

933
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:13,760
I know you're only a shattered hulk of a man,
but you'd better report for duty.

934
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:20,110
All leave is cancelled, and your CO won't be
taken in by a broken wing as easily as I was.

935
01:21:20,201 --> 01:21:23,511
All right, I'll go. But not until
you wish me good luck, too.

936
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:26,832
- Good luck and goodbye.
- Now, you listen to me.

937
01:21:27,921 --> 01:21:31,596
That guy can phone you every day.
You can call him "darling" all you want.

938
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:34,798
But it won't do you any good.
You're mine and you'll stay mine.

939
01:21:34,881 --> 01:21:37,441
Let go of me, you're hurting.

940
01:21:41,641 --> 01:21:46,396
<i>- If I've got to knock...
- No, I won't. (gasps)</i>

941
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:49,075
There you are, my bride.

942
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:57,078
And when I come back, I'll make it official.

943
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:03,152
Come back here and take this thing with you!

944
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:05,880
Don't cry, darling. Don't worry about me.

945
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:08,714
I'll be back. Nothing ever happens to me.

946
01:22:09,321 --> 01:22:12,233
He would get the wrong size!

947
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:17,878
Hello, Falcon Leader.
Hello, Falcon Leader.

948
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:23,911
Message acknowledged. Rearm, refuel.
Emergency landing ground five two.

949
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:27,232
Further orders follow. Over.

950
01:22:27,321 --> 01:22:30,518
<i>The Falcon Leader calling.

<i>The message understood.
The message understood. Over.</i>

952
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:37,358
32 Squadron returning, sir.
Three aircraft missing.

953
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:43,198
54 Squadron, six aircraft missing.
87 Squadron, four missing. 93 Squadron...

954
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:47,433
- Order replacements from the reserve pool.
- Quite so, quite so.

955
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:51,833
There's no time to rest. There's never been
a situation in history comparable to this.

956
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:55,311
325,000 men, the heart and core
of our army, are at Dunkirk,

957
01:22:55,401 --> 01:23:00,191
being bombed and strafed every moment
by the enemy, who outnumber us four to one.

958
01:23:00,281 --> 01:23:03,318
The navy has every vessel afloat
waiting to bring the men off.

959
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:05,961
The air force must see that they do it.

960
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:09,920
We must put every available man into action
to wrest control of the air.

961
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,993
That's 32 Squadron coming in to land now.

962
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,990
Yes. Yes, yes, definitely...

963
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:04,036
We engaged the enemy just south
of Dunkirk, sir. About 12,000 feet.

964
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:08,273
One formation, 20 Heinkels,
18 Messerschmitts about 3,000 feet above.

965
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:12,115
We used number three attack. We got
five Heinkel and three Messerschmitt.

966
01:24:12,201 --> 01:24:14,999
Good. We're holding them,
in spite of their numbers?

967
01:24:15,081 --> 01:24:17,356
- I think so, sir.
- How did you get on, Walker?

968
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:22,356
I got a four-second burst at a Heinkel at 200
yards, sir. He went out of control in flames.

969
01:24:22,441 --> 01:24:27,117
- Then I attacked two Messerschmitts.
- These might be our replacements now.

970
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:04,110
Johnson shot down two Heinkels then lost
control. I watched him land in the water.

971
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:06,590
There was a launch.
I expect he was picked up.

972
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:10,390
Get some coffee while you're being refuelled.

973
01:25:15,841 --> 01:25:18,719
Pilot Officer Carson, sir,
from the reserve pool.

974
01:25:18,801 --> 01:25:23,033
- Pilot Officer Baker, sir.
- Sergeant Johnson, sir.

975
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:25,271
Good. Report to 32 Squadron.

976
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:30,799
I expect you'll have just about time for a spot
of coffee with the others before getting away.

977
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:32,872
Yes, sir.

978
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:41,959
- What's it really like over there?
- Cloudy.

979
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:45,835
<i>32 Squadron. 32 Squadron.</i>

980
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:48,993
<i>Report for takeoff at once.
Report for takeoff at once.</i>

981
01:27:23,881 --> 01:27:26,679
If you get through, tell them
the enemy has our position.

982
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:32,040
Enemy aircraft are bombing and strafing our
embarkation point. We need aircraft help.

983
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:38,592
Look, sir, they're coming over the Channel!
Spitfires! Spitfires! Spitfires!

984
01:28:47,801 --> 01:28:49,917
All right, chaps. All set?

985
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:51,275
Kern. All set, sir.

986
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:53,033
Benson. All set, sir.

987
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:54,395
McKay. All set, sir.

988
01:28:54,481 --> 01:28:56,119
O'Brien. All set, sir.

989
01:28:56,201 --> 01:28:57,600
Baker. All set, sir.

990
01:28:57,681 --> 01:29:00,753
- Tally-ho!
- Tally-ho! I'm with you, Johnny.

991
01:30:04,521 --> 01:30:06,989
That's for Roger.

992
01:30:12,761 --> 01:30:15,229
That's for the corporal.

993
01:30:40,241 --> 01:30:42,801
This one's just for me.

994
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:21,599
<i>(band plays "Hiya, Love")</i>

995
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:27,600
Yes?

996
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:31,071
Just a minute. Yes?

997
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:34,995
Call me back at this number
if you hear anything.

998
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:37,356
- Any word at all?
- He's still missing.

999
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:42,151
They just brought in one of his squadron,
O'Brien, who baled out south of Dunkirk.

1000
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:45,233
He saw Tim shoot down two MEs
and then get a burst himself.

1001
01:31:45,321 --> 01:31:50,953
O'Brien thinks he might have baled out. I've
checked every place I can. You'll have to wait.

1002
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:54,716
If Tim baled out, he'll get back.

1003
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:58,430
I know it. I'm sure of it!

1004
01:31:58,521 --> 01:32:01,160
Why, he's had a hundred forced landings.

1005
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:04,313
Once he was lost in a snowstorm
for a whole week.

1006
01:32:04,401 --> 01:32:08,633
Everybody said he couldn't be alive.
They gave up the search.

1007
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:13,954
Then one day he was brought into town
on a sled by a couple of Indian squaws.

1008
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:16,714
Another time, at the state fair,
he was skywriting.

1009
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:20,157
All of a sudden, the motor fell out
of his plane. People screamed.

1010
01:32:20,241 --> 01:32:23,870
He made a perfect landing
right in front of the governor's grandstand.

1011
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:26,953
Why, nothing ever happens to Tim.

1012
01:32:28,401 --> 01:32:30,710
He has luck.

1013
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:34,799
He certainly has. And that isn't all he has.

1014
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:38,032
From the first, I was afraid
I couldn't shake you free of him.

1015
01:32:38,121 --> 01:32:40,715
Hello? Yes, speaking.

1016
01:32:42,441 --> 01:32:44,193
Thank you. Goodbye.

1017
01:32:44,281 --> 01:32:48,513
In half an hour they'll be bringing in
another boatload. It'll be the last of them.

1018
01:32:48,601 --> 01:32:52,594
Wait for me outside.
I'll be dressed in a minute.

1019
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:00,232
<i>(man) Oh, Peter! Peter!</i>

1020
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:02,312
Dad! Dad!

1021
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:07,238
- My boy! Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1022
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:09,118
Good.

1023
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:14,720
- Did we miss him?
- They just started coming off.

1024
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:18,191
- Then where could he be?
- Carol, there are 1,000 men on this boat.

1025
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:21,557
- We could have missed him.
- But you said we saw the first of them.

1026
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:24,394
It's easy to overlook someone
in a crowd like this.

1027
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:27,314
Stay near this gangplank.
I'll go nearer the other one.

1028
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,198
All right.

1029
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,878
Tim!

1030
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:46,992
Tim! Tim!

1031
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:52,834
<i>- Tim...
- (mouths)</i>

1032
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:00,993
Oh!

1033
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:07,633
Darling, are you hurt?

1034
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:11,873
This? Oh, this is just a new fad collar
I picked up on the other side of the Channel.

1035
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:14,873
Oh, Tim, I knew nothing
would happen to you.

1036
01:34:14,961 --> 01:34:17,521
Sure you did. I told you, didn't I?

1037
01:34:17,601 --> 01:34:20,877
Oh, it's so good
to hold you in my arms again.

1038
01:34:20,961 --> 01:34:24,271
All the time I was floating in the Channel,
I was thinking of you.

1039
01:34:24,361 --> 01:34:26,795
Look. Look, Tim.

1040
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:29,315
I couldn't get it off.

1041
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:33,597
Congratulations, Baker.
Getting through and all that.

1042
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:36,718
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr Baker?

1043
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:38,393
Our car is ready.

1044
01:34:38,481 --> 01:34:42,838
I won't need it. Some friends have met me
unexpectedly. Thank you for all your trouble.

1045
01:34:42,921 --> 01:34:44,718
You won't forget Thursday?

1046
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:49,750
Oh, no, no. I'll change the bandage.
And thank you for your blanket.

1047
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:51,240
Goodbye.

1048
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:52,954
Goodbye.

1049
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,633
- Tim?
- I know, honey.

1050
01:34:54,721 --> 01:34:57,189
I'm a worm.

1051
01:34:58,305 --> 01:35:58,328
