2
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,106
- I'm Statler.
- I'm Waldorf.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,233
We're here to heckle
The Muppet Movie.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,111
Gentlemen, that's straight ahead.
Private screening room D.

5
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,322
- Private screening?
- Yeah, they're afraid to show it in public.

6
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,407
(LAUGHING)

7
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,244
STATLER: Oh, oh. Look at this place.
What a dump.

8
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,997
WALDORF: Bunch of weirdos
around here. Look at 'em.

9
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,084
- Yes, I know you all want to sit with moi.
- Hey, lady. Is this seat taken?

10
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,422
Hey, you! Hey! Bring that back.

11
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,634
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny,
I won't be able to live with myself.

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,679
Well, then you'll have to get
another apartment, won't you?

13
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,223
You know,
I hear this movie is dynamite.

14
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,936
Get your fresh organic popcorn.
Only a buck.

15
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,063
Honey. Buy me some, please.

16
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,775
Sure, Momma.
Nothin's too good for my woman.

17
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,861
Woman! Woman! Woman!

18
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,532
- Well, I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.

19
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,785
- That's what I like about it.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

20
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,453
Yie, yie, yie, yie, yie!

21
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,207
Do it. Yay! (LAUGHING)

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,794
Oh, hey, Mr. The Frog.

23
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,964
Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish
to be in your movie?

24
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,299
Hey!

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,260
I told you, Lew.
Not in the movie or at the screening.

26
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,304
Hey, but watch. Whoa!

27
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,517
(CLEARS THROAT) Kermit, does
this film have socially redeeming value?

28
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,770
Oh, I... I certainly hope so, Sam.
Sorry about that.

29
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,148
- Kermie.
- Oh, hi, Piggy.

30
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,693
Kermie, I tried to save you a seat,
but somebody took it.

31
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,614
Hi, everybody, and welcome to the
first screening of The Muppet Movie.

32
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,033
(ALL CHEERING)

33
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:43,162
But before we begin, I'd like to thank
everyone who contributed to this film,

34
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,916
starting with the little people,
from the hairdressers to special effects.

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,044
That's enough of that, Harry.

36
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,840
- (ALL CLAMORING)
- Boom! Blow it up. Ka-boom!

37
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,883
- MUPPET: Boring.
- To the costume designers.

38
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,510
- To the prop makers.
- MISS PIGGY: Kermie, Kermie.

39
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,055
Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll film.

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,352
Yeah, but I'd like to thank everybody for
all of their hard work and their patience

41
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,355
- and their...
- Roll film! Roll film!

42
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,315
Roll film.

43
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,572
(SHUSHING)

44
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,706
Excuse me.

45
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:32,044
Uncle Kermit, is this about
how the Muppets really got started?

46
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,298
Well, it's sort of approximately
how it happened.

47
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:53,626
KERMIT: (SINGING) Why are there
so many songs about rainbows

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,214
And what's on the other side?

49
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,010
Rainbows are visions

50
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,138
But only illusions

51
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,893
And rainbows have nothing to hide

52
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,814
So we've been told

53
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,818
And some choose to believe it

54
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,406
I know they're wrong, wait and see

55
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,077
Someday we'll find it

56
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,205
The rainbow connection

57
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,793
The lovers, the dreamers and me

58
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,676
Who said that every wish

59
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,721
Would be heard and answered

60
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:51,642
When wished on the morning star?

61
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,272
Somebody thought of that

62
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,567
And someone believed it

63
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:04,488
Look what it's done so far

64
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,451
What's so amazing

65
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,829
That keeps us stargazing?

66
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:16,250
And what do we think we might see?

67
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,213
Someday we'll find it

68
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,341
The rainbow connection

69
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:29,180
The lovers, the dreamers and me

70
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,434
All of us under its spell

71
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:40,316
We know that it's probably magic

72
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,737
Have you been half asleep?

73
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,074
And have you heard voices?

74
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:53,120
I've heard them calling my name

75
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,166
Is this the sweet sound

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,377
That calls the young sailors?

77
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:05,132
The voice might be one and the same

78
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:12,723
I've heard it too many times to ignore it

79
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:17,812
It's something that I'm supposed to be

80
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,233
Someday we'll find it

81
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,111
The rainbow connection

82
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:30,199

MAN: Help! Hello.

85
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,343
This is a serious call for help.

86
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,222
- Yeah?
- Someone help.

87
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,308
Ah, I... Oh, oh.

88
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,020
You, you with the banjo.

89
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,274
Can you help me?
I have lost my sense of direction.

90
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,942
Have you tried Hare Krishna?

91
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,944
Ha, ha. No.

92
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,788
- No. I mean I'm really lost.

Darn, I missed. You know,
that's the first thing to go on a frog.

95
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,580
His tongue. The tongue goes
and you can't catch flies.

96
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,832
That's rough.
I'm sorry about your tongue,

97
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,668
but I have to get out of this swamp.
I have to catch a plane.

98
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,004
With that tongue? No way.

99

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

100
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,341
But seriously,
there's a boat dock just downstream.

101
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,385
- Thank you.
- Just watch out for the alligators.

102
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,803
I will.

103
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,514
- Alligators?
- That's right.

104
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,308
Did you say alligators?

105
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,102
Read my lips, alligators.

106
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,855
It's just that I'm not used to alligators
where I come from.

107
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,151
See, I'm an agent.
I... I winged in from Hollywood.

- Hollywood?
- That's right.

Hollywood

Hey, don't you ever go to the movies?

Later, Max. Now follow that frog.

315
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,285
- FOZZIE: Oh, it's a gorgeous day.
- KERMIT: Yep, certainly is.

316
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,997
- Yep, terrific day for a drive.
- It's beautiful country out here.

317
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,541
A frog and a bear seeing America.

318
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,133
(SINGING) Movin' right along
in search of good times and good news

319
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,427
With good friends, you can't lose

320
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,888
This could become a habit

321
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,975
Opportunity knocks once
Let's reach out and grab it

322
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,478
- Yeah!
- Together we'll nab it

323
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,105
We'll hitchhike, bus, or Yellow Cab it

324
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,523
Cab it?

325
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,609
BOTH: Movin' right along

326
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,779
Footloose and fancy-free

327
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,783
Getting there is half the fun
Come share it with me

328
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,826
Movin' right along

329
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,579
KERMIT: We'll learn to share the load

330
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:34,167
FOZZIE: We don't need a map
to keep this show on the road

331
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,088
Hey, Fozzie, I want you to turn left
if you come to a fork in the road.

332
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,548
Yes, sir. Turn left at
the fork in the road.

333
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,217
FOZZIE: Kermit.

334
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,552
KERMIT: I don't believe that.

335
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,683
KERMIT: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We've found a life on the highway

336
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,102
FOZZIE: And your way is my way

337
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,479
KERMIT: So trust my navigation

338
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,900
FOZZIE: California, here we come
Come pie in the sky land

339
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,986
KERMIT: Palm trees and warm sand

340
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,530
Though sadly we just left Rhode Island

341
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,115
- We did what?
- Just forget it.

342
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,158
BOTH: Movin' right along

343
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,744
Hey, LA, where have you gone?

344
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,082
FOZZIE: Send someone to fetch us
We're in Saskatchewan

345
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,251
BOTH: Movin' right along

346
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,586
You take it, you know best

347
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:23,174
FOZZIE: Hey, I've never seen
the sun come up in the west

348
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,094
Ah.

349
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,305
A bear in his natural habitat.

350
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,640
A Studebaker.

351
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,853
- Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead.
- What is that?

352
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,688
Maybe we should give him a ride.

353
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,232
I don't know. He's pretty big.

354
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,570
- Hey, there. Want a lift?
- Oh, no, thanks.

355
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,533
I'm on my way to New York City
to try to break into public television.

356
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,410
Ah.

357
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,911
Good luck.

358
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,544
BOTH: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We're truly birds of a feather

359
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,755
We're in this together

360
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,257
And we know where we're goin'

361
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,386
Movie stars with flashy cars
and life with the top down

362
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,972
We're stormin' the big town

363
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,099
Yeah, storm is right.
Should it be snowing?

364
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,768
No, I don't think so.

365
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,853
BOTH: Movin' right along

366
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,731
Footloose and fancy-free

367
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,691
You're ready for the big time

368
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,194
Is it ready for me?

369
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:36,074
Movin' right along

370
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,509
KERMIT: Hey.

371
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,928
Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead there.

372
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,806
There's one of those
Doc Hopper billboards.

373
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,141
- Maybe you'd better pull over.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,436
Oh, look at that.

375
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
Kermit, that's you.

376
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,067
(LAUGHING)

377
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,611
You got the picture, boy?
You see what I mean?

378
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,949
Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-fried frog legs.

379
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:15,495
Isn't that splendid? Just splendid.
Just take a look at it.

380
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,957
All I can see are millions of frogs
on tiny crutches.

381
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,878
Now, listen, boy.
Don't you wanna be rich and famous?

382
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,047
- Not workin' for you, I don't.
- That's right.

383
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,008
- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max.

384
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,262
We're a small-time operation,
but we're expandin'.

385
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,223
Expandin', just like you frogs expand.

386
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,392
Don't you frogs expand?

387
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,103
- That's a myth.
- What?

388
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,479
Myth! Myth!

389
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,730
Yeth?

390
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,566
BOTH: Huh?

391
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,361
- Come on, Bear. Burn rubber.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,073
Hey, Frog!

393
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,035
That's the second time!

394
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,123
Max, I've done my best with that frog.
Now's the time to do my worst.

395
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,500
- Open the door.
- No! You open the door.

396
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,378
- What?
- I'm through, Doc. The frog is right.

397
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,173
You're asking him to do something
terrible. I can't be a part of it.

398
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,466
It's a moral decision and I'll stand by it.

399
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,136
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.

400
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,517
FOZZIE: Kermit, where are we?

401
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,144
Well, let's see.

402
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,355
We were just traveling down
this little black line here.

403
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,192
And we just crossed
that little red line over here.

404
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,111
Well, how about...
Let's take the blue line, huh?

405
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,781
- No, we can't take that. That's a river.
- Oh, I knew that.

406
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,451
- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, Kermit, why don't we just go...

407
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,120
- Fozzie. Fozzie.
- Huh. Yeah?

408
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,830
Who's driving?

409
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,166
(BOTH SCREAM)

410
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,462
- KERMIT: Look out! Stop!
- FOZZIE: No problem.

411
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,507
- Okay, back it up.
- Ah, yes, sir.

412
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,929
- Fozzie, where did you learn to drive?
- I took a correspondence course.

413
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,016
This looks like a nice quiet spot.

414
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Uh-huh.

415
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,898
Boy, it feels like
we've been driving for days.

416
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,317
Yeah. Funny, I'm still wide awake.

417
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,069
Yeah, me, too.

418
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,528
(SNORING)

419
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,782
Me, too.

420
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,161
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

421
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,251
- (BAND PLAYING)
- What? What? What? I'm up, I'm up.

422
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,627
What's that?

423
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,804
They don't look like Presbyterians
to me.

424
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,944
Hey, cool it, everybody.

425
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,822
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

426
00:26:55,906 --> 00:27:00,118
Our gentle mornin' melodies
have attracted wanderin' admirers.

427
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,788
- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be

428
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,542
they whom as are known as
the Electric Mayhem.

429

- (LAUGHING)
- For sure.

430
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,796
He's Dr. Teeth.

431
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,342
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.

432
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,469
- Thank you.
- Fozzie.

433
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,556
- I'm Floyd, I blow bass.
- And I'm...

434
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm...

435
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,560
Zoot. Sax is your ax.

436
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,563
Uh-oh. Zoot's skipped a groove again.

437
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,567
Wow, like, I'm Janice.
I'm lead guitar, for surely.

Oh, yeah. That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal.

440
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,451
I want to eat drums.

441
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,663
No, no. Beat drums, beat drums.

442
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,459
Beat drums. Beat drums.

443
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,380
- Down, Animal. Back. Sit.
- Down. Back. Sit.

MUPPET: Hey, don't forget about me.

445
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,636
I'm Scooter, the band's road manager.

446
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,182
Oh, yeah. The road manager.
We couldn't go anywhere without him.

447
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,602
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van.

448
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,357
Yeah, we're takin' this old church
and turnin' it into a coffeehouse.

449
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,861
Yeah, with real good music
and organic refreshments.

450
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,698
It'll be so fine and laid-back
and mellow and profitable.

451
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,700
ANIMAL: Profitable.

452
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,994
Yeah, but what brings you dudes here?

453
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,539
Listen, see, Kermit here,
he was living in the swamp...

454
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,041
- Fozzie.
...and then a fisherman came along.

455
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,043
Fozzie, you can't tell 'em
the whole story.

456
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,961
You'll bore the audience.

457
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,714
Oh, sorry.

458
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,550
But, Kermit,
the band here wants to know.

459
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,594
Well, let 'em read the screenplay.

460
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,097
Ah! Yes, sir.

461
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Uh...

00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,227
You see, it starts here on page one.

00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,414
"Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church.

469
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,541
"Interior. Church. Day.

470
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,669
"Fozzie. 'They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.'

471
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,465
"Kermit and Fozzie
come walkin' down the aisle

472
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:25,138
"to the thunderously loud music
of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."

473
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,683
- Which am us.
- For sure, for sure.

474
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,270
This is a narrative
of very heavy-duty proportions.

475
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,021
Yeah. Cosmic, man.

476
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:38,067
We gotta keep his little froggy self
away from this Hopper dude.

477
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,278
Too true, too true.

478
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,449
It is indeed a problem
for us to probosculate upon.

479
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,286
But it seems to me that the frog and
the bear are temporarily out of service.

480
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,370
(BOTH SNORING)

481
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,458
Oh, wow, like, what can we do
to help them?

482
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,461
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.

483
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,629
...we'd think of a clever plot device.

484
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,633
Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.

485
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,469
Right. Two, three, four.

486
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,222
Oh, yeah!

487
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,725
Whoo!

488
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,394
All right.

489
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,230
(SINGING)
Everybody's lover, everybody's brother

490
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,649
I wanna be your lifetime friend

491
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,902
Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket

492
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,237
I'll keep it at the rainbow's end

493
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,656
I never think of money
I think of milk and honey

494
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,533
Grinnin' like a Cheshire cat

495
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,369
I focus on the pleasure
Somethin' I can treasure

496
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,915
Can you picture that?

497
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,503
Oh, yeah.

498
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,257
Hey, Floyd. Take a verse.

499
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,844
(SINGING) Let me take your picture
Add it to the mixture

500
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,888
There it is, I got you now

501
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,349
Really nothin' to it, anyone can do it

502
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,684
It's easy and we all know how

503
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,020
Now begins the changin'
Mental rearrangin'

504
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,356
Nothin's really where it's at

505
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,691
Now the Eiffel Tower's
holdin' up a flower

506
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,777
I gave it to a Texas cat

507
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:09,283
Fact is there's nothin' out there
you can't do

508
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,871
Yeah, even Santa Claus
believes in you

509
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,667
Beat down the walls
Begin, believe, begat

510
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,629
Be a better drummer
Be an up-and-comer

511
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,758
Can you picture that?

512
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,680
Only what you got

513
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,062
All of us are winnin'
Pickin' and a-grinnin'

514
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,897
Lordy, but I love to jam

515
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,775
Jelly-belly gigglin'
Dancin' and a-wigglin'

516
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,569
Honey, that's the way I am

517
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,321
I lost my heart in Texas
Northern lights affects us

518
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,407
I keep it underneath my hat

519
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,993
Aurora Borealis
Shinin' down on Dallas

520
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:56,664
Can you picture that?

521
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,749
Can you picture?

522
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,502
You gotta see it in your mind

523
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,337
Can you picture?

524
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,798
You know it's quick and easy to find

525
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,883
Can you picture?

526
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,761
You don't have to buy a frame

527
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,972
Can you picture?

528
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,685
Can you picture that?

529
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,187
- Use it if you need it
- Don't forget to feed it

530
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,939
Can you picture that?

531
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,404
FLOYD: Great job.

532
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,492
Doc Hopper will never
recognize you now.

533
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,204
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I don't know why to thank you guys.

534
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,914
Our pleasure, green stuff.

535
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,125
Are you sure you won't
come with us to Hollywood?

536
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,128
Can't, baby,
but when you get rich and famous,

537
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,380
maybe we'll show up
and exploit your wealth.

538
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,840
(ALL LAUGHING)

539
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,218
Movin' right along, Fozzie.

540
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,014
ANIMAL: Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

541
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,644
(CHANTING) Hollywood! Hollywood!

542
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,312
Hollywood!

543
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,899
Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood!

544
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,829
HOPPER: Remember,
this frog does everything.

545
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,528
He talks, he sings, he dances.

546
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,615
He tells jokes. He even rides a bicycle.

547
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,576
Max, find me a frog and a bear
in a tan Studebaker.

548
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,244
Gee, Doc. All I can see

549
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,873
is a frog and a bear
in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.

550
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,668
What?

551
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,837
- Fozzie, they're right behind us.
- I know, I know.

552
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,799
- Well, how did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.

553
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,717
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.

554
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,761
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc.
I'm gaining on 'em.

555
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,138
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.

556
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,303
There's a sign up ahead there.
Pull in front of that.

557
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,060
- Move. Now duck.
- What?

558
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,728
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,982
Aha!

560
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,154

GONZO: Uh-huh. Yeah.

563
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:07,169
Oh, I tell you, Camilla,
great plumbers are born, not made.

564
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,047
I'm a prince of plunger, fair maiden.

(CLUCKS)

566

that. But first, wait till we get there.

567
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,973
Fozzie, look at that funny little truck.

568
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,599
Yeah, it's cute, huh?

569
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,893
- No, it's coming straight at us.

KERMIT: We're gonna hit.

572
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,608
We missed it.

573
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,986
Oh, you call that a miss?

574
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,158
GONZO: Well, I'm getting in your car.

575
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,827
FOZZIE: Oh, boy.

576
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,455
You guys okay?

577
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,623
Why are you hopping up and down?

578
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,751
Because I'm hopping mad.

579
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,294
Guy's got a sense of humor.

580
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,047
- Hey, why don't you join us?
- Where are you going?

581
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,469
- We're following our dream.
- Really? I have a dream, too.

582
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,096
- KERMIT AND FOZZIE: Huh?
- But you'll think it's stupid.

583
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,973
- KERMIT: No, I won't.
- FOZZIE: Tell us, tell us.

584
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,810
Well, I wanna go to Bombay, India
and become a movie star.

585
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,895
CAMILLA: Ah.

586
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,481
You don't go to Bombay
to become a movie star.

587
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,691
You go where we're going, Hollywood.

588
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,778
Sure, if you wanna do it the easy way.

589
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,741
We picked up a weirdo.

590
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,994
KERMIT: Hey, look up ahead.
There's Mad Man Mooney's.

591
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,413
- FOZZIE: What's that?
- KERMIT: It's a used-car lot.

592
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,416
I think we can trade in both these
old cars and get one big one.

593
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,084
FOZZIE: Wait.
Trade in my uncle's Studebaker?

594
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,127
KERMIT: Sure.

595
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,962

he'll kill me.

very wide, Fozzie.

FOZZIE: Well, hold it, will you?
Just... Here we go. Up the bump.

598
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,553
KERMIT: There we go. Hold on. All right.

599
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,679
Pull up ahead there.

600
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,598
- FOZZIE: Look at these cars.
- GONZO: Kermit, Kermit, Kermit.

601
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,975
- Are you gonna sell my plunger, too?
- There's all kinds of great cars.

602
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,477
FOZZIE: No, he's not
gonna sell your plunger.

603
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,021
KERMIT: Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little further here, Fozzie.

604
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,815
FOZZIE: Where should I stop?

605
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,274
- How should I stop?
- KERMIT: A little bit farther.

606
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,651
- GONZO: Easy, easy.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Here?

- KERMIT: Everybody out of the car.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Chickens first.

609
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:02,993
Oh, my dear friends. Welcome
to Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven.

610
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,579
Today... Today is your lucky day.

611
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,915
- It is?
- Yes, it is. You, for example...

612
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,459
- You're driving the wrong car.
- I am?

613
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:14,755
I can put you in this German
street machine for only $2,000,

614
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,050
less a $12 trade-in on your old vehicle.

615
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,553
Now, this...
This car is one of the greatest...

616
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,767
Detachable fenders for narrow garages.

617
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,018
No, thanks.

618
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,272
Hey, what is this pile of...
Jack, get rid of this heap.

619
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,982
Come out here!

620
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,902
- What? What?

you were so courageous.

So magnificent.

946
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,863
- Are you Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

947
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,322
Phone.

948
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:12,827
Huh.

949
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:18,124
It's not often you see a guy that green
have the blues that bad.

950
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,796
- Hello.
- Kermie, please...

951
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,093
- Piggy, is that you?
- HOPPER: Yes, that's her.

952
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:33,389
And this is Doc Hopper.
You listen, Frog. And listen good.

953
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,350
Step outside the motel right now.

954
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,311
My guys will meet you there.

955
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,981
Well... What if I don't?

956

will be ham-hocked by breakfast.

- Show him in. Show him in.

964
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:25,108
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.

965
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,611
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

966

- Ah, Professor Krassman.

It's good to see you, Doc,
you little rustic devil, you.

I mean, patient?

972
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,716
Step this way, Professor.
Let me introduce you to your patient.

973
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,302
Professor Krassman is the world's

974

on mind control in frogs.

975

to our little Kermit.

977
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:08,651
Well, we're going to perform
an electronic cerebrectomy.

978

- A what?

- (GASPS)
- Electronic cerebrectomy.

980

What's that?

981
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:20,204
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

Yes?

983

"Hold on to your hat,"

984
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,959
it's not casual conversation.

985

Hold on to your hat! Hat! Hold! Good.

986

Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

Bertram! Bertram, you...
Bring out the machine!

988
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,179
Wait till you see this.
You think we're sleeping in Düsseldorf?

989

You think
we're taking a nap in Cologne?

No, we're working at night.

- What does it do?
- What does it do? What does it do?

994
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,989
It turns the brains into guacamole.

Thank you, Herr Machine.

Now, the frog will do your bidding.

He will do your every whim,
your every wish.

do your television commercial, yes.

you've got a fun job.

I love it, I love it.

1018

If I can inflict a little pain during
the afternoon, I sleep good at night.

1019
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,015
- Well, we'll let you get on with it, then.

I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

FLOYD: Yeah, all right.

1410
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,729
- Okay, way to go, guys.
- FOZZIE: All right.

1411
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,689
Thanks, miss.

1412
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,944
Well, friends,

1413
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,571
this is it.

1414
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:37,715
Uh, Mr. Lord,

1415
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,926
forgive the interruption,
but I'm here to audition.

1416
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,803
MISS PIGGY: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1417
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,096
KERMIT: We've come
over 2,000 miles...

1418
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,850
Uh, oh, boy.

1419
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:53,064
Kermie, we're all with you.

1420
01:25:57,194 --> 01:26:01,364
Please, sir. My name is Kermit the Frog,
and we read your ad and...

1421
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,158
Well, we've come
to be rich and famous.

1422
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,675
Miss Tracey.

1423
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,346
Prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

1424
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,765
for Kermit the Frog and company.

1425
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,730
Yes. We did it. We did it.

1426
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,816
I can't believe it.

1427
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:47,952
Oh, just look at all this.

1428
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,998
How did a frog make the big time?

1429
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,552
(SINGING) It starts when we're kids

1430
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,222
A show-off at school

1431
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,683
Makin' faces at friends

1432
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,227
You're a clown and a fool

1433
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:18,357
Doin' pratfalls and bird calls
and bad imitations

1434
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:21,527
Ignoring your homework
Now that's dedication

1435
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:24,113
You work to the mirror

1436
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,241
You're getting standing ovations

1437
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:31,329
You're burning with hope

1438
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:34,373
You're building up steam

1439
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,250
What was once juvenile-ish

1440
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,877
Is grown-up and stylish

1441
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,630
You're close to your dream

1442
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:44,342
And somebody out there loves you

1443
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:46,677
Stands up and hollers for more

1444
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:47,762
More!

1445
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:53,017
You've found a home
at the magic store

1446
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,645
Right, everybody.
Production number, okay?

1447
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:59,190
- Off the trucks and on the job.
- On the job!

1448
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,525
Hey, whoa, halt, cease, stop.

1449
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,736
Wow, let's do it.

1450
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,488
- Do what?
- The movie.

1451
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,865
FOZZIE: Yes, sir. A foot stomper.

1452
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,743
- Makeup.
- Yes, let's do it. Yes.

1453
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:14,038
Hey, Fozzie,
take those wagons out of there.

1454
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,207
Yes, sir. I'm off.

1455
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,292
(ROARS)

1456
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,045
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1457
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,590
Scenery over there, right?

1458
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:26,759
Movin' right along. Hey!

1459
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,930
Hey, those are the trees for the swamp.

1460
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,474
Mellow and profitable.

1461
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:35,810
Wacka, wacka.

1462
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,438
- Let's make a scene.
- Okay, hon.

1463
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:42,400
- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.

1464
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,903
Ow.

1465
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,239
- Watch it!
- (MEEPS)

1466
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:51,826
- Miss Piggy, you look beautiful.
- MISS PIGGY: Thank you.

1467
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,077
Hollywood talk.

1468
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,745
Wa ha ha ha.

1469
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,330
Wa ha ha ha ha.

1470
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:57,665
- Good.
- Wa ha!

1471
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,001
The lights. Yeah.

1472
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,586
Good. Save those arcs.

1473
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,796
Ha, ha.

1474
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,757
Crazy Harry plays with electricity!

1475
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,680
Sound is ready. Give me a level.

1476
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:15,891
(YELLS) Testing!

1477
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,855
(LAUGHS)

1478
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,399
Rolling.

1479
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:27,028
Okay, everybody. Stay in focus, huh?

1480
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:31,323
Okay, Muppet Movie,
scene 1A, take one.

1481
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:36,037
- BEAKER: Makeup ready.
- FLOYD: Scenery ready.

1482
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,241
- BUNSEN: Sound is rolling.
- ROWLF: Camera's rollin'.

1483
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,915
MISS PIGGY: All ready, Kermie.

1484
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,585
Okay, standby. Here we go.

1485
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:59,894
(SINGING) Why are there so many
songs about rainbows?

1486
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:04,690
That's part of what rainbows do

1487
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,153
Rainbows are memories

1488
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:12,406
Sweet dream reminders

1489
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:17,495
What is it you'd like to do?

1490
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:24,835
All of us watching
and wishing we'd find it

1491
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,881
I've noticed you're watching, too

1492
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,095
Someday you'll find it

1493
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,515
The rainbow connection

1494
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:41,227
The lovers, the dreamers and...

1495
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,187
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1496
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,680
Kermit.

1497
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,190
(MISS PIGGY GASPS)

1498
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:35,489
(SINGING) Life's like a movie
Write your own ending

1499
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:39,285
Keep believing, keep pretending

1500
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:44,123
We've done
just what we've set out to do

1501
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:48,085
Thanks to the lovers

1502
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:51,338
The dreamers

1503
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:51,923
And you

1504
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,190
(LAUGHS)

1505
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,985
I just knew I'd catch up with you guys.

1506
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,987
(ALL LAUGHING)

1507
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,911
- What did you think?
- It was sick and weird.

1508
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:29,168
Kermit, it went swell. It went great, boss.

1509
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:32,630
Congratulations, Mr. The Frog.

1510
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:36,091
You can be in the next one, Lew.

1511
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,392
Great show.

1512
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,789
Oh, wow.

1513
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:12,753
Woman!

1514
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,567
- Did you like my close-up?
- Oh, yes.

1515
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:38,445
Did you like my song?
How about my karate?

1516
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,203
Kermit. Oh, Kermie.

1517
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:10,352
Was I funny? Was I funny, anybody?

1518
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:28,287
Fozzie, you were very, very funny.

1519
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:30,914
Just great.

1520
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:55,939
Go home! Go home!
