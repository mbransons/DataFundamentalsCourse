1
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,280
And on that point,
members of the jury,

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,391
I rest my case.

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,036
Hello, Wanda.

4
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,833
Hi, Ken.

5
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,109
Hello, W-W-Wanda.

6
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,433
Ken,

7
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,315
this is Otto.

8
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,954
Hello, Ken.
Wanda's told me a lot about you.

9
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,195
Hey! Great fish!

10
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,437
A squeeze of lemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

11
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,032
George back yet?

12
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,071
No, he had to g-g-go

13
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,430
to the b-b-b...

14
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,115
What?

15
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,676
That's quite a stutter
you've got there, Ken.

16
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,394
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.

17
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,114
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,035
A cup of tea, Ken?

19
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,957
Y-y-y...

20
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,638
Yeah, he'd like one.

21
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,320
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

22
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,953
Cost him his life, dammit.

23
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,832
Hi, George.

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,877
Hello, George.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,069
Get you a Scotch?

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,758
Yeah.

27
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,835
George,

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,433
this is Otto.

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,993
So,

30
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,792
you're Wanda's brother?

31
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,319
Good to be here, George.

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,158
England is a fine country.

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,032
Did she tell you what we need?

34
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,632
Something like that?

35
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,036
Something like that.

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,033
Hello, Wendy.

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,674
Had a good day?

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,671
I spend the morning
<i>trying</i> to get a waste disposal man.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,110
At lunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,073
then I have to play
<i>three</i> rubbers with Philippa.

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,998
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,633
Oh, no!

43
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,478
Would you like some tea?

44
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,674
Yes.

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,359
I won the case.

46
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,790
This is the first moment
I've had to myself all day.

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,037
Hello, Portia! How was the show?

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,355
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,438
- But you liked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

50
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,630
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,228
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,794
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,150
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'll do it!

54
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,633
I won the case.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,796
Now this is cracked.

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,192
They're worth about 100,000 each.

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,432
There are 135 of them.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,028
That makes 13 millions, my friends.

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,275
Dollars or pounds?

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,355
Pounds, pet.

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,232
This is the big one. So...

62
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,357
OK.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,550
Yeah.

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,557
Otto?

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,908
Yes?

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,268
OK?

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,355
What?

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,595
The plan.

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,718
Yeah. Great. No problem.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,159
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

71
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,273
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,912
Yeah, yeah!

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,871
I haven't finished yet.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,675
Because the police will watch
all the airports for 72 hours.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,676
I know.

76
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,755
I know.

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,428
Do you want me to g-g-get

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,835
a b-b-big

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,918
c-c-car?

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,359
Getaway?

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,833
A limo, OK?

82
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,916
And put diplomatic plates on it.

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,349
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,914
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

85
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,632
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,036
So, next week,

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,116
we won't have to look for work.

88
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,231
And it won't have to look for us.

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,236
Oscar Wilde.

90
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,068
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,872
What's the attraction?

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,592
Because you can t-t-t

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,030
trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

94
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,229
Shit on you?

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,669
Show off all the time.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,109
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,629
He said they were God's second blunder.

98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,909
Bye, sis!

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,790
Well, you tell him from me that I-I-I...

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,828
Bye, George.

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,035
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,116
- OK.
- Don't let him touch you.

103
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,276
One more day, and we're together.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,356
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,993
I know he's insensitive.

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,518
He's had a hard life.

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,993
Dad used to beat him up.

108
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,593
Good.

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,675
Aaagh!

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,036
Anybody moves and you're dead.

111
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,957
Look where you're going!

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,638
Chauvinist pig!

113
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,070
Really, people here
just think they own the pavement.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,229
That was fun.

115
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,998
I love robbing the English.

116
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,156
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

117
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,838
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

118
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,188
We didn't hit the dog.

119
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,949
- $20 million and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

120
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,231
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

121
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,315
Shut up!

122
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,434
Ken.

123
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,035
Bye!

124
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,595
Let's split.

125
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,156
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie low. No celebrating.

126
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,713
No celebrating?

127
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,072
See you in a couple of hours.

128
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,709
To $20 million.

129
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,909
To a job well done.

130
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,995
To us.

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,839
To the best brother
and sister team since...

132
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,029
Romeo and Juliet?

133
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,836
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

134
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,915
What morons!

135
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,270
- I want you to know something.
- What?

136
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,710
Even if you were my brother,
I'd still want to fuck you.

137
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,795
Oooh!

138
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,959
Make the call.

139
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,638
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

140
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,273
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

141
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,355
Hey!

142
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,677
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

143
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,268
- E linguine primavera...
- No. No.

144
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,437
- Una cotoletta di vitello.
- Make the call, Otto.

145
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,993
Are you really Italian?

146
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,599
Absolutamente. Si!

147
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,517
My name is Otto. It means eight.

148
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,232
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

149
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,270
Bye, George.

150
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,311
The police, please.

151
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,032
Otto!

152
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,957
Yes, hello.

153
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,038
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may like to know

154
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,188
that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.

155
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,835
He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions,

156
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,270
Murray Road, London W9.

157
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,189
Wanda!

158
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,755
Police! Open up!

159
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,278
Come on, open up!

160
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,988
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

161
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,592
George Francis Thomason?

162
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,633
Passport,

163
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,909
tickets,

164
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,995
money!

165
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,598
Asshole!

166
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,832
We're rich, Wanda.

167
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,029
Yep?

168
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,798
I bet these weeks with me

169
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,798
have been
the most exciting weeks of your life.

170
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,069
You said it.

171
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,435
OK.

172
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,832
OK.

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,439
Disappointed!

174
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,233
Sonofabitch!

175
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,640
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

176
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,034
Shut up.

177
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,720
People are always
taking advantage of me!

178
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,035
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

179
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,869
What are you doing?

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,956
I'm thinking!

181
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,832
Thinking what I'll do to him.

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,996
I'll hang him up with piano wire...

183
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,078
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

184
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,029
Talk to who?

185
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,595
Talk to who?!

186
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,553
So, while installing these windows,

187
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,309
you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

188
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,589
That's right, sir.

189
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,597
Your parents can confirm this?

190
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,994
Yes, and his aunt,

191
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,633
Georgina Thomason.

192
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,749
Good, Bartlett.

193
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,233
Yes?

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,752
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

195
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,950
Thomason. A young lady to see you.

196
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,311
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

197
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,759
No, absolutely not.

198
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,835
George!

199
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,520
Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.

200
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,789
- Thanks.
- De nada.

201
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,592
What do you think, Mr Leach?

202
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,713
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else will they come up with?

203
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,792
Oh, George!

204
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,639
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

205
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,671
That's not allowed in here, miss.

206
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,949
Are you OK?

207
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,229
It's all right.

208
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,237
I don't think I can handle this.

209
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,715
I was too afraid to sleep last night...

210
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,637
Leave it out, leave it out, OK?

211
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,398
Listen, listen, listen.

212
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,999
Listen.

213
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,036
You stayed at my place.

214
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,991
We slept late.

215
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,076
You made me breakfast.

216
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,032
What?

217
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,037
What's he doing here?

218
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,037
He wanted to see you.

219
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,796
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

220
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,876
Do you want me to rub him out?

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,956
Anything, you name it.

222
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,355
I have friends making enquiries.

223
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,038
Good.

224
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,754
The jewels are very safe.

225
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,589
If I get sent down, it all gets handed back
to cut my sentence.

226
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,995
Now, to cut my sentence even more,

227
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,475
I could tell them who done it with me

228
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,239
if I wasn't very happy about everything.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,797
What was the middle thing?

230
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,876
Piss off.

231
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,835
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

232
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,233
George?

233
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,038
You don't think...

234
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,718
Do you?

235
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,795
No!

236
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,995
No.

237
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,154
No!

238
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,077
OK.

239
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,189
- George.
- What?

240
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,674
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

241
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,438
Trust me.

242
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,312
Thank you very much.

243
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,953
Thanks a lot. Bye.

244
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,229
Have a good day.

245
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,275
So?

246
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,799
He's not sure it was you.

247
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,875
What about you?

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,353
No, no, he believes me.

249
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,835
That's why he can't figure out about you.

250
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,949
Figure out what?

251
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,548
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

252
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,436
Don't er

253
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,233
ever, ever, <i>ever</i>

254
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,952
call me stupid. OK?

255
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,355
What?

256
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,598
That's George's lawyer.

257
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,675
The other guy must be the barrister.

258
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,395
So?

259
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,635
Trust me.

260
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,509
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

261
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,834
Excuse me.

262
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,598
Don't I recognise you?

263
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,716
No. No, I don't think so.

264
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,432
Oh.

265
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,949
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

266
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,833
Erm...

267
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,916
Well, hardly.

268
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,315
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

269
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,599
Yes, yes, certainly.

270
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,675
Thanks.

271
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,519
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

272
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,595
I'm American.

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,675
Oh, really?

274
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,439
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

275
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,516
What er... What brings you here?

276
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,596
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.

277
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,676
I... have a friend.

278
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,028
Oh!

279
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,115
I see.

280
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,275
There you are.

281
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,355
I knew it!

282
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,993
You're Archie <i>Leash.</i>

283
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,075
Leach.

284
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,235
Right.

285
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,759
I saw you in court!

286
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,836
Er... two weeks ago.

287
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,234
The casino break-in?

288
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,918
You were great!

289
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,996
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

290
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,872
I love the way you er

291
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,433
cross-examine.

292
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,829
Oh, I really admire your work.

293
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,915
Thank you.

294
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,150
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

295
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,236
No? Fine, right.

296
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,315
Well...

297
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,953
Thank you for this.

298
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,354
I'll treasure it.

299
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,756
Au revoir.

300
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,432
You speak French, too!

301
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,472
What's going on?

302
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,990
Whatever George decides to do,
he'll tell Leach first.

303
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,473
Why?

304
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,113
Because he's his lawyer.

305
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,309
Yeah, I know that.

306
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,556
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,678
So George will tell <i>him</i>
where the diamonds are?

308
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,995
That's what I'm going to find out.

309
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,914
You done well, my son.

310
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,115
Now, where are we going to hide it?

311
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,959
Very good!

312
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,752
Don't tell Wanda anything.

313
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,030
Otto might get something out of her.

314
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,115
Now...

315
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,832
George.

316
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,712
You are going to g-get off?

317
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,796
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,875
We'll fix it.

319
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,479
Now, anything on Otto?

320
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,397
No. Not yet.

321
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,232
You watch him.

322
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,072
Ken!

323
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,029
OK.

324
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,233
Looks like the police have been all over it.

325
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,238
Let me change clothes,
then I'll help you look.

326
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,832
Hello,

327
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,996
K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

328
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,636
Hey!

329
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,432
Wake up!

330
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,834
Wake up, limey fish!

331
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,390
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this lawyer?

332
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,511
I don't know. I'll improvise.

333
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,433
Fucking insects!

334
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,235
I thought Englishmen didn't like women,
the way they talk.

335
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,429
No!

336
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,076
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

337
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,952
Have you got the hots for him?

338
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,674
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

339
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,669
What is this? Hump-a-limey week?

340
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,358
Otto doesn't approve.

341
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,038
Otto might get jealous.

342
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,597
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

343
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,237
Molto pericoloso...

344
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,349
Carissima.

345
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,038
Oh, speak it, speak it!

346
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,598
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

347
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,270
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

348
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,833
Dov'ę la farmacia?

349
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,632
Yes, yes, yes!

350
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,715
No, no, no.

351
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,273
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

352
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,549
No, not here.

353
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,715
Otto, not here.

354
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,193
Dov'ę la Fontana di Trevi?

355
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,355
Not here, Otto!

356
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,754
Erm...

357
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,835
Mozzarella...

358
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,075
Er... Parmigiana...

359
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,033
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

360
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,115
Wanda!

361
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,036
Look what I've got, Wanda.

362
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,433
Treasure!

363
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,833
Ssh!

364
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,236
Aaagh!

365
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,873
Ooh!

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,513
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

367
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,596
I thought it was the police again.

368
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,676
Isn't it horrible about George?

369
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,031
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

370
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,388
Shit.

371
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,478
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

372
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,239
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

373
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,749
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

374
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,356
Isn't it terrible about George?

375
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,438
When I find the bastard who squealed!

376
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,913
I love that man!

377
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,632
What are you d-d-doing here?

378
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,794
What am I doing here?

379
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,992
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

380
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,235
Sh...

381
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,194
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

382
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,598
I've got to speak to you.

383
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,994
Are you OK, now, sis?

384
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,237
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- Call me if you need me.

385
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,478
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

386
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,636
Something f-f-funny is going on.

387
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,113
Oh dear, oh dear.

388
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,310
You don't know why you're excited.

389
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,953
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

390
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,516
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

391
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,471
Isn't it time you faced facts?

392
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,033
Come on!

393
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,877
You're a very attractive man.

394
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,315
You're smart.

395
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,396
You've got wonderful bones,

396
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,114
great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

397
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,911
Wh-wh-wh...

398
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,076
We could have a lot of fun together.

399
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,873
I think we'd be really good for each other.

400
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,955
What do you say?

401
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,438
You must be j-j-j...

402
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,675
May I kiss you, Ken?

403
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,153
No, you fucking can't!

404
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,793
Just a peck! No tongue!

405
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,875
No, no!

406
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,514
Ken! Ken!

407
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,954
Ken!

408
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,275
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

409
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,356
OK, no, look.

410
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,435
I'm sorry.

411
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,357
I've handled this badly.

412
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,516
Look, the physical side can wait.

413
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,038
You need time.

414
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,273
Will you think about it?

415
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,713
Oh, my God.

416
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,836
Oh, my God!

417
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,552
Ken!

418
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,318
Somebody just called!

419
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,192
They said that the police...

420
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,709
No, that the loot
is in a garage in Fulham.

421
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,637
You and I have to go get it now.

422
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,990
We have to move it
before the police find it.

423
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,075
No, no, no...

424
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,031
- What?
- It's all right!

425
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,116
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge

426
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,753
George

427
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,029
M-m-m

428
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,037
moved...

429
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,037
George moved the loot?!

430
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,593
Yes.

431
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,273
Where did he move it, Ken?

432
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,038
Where did he move it?!

433
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,676
C-c-c...

434
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,031
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

435
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,115
It's in...

436
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,355
Don't tell me.

437
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,550
It's better that you don't tell me.

438
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,395
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

439
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,319
Otto

440
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,632
tried to k-k-k

441
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,034
kiss me.

442
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,438
I thought he might.

443
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,633
No.

444
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,716
Nothing, no marks at all.

445
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,796
But it is a safety deposit box key?

446
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,275
Yes, but there are millions of them,

447
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,152
hotels, banks, offices.

448
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,429
Sorry.

449
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,834
Thank you.

450
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,152
Fuck!

451
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,993
That's him.

452
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,076
That's him, Inspector.

453
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,714
He's the one
who tried to murder my dogs.

454
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,957
Davidson!

455
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,390
An American legal student
wants to see me for a moment.

456
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,909
- What time is Sir John due?
- 12.30, sir.

457
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,995
Right.

458
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,833
Come in!

459
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,757
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

460
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,711
Am I interrupting?

461
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,273
Absolutely not.

462
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,355
Really?

463
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,277
Really. Delighted to see you.

464
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,355
Hello.

465
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,435
So.

466
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,433
This is the place.

467
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,629
- This is it.
- Very nice.

468
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,991
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

469
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,758
Really, so much to know,

470
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,836
Everybody wears these. Do you?

471
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,877
Oh, ridiculous!

472
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,035
Well, erm

473
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,230
I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

474
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,315
I'm sorry.

475
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,000
But until then,
I'm all yours, as they say.

476
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,156
I just have a couple of questions.

477
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,956
I'm having a little problem

478
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,231
understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

479
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,514
What exactly is the committal?

480
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,709
Ah. Interesting.

481
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,912
Basically,
it's a preliminary investigation

482
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,679
where the prosecution
presents evidence

483
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,030
that the accused has a case to answer.

484
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,037
That's what it says in the book.

485
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,118
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

486
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,389
Right.

487
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,438
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

488
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,755
Yes.

489
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,949
George Thomason?

490
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,598
Yes. Do you know him?

491
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,833
I'm defending him.

492
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,678
What are you talking about?

493
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,791
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

494
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,639
That's so great!

495
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,150
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

496
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,511
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

497
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,595
Thank you.

498
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,517
He's sure to get off now.

499
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,833
Wow!

500
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,038
I can watch you work now!

501
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,752
Please.

502
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,949
Amazing.

503
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,274
Well, anyway.

504
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,153
At the committal,
George would then plead...

505
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,952
Not guilty.

506
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,069
Really?

507
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,078
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

508
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,555
But wasn't there an identification?

509
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,511
True, but a very elderly lady.

510
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,710
I think they've got the wrong man.

511
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,232
You don't think he did it?

512
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,315
No.

513
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,829
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

514
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,712
that you did think he did it.

515
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,877
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to light.

516
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,955
Right, right.

517
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,277
You would then advise him
to plead guilty,

518
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,075
and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

519
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,668
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

520
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,318
Theoretically, yes, yes.

521
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,395
Oh, of course.

522
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,589
Erm. Well er...

523
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,311
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

524
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,995
Wanda.

525
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,997
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

526
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,076
Well, Wanda, there are three...

527
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,434
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

528
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,437
Yes.

529
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,357
Oh, my God.

530
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,469
What?

531
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,749
You're his alibi.

532
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,871
I can't talk to you!

533
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,955
Why not?

534
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,435
My dear lady, you're a defence witness!

535
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,596
I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.

536
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,278
What did I say?

537
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,960
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

538
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,991
Everybody does it in America.

539
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,758
Not in England, it's forbidden.

540
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,275
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

541
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,356
I'm sorry. Please.

542
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,472
Oh, Archie.

543
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,439
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

544
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,232
Come on, you know!

545
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,915
You knew the minute I walked in here.

546
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,518
I want you.

547
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,308
What?

548
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,152
- Hello?
<i>- Sir John is here.</i>

549
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,429
Show him in, please.

550
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,232
Make love with me.

551
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,952
<i>- Pardon?</i>
- Nothing.

552
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,640
- Will you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

553
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,799
Bye, Uncle.

554
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,831
Hi!

555
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,196
He's pleading not guilty

556
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,436
so you're safe until the trial.

557
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,991
Leach doesn't think he did it.

558
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,640
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key,

559
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,115
but only George knows where it is.

560
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,034
Thank you, Wanda!

561
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,356
What have <i>you</i> found out?

562
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,674
Not a lot.

563
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,950
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

564
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,229
I know that!

565
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,759
So nothing, huh?

566
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,835
Nix.

567
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,034
Zip.

568
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,639
Diddly.

569
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,193
Bupkiss.

570
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,594
Niente.

571
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,229
Oh, it's too big!

572
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,669
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

573
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,950
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

574
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,638
No! Absolutely not!

575
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,228
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

576
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,509
Do shut up, Portia!

577
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,872
All I get, all day,
is people complaining to me.

578
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,877
Oh dear.

579
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,316
Ecco I'uomo.

580
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,633
Ooh, le due cupole grandi
della cattedrale di Milano.

581
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,911
Benito Mussolini!

582
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,311
Dov'ę il Vaticano?

583
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,591
<i>Volare</i>

584
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,358
<i>Oh-oh</i>

585
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,675
<i>E cantare</i>

586
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,755
<i>Oh-oh...</i>

587
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,030
Archie, I want <i>you</i> to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

588
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,348
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd listen to me.

589
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,232
I want you to speak to Portia.

590
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,555
I'll speak to her in the morning.

591
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,033
Goodnight, Archie.

592
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,752
Goodnight, Archie!

593
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,998
Goodnight, Wanda.

594
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,833
Goodnight, who?

595
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,629
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow

596
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,716
with some lousy old hag.

597
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,832
Are you George Francis Thomason

598
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,520
of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue,

599
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,834
London W9?

600
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,474
Yes, sir.

601
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,478
The charge is one of armed robbery.

602
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,716
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

603
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,230
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

604
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,634
That is correct, 6.2.

605
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,150
Here are the statements,
all to be fully bound, please.

606
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,071
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

607
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,475
You are committed to stand trial

608
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,160
at the Central Criminal Court.

609
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,635
There is some urgency about this case.

610
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,512
The main witness, Mrs Coady,

611
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,838
is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

612
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,758
Is there any possibility
that this case

613
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,155
might be put down for an early trial?

614
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,748
That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.

615
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,952
Take him down to the cell, please, officer.

616
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,272
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

617
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,391
You look great. I love your hair.

618
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,839
Got time for a coffee?

619
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,269
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

620
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,833
Why did he give you this?

621
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,996
<i>Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.</i>

622
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,634
Does he want you to send her flowers?

623
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,749
Do her shopping?

624
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,074
Show her a good time?

625
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,031
Rub her out?

626
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,036
He wants you to rub her out?

627
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,273
He's going to kill her!

628
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,357
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

629
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,949
Limey fruits!

630
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,758
So the old lady will
m-meet with an accident?

631
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,950
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

632
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,673
What's so funny?

633
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,031
Nothing.
Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

634
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,197
Well, it's better than b-buggering people.

635
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,911
I bet you Ł1 you don't kill her.

636
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,355
All right.

637
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,755
All right.

638
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,949
I love watching your ass when you walk.

639
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,672
Is that beautiful or what?

640
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,439
Don't go near him!

641
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,073
He's mine!

642
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,030
Ł1 says you won't kill her!

643
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,759
When could you look at it?

644
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,316
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

645
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,238
I'll look at it then
and call you on Saturday.

646
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,669
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

647
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,755
Hi.

648
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,156
I know we're not allowed to talk.

649
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,508
Give me a call.

650
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,789
I can't.

651
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,035
Please?

652
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,151
We're not allowed to speak.

653
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,838
We don't have to.

654
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,589
I don't want you for your conversation.

655
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,511
I'd love to...

656
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,955
- What happened?
- Got a date, Friday.

657
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,439
Look here!

658
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,199
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

659
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,276
My dogs will be having their nap.

660
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,277
Nice doggy.

661
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,515
Nice... doggy.

662
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,593
Otto, what are you doing?

663
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,154
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

664
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,157
It focuses your aggression.

665
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,919
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

666
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,996
What kind of Buddhism is this?

667
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,153
Asshole!

668
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,355
It's an early Tantric meditation...

669
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,799
What is this?

670
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,708
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

671
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,434
Well, we're ready now, at last.

672
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,516
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

673
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,359
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- Marvellous.

674
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,435
Be good.

675
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,710
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

676
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,637
Cordial? Courteous?

677
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,988
Supportive? What?

678
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,634
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

679
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,152
So, friendly might include actual er

680
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,599
what, penetration?

681
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,597
I don't need your jealousy now.

682
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,914
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

683
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,032
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

684
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,637
What about my tits?

685
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,193
Does he get to handle them?

686
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,039
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'll stand by that.

687
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,275
Nuzzling?

688
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,595
I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.

689
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,869
80 chance there.

690
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,560
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

691
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,070
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

692
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,349
One thing, though.

693
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,755
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

694
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,160
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

695
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,679
Aren't we going, then?

696
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,313
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

697
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,833
Hurry up.

698
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,716
Hi.

699
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,637
Do you despise me?

700
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,548
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

701
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,436
Can I stay, then?

702
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,513
Of course. Look...

703
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,113
- Wanda...
- I know.

704
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,753
Your wife's coming back.

705
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,030
No, it's not her. She'll be hours.

706
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,957
It's about what I said to you.

707
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,911
It <i>is</i> all right for us to speak.

708
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,029
It is?

709
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,674
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

710
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,629
Oh.

711
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,149
Oh, fine.

712
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,555
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

713
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,432
Oh, but they won't.

714
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,432
Sorry if I seem

715
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,788
pompous.

716
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,672
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

717
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,758
No.

718
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,949
Not yet.

719
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,354
I'm thirsty.

720
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,039
What shall I get you?

721
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,636
Whisky.

722
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,836
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl

723
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,712
I have ever seen

724
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,949
in my entire life.

725
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,838
Get me my drink.

726
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,237
Oh, Archie.

727
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,549
Mm, Archie.

728
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,115
So.

729
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,868
If George decides to change his plea,

730
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,231
he'd tell you
where the loot is first, wouldn't he?

731
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,112
Mm?

732
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,038
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial, OK?

733
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,355
I know. I just meant theoretically.

734
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,829
Kiss me there.

735
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,993
Oh. Theoretically.

736
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,473
Erm.

737
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,717
...to his legal representative...

738
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,473
What's the matter?

739
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,352
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

740
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,435
Ooh!

741
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,869
Aah!

742
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,433
What? What, darling?

743
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,471
- You're getting me hot!
- Sorry.

744
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,192
I need something to drink.

745
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,435
Something cold?

746
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,834
Maybe in the fridge?

747
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,915
Champagne?

748
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,996
Oh, my favourite.

749
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,233
Don't go away.

750
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,593
Je reviens!

751
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,153
What are you doing here?

752
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,316
- Relax!
- Get the fuck out of here!

753
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,512
- Your moaning worried me.
- I was faking it, stupid!

754
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,232
Don't ever call me stupid.

755
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,430
- And I'm not jealous.
- Then leave!

756
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,515
OK!

757
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,638
It's a nice place.

758
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,838
Don't touch his dick!

759
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,832
His wife, his wife!

760
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,916
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

761
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,032
God, there isn't any ice.

762
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,158
Champagne!

763
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,508
Aaagh!

764
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,993
What's the matter?

765
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,874
What are you doing?

766
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,435
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

767
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,516
Erm... let me pour you a glass.

768
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,153
Whose is the car?

769
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,759
The car?

770
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,233
Blocking the drive?

771
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,112
There you are, dear. Cheers.

772
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,673
Nice to see you again.

773
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,028
How was the opera?

774
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,594
- Finished early, did it?
- Whose car is it?

775
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,994
Mine.

776
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,519
It's a beauty, isn't it?

777
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,756
Where did I leave my drink, Archie?

778
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,036
Who is this?

779
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,195
Don't you know?

780
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,753
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

781
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,395
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

782
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,511
- I'm... with the CIA.
- The CIA?

783
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,119
That's correct, ma'am.

784
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,232
I was er...
just telling your husband

785
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,716
before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

786
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,072
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

787
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,111
We're debriefing him as of now

788
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,559
and we're just er

789
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,035
checking all the houses in the area.

790
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,071
- For what?
- For KGB.

791
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,350
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

792
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,119
No er... No, not now.

793
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,514
We er...

794
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,108
We just want to keep everyone informed.

795
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,276
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

796
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,152
Sorry to have troubled you...

797
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,759
Keep everyone informed?

798
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,472
So there's no panic, ma'am.

799
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,874
But isn't it a secret?

800
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,638
You've no idea how secret.

801
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,830
Well, why are you telling everyone?

802
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,518
It's a smoke screen?

803
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,834
What?!

804
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,188
Double bluff.

805
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,790
You obviously know nothing
about intelligence work.

806
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,388
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

807
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,035
My father was in the Secret Service,
Mr Manfredjen St John.

808
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,835
I know perfectly well
you don't keep the public informed

809
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,554
when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

810
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,954
Oh, you don't, huh?

811
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,914
Not unless you're
congenitally insane or stupid, no.

812
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,279
Don't call me stupid.

813
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,479
Why on earth not?

814
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,110
Oh, you English are <i>so</i> superior,
aren't you?

815
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,912
Do you know where you'd be

816
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,554
without us,
the old US of A to protect you?

817
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,635
I'll tell you.

818
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,912
The smallest fucking province
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

819
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,951
So don't call me stupid, lady.

820
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,035
Just thank me.

821
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,435
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us!

822
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,199
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be speaking German!

823
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,833
Singing <i>Deutschland, Deutschland</i>

824
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,156
<i>Über alles</i>

825
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,716
He's covering for me.
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

826
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,956
Necklace. I'll think of something.

827
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,594
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself, darling.

828
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,156
- Who was that shouting?
- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

829
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,952
Archie, who on earth...

830
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,229
I don't know. He...

831
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,476
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

832
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,828
What?!

833
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,154
Let's go to the pub.

834
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,838
Would you like to, Portia?

835
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,439
We haven't been for 15 years!

836
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,959
Portia could see it now.

837
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,229
Honestly, Archie!

838
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,315
Aaagh!

839
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,759
What on earth is the matter?

840
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,798
I thought the picture was falling off.

841
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,036
Will you pull yourself together?!

842
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,479
What's this?

843
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,477
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

844
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,874
What was that?

845
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,399
- A kind of necklace.
- Aah!

846
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,509
What's going on?

847
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,278
Nothing. Let's go.

848
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,355
Can I see that?

849
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,754
- What?
- In your hand.

850
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,069
Your other hand.

851
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,679
Portia, go to your room.

852
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,994
Aren't we going out?

853
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,633
I can explain. I left...

854
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,715
Now!

855
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,876
- They sent a new girl...
- Oh, Archie.

856
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,718
No, she's Canadian...

857
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,035
It's lovely. Thank you.

858
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,630
It's even got a W for Wendy.

859
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,832
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

860
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,952
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

861
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,273
Oh, Archie. This isn't like you.

862
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,393
Are you fucking crazy?!

863
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,759
Hey, I saved your ass.

864
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,758
I had him right where I wanted him,
you asshole!

865
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,348
I give you one fucking thing to!

866
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,948
You had to drive me and shut up!

867
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,149
Oh, relax!

868
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,832
Hello.

869
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,913
Hold on.

870
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,632
It's for you.

871
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,632
Hello.

872
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,189
Not at the moment, no.

873
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,270
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure
when I can get hold of that.

874
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,757
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

875
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,711
Yes. As soon as possible.

876
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,436
Well, that would be very nice, obviously.

877
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,834
So. Erm...

878
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,439
See you soon, I hope.

879
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,959
Bye, Frank.

880
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,596
Calm down. Calm down!

881
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,109
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

882
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,399
Come here!

883
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,033
Smell. Smell!

884
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,277
Smell, Maggie, smell.

885
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,038
Now. Now!

886
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,230
Kill, kill!

887
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,755
Kill!

888
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,997
Kill!

889
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,799
Kill!

890
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,119
We therefore
commit its body to the ground.

891
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,829
Earth to earth.

892
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,871
Ashes to ashes.

893
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,877
Dust to dust.

894
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,833
<i>Miserere Dominus</i>

895
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,479

897
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,959
Hello, honey.

898
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,638
What happened?

899
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,591
N-n-nothing.

900
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,630
What's that?

901
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,829
Er...

902
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,029
Not Granny?

903
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,115
Not yet.

904
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,390
Oh. Who is it for, then?

905
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,714
A f-f-f...

906
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,831
A fish? Frenchman?

907
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,712
- A phone operator?
- Friend.

908
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,876
Oh, a four-legged one?

909
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,149
Where's my sister?

910
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,508
She's in the b-b-b...

911
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,834
Thank you.

912
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,269
Lavatory.

913
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,435
Wanda!

914
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,559
Anything?

915
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,954
What? No?

916
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,672
Why are you here?

917
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,756
I'm here because I'm bored!

918
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,032
Bored, wandering around
this awful city, shoving George's pic...

919
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,478
Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up,
intellectually inferior British faggots.

920
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,509
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of life in this country!

921
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,757
Standing there with their hair clenched

922
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,918
counting the seconds till the weekend,

923
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,952
so they can dress up like ballerinas

924
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,877
<i>at the flat at four</i>

925
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,069
<i>2B, Saint...</i>

926
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,836
To be honest, I er... hate them.

927
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,632
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking <i>lawyer...</i>

928
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,797
So fucking <i>superior</i>
with those phoney accents.

929
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,954
Not you, Ken.
You've got a beautiful voice

930
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,638
when it works.

931
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,629
Sonofabitch!

932
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,754
So er...
Want to have some lunch?

933
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,313
Have you heard from him?

934
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,032
- Who?
- Archie.

935
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,435
No, I have to finish my hair!

936
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,755
Nothing?

937
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,029
OK, I'm out of here!

938
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,673
No plans to see him?

939
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,949
No.

940
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,274
OK, bye, bro!

941
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,115
Bye, Wanda!

942
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,633
Oh, sorry.

943
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,709
- What?!
- It wasn't theirs to sell.

944
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,035
A old lady gave it to them to engrave.

945
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,549
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

946
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,910
- That's their problem.
- No. Legally...

947
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,995
You paid for it!

948
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,669
They accept their mistake
and they're offering you this.

949
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,358
It's much more valuable.

950
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,153
I adore this
and you want me to give it back...

951
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,475
<i>- I</i> don't want...
- They can't have it.

952
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,555
- Wendy.
- No. No!

953
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,238
- Wendy!
- NO!

954
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,952
Tell them they can't have it!

955
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,957
You're the bloody barrister!

956
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

957
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,636
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

958
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,796
It's just beautiful.

959
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,997
Oh, my God, look!

960
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,716
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

961
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,239
Isn't it wonderful?

962
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,759
Whose is it?

963
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,189
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

964
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,469
And where are they?

965
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,508
Hong Kong.

966
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,595
Ah so.

967
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,236
Gone for weeks.

968
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,430
Nice rug, Archie.

969
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,233
May I?

970
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,432
Archie, what are you doing?

971
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,709
The polka, I think.

972
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,116
You make me feel free!

973
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,753
Free?

974
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,555
Do you have any idea
what it's like being English?

975
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,955
Being so correct all the time?

976
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,473
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

977
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,875
Asking someone, 'Are you married? '

978
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,956
And hearing, 'My wife left me.'

979
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,435
Or saying,
'Do you have children? '

980
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,792
And hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday.'

981
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,754
Wanda, we're all terrified
of embarrassment.

982
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,120
That's why we're so... dead.

983
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,111
Most of my friends are dead.

984
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,708
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

985
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,156
But you're alive, God bless you.

986
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,840
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with all this.

987
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,069
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

988
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,795
I'm a good lover.

989
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,515
At least, I used to be
in the early 14th century.

990
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,956
Can we go to bed?

991
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,479
Yeah.

992
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,596
Hang on!

993
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,836
Mind your head.

994
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,352
Agh! Aagh!

995
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,232
Aaagh! Aaagh!

996
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,032
I think I love you, Wanda.

997
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,116
Oh, Archie.

998
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,117
Can I ask you a question?

999
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,195
Anything.

1000
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,276
Where's my locket?

1001
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,469
I couldn't get it.

1002
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,715
What?

1003
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,990
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1004
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,633
I got you this instead.

1005
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,512
Do you like it?

1006
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,234
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1007
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,999
What's the matter? Why?

1008
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,314
My mother gave it to me

1009
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,237
on her death... bed.

1010
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,157
Oh, I'm sorry.

1011
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,633
All right, darling.

1012
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,193
I'll get it for you.

1013
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,275
You promise?

1014
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,913
I'll think of something.

1015
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,235
Sex is very, very difficult for me

1016
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,432
with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

1017
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,957
I promise I'll get it. OK?

1018
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,553
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

1019
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,878
I've loved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

1020
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,558
What was that?

1021
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,193
What?

1022
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,198
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

1023
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,833
No.

1024
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,029
He's no idea?

1025
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,830
He doesn't have a clue.

1026
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,075
What?

1027
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,915
He is so dumb...

1028
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,995
Really?

1029
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,999
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where Lincoln lived.

1030
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,118
Those terrible lies
he told about the CIA!

1031
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,195
So painful!

1032
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,357
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia,

1033
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,233
he said,
'Why did they name her after a car? '

1034
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,638
I love the way you laugh!

1035
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,157
I love you, you're funny.

1036
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,150
How come a girl as bright as you

1037
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,350
can have a brother who's so...

1038
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,072
Don't call me stupid.

1039
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,350
Jesus Christ!

1040
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,150
Ouch! Otto!

1041
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,349
Come on!

1042
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,391
I'll deal with you later!

1043
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,952
What have you done with her?

1044
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,640
- She's all right!
- Otto!

1045
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,512
Now, apologise.

1046
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,710
What?

1047
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,398
Apologise!

1048
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,714
Shit!

1049
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,070
Are you totally deranged?

1050
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,030
You pompous,

1051
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,594
stuck-up, snot-nosed,

1052
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,870
English, giant twerp,

1053
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,675
scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

1054
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,916
How very interesting.

1055
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,315
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1056
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,510
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1057
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,595
Now, apologise!

1058
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,710
What? <i>Me</i> to you?

1059
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,236
Apologise.

1060
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,353
All right, I apologise.

1061
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,708
You're really sorry?

1062
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,353
I'm really, really sorry.

1063
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,152
I apologise unreservedly.

1064
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,029
You take it back?

1065
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,958
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1066
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,868
The imputation was <i>totally</i>
without basis in fact,

1067
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,956
and was in no way fair comment.

1068
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,196
It was motivated purely by malice.

1069
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,197
I deeply regret any distress

1070
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,118
my comments
may have caused you or your family.

1071
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,958
I hereby undertake not repeat

1072
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,470
any such slander
at any time in the future.

1073
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,194
OK.

1074
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,433
<i>Miserere Dominus</i>

1075
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,795
<i>Miserere Dominus</i>

1076
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,319
<i>Canis mortuus est</i>

1077
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:40,833
You said you loved him!

1078
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,352
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

1079
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,436
A. Wanda was lying.

1080
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,516
B. Wanda was telling the truth.

1081
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,517
Which one are you going to pick?

1082
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,278
What was the first one?

1083
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,277
You said you were not seeing him!

1084
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,277
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1085
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,709
I was dealing with something delicate.

1086
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,035
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

1087
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,958
He knows where the loot is
and if you'll be arrested.

1088
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,514
You lope in
like Rambo without a jockstrap

1089
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,312
and dangle him from a window!

1090
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,431
Now, was that smart?!

1091
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,278
Was it shrewd?

1092
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,834
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1093
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,118
Don't call me stupid.

1094
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,555
Oh, right!

1095
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,513
To call you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

1096
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,949
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1097
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,116
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1098
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,232
You think you're an intellectual,
don't you, ape?

1099
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,957
Apes don't read philosophy.

1100
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,755
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

1101
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,519
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

1102
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,631
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1103
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,475
The central message of Buddhism

1104
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,353
- is not every man for himself.
- You read...

1105
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,711
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

1106
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,035
Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.

1107
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,799
Now. You have just assaulted

1108
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,469
the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

1109
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,909
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

1110
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,996
What would an intellectual do?

1111
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,072
What would Plato do?

1112
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,033
Apologise.

1113
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,957
Pardon me?

1114
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,035
Apolo...

1115
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,115
What?

1116
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,835
Apologise!

1117
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,915
Right!

1118
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,633
I'm sorry.

1119
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,233
No.

1120
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,315
Not to me.

1121
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,793
To Archie.

1122
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,229
And make it good, or we're dead.

1123
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,239
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

1124
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,112
Fuck you!

1125
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,032
I'm s...

1126
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,435
I'm very, very s...

1127
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,549
I'm so

1128
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,079
very s...

1129
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,158
Very, very s...

1130
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,436
Very, very...

1131
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,629
ssfff...

1132
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,829
<i>Ugh!</i>

1133
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,791
Hello, Mr Burglar!

1134
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,433
Going somewhere?

1135
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,152
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1136
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,157
I'll teach you a lesson.

1137
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,589
He's a very good friend of mine.

1138
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,073
Otto! Otto!

1139
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,829
He'll be very pleased with me
when he finds you all tied up

1140
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,632
and ready for the police!

1141
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,157
And don't call me Otto.

1142
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,236
To you, I am Mr...

1143
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,152
Aagh!

1144
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,512
Oh, God.

1145
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,230
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1146
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,157
I'm sorry.

1147
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,235
Please.

1148
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,269
I'm sorry.

1149
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,516
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1150
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,232
How could I know it was you?

1151
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,229
I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

1152
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,315
Stupid jerk!

1153
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,558
What the fuck are you doing
robbing your own house?

1154
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,999
You asshole!

1155
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,509
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1156
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,993
Agh!

1157
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,235
I'm sorry.

1158
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,874
I'm sorry.

1159
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,956
Er... Er...

1160
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,477
Yeah.

1161
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,916
God Almighty!

1162
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,636
Bloody hell!

1163
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,632
Darling!

1164
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,239
Are you hurt?

1165
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,510
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1166
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,474
Can't you speak?

1167
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,637
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1168
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,991
Archie, we've been burgled.

1169
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,075
Oh, no!

1170
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,349
Well, are you hurt?

1171
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,072
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1172
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,713
Bit of a headache. I er...

1173
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,434
I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

1174
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,993
My God, is that the time?

1175
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,030
What?

1176
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,310
I didn't realise it was quite so late.

1177
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,395
What?!

1178
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,112
I'm late for a conference.

1179
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,912
You've just been attacked!

1180
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,917
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1181
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,349
- Archie!
- I'll help you tidy up later!

1182
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,754
Hello, Portia.

1183
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,949
What's happened?

1184
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,673
Your father has finally gone
completely mental.

1185
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,633
Hi.

1186
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,233
Archie!

1187
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,359
Thank you so much.

1188
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,674
Champagne?

1189
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,755
OK.

1190
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,432
- To us.
- To us.

1191
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,708
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

1192
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,949
Let's make love!

1193
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,436
Well, if you absolutely insist...

1194
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,595
No.

1195
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,675
What?

1196
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,791
Here. On the rug.

1197
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,113
I'll be right back.

1198
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,196
Get undressed.

1199
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,432
Why not?

1200
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,479
Why not indeed!?

1201
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,638
Afterwards...

1202
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,159
Yeah?

1203
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,236
...let's go to South America.

1204
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,475
What?

1205
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,431
Let's fly to South America.

1206
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,754
Why South America?

1207
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,677
OK... Iceland?

1208
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,794
What do you really want out of life?

1209
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,759
I don't know.

1210
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,632
Why do I like you so much?

1211
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,715
Archie.

1212
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,795
Hm?

1213
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,512
Do you speak Italian?

1214
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,595
I am Italian!

1215
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,870
Sono italiano in spirito.

1216
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,959
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce lavorare in giardino

1217
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,435
a fare l'amore appassionato.

1218
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,834
Uno sbaglio grande!

1219
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,838
But it's such an ugly language.

1220
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,271
How about... Russian?

1221
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,996
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1222
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,113
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya
lyubosyat'sya grust'.

1223
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,154
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu
tverzhdaya naizust'.

1224
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:41,434
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1225
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,070
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko...

1226
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,349
Archie!

1227
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,708
Yeah?

1228
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,239
Are you rich?

1229
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,918
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1230
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,359
What about the house?

1231
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,869
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1232
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,438
Oh.

1233
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,795
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1234
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,072
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1235
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,870
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1236
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,428
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko!

1237
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,153
- What the hell are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

1238
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,235
Who are you?

1239
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,315
What?!

1240
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,714
Get your clothes on.

1241
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,752
- Will you leave immediately, please?
- What?!

1242
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,393
You're in the wrong flat.

1243
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,750
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1244
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,949
He's in Hong Kong.

1245
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,877
He lent me the key. Now get out!

1246
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,958
We leased it
from the agents last weekend.

1247
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,955
Yes, well obviously
that changes things a bit. Erm...

1248
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,633
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1249
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,429
What?

1250
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,199
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

1251
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,837
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

1252
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,591
What a coincidence!

1253
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,638
Ha...

1254
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,910
How nice to see you.

1255
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,948
Hello.

1256
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,672
<i>Hello, Wanda. It's Archie</i>

1257
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,959
I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it.

1258
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,035
I'm sorry.

1259
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,912
What?

1260
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,836
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1261
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,629
Archie?

1262
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,035
Er...

1263
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,829
OK.

1264
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,518
Oh, no, no. Please.

1265
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,232
Look, I want to apologise.

1266
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,509
I just finished it.

1267
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,595
OK, OK, wait.

1268
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,280
Where are you going?
I want speak with you.

1269
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,356
Will you leave me alone?

1270
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,959
I've ended it, all right?

1271
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,957
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1272
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,798
It's all over, OK? It's over.

1273
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,592
- All right!
- Jesus Christ!

1274
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,551
- Calm down!
- Someone help me!

1275
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,395
- Please believe me!
- It's all right!

1276
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,318
Don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

1277
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,509
Will you shut up?!

1278
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,471
Jesus Christ, don't kill me!

1279
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,589
Shut up, then.

1280
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,193
OK.

1281
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,275
Look.

1282
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,118
I just want to apologise

1283
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,229
sincerely

1284
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,197
When I hung you from the window.

1285
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,275
I'm really...

1286
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,832
It was not a nice thing to do.

1287
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,996
Then when I attacked you in there.

1288
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,599
I'm really, s...

1289
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,234
How did I know
you were robbing your house?

1290
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,588
I was trying to help!

1291
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,915
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1292
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,473
I wanted you to trust me.

1293
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,955
Please, it was my fault.

1294
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,993
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1295
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,394
Now, about my sister.

1296
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,475
Otto...

1297
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,238
She's a very sexy girl.

1298
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,555
I understand
you wanting to play around with her.

1299
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,638
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1300
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,715
I was jealous.

1301
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,434
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1302
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,155
Fuck her blue.

1303
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,838
I like you, Archie.

1304
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,032
I just want to help.

1305
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,879
Oh, God!

1306
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,319
Send for an ambulance!

1307
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,199
Shocking!

1308
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,438
I did it!

1309
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,959
I did it! I did it!

1310
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,073
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1311
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,155
Thomason!

1312
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,235
Yeah?

1313
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,838
You done well, my son.

1314
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,838
Now, here's the plan.

1315
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,555
You get four tickets
for this evening for Rio, first class.

1316
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,830
- Then...
- F-f-f...

1317
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,109
Yeah, four.

1318
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,673
We get rid of Otto later.

1319
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,519
Then, back to the flat,
pack, collect me.

1320
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,110
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

1321
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,436
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1322
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,152
Oi! Oi!

1323
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,874
It's so exciting,
I can't believe it!

1324
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,035
He's s-s-safe.

1325
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,197
I'm going to be late for court!

1326
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,554
H-Hello.

1327
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,635
Hello, Otto.

1328
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,633
No, she just er... I-I-left.

1329
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,271
Oh, and Otto...

1330
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,914
You owe me a p-p-p...

1331
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,315
What?

1332
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,310
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1333
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,835
Not Granny?

1334
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,719
M-met with an accident.

1335
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,511
Bullshit! You're lying.

1336
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,835
Dead?

1337
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,158
Heart attack.

1338
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,633
I don't believe this.

1339
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,228
So, George will be out this afternoon.

1340
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,032
We all go out to Heathrow,

1341
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,718
collect the loot and...

1342
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:55,196
All thanks to me.

1343
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,714
So the loot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1344
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,113
What's h-h-happening?

1345
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,715
Well, Ken.

1346
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,875
I'm going to ask you some questions

1347
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,353
while I eat my chips.

1348
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,799
First.

1349
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,512
Who was the philosopher

1350
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,438
who developed
the concept of the superman

1351
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,630
<i>in Also Spracht Zarathustra?</i>

1352
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,038
No?!

1353
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,833
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1354
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,193
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1355
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,753
Next.

1356
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,110
In which book did Nietzsche claim

1357
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,550
that almost all higher culture
is based on cruelty?

1358
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,919
Are you thinking
or are you in mid-stutter?

1359
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,429
You're m-mad.

1360
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,669
<i>Beyond Good And Evil.</i>

1361
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,157
I'll have to ask you an easy one.

1362
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,077
OK. Erm...

1363
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,792
Let me think, let me think.

1364
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,232
Where are the diamonds?

1365
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,752
I'll give you a clue.

1366
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,269
Somewhere round the airport.

1367
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,310
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1368
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,830
I'll just sit here and eat my chips
till you tell me.

1369
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,839
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1370
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,678
The chip.

1371
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,633
What do the English
usually eat with chips

1372
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,955
to make them more interesting?

1373
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,198
Wait a moment!

1374
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,157
It's fish, isn't it?!

1375
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,037
Here, boy.

1376
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,069
Down the hatch.

1377
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,195
Delicious!

1378
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,675
You b-b-b...

1379
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,552
Better eat the green one? OK?

1380
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,555
What's this one's name?

1381
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,796
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

1382
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,592
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1383
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,790
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

1384
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,032
Eugh!

1385
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,116
Avoid the green ones.

1386
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,798
They're not ripe yet.

1387
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,878
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1388
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,989
Yes, sir.

1389
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,430
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was installing windows

1390
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,232
the previous weekend,

1391
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,957
would explain the presence of
small particles of glass on his trousers.

1392
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,516
No hurry, Inspector.

1393
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,153
Please do take your time.

1394
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,189
I'm almost full.

1395
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,353
Almost.

1396
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,391
Stop!

1397
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,431
Please, don't.

1398
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,515
Come on, Wanda!

1399
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,675
Gullet time!

1400
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,597
What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

1401
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,994
The Airway Sheraton?

1402
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,075
The Post House?

1403
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,474
The Cathcart Towers?

1404
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,556
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1405
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,474
Mm? Mm?

1406
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,189
Yes.

1407
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,799
In the safe deposit box?

1408
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,909
Yes.

1409
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,712
Where's the key?

1410
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,795
What?

1411
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,909
Where's the key?

1412
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,031
It's in the t-t-tank.

1413
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,433
Where? Where?

1414
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,869
In the t-t-t...

1415
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,228
Treasure chest!

1416
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,511
Where?!

1417
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,315
Where?

1418
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,032
Oh!

1419
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,672
You m-m-m

1420
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,713
murdering k-k-k...

1421
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,712
I'll kill you, I'll kill you!

1422
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,116
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1423
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,630
Still, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1424
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,159
What?

1425
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,477
Oh!

1426
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,949
- Hello?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1427
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,515
Where?

1428
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,073
Where's the key?

1429
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,788
I've got it.

1430
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,309
When can you get
to George's apartment?

1431
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,551
You are Wanda Gershwitz,

1432
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,309
of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

1433
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,317
Yes.

1434
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,078
Would you tell the court,

1435
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,156
how do you know the defendant?

1436
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,078
We've had a relationship for two years.

1437
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,552
Relationship?

1438
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,069
We're lovers, your lord.

1439
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,716
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year,

1440
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,159
in the morning,

1441
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,315
where were you?

1442
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,396
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1443
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,751
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

1444
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,150
No. Somebody else was there.

1445
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,713
Who was that?

1446
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,193
My brother.

1447
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,275
Did your b...?

1448
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,038
Your brother?

1449
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,111
My brother.

1450
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,554
Yes.

1451
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,479
Yes, and...

1452
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,029
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1453
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,515
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1454
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,518
She's had a relationship
with him all her life.

1455
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,073
Much obliged, my lord.

1456
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,239
W-w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

1457
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,396
Yes, George was there.

1458
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,873
But he left about 6.55.

1459
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,592
Wanda!

1460
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,512
I-I wonder...

1461
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,717
I wonder...

1462
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,758
I wonder...

1463
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,836
Yes, Mr Leach?

1464
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,239
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1465
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,918
I wonder... I w-w-w

1466
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,032
Wh-when you say 6.55,

1467
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,435
Miss er... Gershwitz,

1468
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,154
how can you be so sure?

1469
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,793
Oh, I looked at the clock.

1470
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,473
Cos I said to myself,

1471
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,195
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun? '

1472
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,230
Darling!

1473
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,759
Mr Leach.

1474
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,915
Darling?

1475
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,189
Yes, dear?

1476
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,275
You bitch!

1477
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,799
You fucking bitch!

1478
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,069
Restrain that man!

1479
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,315
Restrain this man.

1480
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,714
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1481
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,798
Clear the court!
I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1482
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,990
Clear the court!

1483
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,514
Clear the court!

1484
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,790
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1485
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,831
Officers, arrest that man!

1486
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,399
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1487
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,593
Bloody hell!

1488
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,430
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1489
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,474
Ah, you made it. Good.

1490
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,272
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1491
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,952
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

1492
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,152
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1493
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,633
I'll see you in court.

1494
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,035
Yes.

1495
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,633
Well.

1496
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,793
That's it, then.

1497
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,395
George.

1498
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,112
- What?
- We've got to talk.

1499
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,711
Tell those pigs to fuck off.

1500
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,068
Fuck off, pigs.

1501
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,759
Did you hear what I said?

1502
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,835
Fuck off.

1503
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,553
What's she up to, George?

1504
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,749
What are you up to?

1505
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,432
You called her darling,

1506
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,629
and Wanda.

1507
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,718
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

1508
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,909
It slipped out.

1509
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,712
Have you been coaching her?

1510
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,354
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

1511
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,436
They'll find you guilty, right?

1512
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,916
Plead guilty now, tell them
where the loot is, you may get

1513
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,235
eight years, out in five and a half.

1514
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,715
What if I tell them about Otto...
and Wanda?

1515
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,838
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1516
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,029
Great, all right.

1517
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,912
Maybe six years, out in four?

1518
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,759
So where are the diamonds?

1519
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,518
Where's Bartlett?

1520
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,517
Upstairs, calming things down.

1521
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,755
So, where are they?

1522
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,474
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1523
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,719
George, it'd be a lot quicker
if you told me.

1524
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,757
OK! I'll tell Bartlett.

1525
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,552
Where's Ken?

1526
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,874
He's at the flat.

1527
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,998
Thank you for all your help.

1528
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,189
I'll be right out.

1529
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,352
Taxi! Taxi!

1530
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,469
Please... shit!

1531
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,828
Taxi!

1532
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,075
Come on.

1533
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,269
- What?
- Let's go.

1534
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,833
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1535
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,679
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1536
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,472
Get in.

1537
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,549
Got your passport?

1538
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,635
Yeah.

1539
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,796
Check the briefcase for mine.

1540
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,273
Get your head down.

1541
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,310
So, you robbed the jeweller's,
turned one lover in,

1542
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,159
and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

1543
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

1544
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,712
Everyone does it in America.

1545
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,034
Not in this country!

1546
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,196
Right! Nobody lies in England.

1547
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,279
- Like Margaret Thatcher never lied.
- You lied to me from the start.

1548
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,915
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I fell in love with you!

1549
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,153
How come you dumped me, then?

1550
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,236
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1551
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,112
Say something in Russian.

1552
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,195
No!

1553
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,791
What are you thinking, Archie?

1554
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,195
I'm trying to find one good reason

1555
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,515
why I should take you away with me.

1556
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,470
How about

1557
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,552
because I have the key
to the safety deposit box.

1558
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,395
<i>(both)</i> That's a good reason!

1559
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,433
What do we do about Otto?

1560
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,629
I'll handle Otto.

1561
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,716
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1562
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,554
So am I.

1563
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,238
Keep it running.

1564
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,756
- Why did you bring him?
- Otto, wait!

1565
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,553
- I'm beginning to think you like him!
- Wait!

1566
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,079
Let's get the diamonds!

1567
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,150
Ken!

1568
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,115
Are you Ken?

1569
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,635
How do you do?

1570
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,273
I'm George's barrister.

1571
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,315
Oh, my God!

1572
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,759
Asshole!

1573
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,155
What the bloody hell...

1574
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,838
Oh, all right, then.

1575
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,958
Archie!

1576
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,554
Where have they gone?

1577
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,432
Quick! Where have they gone?

1578
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,516
They've go... they've go...

1579
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,834
What?

1580
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,229
Are you all right?

1581
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,354
Where have they gone?

1582
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,833
They've gone to the

1583
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,075
the Ca-ca-ca...

1584
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,679
- Are you ill?
- No, no, no.

1585
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,789
What?

1586
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,875
Ca-ca-ca...

1587
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,353
Have you got a stutter?

1588
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,596
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1589
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,153
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1590
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,157
Do you know where they've gone?

1591
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,235
Yeah.

1592
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,759
Fine, fine. Where?

1593
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,792
The Ca-ca

Hotel.

1595
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,555
Hotel?

1596
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,635
Which hotel?

1597
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,235
Ca

1598
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,116

Ca-ca-ca...

1601
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,795
It's OK.

1602
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,309
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1603

Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

I'll be with you in a moment.

I'll be right back.

Smoking or non-smoking?

What was the middle one?

1646

Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

Otto, don't look back,
there's a cop behind us.

Quick!

1651
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,916
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:13,995
Great.

1653
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,553
Luggage?

1654
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,192
Don't really need any.

May I see your boarding pass?

Oh, yes. Certainly.

1664
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,390
Very good. Would you mind
stepping over here, please?

1665
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,316
Of course.

1666

- Oh, look, the Queen.
- Where?

1667
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,036
OK, OK, OK, don't get excited.

1668

OK, OK, OK.

1669

Oh, it's you!
I was actually worried for a minute.

01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,552
- Keep your hands up.
- No!

1671
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,955
- Put 'em up!
- I'll make a deal with you.

1672
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,229
I'll put one up.

1673
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,839
Put the other one up!

1674
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,636
Which looks better?

1675
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,029
I'm warning you, Otto.

1676
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,593
What are you going to do?

1677
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,832
Shoot me? Gun me down in cold blood,
like a dog? Hey?

1678
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,953
If you want to settle something,
fight me. You're a man.

1679
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,036
Let's fight like men! Come on!

1680
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,753
All right.

1681
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,869
All right, then.

1682
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,717
OK. OK.

1683
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,592
You look good, Arch.

1684
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,995
That's right. I used to box for Oxford.

1685
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,554
Oh, yeah?
Well, I used to kill for the CIA.

1686
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,033
Now, get your hands up.

1687
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,075
No.

1688
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,553
You spineless bimbo.

1689
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,636
Now, out.

1690
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:25,080
I'm going to have
to shoot you now, Archie.

1691
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,509
But I've got a little time
before my plane leaves

1692
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:29,756
and I'm longing to humiliate you.

1693
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,632
So get in that barrel.

1694
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,435
What?

1695
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,515
In the barrel.

1696
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,238
Right.

1697
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,595
You English!

1698
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,188
You think you're so superior, don't you?

1699
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,754
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1700
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,030
A bunch of pompous,

1701
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,799
badly-dressed, poverty-stricken,

1702
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,639
sexually repressed football hooligans.

1703
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,513
Goodbye, Archie.

1704
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,029
At least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1705
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,549
Your problem is you don't like winners.

1706
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,908
- Winners?
- Yeah.

1707
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,155
Winners.

1708
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,429
Winners like

1709
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,675
North Vietnam?

1710
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,074
Shut up!

1711
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,713
We did not lose Vietnam!

1712
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,989
It was a tie!

1713
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,112
I'm telling ya, baby,
they kicked a little ass there.

1714
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:22,552
Boy, they whupped
your hide real good!

1715
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,635
No, they didn't.

1716
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,557
- Oh, yes, they did.
- No, they didn't.

1717
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,352
Oh, yes, they did.

1718
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,038
Oh, no they...

1719
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,115
Shut up!

1720
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,149
Goodbye, Archie.

1721
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,633
Are you gonna shoot me?

1722
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,910
Er yes, I'm afraid so, old chap.

1723
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,029
Sorry!

1724
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,149
Look, Otto. Look.

1725
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,040
Revenge.

1726
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,913
It's K-K-Ken!

1727
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,838
C-c-coming to k-k-kill me.

1728
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:59,316
How are you going to c-c-catch me,
K-K-Ken?

1729
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,554
Now, where was I?

1730
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,033
Oh, yeah.

1731
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,672
Shit! God!

1732
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,435
Fucking limey cement!

1733
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,675
Ken! Ken!

1734
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,791
Wait, wait, Ken!

1735
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,195
Kenny! May I call you Kenny?

1736
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,309
Remember Wanda?

1737
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,032
I got the deal of a lifetime!

1738
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,559
50-50. What do you say?

1739
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,716
OK, OK, 60-40.

1740
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,193
That's my final offer.

1741
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,309
Revenge!

1742
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,589
Wait, I got an idea.

1743
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,039
You take it all.

1744
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,355
Here's my boarding pass. Ken!

1745
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,358
I'm gonna... I'm gonna k-k-kill you.

1746
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,959
OK, fine, Ken. Come at me.

1747
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,479
Give me your best shot.

1748
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,556
Go on, you don't have the guts.

1749
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,999
Admit it.

1750
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,314
OK, you have the guts.

1751
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,873
Good. Wait.

1752
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,433
Death!

1753
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,472
All right, I'm sorry
I ate your fish, OK?!

1754
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,715
I'm sorry!

1755
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,955
Revenge!

1756
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,752
Jesus, I said I'm sorry.

1757
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,791
What the fu...? Aaagh!

1758
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,756
Got him!

1759
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,716
Gotcha again!

1760
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,432
You bastard!

1761
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,189
Hey! I've lost my stutter.

1762
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,469
It's gone.

1763
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,555
I can speak.

1764
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,148
How much wood could
a woodchuck chuck,

1765
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,396
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1766
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,035
Good afternoon, sir.

1767
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,115
Boarding pass?

1768
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,911
Buongiorno, signorina.

1769
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,593
Now, listen. Two things.

1770
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,233
One.

1771
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,875
Behave yourself from now on,
or I'll break your neck, OK.

1772
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,115
Two.

1773
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,475
Gorbachov.

1774
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,035
Glasnost.

1775
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,795
Molotov.

1776
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,235
Blinis.

1777
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,510
Er... Lenin.

1778
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,756
Pushkin.

1779
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,029
Chicken Kiev.

1780
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,435
Good. Dostoevsky.

1781
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,073
Roubles.

1782
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,152
<i>Vladivostok.</i>

1783
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:36,959
Assho-o-ole!

1784
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,833
