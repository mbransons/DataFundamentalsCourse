1
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,732
I'm requesting--

2
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,769
Captain, I'd like to request
that it be me who's the attorney--

3
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,490
That it be myself who’s assigned.

4
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,278
No, I'd like to request
that it be I who am assigned--

5
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:37,857
'That it be I who am assigned'?

6
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:41,126
That's good.
That's confidence-inspiring.

7
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,047
Good grammar there.

8
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,217
Captain, I'd like to request...

9
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:48,638
that I be the attorney assigned.

10
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:53,128
I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway
here to see Captain West.

11
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,049
Go right in, Commander.
They're expecting you.

12
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,489
Thank you.

13
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,769
-Jo, come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

14
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,641
Captain West,
this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

15
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,975
-Jo, you know Commander Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,116
Captain, I appreciate
you seeing me on such short notice.

17
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,643
- Would you like to sit down?
- I'm fine, sir.

18
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:15,083
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

19
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,252
I understand we had some trouble
over the weekend down in Cuba?

20
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:20,488
Yes, sir.
This past Friday, two Marines--

21
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,352
a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson
and a Private Louden Downey--

22
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:28,455
entered the barracks room of a P.F.C.
William Santiago and assaulted him.

23
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:31,874
Santiago died at the base hospital
approximately an hour later.

24
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,332
The N.I.S. Agent who took
Dawson and Downey's statements...

25
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,609
maintains they were trying
to prevent Santiago...

26
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,394
from naming Dawson
in a fence line shooting incident.

27
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,073
They're scheduled to have a hearing
down in Cuba this afternoon at 1600.

28
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,996
- What's the problem?
- Dawson and Downey...

29
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:50,220
are both recruiting poster Marines,
and Santiago was known to be a screw-up.

30
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,937
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot
like a Code Red.

31
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,204
Christ.

32
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:58,792
Sir, I'd like to have them moved
up to Washington and assigned counsel--

33
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:01,066
someone who can really
look into this--

34
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:03,404
someone who possesses
not only the legal skill...

35
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,287
but a familiarity
with the inner workings of the military.

36
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:08,741
In short, Captain,
I'd like to suggest that...

37
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,704
I be the one who that--

38
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,282
that it be me who is assigned
to represent them...

39
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,727
myself.

40
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,134
Commander Galloway, why don’t you
get yourself a cup of coffee?

41
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,118
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

42
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:25,260
I'd like you to leave the room so
we can talk about you behind your back.

43
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,184
Certainly, sir.

44
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,616
I thought this Code Red shit
wasn't going on anymore.

45
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,657
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows
what the hell goes on down there?

46
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,617
We better find out
before the rest of the world does.

47
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,625
Damn thing could get messy.

48
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,121
All right,
what about this Commander Galloway?

49
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:49,196
She's been working a desk
in Internal Affairs...

50
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,123
for a little over a year now.

51
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:54,057
- Before that?
- Disposed of three cases in two years.

52
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,848
Three cases in two years?
Who's she handling, the Rosenberg’s?

53
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,337
- She's not cut out for litigation.
- She's a hell of a investigator.

54
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:02,762
In Internal Affairs she can crawl up
a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

55
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:06,514
- But when it comes to trial work--
- I know. All passion, no street smarts.

56
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,435
Bring her back in.

57
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:21,334
Commander, we're gonna have the
defendants moved up here in the morning.

58
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,432
- Thank you, sir.
- Division will assign them counsel.

59
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:29,644
-But not me.
-From what I get from your colleagues...

60
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,955
you're much too valuable in your
present assignment to be wasted...

61
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:34,031
in what I'm sure will boil down
to a five-minute plea bargain...

62
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,957
and a week's worth of paperwork.

63
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,063
Sir, I think there might be
more involved than that.

64
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,510
Don't worry about it.

65
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,358
I promise you Division will assign
the right man for the job.

66
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,663
All right. Let's go.
Let's get two.

67
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,274
- Sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.

68
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,450
You just look the ball
into your glove.

69
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,895
Shooting two.

70
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,512
- Sorry.
- You gotta trust me, Sherby.

71
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:59,155
Keep your eyes open, your chances of
catching it increase by a factor often.

72
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,014
- Kaffee.
- Let's try it again.

73
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,048
Dave, you seem distraught.

74
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,772
We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago
about the McDermott case.

75
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:09,427
You're stalling on this thing.
Now we either do it now...

76
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,946
or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna
hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

77
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:16,815
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy
still hang people from yardarms?

78
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,299
I don't think so.

79
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,560
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy
hangs people from yardarms anymore.

80
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,857
I'm gonna charge him with possession
and being under the influence on duty.

81
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:28,917
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days
in the brig with loss frank and pay.

82
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:31,834
It was oregano, Dave.
It was $10 worth of oregano.

83
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,755
Yeah, well, your client thought
it was marijuana.

84
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,439
My client's a moron.
That's not against the law.

85
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:39,738
Kaffee, I got people to answer to
just like you do. I'm gonna charge him.

86
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,943
With what,
possession of a condiment?

87
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,468
- Kaffee.
- I tried to help you out of this...

88
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,159
but if you ask for jail time,
I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

89
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,018
- You won't get it.
- I will get it.

90
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,940
And if the M.T.D. is denied,
I'll file a motion...

91
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,723
seeking to obtain
an evidentiary ruling in advance.

92
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,059
And after that, I'm gonna file
against pretrial confinement.

93
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,548
And you're gonna spend the next three
months going blind on paperwork...

94
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,103
because a signalman second-class bought
and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

95
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,597
Let's go! Let's get two!

96
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,964
B misdemeanor,
20 days in the brig.

97
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:10,203
C misdemeanor,
15 days restricted duty.

98
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,558
I don't know why
I'm agreeing to this.

99
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,803
'Cause you have wisdom
beyond your years.

100
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,145
Morning.

101
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,842
Morning, Captain.

102
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,374
How's the baby, Sam?

103
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,515
I think she's getting ready
to say her first word any day now.

104
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,111
How can you tell?

105
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:32,666
She just looks
like she has something to say.

106
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,225
Excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.

107
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,207
It's all right, Danny.
I know you don't have a good excuse...

108
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,257
so I won't force you
to come up with a bad one.

109
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,144
- Thank you, sir.
- This first one's for you.

110
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,438
Seems you're moving up
in the world.

111
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,361
Been requested by Division.

112
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:50,081
Requested to do what?

113
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:52,416
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

114
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:56,378
A Marine corporal named Dawson illegally
fires a round from his weapon...

115
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:59,200
over the fence line
and into Cuban territory.

116
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,089
- What's a fence line?
- Sam.

117
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:05,181
A big wall separating the good guys
from the bad guys.

118
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,383
- Teacher's pet.
- P.F.C. William Santiago...

119
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:11,649
threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigative Service.

120
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:13,658
Dawson and another member
of his squad...

121
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:17,529
P.F.C. Louden Downey,
go into Santiago's room...

122
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,867
tie him up,
stuff a rag down his throat...

123
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,940
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

124
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,560
Attending physician says the rag
was treated with some kind of toxin.

125
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,807
They poisoned it?

126
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,692
- Not according to them.
- What did they say?

127
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:33,278
Not much.
They're being flown up here tomorrow...

128
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,666
and on Wednesday at 0600, you'll catch
a transport down to Cuba for the day...

129
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,597
to find out what you can.

130
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:42,208
Meantime, go and see
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway...

131
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,280
with Internal Affairs.

132
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:46,814
Any questions?

133
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:50,749
Uh, the flight to Cuba--
Was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

134
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,150
Seems important to Division
that this one be handled by the book.

135
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:58,078
So I'm assigning co-counsel.
Any volunteers?

136
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,558
I got a stack of papers on my desk
about a mile high.

137
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,488
- Work with Kaffee on this.
- Doing what?

138
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,692
Kaffee will have this done
in about four days.

139
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,893
Doing various administrative things.

140
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,816
Backup, whatever.

141
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:14,337
In other words, I have
no responsibilities here whatsoever.

142
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,838
Right.

143
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:17,921
My kind of case.

144
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,863
Right.

145
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,327
Okay, but I've got to have
that report by Wednesday.

146
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:32,069
- Hi.
- Hold on. Hi.

147
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,376
Daniel Kaffee.
I was told to me with, uh--

148
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:44,331
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

149
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:47,687
About a briefing?

150
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,611
I'll call you back.

151
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,092
You're the attorney Division assigned?

152
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,811
I'm lead counsel.
This is Sam Weinberg.

153
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,950
I have no responsibilities here
whatsoever.

154
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,095
Come in, please. Have a seat.

155
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,190
Lieutenant, how long
have you been in the Navy?

156
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,653
Going on nine months now.

157
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,207
And how long have you been
out of law school?

158
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:21,774
A little over a year.

159
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,847
I see.

160
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,086
Have I done something wrong?

161
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,713
It’s just that when I petition Division
to have counsel assigned...

162
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,694
I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

163
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,353
No offense taken,
in case you were wondering.

164
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,212
Commander,
Lieutenant Kaffee is generally...

165
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,549
considered the best litigator
in our office.

166
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:40,716
He's successfully plea-bargained
44 cases in nine months.

167
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:42,694
One more,
I get a set of steak knives.

168
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,492
Have you ever been in a courtroom?

169
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,982
I once had
my driver's license suspended.

170
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,944
Commander, from what I understand,
if this thing goes to court...

171
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,081
they won’t need a lawyer,
they'll need a priest.

172
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,552
No, they'll need a lawyer.

173
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,553
Dawson's family's been contacted.

174
00:12:56,627 --> 00:13:00,009
Downey's closest living relative
is Ginny Miller, his aunt.

175
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,865
She hasn't been contacted yet.
Would you like me to take care of that?

176
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,360
If you feel like it.

177
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,922
One of the people
you'll be seeing down there...

178
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,962
is the barracks C.O.,
Colonel Nathan Jessup.

179
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:12,074
I assume you’ve heard of him.

180
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,522
Who hasn't?

181
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:17,036
He's been in the papers lately.
He's expected to be appointed...

182
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:19,825
director of operations
of National Security Council.

183
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,135
- Really?
- These are the letters...

184
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,408
that Santiago wrote
in his eight months at Gitmo.

185
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,843
- That's Guantanamo Bay.
- I knew that one.

186
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:29,290
He wrote to the fleet commander
to the commandant of the Marine Corps.

187
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:32,181
Even his senator. He wanted
to be transferred off the base.

188
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,100
No one was listening.
Are you with me?

189
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,988
Yeah.

190
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,083
Finally, he wrote
to the Naval Investigative Service...

191
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:42,060
where he offered information about
Corporal Dawson's fence line shooting...

192
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:44,654
in exchange for a transfer.

193
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,247
Right. Is that all?

194
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,173
Lieutenant,
this letter makes it look like...

195
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,573
your client had a motive
to kill Santiago.

196
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,771
Got you.
And Santiago is who?

197
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,366
The victim.

198
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,959
Write that down.
Am I correct to assume these letters...

199
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:01,814
don't paint a flattering picture
of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?

200
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,286
- Yes, among--
- Am I further right in assuming...

201
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:07,028
investigation of this incident might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

202
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,005
- Colonel Jessup.
- Twelve years.

203
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:10,935
Sorry?

204
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,106
I'll get them to drop the conspiracy
and conduct unbecoming.

205
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:14,868
Twelve years.

206
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,417
You haven't talked to a witness
or looked at a piece of paper.

207
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,464
Pretty impressive, huh?

208
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:22,162
You're gonna have
to go deeper than that.

209
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:24,884
Do you have some sort of jurisdiction
here that I should know about?

210
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,637
My job is to make sure
that you do your job.

211
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:29,593
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

212
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,888
so my jurisdiction’s pretty much
in your face.

213
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,905
Read the letters. I'll expect
your report when you return from Cuba.

214
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,532
- Sure.
- You're dismissed.

215
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,951
I always forget that part.

216
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,302
He's a little preoccupied.

217
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,405
Team's playing Bethesda Medical
next week.

218
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,331
Tell your friend
not to get cute down there.

219
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,632
The Marines in Guantanamo
are fanatical.

220
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:57,943
About what?

221
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,246
About being Marines.

222
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,299
Dear sir...

223
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:04,023
my name is P.F. C. William T. Santiago.

224
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:06,329
I'm a Marine stationed
at Marine barracks...

225
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:09,464
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

226
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,177
I'm writing to inform you of my problems
with my unit here in Cuba...

227
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,806
and to ask for your help.

228
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:18,074
I've fallen out on runs before
for several reasons...

229
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,029
such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

230
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,673
Buton May 18, I'd fallen back
about20 or30yards...

231
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:26,164
going down a rocky unstable hill.

232
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,086
My sergeant grabbed me
and pushed me down the hill.

233
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,893
Then Isawall black, and the last thing
I remembered was hitting the deck.

234
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,188
I was brought to the hospital where
I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

235
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:37,816
I ask you to help me.

236
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:41,203
Please, sir. I just need
to be transferred out of R.S. C.

237
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,997
Sincerely,
P.F. C. William T. Santiago...

238
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,591
U.S. Marine Corps.

239
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:48,479
P.S. In exchange for my transfer
off the base...

240
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,453
I'm willing to provide you
with information about--

241
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:54,620
'The illegal fence line shooting
that occurred the night of August 2.'

242
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,711
Who the fuck
is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?

243
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:02,745
Private Santiago is a member
of Second Platoon Bravo, sir.

244
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,845
Yeah. Well, apparently he's not
very happy down here in Shangri-la...

245
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:09,664
because he's written letters
to everybody but Santa Claus...

246
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,770
asking for a transfer.

247
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:14,657
And now he's telling tales
about a fence line shooting.

248
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,209
Matthew?

249
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:19,739
I'm appalled, sir.

250
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,850
You're appalled.

251
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:27,258
This kid broke the chain of command
and ratted on a member of his unit...

252
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:30,016
to say nothing of the fact
that he is a U.S. Marine...

253
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,702
and it would appear he can't run
from here to there...

254
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:35,422
without collapsing
from heat exhaustion.

255
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,624
What the fuck is going on
in Bravo Company, Matthew?

256
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:41,595
Colonel, I think it would be better
to hold this discussion in private.

257
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,630
That won't be necessary, Colonel.
I can handle the situation, sir.

258
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:49,279
The same way you handled Curtis Bell?
Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!

259
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:52,732
- I'm still your superior officer.
- And I'm yours, Matthew.

260
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,757
I want to know
what we're going to do about this.

261
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,645
I think Santiago should be transferred
off the base immediately.

262
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,271
He's that bad, huh?

263
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:04,382
Not only that. But word
of this letter is bound to get out.

264
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,310
He's gonna get his ass whipped.

265
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,237
Hmm. Transfer Santiago.

266
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,694
Yes. I'm sure you’re right.

267
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:16,157
I'm sure that's the thing to do.

268
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,543
Wait. I've got a better idea.

269
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,424
Let's transfer the whole squad
off the base.

270
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:27,456
Let's-- On second thought, Windward--

271
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,588
Let's transfer the whole
Windward Division off the base.

272
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:35,138
John, go on out there
and get those boys down off the fence.

273
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,599
They're packing their bags. Tom.

274
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,127
- Sir.
- Get me the president on the phone.

275
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,162
We're surrendering
our position in Cuba.

276
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,568
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

277
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,488
Don't get the president just yet.

278
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:52,034
Maybe we should
consider this for a second.

279
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,278
- Dismissed, Tom.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:59,049
Maybe-- and I'm just
spit-balling here--

281
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:03,937
Maybe we have a responsibility
as officers to train Santiago.

282
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:08,006
Maybe we as officers
have a responsibility to this country...

283
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:11,239
to see that the men and women
charged with its security...

284
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,284
are trained professionals.

285
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,132
Yes, I'm certain
that I read that somewhere once.

286
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,685
And now I'm thinking,
Colonel Markinson...

287
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:23,914
that your suggestion
of transferring Santiago...

288
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:27,079
while expeditious
and certainly painless...

289
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,539
might not be,
in a manner of speaking...

290
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:32,397
the American way.

291
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:35,146
Santiago stays where he is.

292
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,019
We're gonna train the lad.

293
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:41,901
John, you're in charge.

294
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:45,000
Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6...

295
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:48,585
on his next proficiency
and conduct report...

296
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,893
I'm going to blame you.

297
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,480
- Then I'm going to kill you.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:56,040
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

299
00:18:57,392 --> 00:19:01,353
Matthew, I think I will
have that word in private with you now.

300
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:05,220
John, that's all. Why don't we meet
at the 'O' club and have lunch...

301
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,786
and we'll talk about the training
of young William?

302
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,476
I'd be delighted to hear any
suggestions that you might have, sir.

303
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,433
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,116
Matthew, sit down. Please.

305
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,571
What do you think of Kendrick?

306
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,399
My opinion of him has nothing to do--

307
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,500
I think he's pretty much
of a weasel myself...

308
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,481
but he's an awfully good officer.

309
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:37,810
And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on
the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.

310
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,258
We're in the business
of saving lives, Matthew.

311
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:44,879
That is a responsibility
that we have to take pretty seriously.

312
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:49,105
And I believe that taking a Marine
who is not quite up to the job...

313
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,540
and shipping him off
to another assignment...

314
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,514
puts lives in danger.

315
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,432
Sit down, Matthew.

316
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,533
We go back a while.

317
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,955
We went to the Academy together.
We were commissioned together.

318
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,398
We did our tours in Vietnam together.

319
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,732
But I've been promoted
up through the chain...

320
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,580
with greater speed and success
than you have.

321
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:21,494
Now, if that’s a source of tension...

322
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,447
or embarrassment for you...

323
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,203
I don't give a shit.

324
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:30,258
We're in the business of saving lives,
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

325
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:34,256
Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

326
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,841
All the paperwork's in order.

327
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,721
- Step over there.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:04,854
Hal, is this Washington, D.C.?

329
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,483
All right. Let's move.

330
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:07,929
Yes, sir.

331
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:17,038
- Got all of that one.
- Excuse me.

332
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:20,552
I wanted to talk to you about
Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

333
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,113
- Say again?
- Dawson and Downey.

334
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,278
Those names sound like
they should mean something to me--

335
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,036
Dawson, Downey--your clients.

336
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:32,269
The Cuba thing. Yes!
Dawson and Downey. Right.

337
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,320
I've done something wrong again,
haven't I?

338
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,303
I was just wondering
why two guys have been locked up...

339
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:42,030
since this morning while their lawyer's
outside hitting a ball.

340
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,580
We need the practice.

341
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,176
That wasn't funny.

342
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,200
It was a little funny.

343
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,431
Would you be very insulted
if I recommended to your supervisor...

344
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,353
that he assign different counsel?

345
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:57,715
- Why?
- I don't think you’re fit to handle it.

346
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,391
You don't even know me.
Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...

347
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,981
to discover I'm not fit
to handle a defense.

348
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:08,881
Oh, come on.
That was damn funny.

349
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,877
You're wrong.

350
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:15,818
I do know you.

351
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:19,571
Daniel Alistair Kaffee,
born June 8, 1964...

352
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,492
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

353
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:22,834
Your father's Lionel Kaffee...

354
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:26,251
former Navy judge advocate and
attorney general of the United States.

355
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:27,820
Died 1985.

356
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,511
You went to Harvard law.
Then you joined the Navy...

357
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,233
probably because that's
what your father wanted you to do.

358
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:36,499
And now you're just treading water
for three years in the JAG Corps.

359
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:39,916
Just laying low till
you can get out and get a real job.

360
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,406
If that’s the situation, that's fine.
I won't tell anyone.

361
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,683
But it's my feeling that
if this case is handled in the same...

362
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:48,500
fast-food, slick-ass,
Persian bazaar manner...

363
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,422
with which you seem
to handle everything else...

364
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,081
then something's gonna get missed.

365
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:54,705
And I wouldn't be doing my job
if allowed Dawson and Downey...

366
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:57,231
to spend any more time in prison
than absolutely necessary...

367
00:22:57,304 --> 00:23:00,271
because their attorney had predetermined
the path of least resistance.

368
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:04,311
Wow.

369
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,767
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

370
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,613
I don't think
your clients murdered anyone.

371
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,992
What are you basing this on?

372
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,781
There was no intent.

373
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,567
The doctor's report says
Santiago died of asphyxiation...

374
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:18,489
brought on by acute lactic acidosis...

375
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:22,231
and that the nature of the acidosis
strongly suggests poison.

376
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:24,949
I don't know what any of that means,
but it sounds pretty bad.

377
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:26,874
Santiago died at 1:00 a.m.

378
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,623
At 3:00, the doctor wasn’t able
to determine the cause of death.

379
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,829
Two hours later,
he said it was poison.

380
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:34,322
Oh, now I see what you’re saying.

381
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,559
It had to be Professor Plum
in the library with a candlestick.

382
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:39,994
- I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.
- Okay.

383
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,132
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.

384
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:44,593
It's the big white house
with the pillars in front.

385
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:47,734
- Thank you.
- I don't think you’ll have much luck.

386
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:49,180
I was assigned by Division.

387
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:52,179
Somebody over there thinks
I'm a pretty good lawyer.

388
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:55,602
So while I appreciate your interest
and admire your enthusiasm...

389
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:58,044
I think I can handle things myself.

390
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,116
You know what a Code Red is?

391
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,879
What a pity.

392
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:18,046
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

393
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,536
Officer on deck!

394
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,679
Sir, Lance Corporal
Harold W. Dawson, sir!

395
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,856
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

396
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,059
Someone hasn't been working
and playing well with others, Harold.

397
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:29,983
Sir, yes, sir!

398
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,917
Sir, P.F.C. Louden Downey, sir!

399
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,848
I'm Daniel Kaffee.
This is Sam Weinberg.

400
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,032
Sit down.

401
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,733
- This your signature?
- Yes, sir.

402
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:50,525
You don't have to call me 'sir.'
Is this your signature?

403
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:51,739
Sir, yes, sir.

404
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,559
You certainly don't need
to do it twice in one sentence.

405
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,074
- What's a Code Red?
- It is a disciplinary engagement.

406
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,520
What's that mean?

407
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:03,297
A Marine falls out of line, it's up to
the men in his unit to get him on track.

408
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:06,713
- What's a garden variety Code Red?
- Sir?

409
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:10,563
Harold, you say, 'sir,' and
I turn around and look for my father.

410
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:13,083
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee.

411
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:16,090
Garden variety. Typical.
What's basic Code Red?

412
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:18,684
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe
on a regular basis...

413
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:21,244
the men in his squad
will give him a G.I. shower.

414
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:22,527
What's that?

415
00:25:22,597 --> 00:25:25,018
Scrub brushes,
Brillo pads, steel wool.

416
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:26,370
Beautiful.

417
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,858
Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

418
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,559
Yes, sir.

419
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:38,623
Does he ever talk?

420
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,858
Sir, P.F.C. Downey will answer
any direct questions you ask him.

421
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:43,420
Swell.

422
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:47,617
Private Downey, the rag
you stuffed in Santiago's mouth--

423
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:49,541
- Was there poison on it?
- No, sir.

424
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:51,995
Silver polish,
turpentine, antifreeze?

425
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:54,340
No, sir. We were just
gonna shave his head, sir.

426
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:57,091
When all of the sudden--

427
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,494
We saw blood dripping
down his mouth...

428
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,587
and we pulled the tape off and
there was blood all down his face, sir.

429
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:06,787
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson
called the ambulance.

430
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,481
Did anyone see you call
the ambulance?

431
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,521
No, sir.

432
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:15,587
Were you there
when the ambulance got there?

433
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,927
Yes, sir. That's when
we were taken under arrest.

434
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:22,598
The night of August 2, did you fire
a shot across the fence line into Cuba?

435
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,832
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

436
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,581
- My mirror engaged, sir.
- His mirror?

437
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,360
Every American sentry post has
a Cuban counterpart, called 'mirrors.'

438
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,743
Lance Corporal's claiming that
his mirror was about to fire at him.

439
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:38,186
Santiago's letter to the N.I.S....

440
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,619
said you fired illegally.

441
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,458
He's saying that the guy, the mirror--

442
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:46,050
He never made a move.

443
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,091
You see what I'm getting at?

444
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:58,215
If Santiago didn't have anything on you,
then why did you give him a Code Red?

445
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,389
'Cause he broke
the chain of command, sir.

446
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,308
- He what?
- He went outside of his unit, sir.

447
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,675
If he had a problem,
he should have spoken to me, sir.

448
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:08,643
- Then his sergeant, then commander--
- Yeah. All right.

449
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:11,271
Did you assault Santiago
with the intent of killing him?

450
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,935
- No, sir.
- What was your intent?

451
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,657
- To train him, sir.
- Train him to do what?

452
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:20,069
Train him to think of his unit
before himself-- to respect the code.

453
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:21,866
What's the code?

454
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,821
Unit, Corps, God, Country.

455
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:25,097
I beg your pardon?

456
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:30,317
Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir.

457
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,335
The government
of the United States...

458
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,085
wants to charge you two
with murder...

459
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:53,062
and you want me
to go to the prosecutor...

460
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:56,553
with ' Unit, Corps, God, Country'?

461
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:58,535
That's our code, sir.

462
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,142
It's your code.

463
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,665
We'll be back.

464
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:10,449
You guys need anything-- books,
papers, cigarettes, ham sandwich?

465
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,719
Sir, no, thank you, sir.

466
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:16,431
Harold, I think there's a concept
you better start warming up to.

467
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:17,709
Sir?

468
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,267
I'm the only friend you've got.

469
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,014
Smiling Jack Ross.

470
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,223
- Welcome to the big time.
- You think so?

471
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:42,002
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey, you
practice law better than play softball.

472
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:45,452
Unfortunately for those two, I don't
do anything better than play softball.

473
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:46,988
- I'm out of here, Janelle.
- Bye.

474
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:49,266
- See you when I get back from Cuba.
- Say hi to Castro for me.

475
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,538
Will do.
What are we looking at?

476
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,640
They plead guilty, we drop
the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

477
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,881
- Twenty years. They're home in half.
- I want 12.

478
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,837
- Can't do it.
- They called the ambulance.

479
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:02,099
I don't care if they called
the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

480
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,469
The rag was tested for poison.
The autopsy, lab reports.

481
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,128
They say the same thing:
maybe, maybe not.

482
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:09,135
Chief of Internal Medicine
at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital...

483
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,669
says he's sure.

484
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,718
What do you know about Code Reds?

485
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,165
Oh, man.

486
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,957
- We off the record?
- Tell me.

487
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:22,039
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

488
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:25,139
Before you go getting yourself into
trouble tomorrow, you should know...

489
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,249
the platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

490
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:30,136
held a meeting with the men
and specifically...

491
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,536
told them not to touch Santiago.

492
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:37,750
- We still playing hoops tomorrow night?
- Do we have a deal?

493
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,404
I'll talk to you when I get back.

494
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,390
- Hi there.
- Any luck getting me replaced?

495
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:49,557
Is there anyone in this command you
don't either drink or play ball with?

496
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,481
- Commander--
- Listen. I came to make peace.

497
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:55,409
Got off on the wrong foot.
What do you say? Friends?

498
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:58,418
I brought Downey some comic books
he was asking for.

499
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:00,827
The kid, Kaffee,
I swear he doesn't know where he is.

500
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:03,129
- Doesn't even know why he's arrested.
- Commander.

501
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:04,887
- You can call me Joanne.
-Joanne.

502
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,094
- OrJo.
- Yes.

503
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:10,034
Jo, if you ever speak to a client
of mine again without my permission...

504
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,602
I'll have you disbarred.

505
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,775
- Friends?
- I had authorization.

506
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:17,495
- From where?
- Downey's closest living relative.

507
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,981
Ginny Miller.
His aunt on his mother's side.

508
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,291
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny?

509
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,267
I gave her a call
like you asked.

510
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,644
Very nice woman.
We spoke for about an hour.

511
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,131
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny.

512
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,759
Perfectly within my province.

513
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,164
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn?
We could hold the trial there.

514
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,232
I can sew the costumes.
Maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.

515
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,956
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

516
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:48,571
And the hits just keep on coming.

517
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:14,073
- How's it going, Luther?
- Another day, another dollar, captain.

518
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:17,213
- You gotta play them as they lay.
- What goes around comes around.

519
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:20,578
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- At least I got my health.

520
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:24,254
Well, then you got everything.
See you tomorrow, Luther.

521
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:26,177
Not if see you first.

522
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,328
Now don't forget.
When Sally gets back, you're my witness.

523
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,608
The baby spoke.
My daughter said a word.

524
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,879
Your daughter made a sound, Sam.
I'm not sure it was a word.

525
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:36,802
Come on, now.
It was definitely a word.

526
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:42,141
You heard her. The girl sat here,
pointed and said, ' Pa.'

527
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:44,219
She did. She said, ' Pa.'

528
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,431
She was pointing at a mailbox, Sam.

529
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:50,297
That's right, pointing as into say,
' Pa, look. A mailbox.'

530
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,542
Jack Ross came to see me today.
He offered me the 12 years.

531
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:03,199
- Oh, that's what you wanted, right?
- I know, I know.

532
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,606
I mean, I guess I'll take it.
I'll take it.

533
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,639
- So--
- It took about 45 seconds.

534
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,336
He barely put up a fight.

535
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:16,862
Danny, take the 12 years.
It's a gift.

536
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,750
You don't believe their story,
do you?

537
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,887
You think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

538
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,065
I believe every word of their story...

539
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:27,038
and I think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

540
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:34,119
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

541
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,705
Don't forget to wear the whites.
Very hot down there.

542
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,566
I don't like the whites.

543
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,902
Nobody likes the whites,
but we're going to Cuba.

544
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:43,555
- You got Dramamine?
- Dramamine keeps you cool?

545
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:47,041
No, Dramamine keeps you from
throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

546
00:32:47,114 --> 00:32:50,343
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid
of crashing into a large mountain.

547
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,904
I don't think Dramamine will help.

548
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,209
I got some oregano.
I hear that works pretty good.

549
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:01,606
You know, Ross said the strangest thing
to me right before I left.

550
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,936
He said the platoon commander
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

551
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:08,484
had a meeting with the men
and told them not to touch Santiago.

552
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:09,898
So?

553
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:13,480
I never mentioned Kendrick.
I don't even know who he is.

554
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:20,801
Ah, what the hell.
I'll see you tomorrow.

555
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:57,833
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg,
Commander Galloway.

556
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,489
I'm Corporal Barnes. I'm to escort you
to the windward side of the base.

557
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,594
- Thank you.
- I got some camouflage jackets here.

558
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,664
- I suggest you both put them on.
- Camouflage jackets?

559
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:09,736
Yes, sir. We'll be riding
pretty close to the fence line.

560
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:11,880
The Cubans see
an officer wearing white...

561
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:14,408
they think it might be someone
they want to take a shot at.

562
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:18,511
Good call, Sam.

563
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,418
We'll just hop on the ferry.
We'll be there in no time.

564
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,977
- Wait. We gotta take a boat?
- Yes, sir.

565
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:31,530
- To get to the other side of the bay.
- Nobody said anything about a boat.

566
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,285
- Is there a problem, sir?
- No, no problem.

567
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:36,045
Just not crazy about boats.

568
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:40,207
Jesus Christ, Kaffee,
you're in the Navy, for crying out loud.

569
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:43,691
- Nobody likes her very much.
- Yes, sir!

570
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,829
Nathan Jessup. Come on in.

571
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:02,763
Thank you, sir. Daniel Kaffee.
I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

572
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:05,106
This is
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway.

573
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:08,240
- Pleasure meeting you, Commander.
- Observing and evaluating, sir.

574
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,164
Lieutenant Sam Weinberg.
He'll be assisting.

575
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,847
- Sir.
- This is my X.O., Colonel Markinson...

576
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,860
and platoon leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

577
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,324
I've asked them to join us.
Sit down, please.

578
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,765
- Lieutenant Kaffee.
- Colonel Markinson.

579
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,220
I had the pleasure
of meeting your father once.

580
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:24,269
I was a teenager.
He spoke at my high school.

581
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,384
Lionel Kaffee?

582
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,079
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what do you know?

583
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:33,550
John, this man's dad once made a lot of
enemies down in your neck of the woods.

584
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:37,236
Jefferson v. Madison County
School District.

585
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:41,461
Folks down there said a black girl
couldn't go to an all-white school.

586
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:45,303
Lionel Kaffee said,
'Well, we'll just see about that.'

587
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:47,823
How the hell is your dad, Danny?

588
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,197
He passed away seven years ago, sir.

589
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:54,615
Don't I feel like the fuckin' asshole.

590
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:55,958
Not at all.

591
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:59,153
Well, what can we do for you, Danny?

592
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,081
Uh, not much, sir.

593
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:06,265
This is really a formality
more than anything else.

594
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,073
JAG Corps insists that we interview
all the relevant witnesses.

595
00:36:10,138 --> 00:36:12,026
The JAG Corps can be demanding
that way.

596
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,375
John will take you out
and show you what you want to see.

597
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,417
After that we can all
hook up for lunch.

598
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:21,591
- How does that sound? Good.
- Fine, sir.

599
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:31,708
I understand you had a meeting
with your men that afternoon.

600
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,009
- Yes, I did.
- What did you guys talk about?

601
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:36,346
I told the men
that we had an informer among us...

602
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,282
and that despite any desire
they might have to seek retribution...

603
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:42,706
Private Santiago
was not to be harmed in anyway.

604
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,945
- What time was that meeting?
- 1600.

605
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,762
That's 4:00.

606
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:40,439
Sam, we should make sure
somebody gets this to his parents.

607
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:43,548
- We don't need it anymore.
- Right.

608
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,942
Lieutenant Kendrick,
may I call you John?

609
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,985
No, you may not.

610
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,100
Have I done something to offend you?

611
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,179
No, I like all you Navy boys.

612
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:57,146
Every time we gotta go someplace to
fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

613
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:01,762
Lieutenant Kendrick,
do you think Santiago was murdered?

614
00:38:01,828 --> 00:38:04,578
Commander, I believe in God
and His Son Jesus Christ.

615
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:06,554
And because I do, I can say this:

616
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:10,207
Private Santiago is dead,
and that is a tragedy.

617
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,448
But he is dead
because he had no code.

618
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:16,640
He is dead because he had no honor,
and God was watching.

619
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:20,704
How do you feel about that theory?

620
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,913
Sounds good. Let's move on.

621
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:24,891
Are you planning
on doing any investigating...

622
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:26,821
or are you just gonna take
the guided tour?

623
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,074
I'm pacing myself.

624
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:33,536
They were running around
for three hours...

625
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:36,422
looking for anything white
they could wave in the air.

626
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:39,650
Some of these people surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

627
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,731
Well, walk softly and carry
an armored tank division, I always say.

628
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:50,243
- That was delicious. Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

629
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:54,948
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple
of questions about September 6.

630
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,542
Shoot.

631
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:59,105
On the morning of the sixth,
you were contacted by an N.I.S. agent...

632
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:02,472
who said that Santiago tipped him off
to an illegal fence line shooting.

633
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,642
- Yes.
- Santiago would reveal the person...

634
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:07,397
- in exchange for a transfer.
- Yes.

635
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:13,061
If you feel there are any details
that I'm missing...

636
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,229
you should feel free to speak up.

637
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,074
Thank you.

638
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:26,182
Now, at this point you called
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson...

639
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,488
and Lieutenant Kendrick
into your office.

640
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:30,180
- Is that right?
- Yes.

641
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,364
What happened?

642
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:37,000
We agreed that, for his own safety,
Santiago should be transferred off base.

643
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,930
Santiago was set to be transferred.

644
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,492
On the first available flight
to the States...

645
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,604
0600 the next morning.

646
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:49,606
Five hours too late,
as it turned out.

647
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,203
Yeah.

648
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,979
All right. That's all I have.
Thanks very much for your time.

649
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:59,210
Corporal's waiting with the Jeep.
He'll take you back to the flight line.

650
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:01,220
- Thank you, sir.
- Wait. I've got some questions.

651
00:40:01,294 --> 00:40:02,855
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

652
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:05,796
- No, you don't.
- On the morning that Santiago died...

653
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,318
did you meet with Dr. Stone
between 3:00 and 5:00?

654
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,252
Of course I met with the doctor.
One of my men was dead.

655
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,749
See? The man was dead. Let's go.

656
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:19,337
I'm just wondering if you’ve ever heard
the term 'Code Red.'

657
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,249
I've heard the term, yes.

658
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,188
This past February,
you received a cautionary memo...

659
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:27,468
from the commander-in-chief
of the Atlantic fleet...

660
00:40:27,536 --> 00:40:29,391
warning that the practice
of enlisted men...

661
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:32,490
disciplining their own
wasn't to be condoned by officers.

662
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,983
Well, I submit to you
that whoever wrote that memo...

663
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,912
has never faced the working end...

664
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:40,871
of a Soviet-made
Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

665
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:44,491
However, the directive
having come from the commander...

666
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,601
I gave it its due attention.

667
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:49,130
- What is your point, Jo?
- She has no point.

668
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,057
She often has no point.
It's part of her charm.

669
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:55,911
- We're out of here. Thank you.
- I think Code Reds still go on here.

670
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:00,078
- Do Code Reds still happen here?
-Jo, he doesn't need to answer that.

671
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,641
- Yes, he does.
- No, he really doesn't.

672
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:03,689
Yeah, he really does.

673
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,383
You know, it just hit me.

674
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:13,267
She outranks you, Danny.

675
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:16,049
- Yes, sir.
- I want to tell you something.

676
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:18,538
And listen up,
'cause I really mean this.

677
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,230
You're the luckiest man
in the world.

678
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,424
There is nothing on this earth sexier--
believe me, gentlemen--

679
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:28,363
than a woman that
you have to salute in the morning.

680
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:32,178
Promote 'em all, I say,
'cause this is true:

681
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:35,246
If you haven't gotten a blowjob
from a superior officer...

682
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,595
well, you’re just letting
the best in life pass you by.

683
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:43,279
Colonel, the practice of Code Reds
is still condoned by officers--

684
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,606
My problem is that I'm a colonel,
so I'll go on taking cold showers...

685
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,126
until they elect some gal president.

686
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,566
I need an answer to my question, sir.

687
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:56,046
Take caution in your tone, Commander.

688
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,269
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat
is making me absolutely crazy.

689
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,303
You want to ask me about Code Reds?
On the record...

690
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:07,278
I tell you I discourage
the practice...

691
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,327
in accordance
with the commander's directive.

692
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,303
Off the record,
I tell you it is an invaluable part...

693
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,231
of close-infantry training.

694
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:18,071
And if it happens to go on
without my knowledge, so be it.

695
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,039
I run my unit how I run my unit.

696
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:25,370
You want to investigate me,
roll the dice and take your chances.

697
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:29,744
I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

698
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,785
So don't think for one second that
you can come down here...

699
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:34,866
flash a badge...

700
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:37,426
and make me nervous.

701
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:42,613
Let's go.

702
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,948
Colonel, I'll just need a copy
of Santiago’s transfer order.

703
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:50,547
What's that?

704
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:53,620
Santiago's transfer order. You guys
have paperwork on that kind of thing.

705
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:55,547
I just need it for the file.

706
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:58,482
- For the file.
- Yeah.

707
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,698
Of course you can have a copy
of the transfer order for the file.

708
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:07,897
- I'm here to help in anyway I can.
- Thank you.

709
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:11,828
You believe that, don’t you, Danny, that
I'm here to help you in anyway I can?

710
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:14,072
Of course.

711
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,098
Corporal will take you by personnel
on your way out to the flight line...

712
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:22,233
and you can have
all the transfer orders that you want.

713
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,330
- Let's go.
- But you have to ask me nicely.

714
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:29,818
I beg your pardon?

715
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:32,887
You have to ask me nicely.

716
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:36,221
You see, Danny, I can deal with
the bullets and the bombs and the blood.

717
00:43:36,288 --> 00:43:39,322
I don't want money,
and I don't want medals.

718
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:43,899
What I do want is for you to stand there
in that faggoty white uniform...

719
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:48,225
and with your Harvard mouth
extend me some fucking courtesy.

720
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:53,205
You gotta ask me nicely.

721
00:43:56,577 --> 00:43:58,814
Colonel Jessup,
if it’s not too much trouble...

722
00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:02,624
I'd like a copy
of the transfer order, sir.

723
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:07,200
No problem.

724
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,465
In the seventh. San Diego leads.
Braves try to comeback.

725
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:36,704
Runners don’t go.

726
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:39,424
Hard drive, right field.
We're gonna have a tied ballgame.

727
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:43,290
It's on its way,
and it is now 10 to 10.

728
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:45,220
And I don't believe it.

729
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,396
- Who is it?
- It's me.

730
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:57,056
I really missed you. I was just saying
to myself it’s been almost three hours.

731
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,844
- Markinson's disappeared.
- What?

732
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:02,562
Colonel Markinson's gone U.A. --
unauthorized absence.

733
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:04,060
I know what it means.
When?

734
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,306
This afternoon.
Sometime after we left.

735
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:09,535
- I'll try to find him in the morning.
- I've already tried.

736
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,266
You tried?

737
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:15,749
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close
to the textbook definition...

738
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,021
of interfering
with a government investigation.

739
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:19,615
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

740
00:45:20,777 --> 00:45:24,257
Aunt Ginny. She says she feels
like she's known me for years.

741
00:45:24,328 --> 00:45:26,501
So I suggested that she might feel
more comfortable...

742
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:28,641
if were directly involved
with the case.

743
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:31,975
She had Louden sign the papers
about an hour ago.

744
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,930
I suppose
it's way too much to hope...

745
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:36,360
that you’re making this up
just to bother me.

746
00:45:36,426 --> 00:45:38,498
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
make a motion for separation.

747
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,320
- You're still lead counsel.
- Splendid.

748
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:44,103
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red,
and so do you.

749
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,753
Let's go.

750
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,155
Officer on deck!

751
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,083
- Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
- Sir?

752
00:45:55,148 --> 00:45:58,661
Don't say 'Sir' like I just asked you
if you cleaned the latrine.

753
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:00,903
You heard what I said. Did
Lieutenant Kendrick order you guys...

754
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:02,915
to give Santiago a Code Red?

755
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,224
Yes, sir.

756
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,839
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

757
00:46:13,613 --> 00:46:16,547
You mind telling me
why you never mentioned this before?

758
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:20,516
-You didn't ask.
-That won't win you a place in my heart.

759
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:22,793
I get paid no matter
how much time you spend in jail.

760
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:24,836
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

761
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,983
- Fuck you, Harold!
- All right.

762
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:30,349
At ease.

763
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,270
- Let's sort this thing out.
- Shit!

764
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:35,630
There was a platoon meeting
on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.

765
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:37,963
Lieutenant Kendrick says
that he gave strict instructions...

766
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,038
that nothing was to happen
to Santiago.

767
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:43,046
Now, is this true?

768
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,644
I want you to speak freely.

769
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:49,926
Ma'am, that's correct...

770
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,553
but then he dismissed the platoon
and we all went to our rooms.

771
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:53,933
And what happened then?

772
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,521
Lieutenant Kendrick came
to our room, ma'am.

773
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:57,607
When?

774
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:03,084
About five minutes after the meeting
broke, sir. About 1620.

775
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,714
And what happened then?

776
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:09,832
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

777
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,202
Jack!

778
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:14,412
Hang on.

779
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:15,943
They were given an order.

780
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,811
-Jack, come on.
- Be right back.

781
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:23,949
- What are you doin', Jack?
- Be right back.

782
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:27,053
- How long did you know about the order?
- I didn't. Who's this?

783
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:30,636
That's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer.
She's very pleased to meet you.

784
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:33,741
- What exactly are you accusing me of?
- How long did you know about the order?

785
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,753
He didn't, 'cause if he did
and hadn't told us...

786
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:38,478
he'd be violating about 14 articles
of the Code of Ethics.

787
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:39,923
He has enough to worry about...

788
00:47:39,988 --> 00:47:41,996
God forbid our clients
decide to plead not guilty...

789
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,207
and testify for the record
that they were given an order.

790
00:47:44,276 --> 00:47:46,798
Kendrick specifically told those men
not to touch Santiago.

791
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,658
That's right. And then he went
into Dawson and Downey's room...

792
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:50,634
and specifically told them
to give him a Code Red.

793
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:53,327
- Kendrick said different. Have proof?
- He's lying. I have the defendants.

794
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:55,438
And I have 23 Marines
who aren't accused of murder...

795
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,713
and a lieutenant
with four letters of commendation.

796
00:47:57,781 --> 00:47:59,887
- Why did Markinson go U.A.?
- We'll never know.

797
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,828
- You don't think I could subpoena him?
- You can try, but you won't find him.

798
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:06,612
You know what he did for the first 17
of his 26 years in the Corps?

799
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,956
Counterintelligence. Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

800
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:14,261
Look, Danny.

801
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,748
Jessup's star is on the rise.

802
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:18,679
Division will give me
a lot of room on this one...

803
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:20,849
to spare Jessup
and the Corps any embarrassment.

804
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,032
How much?

805
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,576
Involuntary manslaughter,
two years, they're home in six months.

806
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:28,055
No deal. We're going to court.

807
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,875
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

808
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:33,108
'Cause you’ll lose,
and Danny knows it.

809
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,794
If we do go to court,
I'm gonna have to go all the way.

810
00:48:35,864 --> 00:48:38,101
They're gonna be charged
with a whole truckload--

811
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,658
murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

812
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,031
Even though he's got me by the balls
out here, Danny knows...

813
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,334
that in a courtroom,
he loses this case.

814
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,256
Danny is an awfully talented lawyer.

815
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:49,623
He's not about to see
his clients go to jail for life...

816
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,079
when he knows
they can be home in six months.

817
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:54,649
That's the end of this negotiation.

818
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,784
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

819
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:03,834
All right. Here's the story.

820
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:08,406
The government's offering
involuntary manslaughter, two years.

821
00:49:08,476 --> 00:49:10,331
Be home in six months.

822
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,340
Wow, Kaffee!
You're the greatest lawyer in the world!

823
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:19,348
Ooh, how can we ever thank you?

824
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,875
Fellas, you hear what I just said?

825
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:25,080
You're going home in six months.

826
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:27,385
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

827
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:30,649
- Do what?
- Make a deal, sir.

828
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,125
What are you talking about?

829
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,907
We did nothing wrong, sir.
We did our job...

830
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:38,007
and if that has consequences,
then I'll accept them.

831
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:40,380
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

832
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:45,077
Did you--
Did she put you up to this?

833
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,500
- We have a code, sir.
- Oh, well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

834
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:51,772
You and your code plead not guilty.
You'll be in jail the rest of your life.

835
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,775
Do what I'm telling you,
you'll be home in six months.

836
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:58,431
Do it, Harold.
Six months.

837
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,918
It's nothing.
It's a hockey season.

838
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:04,922
- Permission to--
- Speak!

839
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:06,999
Jesus!

840
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:12,184
- What do we do then, sir?
- When?

841
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:15,159
After six months, we'll be
dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

842
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:16,511
Probably.

843
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:19,607
Well, what do we do then, sir?

844
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:25,952
We joined the Marines because we wanted
to live our lives by a certain code.

845
00:50:26,017 --> 00:50:27,708
And we found it in the Corps.

846
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:30,877
Now you’re asking us to sign a piece
of paper that says we have no honor.

847
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:33,052
You're asking us
to say we’re not Marines.

848
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:35,327
If a court decides
that what we did was wrong...

849
00:50:35,395 --> 00:50:37,337
then I'll accept
whatever punishment they give.

850
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:40,728
But I believe I was right, sir.
I believe I did my job...

851
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,000
and I will not dishonor myself,
my unit or the Corps...

852
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:47,963
so that I can go home
in six months...

853
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:49,411
sir.

854
00:50:56,325 --> 00:51:00,930
Commander, I'd like to talk to Lance
Corporal Dawson alone for a minute.

855
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,226
Sergeant.

856
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:06,715
We're gonna go to another room.

857
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:09,026
- We'd like another holding room.
- All right, ma'am.

858
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:11,429
- It's gonna be okay.
- Sit down.

859
00:51:22,406 --> 00:51:24,349
You don't like me very much, do you?

860
00:51:25,608 --> 00:51:28,673
Forget it. Don't answer that.
It doesn't matter.

861
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:36,005
You know...

862
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:39,175
Downey worships you.

863
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,190
He's gonna do whatever you do.

864
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,734
Are you really gonna let this happen
to him because of a code, Harold?

865
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:52,135
- Do you think we were right?
- It doesn't matter--

866
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:56,096
- Do you think we were right?
- I think you’d lose.

867
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,849
You're such a coward.

868
00:51:59,914 --> 00:52:02,370
I can't believe
they let you wear a uniform.

869
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,170
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this.
I did everything I could.

870
00:52:07,243 --> 00:52:09,664
You're going to Leavenworth
for the better part of your life.

871
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:11,594
And you know what?
I don't give a shit.

872
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:16,427
What happened to saluting an officer
when he leaves the room?

873
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:26,179
Open it up.

874
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:30,557
I don't believe it.

875
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,926
Dawson's gonna go to jail
just to spite me.

876
00:52:32,992 --> 00:52:35,447
Fine. If he wants to jump
off a cliff, that's his business.

877
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,132
I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way.
I want to get him a new lawyer. How?

878
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,536
Just make a motion tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

879
00:52:41,602 --> 00:52:43,511
The judge will ask you
if you want to enter a plea...

880
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:45,888
and you tell him that you want
to have new counsel assigned.

881
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:48,736
That's that.

882
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:51,965
One thing, though. When you ask
the judge for new counsel...

883
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:53,890
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

884
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,438
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to let them be judged.

885
00:52:57,506 --> 00:53:00,290
I want you to stand up
and make an argument.

886
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,909
An argument that didn't work
for Calley at My Lai.

887
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,019
An argument that didn't work
for the Nazis at Nuremburg.

888
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:06,946
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.

889
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,346
Do you really think that's the same
as two teenage Marines...

890
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,095
executing a routine order they never
believed would result in harm?

891
00:53:12,163 --> 00:53:13,789
These guys aren't the Nazis.

892
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,796
Don't look now, Danny,
but you’re making an argument.

893
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:21,723
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning
I get them a new attorney.

894
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,685
Why are you so afraid
to be a lawyer?

895
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:26,116
Were Daddy's expectations
really that high?

896
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:29,629
Oh, please. Spare me
the psycho-babble father bullshit!

897
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:32,963
Dawson and Downeywill have their day
in court, but with another lawyer.

898
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:35,877
Another lawyer won’t be good enough.
They need you.

899
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:39,358
You know how to win. You know they have
a case, and you know how to win.

900
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:41,765
If you walk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

901
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:45,060
Their fate was sealed
the moment Santiago died.

902
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:47,647
- Do you believe they have a case?
- You and Dawson.

903
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,694
You both live
in the same dream world.

904
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,621
It doesn't matter what I believe.

905
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,727
It only matters what I can prove.

906
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:56,614
So, please, don't tell me
what I know and don't know!

907
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,370
I know the law!

908
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:04,999
You know nothing about the law.

909
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:07,170
You're a used car salesman, Daniel.

910
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:09,629
You're an ambulance chaser
with a rank.

911
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,672
You're nothing. Live with that.

912
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:20,808
So I told Duncan...

913
00:54:20,873 --> 00:54:24,867
'If you want to take this to court
I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...

914
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:28,101
and you're gonna spend a year
going blind on paperwork...

915
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,520
because a 90-year-old man
misread the Delaware insurance code.'

916
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:33,700
- So what happened?
- He calls back 15 minutes later.

917
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,625
He says, ' Let's make a deal.'

918
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:22,253
All rise.

919
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:30,503
Where are we?

920
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:35,527
Docket number 411275VR-5.

921
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,503
The United States v.
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson...

922
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:40,518
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

923
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:43,592
The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy to commit murder...

924
00:55:43,664 --> 00:55:46,121
and conduct unbecoming
a United States Marine.

925
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:48,298
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

926
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,377
Yeah.

927
00:55:54,929 --> 00:55:56,271
They're not guilty.

928
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,801
Enter a plea of not guilty
for the accused.

929
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:05,006
We'll adjourn until 1000,
three weeks from today...

930
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:07,890
at which time this general
court-martial will reconvene.

931
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,113
Why does a lieutenant junior grade
with ninth months' experience...

932
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:30,418
and a track record for plea bargaining
get assigned a murder case?

933
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:36,011
Would it be so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

934
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:40,371
We'll work out of my apartment
every night, 7:00.

935
00:56:40,436 --> 00:56:44,878
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half
a dozen boxes of red and black pens.

936
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,049
Sam, get a couple of desk lamps.
I need a preliminary medical profile.

937
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:52,373
Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct
reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.

938
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:54,543
The only thing I have to eat
is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...

939
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:56,469
so if you want anything else,
bring it with you.

940
00:56:56,534 --> 00:56:58,608
- Okay?
- Yeah.

941
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:06,741
So this is what
a courtroom looks like.

942
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:19,214
Were you able to speak
to your friend at the N.I.S.?

943
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:23,381
Yeah. She said if Markinson
doesn't want to be found...

944
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,271
we're not gonna find him.

945
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:28,153
She said I could be Markinson,
and you wouldn't know it.

946
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:31,632
Are you Markinson?

947
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,640
I'm not Markinson.

948
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:38,771
That's two down.

949
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:41,652
What?

950
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:46,903
I'm just wondering,
now that Joanne’s on this--

951
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:49,392
I'm just wondering
if you still need me.

952
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,150
- They were following orders.
- An illegal order.

953
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,358
Do you think they knew
it was an illegal order?

954
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,624
It doesn't matter what they knew.
Any decent person would have refused--

955
00:57:57,692 --> 00:57:59,864
They're not permitted
to question orders.

956
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:02,834
Then what's the secret? Huh?
What are the magic words?

957
00:58:02,908 --> 00:58:04,434
I give orders every day--

958
00:58:04,508 --> 00:58:06,364
We have softball games
and marching bands.

959
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:10,455
They work at a place where you have to
wear camouflage or you might get shot!

960
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:19,860
I need you.

961
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:24,668
You're better at research than I am,
and you know how to prepare a witness.

962
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:32,854
I've got medical reports
and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

963
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:41,078
What?

964
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,055
You got any kung pao chicken?

965
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:51,670
This is our defense-- intent. No one
can prove there was poison on the rag.

966
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:54,494
Code Red-- they're common
and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.

967
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:58,751
The order-- A: Kendrick gave it,
B: They had to follow it.

968
00:58:58,817 --> 00:59:00,857
- That's it.
- What about motive?

969
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:02,871
We're a little weak on motive.
They had one.

970
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:05,018
- That doesn't mean they're guilty.
- Relax.

971
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,359
We'll deal with the fence line shooting
when it comes up.

972
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:10,459
Let's start with intent. I don't
want to know what made Santiago die.

973
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:13,346
I just want to show it could've been
something other than poison.

974
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:16,826
Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything
there is to know about lactic acidosis.

975
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:20,063
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway
with the JAG Corps in Washington.

976
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:23,229
I've been trying to track down
a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

977
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:26,015
Doctor, was there any sign
of external damage?

978
00:59:26,082 --> 00:59:30,394
No scrapes? No cuts?
Bruises? Broken bones?

979
00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:34,658
- Was there any sign of violence?
- You mean, other than the dead body?

980
00:59:34,723 --> 00:59:37,375
Shit, I walk into that
every goddamn time.

981
00:59:37,444 --> 00:59:41,884
He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson
to give Willie a Code Red.

982
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:44,095
Answers still have to come
much faster.

983
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,171
This Iowa farm boy thing
will play for a while...

984
00:59:46,244 --> 00:59:48,547
but in the end, it sounds
like he's searching for the truth.

985
00:59:48,613 --> 00:59:50,785
He's right. From now on,
Willie is Private Santiago.

986
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:53,090
You start calling him Willie,
and all of a sudden he's a person...

987
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:55,296
who's got a mother
who's gonna miss him, okay?

988
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:57,221
They drew the court members
this afternoon.

989
00:59:57,286 --> 00:59:59,490
Seven men, two women,
five Navy, four Marines.

990
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:01,980
All officers with line experience.
Neither of the women have children.

991
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:04,257
That's a bad break.
There’s nothing we can do.

992
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:06,978
My father always said a jury trial
is not just about the law.

993
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:10,081
It's about assigning blame.
Santiago's dead, and he shouldn't be.

994
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,901
These nine people are gonna insist
that someone be blamed for that.

995
01:00:12,967 --> 01:00:15,334
Ross is handing them our clients.
We're gonna hand them Kendrick.

996
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:18,781
This is about a sales pitch.
It's gonna be won by the lawyers.

997
01:00:18,855 --> 01:00:22,020
So remember, poker faces. Don’t flinch
in front of the court members.

998
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:25,700
Something doesn't go our way, don't hang
your head or shift in your seat.

999
01:00:25,768 --> 01:00:29,347
Whatever happens, you have to look like
it's exactly what you knew would happen.

1000
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:33,824
- If you pass me documents--
- Do it swiftly and don't look eager.

1001
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:37,028
Don't wear that perfume in court.
Wrecks my concentration.

1002
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,471
Really?

1003
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:40,773
I was talking to Sam.

1004
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:43,431
What time is it?

1005
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:45,407
It's time to go home.
Try to get some sleep.

1006
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:47,424
- Yeah.
- Give me a ride?

1007
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:48,872
Sure.

1008
01:00:51,722 --> 01:00:53,794
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

1009
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:56,255
I'll see you in court, counselor.

1010
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:04,838
- Danny, I--
- You don't have to say it.

1011
01:01:04,909 --> 01:01:07,210
We've had our differences.
I said some things I didn't mean.

1012
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:10,505
You said some things you didn't mean,
but you’re happy I stuck with the case.

1013
01:01:10,571 --> 01:01:14,794
And if you’ve gained a certain respect
for me over the last three weeks...

1014
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:16,835
of course, I'm happy about that.

1015
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:18,915
But we don't have to make
a whole big deal out of it.

1016
01:01:18,988 --> 01:01:21,161
If you like me,
I won't make you say it.

1017
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,525
I was just gonna tell you
to wear matching socks tomorrow.

1018
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:29,514
Okay. Good tip.

1019
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:31,528
We're ready.

1020
01:01:31,597 --> 01:01:33,931
Better believe it.

1021
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:45,294
We're gonna get creamed.

1022
01:02:13,553 --> 01:02:15,593
- Lieutenant Kaffee?
- Yes?

1023
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,934
You are gonna save our son,
aren’t you?

1024
01:02:18,962 --> 01:02:20,239
I'll do my best.

1025
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:25,451
Danny, I'd like you to meet
Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

1026
01:02:26,418 --> 01:02:29,265
- You're Aunt Ginny?
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:02:30,418 --> 01:02:33,451
I'm sorry. I was expecting
someone older.

1028
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:35,181
So was I.

1029
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,034
Last chance.
I'll flip you for it.

1030
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:43,442
- All rise.
- Too late.

1031
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,638
All those having business
with this general court-martial...

1032
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:57,165
stand forward
and you shall be heard.

1033
01:02:57,238 --> 01:03:00,554
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph
is presiding.

1034
01:03:00,629 --> 01:03:03,084
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

1035
01:03:03,156 --> 01:03:04,532
Yes, sir.

1036
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,675
The facts of the case are these:

1037
01:03:09,749 --> 01:03:12,433
On midnight of September 6,
the accused entered the barracks room...

1038
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:15,350
of their platoon mate,
P.F.C. William Santiago.

1039
01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:18,383
They woke him up,
tied his arms and legs with tape...

1040
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:20,627
and forced a rag into his throat.

1041
01:03:20,695 --> 01:03:24,142
A few minutes later, a chemical reaction
called lactic acidosis...

1042
01:03:24,215 --> 01:03:26,256
caused his lungs to begin bleeding.

1043
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:28,182
He drowned in his own blood...

1044
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:31,728
and was pronounced dead
at 37 minutes past midnight.

1045
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,623
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1046
01:03:36,697 --> 01:03:40,177
That's right.
The story I’ve just told you...

1047
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:43,663
is the exact same story you’re gonna
hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...

1048
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,354
and it's the exact same story
you're gonna hear from Private Downey.

1049
01:03:46,424 --> 01:03:49,011
Furthermore, the government
will also demonstrate...

1050
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:51,417
that the accused
soaked the rag in poison...

1051
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:55,410
and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kill.

1052
01:03:56,763 --> 01:03:58,705
Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1053
01:03:58,778 --> 01:04:01,745
is gonna try and pull off
a little magic act here.

1054
01:04:01,817 --> 01:04:04,207
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

1055
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:07,861
He's gonna astonish you
with stories of rituals...

1056
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,714
and dazzle you
with official-sounding terms...

1057
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,634
like 'Code Red.'

1058
01:04:13,755 --> 01:04:16,854
He might even try to cut into
a few officers for you.

1059
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:21,594
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none,
but it's gonna be entertaining.

1060
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:25,008
And when we get to the end,
all the magic in the world...

1061
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,671
will not have been able to divert
your attention from the fact...

1062
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:33,011
that Willie Santiago is dead
and Dawson and Downey killed him.

1063
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:37,842
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1064
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:41,108
Lieutenant Kaffee.

1065
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:43,963
There was no poison on the rag,
and there was no intent to kill.

1066
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:48,570
Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile
'cause it just ain't true.

1067
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,737
When Dawson and Downey went
into Santiago's room that night...

1068
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:54,294
it wasn't because of vengeance
or hatred.

1069
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:57,913
It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't
because they were looking for kicks.

1070
01:04:57,983 --> 01:05:00,601
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1071
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,325
Let me say that again.

1072
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:06,327
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1073
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:08,889
Out in the real world
that means nothing...

1074
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,954
and here at the Washington Navy Yard
it doesn't mean a whole lot more.

1075
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:16,820
But if you’re a Marine assigned
to Rifle Security Company Windward...

1076
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:19,712
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and you're given an order...

1077
01:05:19,777 --> 01:05:22,264
you follow it
or you pack your bags.

1078
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,247
Make no mistake about it.

1079
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:27,453
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey
are sitting before you today...

1080
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:30,750
because they did their job.

1081
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:36,318
Is the government ready
to call its first witness?

1082
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:40,858
If it please the court,
the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

1083
01:05:45,123 --> 01:05:47,228
Mr. McGuire, would you
raise your right hand, please?

1084
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:49,950
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you give this general court-martial...

1085
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:52,834
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1086
01:05:52,899 --> 01:05:56,096
- I do.
- Have a seat, please, sir.

1087
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:59,393
Would you state your full name
and occupation, for the record?

1088
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:03,716
Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent,
Naval Investigative Service.

1089
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:07,905
Mr. McGuire, did your office receive
a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...

1090
01:06:07,973 --> 01:06:10,013
on 3 September of this year?

1091
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:12,289
- We did.
- What did that letter say?

1092
01:06:12,357 --> 01:06:16,830
That a member of Santiago’s unit
had fired his weapon over the fence line.

1093
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,941
Was that Marine
identified in the letter?

1094
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:22,396
No. I notified the barracks C.O.
Colonel Jessup...

1095
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,412
that I would be coming down
to investigate.

1096
01:06:24,486 --> 01:06:26,145
And what did you find?

1097
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,149
The shift reported only one sentry
returned his weapon to the switch...

1098
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,131
with a round of ammunition missing.

1099
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:34,305
- Who was that?
- Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

1100
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:35,901
Your witness.

1101
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:41,570
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson
about the fence line shooting?

1102
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,437
Yes. He claims to have been engaged
in some manner by the enemy.

1103
01:06:45,512 --> 01:06:47,618
- You don' believe him?
- It's not my place--

1104
01:06:47,689 --> 01:06:49,827
Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged
with a number of crimes.

1105
01:06:49,896 --> 01:06:52,449
Why wasn’t he charged with firing
at the enemy without cause?

1106
01:06:54,152 --> 01:06:56,936
There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge.

1107
01:06:57,002 --> 01:06:58,856
Thank you.

1108
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,922
Mr. McGuire, I don't understand
what you mean when you say...

1109
01:07:01,994 --> 01:07:04,482
'There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge.'

1110
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,757
You had William Santiago's letter.

1111
01:07:07,977 --> 01:07:09,833
Santiago was the only eyewitness.

1112
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:13,193
I never had the chance to interview him,
so I don't know what he saw.

1113
01:07:13,258 --> 01:07:16,193
And now we'll never know,
will we, Mr. McGuire?

1114
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:22,569
- No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

1115
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,029
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker,
Marine Barracks...

1116
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:32,231
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

1117
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,596
Corporal, were you present at a meeting
that Lieutenant Kendrick held...

1118
01:07:35,661 --> 01:07:38,890
on the afternoon of September 6
with the members of the Second Platoon?

1119
01:07:38,956 --> 01:07:40,201
Yes, sir.

1120
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,756
Would you tell the court
the substance of that meeting?

1121
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:45,862
Lieutenant Kendrick told us
we had an informer in our group--

1122
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:48,518
that Private Santiago had gone
outside the chain of command...

1123
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:51,404
and reported to the N.I.S.
on a member of our platoon.

1124
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:55,213
Did that make you mad?
You can tell the truth, Corporal.

1125
01:07:55,278 --> 01:07:57,034
- Did it make you mad?
- Yes, sir.

1126
01:07:57,102 --> 01:07:58,280
How mad?

1127
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:02,028
Private Santiago betrayed a code
we believe in very deeply, sir.

1128
01:08:02,094 --> 01:08:04,963
- Were the other squad members angry?
- Object. Speculation.

1129
01:08:05,038 --> 01:08:07,143
- Were Dawson and Downey?
- Is the government counsel...

1130
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:11,591
honestly asking the witness to testify
as to how my clients felt?

1131
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:13,518
Sustained.

1132
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,076
Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick
leave a standing order at that meeting?

1133
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:21,159
- Yes, sir.
- What was it?

1134
01:08:22,863 --> 01:08:26,726
Well, it was clear that he didn't want
us taking matters into our own hands.

1135
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,709
What was the order?

1136
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:33,361
Sir, he said Santiago
wasn't to be touched.

1137
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,392
Your witness.

1138
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,335
Corporal Hammaker, were you
in Dawson and Downey's barracks...

1139
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,166
five minutes after this meeting?

1140
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:42,728
No, sir.

1141
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:45,354
Thanks.
I have no more questions.

1142
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:47,401
The witness is excused.

1143
01:08:51,091 --> 01:08:53,294
The government calls
Corporal Raymond Thomas.

1144
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:56,462
I understand Captain Ross is planning
on calling all the other members...

1145
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:59,051
of Rifle Security Company Windward
to testify.

1146
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:01,229
In light of the defense Lieutenant
Kaffee is planning to mount...

1147
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,074
the explicit instructions of a platoon
leader seems particularly relevant.

1148
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:07,562
The defense is willing to concede
that all 22 witnesses...

1149
01:09:07,636 --> 01:09:09,840
will testify substantially
as Corporal Hammaker did...

1150
01:09:09,908 --> 01:09:12,177
if the government is willing to concede
that none of them...

1151
01:09:12,244 --> 01:09:15,724
were in Dawson and Downey's room
at 16:20 on September 6.

1152
01:09:15,796 --> 01:09:17,652
Captain?

1153
01:09:17,717 --> 01:09:20,084
The government will stipulate.

1154
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:23,946
Then we'll adjourn for the day.
You can call your next witness tomorrow.

1155
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:25,877
All rise.

1156
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,741
I want to go over the doctor again.

1157
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:41,555
- We're taking the right approach.
- We've been over this already.

1158
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:45,071
Listen to me. 3:00-- Stone says
he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

1159
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,689
Then he meets with Jessup,
and at 5:00 he says it was poison?

1160
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,378
- The doctor's not telling the truth.
- Oh, that's a relief!.

1161
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:54,415
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use
the 'liar, liar, pants on fire' defense.

1162
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:59,124
We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have, okay?

1163
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:12,562
Private Santiago was admitted
to the E.R. at0012...

1164
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:16,016
and he was pronounced dead
at 0037.

1165
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:19,156
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

1166
01:10:19,226 --> 01:10:22,226
If the muscles and other cells
of the body burn sugar...

1167
01:10:22,298 --> 01:10:25,049
instead of oxygen,
lactic acid is produced.

1168
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:28,410
That lactic acid is what caused
Santiago's lungs to bleed.

1169
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:31,290
Normally, how long does it take
for the muscles and other cells...

1170
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:33,690
to begin burning sugar
instead of oxygen?

1171
01:10:33,755 --> 01:10:36,210
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1172
01:10:36,283 --> 01:10:39,862
And what caused this process
to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?

1173
01:10:39,932 --> 01:10:42,005
An ingested poison of some kind.

1174
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:45,010
Your Honor, we object at this point.
The witness is speculating.

1175
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:47,059
Commander Stone is an expert
medical witness.

1176
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:49,499
In this courtroom, his opinion
is not considered speculation.

1177
01:10:49,564 --> 01:10:52,433
Commander Stone is an internist,
not a criminologist.

1178
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:54,964
The medical facts here
are ultimately inconclusive.

1179
01:10:55,037 --> 01:10:58,583
A point I'm confident you’ll illustrate
to the court under cross-examination.

1180
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:01,687
So I'm sure you won't mind
if his opinion is admitted now.

1181
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,449
Not at all, sir.

1182
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:09,848
Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago
die of poisoning?

1183
01:11:09,918 --> 01:11:11,543
Absolutely.

1184
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:15,543
You're aware that the lab and coroner's
report show no traces of poison?

1185
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:18,037
- Yes, I am.
- Then how do you justify--

1186
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:20,958
There are literally dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectable...

1187
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:23,577
both in the human body
and on a fabric.

1188
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:27,161
The nature of the acidosis
is the compelling factor on this issue.

1189
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,822
Thank you, sir.

1190
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,876
Commander, is it possible for a person
to have an affliction--

1191
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:39,135
some sort of condition-- which might
speed up the process of acidosis?

1192
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,549
Commander, is it possible?

1193
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:45,406
It's possible.

1194
01:11:45,474 --> 01:11:47,775
What might some of those
conditions be?

1195
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:51,190
If a person had a coronary disorder...

1196
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,200
or a cerebral disorder,
the process would be more rapid.

1197
01:11:54,274 --> 01:11:58,137
If had a coronary condition and
a clean rag was placed in my mouth...

1198
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:01,823
and the rag was pushed too far down,
is it possible that my cells...

1199
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,541
would continue burning sugar
after the rag was taken out?

1200
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,392
It would have to be
a very serious condition.

1201
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:09,630
Is it possible to have
a serious coronary condition...

1202
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:12,993
where the warning signals were so mild
as to escape a physician...

1203
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,482
during a routine medical exam?

1204
01:12:15,556 --> 01:12:18,687
Possibly. There would still
be symptoms, though.

1205
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:20,992
- What kind of symptoms?
- There are hundreds--

1206
01:12:21,059 --> 01:12:23,264
- Chest pains?
- Yes.

1207
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,187
- Shortness of breath?
- Yes.

1208
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:27,587
- Fatigue?
- Of course.

1209
01:12:32,966 --> 01:12:34,820
Doctor, is this your signature?

1210
01:12:36,389 --> 01:12:37,470
Yes, it is.

1211
01:12:38,182 --> 01:12:41,695
This is an order for Private Santiago
to be put on restrictive duty.

1212
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:45,541
Would you read your handwritten remarks
at the bottom of the page, please?

1213
01:12:45,606 --> 01:12:49,632
'Initial testing, negative.
Patient complains of chest pains...

1214
01:12:49,702 --> 01:12:51,775
shortness of breath and fatigue.

1215
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:55,425
Restricted from running distances
over five miles for one week.'

1216
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:01,534
Commander, isn't it possible
that Santiago had a serious condition...

1217
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:06,342
and it was that condition that caused
the accelerated chemical reaction?

1218
01:13:07,944 --> 01:13:09,505
It's not possible?

1219
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:14,335
I personally give each man
a thorough physical examination.

1220
01:13:14,408 --> 01:13:17,376
Private Santiago was given
a clean bill of health.

1221
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:19,904
That's why it had to be poison,
right, Commander?

1222
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:23,906
'Cause if you put a man with a serious
coronary condition on duty...

1223
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:26,311
and that man died
from a heart-related incident...

1224
01:13:26,377 --> 01:13:28,287
you'd have a lot to answer for,
wouldn’t you, Doctor?

1225
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:31,265
- Object! Move to strike.
- Sustained.

1226
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,400
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

1227
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:38,953
Dr. Stone, you've held
a medical license for 17 years.

1228
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:41,091
You're Board-certified
in internal medicine.

1229
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:46,499
You are chief of internal medicine
at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.

1230
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:51,241
In your professional medical opinion,
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1231
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:53,926
We renew our objection
to Commander Stone's testimony...

1232
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,035
and ask that it be stricken
from the record.

1233
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:59,883
We further ask the court members to lend
no weight to this witness's testimony.

1234
01:13:59,948 --> 01:14:01,541
The objection is overruled.

1235
01:14:01,613 --> 01:14:05,541
The defense strenuously objects
and requests an 802 conference...

1236
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:09,574
so that His Honor might have a chance
to hear discussion before ruling.

1237
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:12,994
The objection of the defense
has been heard and overruled.

1238
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:15,655
- Move to reconsider.
- Your objection is noted.

1239
01:14:15,725 --> 01:14:19,467
The witness is an expert,
and the court will hear his opinion!

1240
01:14:23,598 --> 01:14:28,235
Dr. Stone, in your expert,
professional opinion...

1241
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,921
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1242
01:14:30,991 --> 01:14:32,878
Yes.

1243
01:14:32,943 --> 01:14:36,522
Thank you, sir.
I have no more questions.

1244
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:38,598
Commander, you may step down.

1245
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,019
Please the court, while we reserve
the right to call rebuttal witnesses...

1246
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:48,779
the government rests.

1247
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:52,297
We'll stand in recess until 1000,
Monday the 19th...

1248
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:55,664
at which time, the defense
will call its first witness.

1249
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,584
All rise.

1250
01:15:06,322 --> 01:15:08,362
'I strenuously object'?

1251
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:12,492
Is that how it works?
'Objection overruled.'

1252
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:14,635
' No, no. I strenuously object.'

1253
01:15:14,707 --> 01:15:18,023
'Oh, well, if you strenuously object,
then I should take time to reconsider.'

1254
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,626
I got it on the record.

1255
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,805
You also got the court members
thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1256
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:24,461
You object once, so they can hear us say
he's not a criminologist.

1257
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:28,012
You keep after it, and suddenly it looks
like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1258
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:31,051
It's the difference between paper law
and trial law.

1259
01:15:31,124 --> 01:15:33,490
You even had the judge saying
Stone was an expert!

1260
01:15:33,556 --> 01:15:36,306
She made a mistake.
Let's not relive it.

1261
01:15:37,974 --> 01:15:41,388
I'm gonna go call my wife.
I'll see you tonight.

1262
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:45,747
Why do you hate them so much?

1263
01:15:45,813 --> 01:15:48,180
They beat up on a weakling.
That's all they did.

1264
01:15:48,245 --> 01:15:51,148
The rest of this is just
smoke-filled coffeehouse crap.

1265
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:54,221
They tortured and tormented
a weaker kid!

1266
01:15:54,294 --> 01:15:56,236
They didn't like him,
so they killed him.

1267
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:59,093
And why? Because
he couldn't run very fast!

1268
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:02,671
All right.
Everybody take the night off.

1269
01:16:02,742 --> 01:16:04,597
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1270
01:16:04,662 --> 01:16:07,313
We've been working 20 hours a day
for three and half weeks straight.

1271
01:16:07,383 --> 01:16:10,612
Just take the night off.
Go see your wife, your daughter.

1272
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,751
Jo, go do...

1273
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,423
whatever it is you do
when you're not here.

1274
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:20,081
- What day is tomorrow?
- Saturday.

1275
01:16:20,152 --> 01:16:22,007
We start at 10:00.

1276
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,084
Why do you like them so much?

1277
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,258
'Cause they stand on a wall....

1278
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:38,388
and they say, ' Nothing's gonna hurt you
tonight, not on my watch.'

1279
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:46,006
Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

1280
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:54,837
1 and 2 with two out.
And a line drive to left center.

1281
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:58,005
Kirby racing.
He won’t get there.

1282
01:16:58,075 --> 01:17:01,075
And rounding third is Cal Ripken...

1283
01:17:01,148 --> 01:17:04,181
and the Twins' streak is over.

1284
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,872
One strike away, and Andy Milligan
feels right now like Hulk Hogan.

1285
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:16,884
I'm sorry to bother you.
I should've called first.

1286
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:21,148
No, I was just watching
a ball game. Come on in.

1287
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:40,692
I was wondering if-- How you’d feel
about my taking you to dinner tonight?

1288
01:17:40,766 --> 01:17:43,636
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- No.

1289
01:17:43,711 --> 01:17:45,653
Sounded like you
were asking me on a date.

1290
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,629
I've been asked out on dates before,
and that's what it sounded like.

1291
01:17:49,856 --> 01:17:51,929
Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

1292
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:02,391
My third case was
a drunk and disorderly.

1293
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:06,174
It lasted nine weeks. I rounded up
31 people from the bar that night.

1294
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,536
Nine weeks on a D and D?
What was the prosecutor offering?

1295
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,456
Fifteen days.

1296
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:15,739
You sure hustled
the shit out of him.

1297
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,079
Well, after that
they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1298
01:18:18,146 --> 01:18:20,056
- Tough to blame them.
- Where I have earned...

1299
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:23,675
two meritorious service medals
and two letters of commendation.

1300
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:26,649
Why are you always giving me
your resume?

1301
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:32,226
Because I want you to think
I'm a good lawyer.

1302
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,233
I do.

1303
01:18:34,307 --> 01:18:36,413
No, you don't.

1304
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,886
I think you’re an exceptional lawyer.

1305
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:47,101
I watch the court members.
They respond to you. They like you.

1306
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:49,692
I see you convincing them,
and I think Dawson and Downey...

1307
01:18:49,764 --> 01:18:52,318
are gonna end up
owing their lives to you.

1308
01:18:55,812 --> 01:18:57,668
Jo, I think--

1309
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,813
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1310
01:19:02,885 --> 01:19:06,115
Ross's opening statement--
it was all true.

1311
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:08,833
Let's pretend for a minute
that it would actually matter...

1312
01:19:08,902 --> 01:19:10,909
that the guys
were given an order.

1313
01:19:10,982 --> 01:19:13,503
I can't prove it ever happened.

1314
01:19:13,575 --> 01:19:15,964
We'll keep doing what we're doing
and we'll put on a show...

1315
01:19:16,038 --> 01:19:21,221
but all we have is the testimony
of two people accused of murder.

1316
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:24,164
We'll find Markinson.

1317
01:19:24,232 --> 01:19:28,542
Jo, we're gonna lose,
and we're gonna lose huge.

1318
01:19:31,624 --> 01:19:34,789
Corporal Jeffrey Owen Barnes,
Marine Barracks Windward...

1319
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:36,799
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1320
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:41,030
Corporal Barnes, name some reasons
why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1321
01:19:41,097 --> 01:19:44,359
Being late for platoon
or company meetings.

1322
01:19:44,425 --> 01:19:48,167
Keeping his barracks in disorder.
Falling back on a run.

1323
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:50,623
- Have you ever received a Code Red?
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,112
We were doing seven-man assault drills,
and my weapon slipped.

1325
01:19:54,185 --> 01:19:57,350
It was 'cause it was over 100 degrees,
and my palms were sweaty...

1326
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:00,932
and I'd forgotten to use the resin
like we were taught.

1327
01:20:01,002 --> 01:20:02,464
What happened?

1328
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:05,474
That night, the guys in my squad
threw a blanket over me...

1329
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:08,264
took turns punching me in the arm
for five minutes...

1330
01:20:08,331 --> 01:20:10,818
then they poured glue on my hands.

1331
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:14,437
And it worked too, 'cause
I ain't never dropped my weapon since.

1332
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:18,786
Was Private Santiago ever late
for platoon meetings?

1333
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,973
Yes, sir.

1334
01:20:20,044 --> 01:20:22,313
- Was his barracks ever in disorder?
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,617
- Did he ever fall back on a run?
- All the time, sir.

1336
01:20:24,685 --> 01:20:29,835
Did he ever, prior to the night
of September 6, receive a Code Red?

1337
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,329
No, sir.

1338
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:33,379
- Never?
- No, sir.

1339
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,259
You got a Code Red
'cause your palms were sweaty.

1340
01:20:37,326 --> 01:20:41,220
Why didn't Santiago,
this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1341
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,580
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

1342
01:20:45,646 --> 01:20:47,621
Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1343
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:51,142
The guys talked tough about Santiago,
but they wouldn’t go near him.

1344
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:53,070
They were too afraid of Dawson.

1345
01:20:53,135 --> 01:20:55,502
Object.
The witness is speculating.

1346
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:59,080
I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever
want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1347
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:01,038
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn’t you?

1348
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:03,787
'Cause Dawson
would kick my butt, sir.

1349
01:21:03,855 --> 01:21:07,630
Good enough. Captain Ross
is gonna ask you some questions now.

1350
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,799
Corporal Barnes...

1351
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,598
I hold here the Marine Outline
for Recruit Training.

1352
01:21:14,673 --> 01:21:16,363
- Are you familiar with this book?
- Yes, sir.

1353
01:21:16,432 --> 01:21:18,025
- Have you read it?
- Yes, sir.

1354
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:21,262
Would you turn to the chapter
that deals with Code Reds, please?

1355
01:21:23,729 --> 01:21:27,145
Just flip to the page of the book
that discusses Code Reds.

1356
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:32,646
Well, you see, sir, Code Red
is a term that we use.

1357
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,348
Just down in Gitmo--

1358
01:21:34,419 --> 01:21:36,426
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1359
01:21:39,602 --> 01:21:43,858
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle
Security Company, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1360
01:21:43,923 --> 01:21:47,752
I assume we'll find the term Code Red
and its definition in that book.

1361
01:21:47,826 --> 01:21:49,616
No, sir.

1362
01:21:49,683 --> 01:21:51,407
Corporal Barnes, I'm a Marine.

1363
01:21:51,476 --> 01:21:55,437
Is there no book, no manual or pamphlet,
no set of orders or regulations...

1364
01:21:55,508 --> 01:21:59,851
that lets me know that as a Marine one
of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1365
01:21:59,925 --> 01:22:03,219
No, sir.
No book, sir.

1366
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:05,139
No further questions.

1367
01:22:07,124 --> 01:22:09,580
Corporal, would you turn
to the page in this book....

1368
01:22:09,653 --> 01:22:11,956
that says where
the mess hall is, please?

1369
01:22:12,022 --> 01:22:14,989
Lieutenant Kaffee,
that's not in the book, sir.

1370
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:19,285
You mean to say in all your time
at Gitmo you've never had a meal?

1371
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,383
No, sir.
Three squares a day, sir.

1372
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:24,685
I don't understand.

1373
01:22:24,757 --> 01:22:27,693
How did you know where the mess hall was
if it’s not in this book?

1374
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,233
Well, I guess I just followed the crowd
at chow time, sir.

1375
01:22:34,168 --> 01:22:36,273
No more questions.

1376
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:39,856
- Corporal Barnes, you may step down.
- Thank you, sir.

1377
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,629
7:00 tonight we'll do
a final Kendrick review.

1378
01:22:47,704 --> 01:22:50,487
I want to slam-dunk this guy.

1379
01:23:01,465 --> 01:23:02,959
Hey, Luther.

1380
01:23:03,033 --> 01:23:05,424
Admiral, how's
the big case going?

1381
01:23:05,498 --> 01:23:07,386
Nose to the grindstone.

1382
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,483
- No flies on you.
- A rolling stone gathers no moss.

1383
01:23:10,554 --> 01:23:12,976
Well, it ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

1384
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:15,320
You can say that again.

1385
01:23:15,386 --> 01:23:18,551
- It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
- Till the fat lady sings.

1386
01:23:19,611 --> 01:23:21,466
Walked into that one.

1387
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,159
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1388
01:23:35,229 --> 01:23:37,781
You left the door unlocked.

1389
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:40,788
- You scared the shit out of me.
-Just keep driving.

1390
01:23:40,861 --> 01:23:42,716
Are you aware
you're under subpoena?

1391
01:23:42,781 --> 01:23:46,425
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives
of two Marines are in your hands.

1392
01:23:46,493 --> 01:23:48,567
If there was something
I could do about that, I would.

1393
01:23:48,638 --> 01:23:50,939
But since I can't,
all I can do is help you.

1394
01:23:51,005 --> 01:23:53,242
- What do you know?
- I know everything.

1395
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,449
- Was it a Code Red?
- Yes.

1396
01:23:55,518 --> 01:23:57,558
- Did Kendrick give the order?
- Yes.

1397
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,444
- Did you witness it?
- I didn't need to.

1398
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:03,031
Then how do you know?
You know shit.

1399
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:05,372
He was never gonna be transferred
off that base.

1400
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:14,235
Jessup was gonna keep him on the base.
He said he wanted him trained.

1401
01:24:14,303 --> 01:24:16,790
- The transfer order has your signature.
- Yeah, I know.

1402
01:24:16,863 --> 01:24:20,662
I signed it the morning you arrived
in Cuba, five days after Santiago died.

1403
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,844
I'm gonna get you a deal, some kind
of immunity with the prosecutor.

1404
01:24:26,913 --> 01:24:31,223
In about four days, you'll appear
as a witness and tell what you know.

1405
01:24:31,296 --> 01:24:34,777
I'm gonna check you into a motel.
We are gonna start from the beginning.

1406
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:38,843
I don't want a deal,
and I don't want immunity.

1407
01:24:38,913 --> 01:24:43,933
I want you to know that I'm proud
neither of what I've done or am doing.

1408
01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:48,067
- Where is he?
- The Downtown Lodge in Northeast.

1409
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:50,170
- I want him guarded.
- That's a good idea.

1410
01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:52,828
- My clearance code is 411527273.
- Clearance code?

1411
01:24:52,899 --> 01:24:55,452
- Thank you.
- Do you have a clearance code?

1412
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,564
This is Jo Galloway.
I need to secure a witness.

1413
01:24:57,636 --> 01:25:00,483
Anyway, he also said that Jessup’s lying
about the transportation off the base.

1414
01:25:00,547 --> 01:25:03,231
Jessup said that 6:00 the next morning
was the first flight leaving.

1415
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,649
Markinson says there was a plane
that left seven hours earlier.

1416
01:25:06,724 --> 01:25:09,626
That was impressive. Did you hear
what I said about the flight?

1417
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:12,831
Sam, when a flight takes off,
there's a record kept, right?

1418
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,005
Yeah, you need the tower chief’s log
from Gitmo.

1419
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:18,078
- Get it.
- We're gonna win.

1420
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,419
We don't know who Markinson is.
We don't know what the logbook will say.

1421
01:25:20,486 --> 01:25:23,387
You just concentrate on Downey.
I'm gonna tell Ross where we are.

1422
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:33,509
Nice work today.
Redirect on Barnes.

1423
01:25:33,574 --> 01:25:37,536
- I have Markinson.
- Where is he?

1424
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:41,764
Motel room in Northeast with
six Federal Marshalls outside his door.

1425
01:25:41,831 --> 01:25:43,903
The transfer that Markinson
signed is phony.

1426
01:25:43,975 --> 01:25:46,692
Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a.m.
flight was the first available is a lie.

1427
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:49,094
We're checking the tower chief’s log.
I'd like a beer, please.

1428
01:25:49,159 --> 01:25:53,415
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

1429
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,132
All right, I have
an obligation to tell you...

1430
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:59,168
that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessup
of any crime without proper evidence...

1431
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:01,891
you'll be subject to a court-martial
for professional misconduct.

1432
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,271
That's something that'll be stapled to
every job application you ever fill out.

1433
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:11,297
Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny.
He's a crazy man.

1434
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,850
I'm not saying this to intimidate you.
I'm being your lawyer here.

1435
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:18,850
Thanks, Jack. And I think the fucking
bunch of you are certifiably insane.

1436
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:21,158
Your code of honor makes me
want to beat the shit out of somebody.

1437
01:26:21,226 --> 01:26:24,937
Don't lump me in with them
just because we wear the same uniform.

1438
01:26:25,003 --> 01:26:27,937
I'm your friend, and I don't think
your clients belong in jail...

1439
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,865
but I don't get
to make that decision.

1440
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:34,154
I represent the United States government
without passion or prejudice.

1441
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:37,415
- My client has a case.
- Here you go.

1442
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,783
I want you to acknowledge that
the judge advocate has made you aware...

1443
01:26:43,852 --> 01:26:46,601
of the possible consequences involved
in accusing a Marine officer...

1444
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,676
of a felony
without proper evidence.

1445
01:26:48,749 --> 01:26:51,302
I've been so advised.

1446
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:58,024
You got bullied
into that courtroom, Danny.

1447
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:01,803
By everyone.
By Dawson, by Galloway.

1448
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:04,324
Shit, I practically dared you.

1449
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:08,836
You got bullied into that courtroom
by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1450
01:27:14,702 --> 01:27:17,703
You're a lousy fucking
softball player, Jack!

1451
01:27:20,943 --> 01:27:24,937
Your boys are going down, Danny.
I can't stop it anymore.

1452
01:27:30,032 --> 01:27:33,229
Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion,
was Private Santiago a good Marine?

1453
01:27:33,296 --> 01:27:35,303
I'd say he was about average.

1454
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:38,638
You signed three proficiency
and conduct reports on Santiago.

1455
01:27:38,704 --> 01:27:42,217
On all three reports, you indicate
a rating of below average.

1456
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:49,233
Yes, Private Santiago
was below average.

1457
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:52,910
I did not see the need
to trample on a man's grave.

1458
01:27:52,978 --> 01:27:55,051
We appreciate that,
but you’re under oath now.

1459
01:27:55,122 --> 01:27:57,642
Unpleasant as it may be,
we'd all just as soon hear the truth.

1460
01:27:57,714 --> 01:27:59,502
I'm aware of my oath.

1461
01:27:59,569 --> 01:28:04,328
These are the last three pro-con reports
you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1462
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,258
Dawson received
two marks of exceptional...

1463
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:10,514
but on this most recent report of June 9
he received a rating of below average.

1464
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:14,408
- I'd like to discuss this last report.
- That would be fine.

1465
01:28:14,483 --> 01:28:17,997
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after
the school of infantry was perfect.

1466
01:28:18,068 --> 01:28:20,882
Over half that class has since
been promoted to full corporal...

1467
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:23,152
while Dawson has remained
a lance corporal.

1468
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:26,090
Was Dawson's promotion held up
because of this last report?

1469
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:28,020
I'm sure it was.

1470
01:28:28,085 --> 01:28:30,954
Do you recall why Dawson was given
such a poor grade on this report?

1471
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:32,273
I'm sure I don't.

1472
01:28:32,342 --> 01:28:36,018
I have many men in my charge.
I write many reports.

1473
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:41,618
Lieutenant, do you recall an incident
involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...

1474
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:44,304
who'd been found stealing liquor
from the Officers' Club?

1475
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:46,197
Yes, I do.

1476
01:28:46,263 --> 01:28:48,597
Did you report Private Bell
to proper authorities?

1477
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:52,495
I have two books at my bedside--

1478
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:55,437
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct
and The King James Bible.

1479
01:28:55,511 --> 01:28:57,998
The only proper authorities I'm aware of
are my commanding officer...

1480
01:28:58,071 --> 01:29:00,625
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup
and the Lord our God.

1481
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:04,624
At your request, Lieutenant Kendrick,
I can have the record reflect...

1482
01:29:04,696 --> 01:29:07,249
your lack of acknowledgement
of this court as a proper authority.

1483
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,038
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

1484
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:12,111
Watch yourself, counselor.

1485
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:14,769
Did you report Private Bell
to your superiors?

1486
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,492
I remember thinking very highly
of Private Bell--

1487
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,595
not wanting to see his record tarnished
by a formal charge.

1488
01:29:21,722 --> 01:29:24,472
You preferred it be handled
within the unit?

1489
01:29:26,138 --> 01:29:27,992
Yes, I most certainly did.

1490
01:29:29,177 --> 01:29:32,277
- Do you know what a Code Red is?
- Yes, I do.

1491
01:29:32,346 --> 01:29:35,412
- Have you ever ordered a Code Red?
- No, I have not.

1492
01:29:35,482 --> 01:29:38,451
Did you order Dawson and two other men
to make sure that Private Bell...

1493
01:29:38,523 --> 01:29:43,738
received no food or drink, except water,
for a period of seven days?

1494
01:29:43,803 --> 01:29:46,008
That is a distortion
of the truth, Lieutenant.

1495
01:29:46,076 --> 01:29:48,247
Private Bell was placed
on barracks restriction.

1496
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:51,282
He was given water and vitamin
supplements, and I can assure you...

1497
01:29:51,355 --> 01:29:55,153
at no time
was his health in danger.

1498
01:29:55,228 --> 01:29:57,846
I'm sure it was lovely
for Private Bell.

1499
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,470
But you did order
the barracks restriction, didn’t you?

1500
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:04,534
- You did order the denial of food?
- Yes, I did.

1501
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:08,250
Wouldn't this form of discipline
be considered a Code Red?

1502
01:30:10,942 --> 01:30:14,652
If called the other 478 Marines
at Guantanamo Bay to testify...

1503
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:16,726
would they consider it
a Code Red?

1504
01:30:16,799 --> 01:30:20,595
The witness can't possibly testify
as to what 478 other men would say.

1505
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:24,380
We object to this entire line
of questioning. It's argumentative...

1506
01:30:24,446 --> 01:30:26,715
and irrelevant badgering
of the witness.

1507
01:30:26,782 --> 01:30:29,303
The government's objection
is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1508
01:30:29,374 --> 01:30:32,376
and I would remind you that you’re now
questioning a Marine officer...

1509
01:30:32,448 --> 01:30:34,488
with an impeccable service record.

1510
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,054
Thank you, Your Honor.

1511
01:30:37,087 --> 01:30:40,732
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating
of below average on this last report...

1512
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,550
because you learned he'd been sneaking
food to Private Bell?

1513
01:30:43,616 --> 01:30:46,748
- Object!
- Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1514
01:30:48,352 --> 01:30:51,866
Lance Corporal Dawson
was given a below average rating...

1515
01:30:52,802 --> 01:30:55,168
because he had committed a crime.

1516
01:30:55,233 --> 01:30:58,364
A crime?
What crime did he commit?

1517
01:31:02,114 --> 01:31:07,646
Dawson brought a hungry guy some food.
What crime did he commit?

1518
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:11,065
He disobeyed an order.

1519
01:31:11,139 --> 01:31:13,527
And because he exercised
his own set of values...

1520
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:16,472
because he made a decision
about the welfare of a Marine...

1521
01:31:16,547 --> 01:31:20,027
that was in conflict with your order,
he was punished, is that right?

1522
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,482
Lance Corporal Dawson
disobeyed an order.

1523
01:31:23,555 --> 01:31:25,976
Yeah, but it wasn't
a real order, was it?

1524
01:31:26,051 --> 01:31:28,157
After all, it's peacetime.

1525
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:31,360
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill
or advance on a beachhead.

1526
01:31:31,429 --> 01:31:35,684
I mean, surely a Marine
of Dawson's intelligence...

1527
01:31:35,748 --> 01:31:38,716
can be trusted to determine on his own
which are the important orders...

1528
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:42,531
and which orders might, say,
be morally questionable?

1529
01:31:45,637 --> 01:31:47,361
Can he?

1530
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:50,943
Can Dawson determine on his own
which orders he's going to follow?

1531
01:31:51,014 --> 01:31:52,640
No, he cannot.

1532
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:55,329
A lesson he learned
after the Curtis Bell incident, right?

1533
01:31:55,398 --> 01:31:58,147
- I would think so.
- You know so, don’t you?

1534
01:31:58,214 --> 01:31:59,841
- Object!
- Sustained.

1535
01:32:01,799 --> 01:32:04,613
Lieutenant Kendrick,
one final question.

1536
01:32:05,863 --> 01:32:09,027
If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red--

1537
01:32:09,096 --> 01:32:13,154
- I specifically ordered those men--
- Would he disobey you again?

1538
01:32:13,224 --> 01:32:17,119
- Lieutenant, don't answer that!
- You don't have to. I'm through.

1539
01:32:17,192 --> 01:32:20,672
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order
Lance Corporal Dawson...

1540
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:24,542
and Private Downey
to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?

1541
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:30,473
- No, I did not.
- Thank you.

1542
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:36,354
What's the word?

1543
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:40,516
I got the tower chief’s log from that
night. Jessup’s telling the truth.

1544
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:44,646
- 6:00 a.m. flight was the first plane.
- Let me see this.

1545
01:32:54,411 --> 01:32:57,160
- Working late tonight?
- Oh, yeah.

1546
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:04,902
There wasn't a flight at00.
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1547
01:33:04,972 --> 01:33:08,071
The first flight stateside
left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.

1548
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:11,915
It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
at a few minutes past 2:00.

1549
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:15,047
Really? Then why isn't it
listed in the tower chief’s log?

1550
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:18,312
Jessup.

1551
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,716
What are you telling me?
He fixed the logbook?

1552
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:26,532
Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't
take off, but I can prove one landed.

1553
01:33:26,605 --> 01:33:28,612
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1554
01:33:28,685 --> 01:33:31,533
You're not gonna find anything
in the Andrews logbook, either.

1555
01:33:31,599 --> 01:33:33,453
He can make
an entire flight disappear?

1556
01:33:33,518 --> 01:33:37,829
Jessup is about to be appointed director
of operations for the Security Council.

1557
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:41,733
You don't get to that position without
knowing how to sidestep some land mines.

1558
01:33:41,807 --> 01:33:44,557
He's not gonna be able
to sidestep you.

1559
01:33:44,624 --> 01:33:46,926
You don't still intend
to put me on the stand?

1560
01:33:46,992 --> 01:33:49,806
Thursday morning, 10:00.

1561
01:33:54,064 --> 01:33:57,741
There's gotta be someone
who can testify to the flight.

1562
01:33:57,809 --> 01:34:00,908
This isn't TWA.
There isn't a regular flight schedule.

1563
01:34:00,977 --> 01:34:03,660
Do you have any idea how many planes
take off and land every day?

1564
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:07,025
A ground crew kid won't remember
a flight that landed four weeks ago.

1565
01:34:07,089 --> 01:34:10,122
- How do you know if you don't check?
- Forget the flight!

1566
01:34:10,193 --> 01:34:13,838
Markinson will testify that Jessup
refused to transfer Santiago.

1567
01:34:13,906 --> 01:34:16,361
He'll testify to the forged transfer,
and that'll be enough.

1568
01:34:16,434 --> 01:34:18,856
That and Downey's testimony
really ought to be enough.

1569
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:27,944
Why did you go into Santiago's room
on the night of the 6th?

1570
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:31,118
To give Private Santiago
a Code Red, ma'am.

1571
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:33,292
Why did you give him a Code Red?

1572
01:34:33,363 --> 01:34:36,659
I was ordered to give him a Code Red
by the platoon commander...

1573
01:34:36,725 --> 01:34:40,783
of Rifle Security Company Windward,
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1574
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:44,242
You're gonna do fine.

1575
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:48,169
You think they'll let us go back
to our platoon soon, ma'am?

1576
01:34:49,556 --> 01:34:51,379
Absolutely.

1577
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:56,788
Do you remember the order of questions?
Are you sure?

1578
01:34:56,853 --> 01:34:59,668
And we'll use small words, 'cause he
gets rattled if he doesn't understand.

1579
01:34:59,734 --> 01:35:02,516
- I'm just saying go slow.
- I'm gonna go slow.

1580
01:35:02,582 --> 01:35:05,396
And get him off
as fast as you can.

1581
01:35:05,461 --> 01:35:08,277
What?
It's gonna be fine.

1582
01:35:10,614 --> 01:35:12,502
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago...

1583
01:35:13,783 --> 01:35:16,150
I was William's executive officer.

1584
01:35:16,215 --> 01:35:19,564
I knew your son vaguely,
which is to say I knew his name.

1585
01:35:20,598 --> 01:35:22,509
In a matter of time,
the trial of the two men...

1586
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:25,169
charged with your son's death
will be concluded...

1587
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,411
and seven men and two women
whom you've never met...

1588
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:31,310
will try to offer you an explanation
as to why William is dead.

1589
01:35:31,385 --> 01:35:34,865
For my part, I've done as much as I can
to bring the truth to light.

1590
01:35:35,704 --> 01:35:37,166
And the truth is this--

1591
01:35:37,241 --> 01:35:39,696
Your son is dead for only one reason--

1592
01:35:39,769 --> 01:35:42,583
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1593
01:35:42,648 --> 01:35:46,872
Always, Lieutenant Colonel
Matthew Andrew Markinson...

1594
01:35:46,937 --> 01:35:48,366
United States Marine Corps.

1595
01:35:53,306 --> 01:35:56,688
Private, I want you
to tell us one last time.

1596
01:35:56,762 --> 01:36:02,360
Why did you go to Private Santiago's
room on the night of September 6?

1597
01:36:02,427 --> 01:36:04,728
A Code Red was ordered
by my platoon commander...

1598
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:07,032
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1599
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,271
Thank you.

1600
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,867
Your witness.

1601
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,333
Private, the week of2 September...

1602
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:20,753
the switch log has you down
at Post 39 until 1600.

1603
01:36:20,828 --> 01:36:21,973
Is that correct?

1604
01:36:22,044 --> 01:36:24,859
I'm sure it is, sir.
They keep that log pretty good.

1605
01:36:24,924 --> 01:36:28,373
How far is it from Post 39
to the Windward Barracks?

1606
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:31,762
Well, it's a ways, sir.
It's a hike.

1607
01:36:31,838 --> 01:36:34,554
About how far by Jeep?

1608
01:36:34,621 --> 01:36:37,850
About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.

1609
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,739
You ever had to walk it?

1610
01:36:39,806 --> 01:36:43,483
Yes, sir. That day, Friday.
The pickup private--

1611
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:46,486
That's what we call the guy
who drops us off and picks us up...

1612
01:36:46,559 --> 01:36:49,624
also 'cause he can get girls
in New York City.

1613
01:36:50,624 --> 01:36:52,696
The pickup private got a flat,
sir, right at 39.

1614
01:36:52,767 --> 01:36:55,483
He pulled up and, bam,
blowout with no spare.

1615
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:57,525
So we had to double-time it
back to the barracks.

1616
01:36:57,599 --> 01:37:01,145
And if it’s about ten or fifteen
minutes by Jeep, I'm guessing...

1617
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:04,150
it must be a good hour by foot,
am I right?

1618
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:07,192
Pickup and me did it
in 45 flat, sir.

1619
01:37:07,264 --> 01:37:08,638
Not bad.

1620
01:37:10,016 --> 01:37:13,312
You've said that your assault
on Private Santiago...

1621
01:37:13,378 --> 01:37:16,508
was a result of a order
that Lieutenant Kendrick gave you...

1622
01:37:16,577 --> 01:37:19,991
in your barracks room
at 1620, am I right?

1623
01:37:21,089 --> 01:37:22,617
Yes, sir.

1624
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:26,334
But you just said that you didn't
make it back to the barracks until 1645.

1625
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:32,763
Well, if you didn't make it back
to the barracks until 1645...

1626
01:37:32,834 --> 01:37:34,938
how could you be
in your room at 1620?

1627
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:38,622
Well, you see, sir,
there was a blowout--

1628
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:42,434
Did you ever actually hear
Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1629
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,158
Well, Hal said that--

1630
01:37:44,228 --> 01:37:46,649
Private, did you ever
actually hear...

1631
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:49,342
Lieutenant Kendrick
order a Code Red?

1632
01:37:51,044 --> 01:37:54,240
I'd like to request a recess
in order to confer with my client.

1633
01:37:54,307 --> 01:37:56,544
- Why did you go into Santiago's room?
- The witness has rights!

1634
01:37:56,612 --> 01:37:59,745
- The witness has been read his rights.
- The question will be repeated.

1635
01:37:59,814 --> 01:38:01,668
Why did you go
into Santiago's room?

1636
01:38:01,733 --> 01:38:05,029
Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

1637
01:38:05,094 --> 01:38:06,784
- Don't look at him!
- Hal!

1638
01:38:06,853 --> 01:38:08,708
Answer the captain's question!

1639
01:38:11,877 --> 01:38:14,114
Yes, Captain, I was given an order
by my squad leader...

1640
01:38:14,182 --> 01:38:17,378
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson,
United States Marine Corps...

1641
01:38:17,446 --> 01:38:18,657
and I followed it.

1642
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:40,801
Where do you think he is?

1643
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:45,635
As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

1644
01:38:45,704 --> 01:38:47,591
It doesn't matter that
he didn't hear it firsthand.

1645
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:50,592
He doesn't distinguish
between the two.

1646
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,805
Danny, I'm sorry.

1647
01:38:57,674 --> 01:38:59,168
Don't worry about it.

1648
01:38:59,242 --> 01:39:01,696
Sam and I were just talking about
how all we really have to do...

1649
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,520
is call some witnesses
who will talk about implied orders.

1650
01:39:04,587 --> 01:39:07,042
Maybe we can put Downey back
on the stand before we get to Dawson.

1651
01:39:07,786 --> 01:39:12,227
If we work at it, we can get Dawson
charged with the Kennedy assassination.

1652
01:39:15,404 --> 01:39:16,516
Are you drunk?

1653
01:39:17,355 --> 01:39:20,007
Pretty much.

1654
01:39:20,076 --> 01:39:22,312
Yeah.

1655
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,795
I'll put on a pot of coffee.
We've got a long night's work ahead.

1656
01:39:26,892 --> 01:39:29,193
She's gonna make coffee.

1657
01:39:30,284 --> 01:39:32,171
That's nice.

1658
01:39:35,949 --> 01:39:38,666
Downey wasn’t in his room.

1659
01:39:38,733 --> 01:39:40,555
Wasn't even there.

1660
01:39:41,934 --> 01:39:45,000
That was an important piece
of information, don’t you think?

1661
01:39:47,373 --> 01:39:51,499
Danny, it was a setback,
and I'm sorry.

1662
01:39:51,567 --> 01:39:54,152
But we fix it,
and move on to Markinson.

1663
01:39:55,822 --> 01:39:57,481
Markinson's dead.

1664
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:06,981
You really gotta hand it
to those Federal Marshals, boy.

1665
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:09,607
It's not like he hanged himself
by his shoelaces...

1666
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,200
or slashed his wrists
with a concealed butter knife.

1667
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:13,646
This guy...

1668
01:40:15,504 --> 01:40:19,017
got into full dress uniform,
stood in the middle of that room...

1669
01:40:19,088 --> 01:40:22,122
drew a nickel-plated pistol
from his holster...

1670
01:40:22,192 --> 01:40:24,494
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1671
01:40:28,241 --> 01:40:31,951
Anyway, since we seem to be out of
witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1672
01:40:32,017 --> 01:40:34,123
I still think we can win.

1673
01:40:36,082 --> 01:40:37,642
Maybe you should drink a little.

1674
01:40:37,714 --> 01:40:42,504
We'll go to Randolph in the morning and
make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.

1675
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:45,709
- Why would we want to do that?
- To subpoena Colonel Jessup.

1676
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:49,486
- What?
- Listen for a second. Hear me out.

1677
01:40:49,555 --> 01:40:51,497
I won't listen,
and I won't hear you out.

1678
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,774
Your passion is compelling, Jo.
It's also useless.

1679
01:40:53,843 --> 01:40:56,843
Louden Downey
needed a trial lawyer today.

1680
01:40:59,731 --> 01:41:01,357
You're chicken shit.

1681
01:41:01,427 --> 01:41:04,046
You're gonna use what happened today
as an excuse to give up.

1682
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,988
It's over.

1683
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,516
Why did you ask Jessup
for the transfer order?

1684
01:41:09,589 --> 01:41:12,110
- In Cuba. Why?
- What does it matter?

1685
01:41:12,182 --> 01:41:14,734
- I wanted the damn transfer order!
- Bullshit.

1686
01:41:14,805 --> 01:41:18,154
You could've gotten it by calling
any department at the Pentagon.

1687
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:22,768
You didn't want the transfer order.
You wanted to see Jessup’s reaction.

1688
01:41:22,837 --> 01:41:25,773
You had an instinct,
and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1689
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,661
Let's put Jessup on the stand
and end this thing!

1690
01:41:28,726 --> 01:41:32,719
What possible good could come
from putting Jessup on the stand?

1691
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:34,831
He told Kendrick
to order the Code Red.

1692
01:41:34,903 --> 01:41:38,797
He did? That's great!
Why didn’t you say so?

1693
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,042
And of course
you have proof of that!

1694
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:45,170
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick
the day they taught law at law school.

1695
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:47,606
You put him on the stand,
and you get it from him.

1696
01:41:47,671 --> 01:41:51,534
Oh, we get it from him!
Yes! No problem!

1697
01:41:51,608 --> 01:41:55,284
Colonel Jessup, isn't it true that
you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1698
01:41:55,351 --> 01:41:58,352
- Listen, we're all a little--
- I'm sorry. Your time's run out.

1699
01:41:58,424 --> 01:42:01,391
What do we have for the losers?
Well, for our defendants...

1700
01:42:01,465 --> 01:42:03,735
it's a lifetime
at exotic Fort Leavenworth.

1701
01:42:03,802 --> 01:42:06,649
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...

1702
01:42:06,713 --> 01:42:08,436
it's a court-martial!

1703
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:11,539
Yes, Johnny,
after falsely accusing...

1704
01:42:11,609 --> 01:42:13,846
a highly decorated Marine officer...

1705
01:42:13,914 --> 01:42:15,702
of conspiracy and perjury...

1706
01:42:15,769 --> 01:42:18,770
Lieutenant Kaffee will have
a long and prosperous career...

1707
01:42:18,842 --> 01:42:23,861
teaching typewriter maintenance
at the Rocco Clubo School for Women.

1708
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:26,866
Thank you for playing
'Should we or should we not...

1709
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:29,874
follow the advice
of the galactic ally stupid?'

1710
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:53,779
I'm sorry I lost
your set of steak knives.

1711
01:43:10,077 --> 01:43:11,933
Stop cleaning up.

1712
01:43:16,927 --> 01:43:18,783
Stop cleaning up.

1713
01:43:26,944 --> 01:43:29,759
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

1714
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:50,140
- Is your father proud of you?
- Don't do this to yourself.

1715
01:43:50,209 --> 01:43:51,867
I'll bet he is.

1716
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:55,840
I'll bet he bores the shit
out of the neighbors and relatives.

1717
01:43:55,907 --> 01:44:00,184
'Sam's made Law Review.
He's got a big case he's making.

1718
01:44:00,258 --> 01:44:03,259
He's arguing.
He's making an argument.'

1719
01:44:08,546 --> 01:44:12,607
I think my father would’ve enjoyed
seeing me graduate from law school.

1720
01:44:15,972 --> 01:44:18,558
I think he would've liked that
an awful lot.

1721
01:44:21,028 --> 01:44:23,875
Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper
about your father in college?

1722
01:44:24,901 --> 01:44:26,276
Yeah?

1723
01:44:26,341 --> 01:44:28,828
One of the best
trial lawyers ever.

1724
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:32,097
Yes, he was.

1725
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:34,370
If were Dawson and Downey
and I had a choice...

1726
01:44:34,438 --> 01:44:37,285
between you or your father
to represent me in this case...

1727
01:44:37,349 --> 01:44:40,220
I'd choose you any day of the week
and twice on Sunday.

1728
01:44:40,294 --> 01:44:43,556
You should've seen yourself
thunder away at Kendrick.

1729
01:44:46,534 --> 01:44:48,390
Would you put Jessup on the stand?

1730
01:44:51,975 --> 01:44:56,253
- Do you think my father would have?
- With the evidence we got?

1731
01:44:56,328 --> 01:44:59,110
Not in a million years.

1732
01:44:59,175 --> 01:45:02,405
But here's the thing-- and there's
really know way of getting around this--

1733
01:45:02,472 --> 01:45:06,628
Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg
are lead counsel for the defense...

1734
01:45:06,696 --> 01:45:09,698
in the matter of
U.S. v. Dawson and Downey.

1735
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,544
So there's really only one question--
What would you do?

1736
01:45:25,097 --> 01:45:28,993
Jo, get in the car.
Joanne, please get in the car.

1737
01:45:29,067 --> 01:45:30,441
Look--

1738
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:37,927
I apologize. I was angry.
I'm sorry about what I said.

1739
01:45:37,994 --> 01:45:40,483
I'm gonna put Jessup on the stand.

1740
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:01,509
What do you suggest we do?

1741
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,686
I say we hit Jessup
with the phony transfer order.

1742
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:05,612
What's a transfer order
without a witness?

1743
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,204
- We have a witness.
- A dead witness.

1744
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:10,061
In the hands of a lesser attorney,
that would be a problem.

1745
01:46:10,126 --> 01:46:12,492
Look at this. Last night
he's swimming in Jack Daniels...

1746
01:46:12,558 --> 01:46:15,176
and now he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

1747
01:46:15,246 --> 01:46:18,312
I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

1748
01:46:18,382 --> 01:46:22,725
Good. Jessup told Kendrick
to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.

1749
01:46:22,798 --> 01:46:24,938
Our clients followed the order.
The cover-up isn't our case.

1750
01:46:25,008 --> 01:46:29,448
To win, Jessup needs to tell the court
members that he ordered the Code Red.

1751
01:46:29,519 --> 01:46:33,097
- You think you can get him to say it?
- I think he wants to say it.

1752
01:46:33,167 --> 01:46:35,338
I think he's pissed off
that he's got to hide from us.

1753
01:46:35,408 --> 01:46:38,756
I think he wants to say that he made
a command decision, and that's the end.

1754
01:46:38,831 --> 01:46:41,647
He eats breakfast 300 yards away...

1755
01:46:41,713 --> 01:46:44,876
from 4,000 Cubans
that are trained to kill him.

1756
01:46:44,944 --> 01:46:46,920
No one's gonna tell him
how to run his unit.

1757
01:46:46,994 --> 01:46:49,743
Least of all the Harvard mouth
in his faggoty white uniform.

1758
01:46:49,809 --> 01:46:51,849
I need to shake him,
put him on the defensive...

1759
01:46:51,921 --> 01:46:54,507
and lead him right
where he's dying to go.

1760
01:46:54,578 --> 01:46:57,425
- That's it? That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

1761
01:46:57,489 --> 01:47:00,556
- How are you gonna do it?
- I have no idea.

1762
01:47:00,626 --> 01:47:02,667
- I need my bat.
- Your what?

1763
01:47:02,739 --> 01:47:04,910
I think better with my bat.
Where's my bat?

1764
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:08,295
- I put it in the closet.
- You put it in the closet?

1765
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:12,113
- I was tripping on it.
- Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1766
01:47:12,178 --> 01:47:15,822
- He thinks better with his bat?
- I can understand that.

1767
01:47:26,804 --> 01:47:29,586
Stay here.
I'm going to the office for a while.

1768
01:47:32,021 --> 01:47:34,541
He does think better with that bat.

1769
01:47:56,119 --> 01:47:59,315
Sam, I need you
to do something for me.

1770
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:05,490
- What's going on?
- Gotta go out to Andrews.

1771
01:48:28,376 --> 01:48:30,231
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1772
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:32,152
- Did he get the guys?
- Yeah.

1773
01:48:32,217 --> 01:48:35,087
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

1774
01:48:35,162 --> 01:48:37,300
Oh, yeah, sure.

1775
01:48:47,322 --> 01:48:48,915
How you feeling?

1776
01:48:50,266 --> 01:48:53,683
Well, I think Jessup’s
gonna have his hands full today.

1777
01:48:56,315 --> 01:48:58,170
Listen, Danny...

1778
01:48:59,291 --> 01:49:01,626
when you're out there today...

1779
01:49:01,692 --> 01:49:04,725
if you feel like
it's not gonna happen...

1780
01:49:04,796 --> 01:49:07,796
if you feel like
he's not gonna say it...

1781
01:49:07,868 --> 01:49:09,395
don't go for it.

1782
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:12,984
You could get in trouble.

1783
01:49:13,053 --> 01:49:15,060
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

1784
01:49:15,133 --> 01:49:17,589
and I'm telling you
you could get in a lot of trouble.

1785
01:49:17,662 --> 01:49:19,571
Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...

1786
01:49:19,646 --> 01:49:23,705
you're not suggesting
that I back off a material witness?

1787
01:49:23,774 --> 01:49:26,840
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1788
01:49:28,991 --> 01:49:30,584
All rise.

1789
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:38,101
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1790
01:49:43,487 --> 01:49:45,975
- Call your first witness.
- Where is he?

1791
01:49:46,047 --> 01:49:48,285
- He'll be here.
- Lieutenant.

1792
01:49:48,353 --> 01:49:49,946
Call your witness.

1793
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,905
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessup.

1794
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:17,727
Colonel Jessup, would you raise
your right hand please, sir?

1795
01:50:17,794 --> 01:50:21,110
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you will give in this court-martial...

1796
01:50:21,186 --> 01:50:24,483
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1797
01:50:24,547 --> 01:50:25,889
Yes, I do.

1798
01:50:25,955 --> 01:50:27,362
Have a seat please, sir.

1799
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:32,248
Would you state your name, rank
and current billet for the record, sir?

1800
01:50:32,323 --> 01:50:35,323
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup,
commanding officer...

1801
01:50:35,396 --> 01:50:38,560
Marine Ground Forces,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1802
01:50:38,628 --> 01:50:40,865
- Thank you, sir.
- He's not here.

1803
01:50:46,437 --> 01:50:49,852
Colonel, when you learned
of Santiago’s letter to the N.I.S....

1804
01:50:49,925 --> 01:50:52,925
you had a meeting
with your two senior officers.

1805
01:50:52,997 --> 01:50:54,972
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1806
01:50:55,046 --> 01:50:58,493
The platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

1807
01:50:58,565 --> 01:51:02,080
and the executive officer,
Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1808
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:03,612
Yes.

1809
01:51:03,687 --> 01:51:07,997
And at present Colonel Markinson
is dead. Is that right?

1810
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:11,965
Objection. I'd like to know just what
the defense counsel is implying.

1811
01:51:12,038 --> 01:51:15,334
I'm implying simply that at present
Colonel Markinson is not alive.

1812
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:18,977
Colonel Jessup doesn't need to appear
in court to confirm that information.

1813
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:21,382
I just wasn't sure the witness was aware
that two days ago...

1814
01:51:21,447 --> 01:51:24,132
the colonel took his own life
with a .45-caliber pistol.

1815
01:51:24,201 --> 01:51:26,567
The witness is aware,
the court is aware...

1816
01:51:26,632 --> 01:51:28,487
and now the court members
are aware.

1817
01:51:28,552 --> 01:51:31,968
We thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

1818
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:33,699
Move on, Lieutenant..

1819
01:51:33,768 --> 01:51:35,459
Yes, sir.

1820
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:39,011
Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick
an order at this meeting, right?

1821
01:51:39,082 --> 01:51:43,238
I told Kendrick to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1822
01:51:43,306 --> 01:51:46,121
And did you give an order
to Colonel Markinson as well?

1823
01:51:46,186 --> 01:51:51,488
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago
transferred off the base immediately.

1824
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:53,285
Why?

1825
01:51:53,355 --> 01:51:56,966
I felt his life might be in danger
once word of the letter got out.

1826
01:51:57,034 --> 01:51:58,409
Grave danger?

1827
01:51:58,474 --> 01:52:00,580
Is there another kind?

1828
01:52:04,043 --> 01:52:07,818
Colonel, we have the transfer order
that you and Markinson co-signed...

1829
01:52:07,884 --> 01:52:12,323
ordering that Santiago be on a flight
leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next day.

1830
01:52:12,395 --> 01:52:17,285
- Was that the first flight?
- The 0600 was the first flight.

1831
01:52:21,005 --> 01:52:24,235
You flew up to Washington this morning.
Is that right?

1832
01:52:24,301 --> 01:52:27,562
I notice you’re wearing your
class 'A' dress uniform in court today.

1833
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:30,695
- As are you, Lieutenant.
- Did you wear that on the plane?

1834
01:52:30,765 --> 01:52:33,448
Please the court, is this dialogue
relevant to anything--

1835
01:52:33,517 --> 01:52:36,103
Defense didn't have the opportunity
to depose this witness.

1836
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:39,720
- I'd ask for a little latitude.
- A very little latitude.

1837
01:52:41,871 --> 01:52:43,812
I wore utilities on the plane.

1838
01:52:43,886 --> 01:52:46,822
- You brought your dress uniform?
- Yes.

1839
01:52:46,895 --> 01:52:50,156
- Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
- Your Honor!

1840
01:52:50,222 --> 01:52:52,492
Is the colonel's underwear
a matter of national security?

1841
01:52:52,559 --> 01:52:55,821
Gentlemen! You better get somewhere
fast with this, Lieutenant.

1842
01:52:55,888 --> 01:52:57,862
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1843
01:52:58,927 --> 01:53:02,506
I brought a change of clothes
and some personal items.

1844
01:53:02,576 --> 01:53:04,365
Thank you.

1845
01:53:04,432 --> 01:53:07,945
After Dawson and Downey's arrest
on the night of the sixth...

1846
01:53:08,016 --> 01:53:12,108
Santiago's barracks were sealed off
and its contents inventoried.

1847
01:53:12,177 --> 01:53:15,342
' Four pairs camouflage pants,
three long-sleeve khaki shirts...

1848
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:19,152
three pairs of boots, four pairs
green socks, three green T-shirts--'

1849
01:53:19,218 --> 01:53:22,033
Please the court, is there a question
anywhere in our future?

1850
01:53:22,098 --> 01:53:25,098
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to ask you
to state your question.

1851
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:27,853
I'm wondering why Santiago
wasn't packed.

1852
01:53:29,842 --> 01:53:32,974
I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to that one in a minute.

1853
01:53:33,843 --> 01:53:37,040
This is a record of all phone calls made
from your base in the past 24 hours.

1854
01:53:37,107 --> 01:53:40,554
After being subpoenaed to Washington,
you made three calls.

1855
01:53:40,627 --> 01:53:42,864
Do you recognize
those number, sir?

1856
01:53:42,931 --> 01:53:45,931
I called Colonel Fitzhughes
in Quantico, Virginia.

1857
01:53:46,003 --> 01:53:48,686
I wanted to let him know
that I would be in town.

1858
01:53:48,755 --> 01:53:52,172
The second call was to arrange a meeting
with Congressman Richmond...

1859
01:53:52,245 --> 01:53:54,416
of the House Armed Services Committee.

1860
01:53:54,485 --> 01:53:57,419
And the third call
was to my sister Elizabeth.

1861
01:53:57,492 --> 01:53:59,500
Why did you make that call, sir?

1862
01:53:59,573 --> 01:54:02,835
I thought she might like
to have dinner tonight.

1863
01:54:02,901 --> 01:54:06,130
- I'm gonna stop this.
- These are phone records from Gitmo...

1864
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:10,257
for September 6,
and these are 14 letters...

1865
01:54:10,326 --> 01:54:12,944
that Santiago wrote in nine months...

1866
01:54:13,014 --> 01:54:16,048
requesting-- in fact, begging--
for a transfer.

1867
01:54:16,118 --> 01:54:19,184
Upon hearing the news that
he was finally getting his transfer...

1868
01:54:19,254 --> 01:54:23,051
Santiago was so excited that
do you know how many people he called?

1869
01:54:23,127 --> 01:54:25,494
Zero. Nobody.

1870
01:54:25,559 --> 01:54:29,270
Not one call to his parents
saying he was coming home.

1871
01:54:29,336 --> 01:54:32,434
Not one call to a friend, saying,
'Can you pick me up at the airport?'

1872
01:54:32,503 --> 01:54:36,181
He was asleep in his bed at midnight,
and according to you...

1873
01:54:36,248 --> 01:54:38,670
he was getting on a plane
in six hours.

1874
01:54:38,744 --> 01:54:42,159
Yet everything he owned
was hanging neatly in his closet...

1875
01:54:42,232 --> 01:54:44,753
and folded neatly in his footlocker.

1876
01:54:44,824 --> 01:54:48,436
You were leaving for one day.
You packed a bag and made three calls.

1877
01:54:48,505 --> 01:54:52,663
Santiago was leaving
for the rest of his life...

1878
01:54:54,362 --> 01:54:57,012
and he hadn't called a soul...

1879
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:59,635
and he hadn't packed a thing.

1880
01:55:02,746 --> 01:55:04,437
Can you explain that?

1881
01:55:06,843 --> 01:55:09,014
The fact is,
there was no transfer order.

1882
01:55:09,083 --> 01:55:11,733
Santiago wasn't going anywhere.
Isn't that right, Colonel?

1883
01:55:11,802 --> 01:55:15,119
Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious
that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...

1884
01:55:15,195 --> 01:55:17,431
is the smear
a high-ranking Marine officer...

1885
01:55:17,499 --> 01:55:21,013
in the hope that the mere appearance
of impropriety will win him points.

1886
01:55:21,084 --> 01:55:24,859
It's my recommendation, sir,
that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...

1887
01:55:24,924 --> 01:55:27,706
and the witness be excused
with the court's deepest apologies.

1888
01:55:29,469 --> 01:55:32,436
Overruled.
Your objection is noted.

1889
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:40,377
Is this funny, sir?

1890
01:55:40,445 --> 01:55:43,643
No, it's not.
It's tragic.

1891
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:46,296
- Do you have an answer?
- Absolutely.

1892
01:55:46,366 --> 01:55:50,010
My answer is,
I don't have the first damn clue.

1893
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:53,690
Maybe he was an early riser
and liked to pack in the morning.

1894
01:55:53,758 --> 01:55:56,475
And maybe he didn't have any friends.

1895
01:55:56,542 --> 01:55:59,892
I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid
I can't speak intelligently...

1896
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:03,480
about the travel habits
of William Santiago.

1897
01:56:03,551 --> 01:56:08,373
What I do know is that he was set
to leave the base at 0600.

1898
01:56:09,215 --> 01:56:14,104
Now, are these really the questions
that I was called here to answer?

1899
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:16,445
Phone calls and footlockers?

1900
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:20,058
Please tell me that you have
something more, Lieutenant.

1901
01:56:20,128 --> 01:56:23,741
These two Marines
are on trial for their lives.

1902
01:56:23,809 --> 01:56:28,064
Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1903
01:56:30,466 --> 01:56:33,761
Do you have any other questions
for me, counselor?

1904
01:56:51,748 --> 01:56:55,130
Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

1905
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,511
Thanks, Danny.
I love Washington.

1906
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:07,069
Excuse me.
I didn't dismiss you.

1907
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:09,791
I beg your pardon?

1908
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:14,203
I'm not through with my examination.
Sit down.

1909
01:57:15,846 --> 01:57:18,496
- Colonel.
- What's that?

1910
01:57:18,566 --> 01:57:21,119
I'd appreciate it if you’d address me
as 'colonel' or 'sir.'

1911
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:22,717
I believe I've earned it.

1912
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:26,848
Defense counsel will address
the witness as 'colonel' or 'sir.'

1913
01:57:26,918 --> 01:57:29,766
I don't know what the hell
kind of unit you're running here.

1914
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:33,475
The witness will address this court
as 'judge' or 'your honor.'

1915
01:57:33,542 --> 01:57:38,082
I'm quite certain I've earned it.
Take your seat, Colonel.

1916
01:57:42,856 --> 01:57:46,784
What do you want to discuss now?
My favorite color?

1917
01:57:48,007 --> 01:57:50,593
Colonel, the 6:00 a.m. flight
was the first one off the base?

1918
01:57:50,664 --> 01:57:51,680
Yes.

1919
01:57:51,753 --> 01:57:53,727
There wasn't a flight
that left seven hours earlier...

1920
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:56,037
and landed at Andrews Air Force Base
at 2:00 a.m.?

1921
01:57:56,105 --> 01:57:58,953
Lieutenant, I think
we've covered this, haven't we?

1922
01:57:59,945 --> 01:58:01,985
Your Honor, these are
the tower chief’s logs...

1923
01:58:02,057 --> 01:58:04,774
for both Guantanamo Bay
and Andrews Air Force Base.

1924
01:58:04,842 --> 01:58:08,070
The Guantanamo log lists no flight
that left at 11:00 p.m.

1925
01:58:08,137 --> 01:58:10,626
The Andrews log lists no flight
that landed at 2:00 a.m.

1926
01:58:10,698 --> 01:58:13,186
I'd like to admit them
as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

1927
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:17,313
I don't understand. You're admitting
evidence of a flight that never existed.

1928
01:58:17,386 --> 01:58:19,754
We believe it did, sir.

1929
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:22,983
Defense will be calling Airmen
Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.

1930
01:58:23,051 --> 01:58:25,953
They were working the ground crew
at Andrews at 2:00 a.m. on the 7th.

1931
01:58:26,027 --> 01:58:28,744
- These men weren't on the list.
- Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...

1932
01:58:28,812 --> 01:58:32,968
called specifically to refute testimony
offered under direct examination.

1933
01:58:33,036 --> 01:58:35,884
- I'll allow the witnesses.
- This is ridiculous.

1934
01:58:35,948 --> 01:58:40,170
- Colonel, a moment ago--
- Check the tower logs, for God's sake!

1935
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:43,205
We'll get to the airmen
in just a minute, sir.

1936
01:58:44,204 --> 01:58:46,059
A moment ago you said that
you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...

1937
01:58:46,124 --> 01:58:49,988
to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1938
01:58:50,062 --> 01:58:51,556
That's right.

1939
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:54,247
And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear
on what you wanted?

1940
01:58:54,317 --> 01:58:56,041
Crystal.

1941
01:58:56,109 --> 01:58:59,109
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick
ignored the order?

1942
01:58:59,182 --> 01:59:01,091
Ignored the order?

1943
01:59:01,165 --> 01:59:04,132
Any chance he forgot about it?

1944
01:59:04,206 --> 01:59:08,168
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick left your
office and said, 'The old man is wrong'?

1945
01:59:10,127 --> 01:59:12,299
When Lieutenant Kendrick
spoke to the platoon...

1946
01:59:12,368 --> 01:59:15,499
and ordered them not to touch Santiago,
any chance they ignored him?

1947
01:59:16,879 --> 01:59:19,749
You ever served
in an infantry unit, son?

1948
01:59:19,824 --> 01:59:22,987
- No, sir.
- Ever served in a forward area?

1949
01:59:24,271 --> 01:59:27,175
Ever put your life
in another man's hands?

1950
01:59:27,249 --> 01:59:29,769
Asked him to put his life in yours?

1951
01:59:30,992 --> 01:59:32,880
We follow orders, son.

1952
01:59:32,944 --> 01:59:35,792
We follow orders, or people die.

1953
01:59:35,857 --> 01:59:38,890
It's that simple.
Are we clear?

1954
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,716
Yes, sir.

1955
01:59:40,784 --> 01:59:42,443
Are we clear?

1956
01:59:42,513 --> 01:59:44,369
Crystal.

1957
01:59:46,418 --> 01:59:50,794
I have just one more question before
I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1958
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:56,173
If you gave an order
that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1959
01:59:56,242 --> 01:59:58,664
and your orders
are always followed...

1960
02:00:00,563 --> 02:00:03,531
then why would Santiago
be in danger?

1961
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,942
Why would it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

1962
02:00:14,324 --> 02:00:17,324
Santiago was a substandard Marine.

1963
02:00:17,396 --> 02:00:19,698
- He was being transferred--
- That's not what you said!

1964
02:00:19,765 --> 02:00:23,246
You said he was being transferred
because he was in grave danger.

1965
02:00:23,317 --> 02:00:26,133
I said, 'Grave danger?'
You said, 'Is there any other kind?'

1966
02:00:26,198 --> 02:00:28,620
- I recall what I said.
- I can have it read back to you.

1967
02:00:28,693 --> 02:00:31,562
I know what I said!
I don't have to have it read back to me.

1968
02:00:31,637 --> 02:00:35,086
Then why the two orders?
Colonel?

1969
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:39,536
Sometimes men take matters
into their own hands.

1970
02:00:39,606 --> 02:00:42,574
You've made it clear that your men
never take matters into their own hands.

1971
02:00:42,647 --> 02:00:44,534
Your men follow orders,
or people die.

1972
02:00:44,598 --> 02:00:47,119
So Santiago should have been
in danger, should he?

1973
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:50,901
- You snotty little bastard.
- I'd like to ask for a recess.

1974
02:00:50,967 --> 02:00:54,447
- I'd like an answer to the question.
- The court will wait for an answer.

1975
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:57,492
If Lieutenant Kendrick
gave an order...

1976
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,408
that Santiago
wasn't to be touched...

1977
02:01:00,472 --> 02:01:02,327
then why did he
have to be transferred?

1978
02:01:05,112 --> 02:01:09,138
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red
because that's what you told him to do!

1979
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:12,078
- Object!
- And then you cut these guys loose!

1980
02:01:12,153 --> 02:01:15,568
- I'll hold you in contempt.
- You doctored the logbook!

1981
02:01:15,641 --> 02:01:18,392
- Damn it, Kaffee!
- Consider yourself in contempt.

1982
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:21,141
Colonel Jessup,
did you order the Code Red?

1983
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:24,625
- You don't have to answer that.
- I'll answer the question.

1984
02:01:24,698 --> 02:01:26,641
- You want answers?
- I think I'm entitled!

1985
02:01:26,715 --> 02:01:29,016
- You want answers?
- I want the truth!

1986
02:01:29,082 --> 02:01:32,049
You can't handle the truth!

1987
02:01:32,122 --> 02:01:34,032
Son, we live in a world
that has walls...

1988
02:01:34,107 --> 02:01:36,628
and those walls have to be guarded
by men with guns.

1989
02:01:36,699 --> 02:01:40,890
Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

1990
02:01:40,956 --> 02:01:44,785
I have a greater responsibility
than you can possibly fathom.

1991
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:48,177
You weep for Santiago,
and you curse the Marines.

1992
02:01:48,252 --> 02:01:51,929
You have the luxury
of not knowing what I know--

1993
02:01:51,996 --> 02:01:55,926
that Santiago's death,
while tragic, probably saved lives.

1994
02:01:55,997 --> 02:02:01,660
And my existence, while grotesque and
incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

1995
02:02:01,725 --> 02:02:05,686
You don't want the truth because
deep down you don't talk about...

1996
02:02:05,757 --> 02:02:07,829
you want me on that wall.

1997
02:02:07,901 --> 02:02:10,488
You need me on that wall!

1998
02:02:10,558 --> 02:02:15,031
We use words
like honor, code, loyalty.

1999
02:02:15,102 --> 02:02:18,648
We use these words as the backbone
of a life spent defending something.

2000
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:20,629
You use them as a punch line.

2001
02:02:20,703 --> 02:02:24,380
I have neither the time
nor the inclination to explain myself...

2002
02:02:24,446 --> 02:02:28,440
to a man who rises and sleeps under
the blanket of the freedom I provide...

2003
02:02:28,511 --> 02:02:31,261
and then questions the manner
in which I provide it!

2004
02:02:31,327 --> 02:02:34,459
I would rather you just said thank you
and went on your way.

2005
02:02:34,528 --> 02:02:38,140
Otherwise, I suggest you
pick up a weapon and stand a post.

2006
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:42,911
Either way, I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitled to!

2007
02:02:42,977 --> 02:02:44,570
Did you order the Code Red?

2008
02:02:44,641 --> 02:02:46,495
- I did the job--
- Did you order the Code Red?

2009
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,798
You're goddamned right I did!

2010
02:02:59,394 --> 02:03:02,361
Please the court,
I suggest the members be dismissed...

2011
02:03:02,434 --> 02:03:05,533
so that we can move to an immediate
Article 39-A session.

2012
02:03:05,602 --> 02:03:07,936
The witness has rights.

2013
02:03:08,001 --> 02:03:10,142
Captain Ross?

2014
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:24,093
The members of the court will retire
to an anteroom until further instructed.

2015
02:03:24,164 --> 02:03:25,888
All rise.

2016
02:03:27,077 --> 02:03:30,426
What the hell is this?
Colonel, what's going on?

2017
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,923
I did my job.
I'd do it again.

2018
02:03:32,997 --> 02:03:35,997
I'm gonna get on a plane
and go on back to my base.

2019
02:03:36,069 --> 02:03:39,614
You're not going anywhere, Colonel.
M.P. s, guard the colonel.

2020
02:03:39,684 --> 02:03:41,059
Yes, sir.

2021
02:03:43,014 --> 02:03:45,435
- Captain Ross.
- What the hell is this?

2022
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:48,293
Colonel Jessup, you have
the right to remain silent.

2023
02:03:48,359 --> 02:03:52,799
I'm being charged with a crime?
Is that what this is?

2024
02:03:52,871 --> 02:03:56,068
- I'm being charged with a crime?
- You have a right to consult a lawyer.

2025
02:03:56,135 --> 02:03:59,812
- This is funny. That's what this is.
- This lawyer may be appointed by you.

2026
02:03:59,879 --> 02:04:03,425
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head
and piss in your dead skull!

2027
02:04:03,495 --> 02:04:05,350
You fucked with the wrong Marine!

2028
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:08,677
Colonel Jessup, do you understand
these rights as I have just read them?

2029
02:04:14,664 --> 02:04:17,315
You fucking people.

2030
02:04:17,384 --> 02:04:20,035
You have no idea
how to defend a nation.

2031
02:04:20,105 --> 02:04:23,401
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

2032
02:04:23,465 --> 02:04:25,375
That's all you did.

2033
02:04:25,450 --> 02:04:30,338
You put people's lives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

2034
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:32,483
Don't call me son.

2035
02:04:32,554 --> 02:04:36,809
I'm a lawyer and an officer
in the United States Navy...

2036
02:04:36,874 --> 02:04:39,525
and you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

2037
02:04:43,659 --> 02:04:45,546
The witness is excused.

2038
02:05:06,764 --> 02:05:07,779
All rise.

2039
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:20,390
Have the members reached a verdict?

2040
02:05:20,462 --> 02:05:22,317
We have, sir.

2041
02:05:33,647 --> 02:05:36,963
Lance Corporal Dawson
and Private First Class Downey.

2042
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:44,201
On the charge of murder,
the members find the accused...

2043
02:05:44,272 --> 02:05:46,126
not guilty.

2044
02:05:47,152 --> 02:05:50,600
On the charge
of conspiracy to commit murder...

2045
02:05:50,672 --> 02:05:54,284
the members find the accused
not guilty.

2046
02:05:56,977 --> 02:06:00,653
On the charge of conduct
unbecoming a United States Marine...

2047
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:06,285
the members find the accused
guilty as charged.

2048
02:06:08,177 --> 02:06:11,211
The accused are hereby sentenced
to time already served...

2049
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:15,952
and you are ordered to be dishonorably
discharged from the Marine Corps.

2050
02:06:17,299 --> 02:06:19,306
This court-martial is adjourned.

2051
02:06:19,379 --> 02:06:21,201
All rise.

2052
02:06:36,372 --> 02:06:38,260
What does that mean?

2053
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,075
What did that mean?

2054
02:06:48,245 --> 02:06:52,272
I don't understand. Colonel Jessup
said he ordered the Code Red.

2055
02:06:52,342 --> 02:06:56,117
- I know.
- What did we do wrong?

2056
02:06:56,182 --> 02:06:59,565
- It's not that simple.
- We did nothing wrong!

2057
02:06:59,637 --> 02:07:00,979
Yeah, we did.

2058
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:07,732
We were supposed to fight for people
who couldn't fight for themselves.

2059
02:07:08,823 --> 02:07:11,409
We were supposed
to fight for Willie.

2060
02:07:18,872 --> 02:07:21,774
I have to take these men
over to personnel for some paperwork.

2061
02:07:39,386 --> 02:07:41,971
You don't need to wear a patch
on your arm to have honor.

2062
02:07:48,315 --> 02:07:51,282
There's an officer on deck.

2063
02:08:14,204 --> 02:08:16,376
Airmen Cecil O'Malley
and Anthony Rodriguez--

2064
02:08:16,444 --> 02:08:19,161
What exactly were these guys
gonna testify to?

2065
02:08:19,228 --> 02:08:21,333
Unless I'm mistaken, they were both
gonna testify under oath...

2066
02:08:21,404 --> 02:08:24,274
that they had absolutely
no recollection of anything.

2067
02:08:24,349 --> 02:08:27,481
- Strong witnesses.
- And handsome too, don’t you think?

2068
02:08:28,989 --> 02:08:31,543
I'll see you around campus.
I gotta go arrest Kendrick.

2069
02:08:31,614 --> 02:08:34,134
Tell him I say hi.

2070
02:08:34,206 --> 02:08:35,733
Will do.
