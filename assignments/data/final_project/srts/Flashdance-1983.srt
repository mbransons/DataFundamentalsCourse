1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:02,717
Thank you.

2
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:09,933
What do you feel like,
fish, chicken, steak?

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,227
- I know this terrific little...
- Pizza.

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,812
...Pizza place.

5
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,659
- You really live here?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:31,288
It used to be a warehouse
before I moved in.

7
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,499
It's different. Very different.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,461
A whole lot different
than where I'm from.

9
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:39,254
Where is that?

10
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,257
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

11
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,134
Altoona.

12
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:48,346
I was thinking
more along the lines of Jupiter.

13
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,402
Actually, they're very close.

14
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,905
It's just the next lifeless planet over.

15
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:10,327
Really, it was boring.
Except for maybe music.

16
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:16,291
- They have music in Altoona?
- Well, my father, he loves music.

17
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:21,713
This one time, he took us all
to the symphony, my whole family.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,800
It was supposed to be
this really big deal.

19
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,677
At first I didn't like it very much.

20
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:31,932
There is nothing to do with your feet
and there's nothing to look at.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,976
It's boring.

22
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,522
I was ready to nod out,
or something.

23
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:45,529
He said, "If you close your eyes,
you can see the music."

24
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,824
You can, too.

25
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,369
Did you ever try?

26
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:54,538
See the music?

27
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:58,708
Come on, try.

28
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,504
Close your eyes.

29
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:10,554
Well?

30
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,226
Well...

31
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:23,275
I had a great time.
It was a terrific evening.

32
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,655
Don't you want some pizza?

33
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,132
Hey!
A little late, aren't you?

34
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,193
# Frightened by a dream

35
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,989
# You're not the only one

36
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,996
# Running like the wind

37
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:05,293
# Thoughts can come undone

38
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:14,719
# Dancing behind masks
Just subtle pantomime

39
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:20,767
# Lady, lady, lady

40
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:25,939
# I know it's in your heart to stay

41
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:31,278
# Lady, lady, lady

42
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:38,869
# When will I ever hear you say
I love you... #

43
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,912
What was that for?

44
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,915
I wanted to see how fast
you could run.

45
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,044
- How did I do?
- Fair.

46
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:54,176
# Lady, lady, lady

47
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:59,306
# Don't walk this lonely avenue

48
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:04,770
# Lady, lady, lady

49
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:12,569
# Let me touch that part of you.
You want me to... #

50
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,325
Do that again.

51
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,745
- What?
- That dance step you just did.

52
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:27,459
I can't, I was just fooling around.
I'm not a dancer like that.

53
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,797
- What do you mean?
- I've never studied before.

54
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:35,008
I mean, I read books and stuff
and I watch.

55
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,427
But I've never taken dance classes.

56
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:41,264
There's all those dancers
in one room

57
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,767
watching each other
and watching you.

58
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,937
But you dance in front of an audience
at the club every night.

59
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,398
It's different.
I never see them.

60
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:55,904
You go out there, the music starts
and you begin to feel it.

61
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,118
And your body just starts to move.

62
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:05,664
I know it sounds really silly.

63
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:09,042
But something inside of you
just clicks.

64
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,461
You just take off
and you're gone.

65
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,714
It's like you're somebody else
for a second.

66
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,554
Some nights, I...

67
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:29,187
Some nights I just can't wait
to get out there...

68
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,149
Just so I can disappear.

69
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:37,279
# Lady, lady, lady

70
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:42,409
# Don't walk this lonely avenue

71
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:47,998
# Lady, lady, lady

72
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:55,338
# Let me touch that part of you
You want me to #

73
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,754
"lmagination)

74
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:15,001
# He says that he can read my mind

75
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,547
# The power to turn iron into gold

76
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:25,429
# She says she's seen the other side

77
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,141
# And knows the place
The fire burns all night

78
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:34,980
# There is an answer to the question

79
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:39,526
# So long ago down below

80
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:43,739
# Once you have it,
It never goes away

81
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,409
# It's in the pocket,
When you're really really lucky

82
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:51,371
# When your fantasy becomes reality

83
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,582
# Living inside your imagination

84
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,544
# It's in your pocket,
When you're really really lucky

85
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:02,340
# When your fantasy becomes reality... #

86
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:05,135
How come you don't go up there
and dance?

87
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,596
You look like
you could dance real good.

88
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,056
I'm practising.

89
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:13,143
Yeah? You know how to do
the horizontal mambo?

90
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:20,776
Jeanie, I just kid around.
I don't mean nothing. Keep that.

91
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,862
That's $100.
I can't take this.

92
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,907
Keep it.
It's my way of saying I'm sorry.

93
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,245
Thanks.

94
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:36,666
# It will not burn you

95
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:45,467
# And the once you may love
Only life won't make it, or just burn away #

96
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,404
Hanna!

97
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,030
Hanna!

98
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,658
Darling, here you are.

99
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:43,376
Bravo! Bravo!

100
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:04,689
At the end of every performance, does
the lead dancer always get flowers?

101
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:07,651
- Always.
- Did you get flowers like that?

102
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:12,364
- Not always.
- But once, right? At least once?

103
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,743
- How does that make you feel?
- You will let me know.

104
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,626
- Now, sleep well.
- You too.

105
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:19,973
You son of a bitch!

106
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,690
Was that you
or the radiator, Grunt?

107
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,652
Oh, shit.

108
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:23,286
Shut up, Grunt.

109
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,289
- Hey, it's Richie!
- Hi.

110
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,584
The stupid radiator broke.

111
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,879
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?

112
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,339
L.A.

113
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,135
- L.A.?
- Got my car all packed.

114
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,887
I'm just going to get on the turnpike.
That's it. I'm gone.

115
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,764
What about Jeanie?

116
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:46,977
Look, I love Jeanie. But I don't
have it to give to her right now.

117
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,563
She's going to be all right.
She'll be fine.

118
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,858
Don't go yet. I'll make
some coffee, we can talk.

119
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,943
What am I going to do here?

120
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,363
Cook hamburgers
and pretend I'm a comedian?

121
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,075
I'll miss you.

122
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,298
Can't forget my hat.

123
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,718
Good luck.

124
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,586
Give me a turkey sandwich
and a diet 7-U)p.

125
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:00,008
- I've got that.
- Save your money.

126
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,803
- I was buying you lunch.
- I don't want you buying me anything.

127
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,056
- I don't want you buying me, period.
- What's the matter?

128
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,642
- I've got eyes.
- What are you talking about?

129
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,521
I didn't know you were a ballet fan,
I thought you liked it private.

130
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:13,730
What?

131
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:16,942
How quickly they forget.
At the dance benefit.

132
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,112
The blonde in the white dress.
Who's the goddamn blonde?

133
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,239
Blonde?

134
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,908
Blonde?

135
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:28,036
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

136
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,418
Wait a minute! What's going on?
Is everybody crazy?

137
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,170
Last night, some idiot throws
a rock through my window...

138
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:40,549
- I broke your fucking window!
- You what?

139
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:43,677
You heard me.
I smashed your stupid window.

140
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,223
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

141
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,683
Maybe.

142
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,436
It cost me a $170.
I had to special order it.

143
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,938
You've got the money!
Go fuck the blonde!

144
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:58,358
She's my ex-wife.
We have friends on the Arts Council.

145
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:02,154
I see her once a year
to take her to the stupid benefit!

146
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,781
Why am I explaining myself?

147
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,537
You didn't have to break my window.

148
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,750
I did it because... you pissed me off.

149
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:47,532
When I was a kid all I wanted was
to afford to eat in restaurants like this.

150
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,284
Were you poor?

151
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:51,745
I was so poor
I had hand-me-down lunches.

152
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,164
It was rough in the old days.

153
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,626
I used to steal
hubcaps with Johnny C.

154
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,129
You did?

155
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,224
How's the lobster?

156
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,732
It sucks.

157
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:27,531
Want some of mine?

158
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,325
I'm not hungry, thanks.

159
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,163
Whatever turns you on.

160
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,333
What turns you on?

161
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,061
You like phone booths?

162
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,732
Phone booths?

163
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:05,277
You probably just like
doing it in bed, right?

164
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,786
- You two look cosy.
- Alex, this is Katie.

165
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,290
Hello.
Nick has told me all about you.

166
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,666
Hi.

167
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:25,547
- You're not really a welder, are you?
- Yes, I really am.

168
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:28,842
And you really take your
clothes off at night?

169
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:34,473
- I don't really take them off.
- I was under the impression that you did.

170
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,016
You look great.

171
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:38,643
You didn't look this good
when we were married.

172
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,022
- It was the company I was keeping.
- That was good. That's funny.

173
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:46,568
Has he taken you to the steel mill?
He likes to go there on his first date.

174
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:50,113
- That was your first date, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was.

175
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,660
As a matter of fact...
I fucked his brains out.

176
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,920
Obviously, you did.

177
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,797
Charmed, dear.

178
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,135
You loved her once, didn't you?

179
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,847
I thought I did in the beginning.

180
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:21,103
She was different from anyone
I had gone out with before, she was...

181
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,564
Well educated.
Came from a real good family.

182
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:30,779
I figured that I had really made it.

183
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,741
And one day, I realised that...

184
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,996
I'd just taken the safe route.

185
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:47,379
When I realised that, it made it easier
for me to do what I had to do.

186
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,631
What was that?

187
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,218
Let go. Start over again.

188
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:58,557
Figure out what it was
I wanted to do and go after it.

189
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,519
You got it, didn't you?

190
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,738
How did you do it?

191
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,576
I took a deep breath and jumped.

192
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,166
Hello.

193
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,211
I'd like to apply for admission
to the Repertory Company.

194
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,297
When you fill out this application,

195
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,467
write down all your years
of previous dance training.

196
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,969
Starting with the last school
you attended.

197
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:38,263
I know that part.

198
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,640
Auditions are by invitation only

199
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,060
and are performed
before the committee

200
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:46,772
and select members
of the Repertory Company.

201
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,023
Thank you.

202
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,150
You're welcome.

203
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,008
Good morning.

204
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,644
Good morning.
May I help you?

205
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,774
Yes. There was a young woman here
a short time ago, wearing an army jacket.

206
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:33,443
She was here.
I was talking to her...

207
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,113
about admission
to the Repertory Company.

208
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,542
Mr Bradley, please.

209
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,085
Nick Hurley.

210
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,756
Larry! Hey.

211
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,010
Great. Great.

212
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:02,180
Listen, are you still
on the Arts Council?

213
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,350
I need a favour for a special friend.

214
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:49,394
# My baby wears his heart on his sleeves

215
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,440
# He wears a look on his face
That says please, please, please, love it

216
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,234
# Everything he wants, love it,
Everything he wants

217
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,571
# I just can't hesitate
When he wants what he wants

218
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,739
# Oh, chaka... #

219
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,824
He called.

220
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,499
# Oh chaka, oh chaka,
Oh chaka, oh chaka

221
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:13,126
# Last night he called on the telephone

222
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,462
# And though at two in the morning... #

223
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:20,217
- Trick or treat?
- Hey, throw that bum out!

224
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:24,054
I told you they didn't like
short people down there.

225
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:25,472
Richie!

226
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,100
Richie!

227
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:34,064
- Did you check out the clubs there?
- Yeah.

228
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,110
- Come on, what happened?
- One of them offered me a job.

229
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,487
That's great.

230
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:43,573
As a waiter. I said,
"Me, a waiter? You got to be crazy.

231
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,993
"I can't take a job as a waiter.
I'm a cook."

232
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,498
Hi, Richie.

233
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,294
Hi, Jeanie.

234
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,134
- I missed you.
- All those giris out there?

235
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,219
There were no giris out there.

236
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:07,264
That's why you called me every night?

237
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,267
Hey, it's the cook!

238
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:13,895
Or is it the comedian?
Nice suit, Richie.

239
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:18,817
- Let's go, Jeanie.
- See you later, Richie.

240
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,236
See you around.

241
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:37,479
The audition!
I got it! I got it!

242
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,982
Nick, wait up!

243
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,863
- Look! Wait!
- What's going on?

244
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,657
- Read it.
- What?

245
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:52,369
I got the audition, look.
I applied for the Repertory Company.

246
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:56,373
You have to be invited before
you can audition and they invited me.

247
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,085
That's wonderful.
We have to do something about it.

248
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,253
When?

249
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,922
- How about tonight?
- Yes.

250
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,471
Hanna?

251
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,432
Hanna?

252
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,645
Well... I did it.

253
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:23,442
I knew you would.
Congratulations.

254
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,736
I'm so excited I can't stop shaking.

255
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,531
But what if I don't make it?

256
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,035
You will.
I know you will.

257
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,082
What would I do without you?

258
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,006
I loved the dinner.

259
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,508
And I loved the way
they sat us right away.

260
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:54,222
I loved that there were 50 people
waiting and we just whizzed in.

261
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,894
I called the restaurant last night...

262
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,606
and told them it was
a very special occasion.

263
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,574
What do you mean
you called them last night?

264
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,534
- Stop the car.
- Why?

265
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,369
Stop the goddamn car!

266
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:18,163
You called them last night

267
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,416
but I didn't tell you
I got the audition until this morning.

268
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,335
So how the hell did you know?

269
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,088
- Listen.
- Friends on the committee?

270
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,382
Asshole! Stop the car!

271
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,050
- Alex!
- Let me go.

272
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:41,728
You have no right to help me!
I don't want you to help me!

273
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:46,149
You're going to get yourself killed!
All I did was make a phone call.

274
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:49,319
I got you the audition,
the rest is up to you.

275
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,700
The whole thing has to be up to me!
I'm not going to the audition!

276
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,232
Good evening, Mawby's.

277
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,944
- Is Jeanie there?
- Alex, where have you been all week?

278
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:34,364
Come on, Jake, I don't want to hear it.
Is she there?

279
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:38,243
She doesn't work for me any more.
She's over at the Zanzibar.

280
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,746
- What?
- You heard me.

281
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,653
# Living on the edge

282
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,950
# Sliding downhill to where
The good giris don't but the bad giris will

283
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,786
# Bad giris will

284
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:27,167
# Don't wanna know your name
You can tell me lies

285
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:32,339
# Show me all the secrets
Hidden in your thighs, in your thighs

286
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,511
# Seduce me tonight

287
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,348
# Seduce me tonight

288
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,228
# I'll play acts at the stage
Dim the lights

289
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,106
# And baby, seduce me tonight

290
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,701
# I wanna be your slave
Set me in scene

291
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,703
# Take me all the places... #

292
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,247
Come on, Jeanie.

293
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,209
We're getting out of here.

294
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,171
No!

295
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:17,092
Alex! Alex!
Jesus Christ!

296
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:20,887
Alex! What the fuck!
What are you doing?

297
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,815
You want to make a living
rolling around on your back?

298
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,817
I make good money.

299
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:36,987
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
You call that dancing?

300
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:40,240
- What's this shit?
- Stop it, that's mine.

301
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,832
Why did you come here?

302
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,294
Because you're my friend. Jerk!

303
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:55,464
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

304
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,455
- You don't say hello?
- No.

305
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:31,875
You didn't show up at work,
I was worried about you.

306
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,294
- You look like shit.
- Thanks a lot.

307
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,921
You're welcome.

308
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:40,133
Listen, I didn't come here to fight,
I came to see if you were OK.

309
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,843
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

310
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,471
- What doesn't matter?
- The audition. I don't care.

311
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:47,349
- You do care.
- I don't care.

312
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,268
If you can't be honest with yourself,
you can't with me.

313
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:54,272
I don't need you telling me what to do.
I don't need to hear your shit.

314
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,358
I'm not a baby!

315
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:59,444
Get out of here!
Go play with your fucking Porsche.

316
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,905
What you need is a kick in the ass.

317
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,040
You're not grown-up enough
to smoke.

318
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:24,010
The truth is, you're scared shitless
of going to that place, aren't you?

319
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,722
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

320
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,433
You're using me
as an excuse not to go.

321
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,017
Get out.

322
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:34,146
You're just going to piss it
all away, Alex.

323
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:41,695
Don't you understand?
When you give up your dream, you die.

324
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,909
See you.

325
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,534
Hanna?

326
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,080
Hanna?

327
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,543
Hanna?

328
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:41,838
Hanna?

329
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,143
Hanna?

330
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,941
She died.

331
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,360
Yesterday.

332
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,485
"I'll be where the heart is)

333
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:53,136
# It's a song that just keeps playing
On the radio

334
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,851
# And you know
I haven't seen you for a while

335
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:07,776
# I lie awake at night
And wonder how you are

336
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:14,408
# And I wish that I could see you again

337
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:26,086
# Is it fate
Or is it luck that brings us back

338
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:32,592
# Or is it just a common point of view

339
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:40,600
# Time has put a spell on you
You never seem to change

340
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:46,857
# And I wish that I could see you again

341
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:53,864
# I'll be here where the heart is... #

342
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,783
- Where have you been?
- No place.

343
00:37:58,952 --> 00:38:02,497
- What are you doing?
- Getting my stuff.

344
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:06,168
What are you getting your stuff for?

345
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:13,258
If it's that bad, why don't you
slit your wrists and get it over with?

346
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,429
I thought nothing ever got you down.

347
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,271
You know, when I started out,
I was 17.

348
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:33,278
I used to work
in these old movie theatres.

349
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:37,657
Every cent I had,
I spent on costumes.

350
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,079
I had more fancy costumes
and dresses than you do.

351
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:46,833
When I went on that stage
I was looking so good.

352
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:55,175
One day I just stopped buying them.

353
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,971
I don't even know what happened.

354
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,436
I thought about it a lot.

355
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:09,272
I just can't seem to pin it down.

356
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:14,152
The dresses got old
and I just stopped wearing them.

357
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:20,200
I got some in a trunk.
I'll show you sometime.

358
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,493
OK.

359
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,331
What the hell.

360
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,171
It's show time.

361
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:49,229
May the Lord be in your heart
and mind that you confess your sins

362
00:39:49,396 --> 00:39:53,233
in the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

363
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:57,863
Bless me father for I have sinned.

364
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,949
It's been a long time
since my last confession.

365
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:04,911
I want...
I want so much.

366
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:55,897
# First, when there's nothing... #

367
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:58,483
Can I start again?

368
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:37,147
# First, when there's nothing

369
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,652
# But a slow, glowing dream

370
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,489
# That your fears

371
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:47,866
# Seems to hide

372
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:51,119
# Deep inside

373
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,246
# Your mind

374
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,208
# All alone

375
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,293
# I have cried

376
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:01,421
# Silent tears

377
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:03,924
# Full of pride

378
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:06,551

380
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:12,724

00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:18,980
