All right, so we get him
on the next hill.

773

He's no kid.

to be over 3 5.

Yeah, in his day, Beagle.

How old are we, anyway?

What did you say,

900
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:47,812
Hmm? Oh,
do you know what an occasion
like this calls for? A drink.

901
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,466
Yeah.
You're right.
He's right, sir.

902
01:06:50,536 --> 01:06:54,333
May we have a
farewell drink together?

Sure!

Beautiful villa you have,
Mr. Talbot.

906
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,412
Now then, what would
you boys like to drink?

907
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:21,474
A brandy.
Brandy?

908
01:07:21,544 --> 01:07:24,358
Mm-hmm.
Fine!

909
01:07:27,912 --> 01:07:31,490
A toast, sir.
May this night be an example
of the friendship...

910
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,527
that exists between
your generation... and ours.

911

Ahh.

912
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:59,326
A-Another toast, sir.

913
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:05,447
May these drinks
wash away the past
and ensure the future.

914
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,502
To a little insurance.

915
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,262
Now then.

916
01:08:50,152 --> 01:08:54,080
Sir, I'd like
to propose a toast then.

917
01:08:54,152 --> 01:08:57,982
To what?
You name it.

918
01:08:58,056 --> 01:09:00,390
Well--

919
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:02,496
Fine.

920
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:16,291
Sir, do you realize
that you are defying
the laws of medical science?

921

Dr. Lister

and, uh... Madame Curie.

923
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:32,481
All their work, sir,

01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,027
Mr. Talbot,
he called us in.

And then he forced us
to drink with him.

01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,535
Oh, Tony.

950

Hmm?

"Do unto others before
they do it to you!"

You can't let them
lie there all night.

what they deserved.

Somebody has to look after
those girls.

Isn't that their
parents' responsibility?

You know the trouble
with the American parent?

They have a new gimmick:
Keep your kids

There's
a body missing.

It's the one body

I was drunk, I swear.
I didn't know what I was doing.

The next time I see a man
lying in a bar,
I'll leave him there!

974
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,665
Mr. Talbot, did you force
him to drink with you?
Of course not.

975
01:13:53,735 --> 01:13:55,743
And that's for lying!

976
01:13:55,816 --> 01:13:59,231
Sandy, honey--
Sandy?

977

Thank you.

my lack of confidence
in my fellow man.

Hmm?

of his teeth when I hit him.
He has a beautiful smile!

984
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,989
You're not mad at him?
Mad at him?
Why would I be mad?

985
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,919
Wait, wait.

986
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:46,530
He got fresh.
You hit him.
Mm-hmm.

987
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,382

You people are...
all mixed up.

991
01:14:58,696 --> 01:15:02,012
You see, when he got fresh,
it showed that
he was interested.

992
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:04,674
I had to make sure
he stayed interested.
So you hit him.

993
01:15:04,744 --> 01:15:06,784
That's right.

994
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:09,190
It's like
Mr. Talbot said.

995
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:12,103
A girl has to make a boy
respect her.

996
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:16,423
If she gives in too easily,
he'll never
take her seriously.

997
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:18,943
Oh.

998
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:21,187
He said that?
Mm-hmm.

999
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:24,419
And he's right.
He said, " When you
go shopping in a market,

1000
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:27,553
you don't buy anything
that's been handled
too much."

1001
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:32,926
Oh. When did Mr. Talbot
tell you all this?

1002
01:15:33,032 --> 01:15:35,039
While we were dancing.
He said,

1003
01:15:35,112 --> 01:15:38,373
"If you want a man to think
in terms of getting
engaged and married,

1004
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,368

<i>your standards high. "</i>

1005
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,058
Hmm. What else
did he say?

1006
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:50,496
He said that love is
one product you don't sell
by giving away free samples.

1007
01:15:52,104 --> 01:15:54,526
Hmm.

1008
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:57,414
That's good advice
for all of us.

1009
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:03,807
You listen to him.
I can tell you he knows
what he's talking about.

1010
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,019
I know.

1011

It's been a long day.

1017
01:16:31,112 --> 01:16:35,968
Some champagne would
do us both a world of good.
Mm-hmm.

1018
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:39,269
The bottle's on the terrace.
I'll go get it, huh?
