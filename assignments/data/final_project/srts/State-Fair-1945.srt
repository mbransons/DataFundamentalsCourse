Don't miss it
Don't even be late

It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

Is the best state fair in our state

(RHYTHMIC GRUNTING)

00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,066
Take it easy, Blue Boy. Your
supper will be here any minute.

12
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,611
I wish I knew what was
keeping that feller.

WOMAN: Dad! Daddy, I just had
Mr. Cramer on the phone.

18
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,094
He said Dave Miller stopped
by his place 10 minutes ago

19
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,514
- to put water in his radiator.
- Thanks, daughter.

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,474
Margy?

21
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,437
- Have you finished your packing?
- Not yet. I was just going to.

22
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,941
I don't know what's got into you lately.
All you do is sit around and mope.

23
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,734
I don't sit around and mope.

24
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,939
Well, stop moping now and
finish your packing.

25
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,621
Always saying she doesn't
know what's got into me.

26
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,082
I'll be glad to get to the fair,

hear something different, see
something different for a change.

28
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,565
What has got into me, anyway?

29
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,219
The things I used to like

30
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,306
I don't like anymore

31
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,058
I want a lot of other things

32
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,520
I've never had before

33
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,484
It's just like Mother says

34
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,565

35
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:47,578
Pretending I am wonderful

36
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,330
And knowing I'm a dope

37

- WOMAN: Margy?
- Yes, Mother?

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,781
As soon as you're finished, I want you to
come down and help me with the pickles.

39
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,385
In a minute, Mother.

40
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,088
Pickles!

41
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm as restless as a willow

42
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,436
In a windstorm

43
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm as jumpy as a puppet

44
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,317
On a string

45
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:24,073
I'd say that I had spring fever

46
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:30,162
But I know it isn't spring

47
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:36,293
I'm starry-eyed and
vaguely discontented

48
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:42,424
Like a nightingale
without a song to sing

49
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:48,430
Oh, why should I have spring fever

50
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:55,020
When it isn't even spring

51
00:05:55,021 --> 00:06:00,818
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

52
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,740
Walking down a strange, new street

53
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:12,788
Hearing words that
I have never heard

54
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,838
From a man I've yet to meet

55
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,841
I'm as busy as a spider

56
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,677
Spinning daydreams

57
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:32,641
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:38,314
I haven't seen a
crocus or a rosebud

59
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:44,028
Ora robin on the wing

60
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,282
But I feel so gay

61
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,328
In a melancholy way

62
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:59,378
That it might as well be spring

63
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:06,886
It might as well be

64
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,426
Spring

65
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,139
WOMAN: Margy!

66
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,232
I'm coming, Mother.

67
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,153
Come on, boy.

68
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,617
Ah, he'll win first this year sure.

69
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,786
He's half again the hog
he was last year.

70
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,707
You don't really expect to win, do
you, with that animated lard can?

71
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,752
Say, listen, you can say
anything you please about me,

72
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,463
but don't say anything bad
about Blue Boy.

73
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,716
That's the finest Hampshire
boar that ever breathed.

74
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,921
If you think that, he's
just as good as beat now.

75
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,888
Be better if he was
third or fourth best.

76
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,975
- He'd stand a better chance.
- What are you talking about?

77
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:01,063
If a hog or a man ever got what
he was entitled to just once,

78
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,024
the eternal stars would quit
making melody in the spheres.

79
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,361
Oh, there you go
with that book talk again.

80
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,031
I say he's the best hog in the state,
and the judges will say so too.

81
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,951
They might.
But if that turns out good,

82
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,578
then something else
will probably happen.

83
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,664
- He might catch pneumonia...
- Oh!

84
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,458
or hog cholera,
or you might catch pneumonia.

85
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,085
Or something might happen
to Wayne or Margy.

86
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,294
Oh!

87
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,881
Mark my words, Abel, there's
compensation in this world.

88
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,594
For every good, there's bad. Now,
Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us...

89
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,931
I don't care what
Waldo Emerson tells us!

90
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,350
Look, I'll just make
a little bet with you.

91
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,894
- On what?
- I'll bet you we go to the fair...

92
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,313
and Blue Boy
will win the grand award.

93
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,942
And nothing bad will happen
to him, me or my family.

94
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,153
Yes, and we'll all have
a good time too

95
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,780
and be better off for it
after the fair is over.

96
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,368
It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd
asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1.

97
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,996
But you didn't ask me,
so it's an even bet.

98
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,418
- Five dollars?
- Five dollars is right.

99
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,962
I'll be around for the money
the day you get back.

100
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,466
- Be around with the money, you mean.
- You'll see. You'll see.

101
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,927
Yeah, I'll see.
Well, well, what's this?

102
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,764
You got your chains on.
You expecting a shower?

103
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,141
Nope. I'm expecting good weather.

104
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:23,017
That's why I put my chains on,
so I wouldn't be fooled.

105
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,487
Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel
Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?

106
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,031
Melissa Frake, I guess. With
your father entering Blue Boy,

107
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,859
the judges might get us mixed.

108
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,995
ABEL: Hog cholera, pneumonia.

109
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,998
He left out earthquakes,
the old gloom spreader.

110
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,247
Poor Dad.

111
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,713
Mmm, I don't know.

112
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,042
Let me taste.

113
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,055
- Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's.
- I followed her recipe.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

115
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,268
- I'll get it.
- You left something out.

116
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,189
Abel Frake, I am not gonna
put liquor into my cooking!

117
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,234
Making mincemeat without brandy?
No such thing.

118
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,402
I don't approve of it,
and I won't do it.

119
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,280
Well, you'll be sorry. You know,
those judges at the fair,

120
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,199
they like a little snifter
now and then.

121
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,451
- It's Eleanor, for Wayne.
- Wayne's out back somewhere.

122
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,746
I'll find him.

123
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,710
Why don't you say hello
to Eleanor, Ma?

124
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,421
See how her mother is. You know, they
had the doctor again this morning.

125
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,466
- I suppose I should.
- Find out if she's going to the fair.

126
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
Yes, I will.

127
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,724
Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?

128
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,227
How's your mother feeling?

129
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:49,439
Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't
get by to see her today,

130
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,315
but I've been so busy getting
ready to leave and all.

131
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
Oh, well, I'm glad
she's better, dear.

132
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,574
Wayne'll be here any moment.
Just hold on.

133
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,827
And be sure to give
my love to your mother.

134
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,872
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.

135
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,125
- Abel?
- Hmm?

136
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,336
I need a good-sized box, or cotton.
Something to carry my pickles in.

137
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,542
Know just what you want, Ma.
I'll get it for you right away.

140
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,240
No, I won't!

141
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,117
- Eph, where's Wayne?
- Wayne? He's back there in the barn.

142
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,325
MAN: Thank you, mister.

143
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,460
And now, I think I'll have a
try at that fancy brass clock.

144
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,834
Yes, that one.

145
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,425
- There ya are.
- Wayne?

146
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,011
There's a nice string of pearls.
I think I'll have a go at them.

147
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,091
- Oh, I know they're fakes, but...
- Wayne!

148
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,226
What are you doing?

149
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,312
- How long you been there?
- Just a little while.

150
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,981
Why didn't you say somethin'
instead of just standing there?

151
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,566
Who were you talking to?

152
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,069
And does Mother know you have
her embroidery hoops out here?

153
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,240
Look, just leave me alone, will ya?
And stop prying in other people's affairs.

154
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,992
Speaking of affairs,
Eleanor's on the phone.

155
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,197
Eleanor? Well, Christmas!
Why didn't you tell me?

156
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,043
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

157
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,547
Eleanor's on the phone.

158
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:59,236
Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the
doctor say about your mother? Can you go?

159
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,488
Well, I don't know
what to do, Wayne.

160
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,615
The doctor said she's
a little better, but...

161
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,909
Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go!

162
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,331
I've made a lot
of plans for us. What?

163
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:34,563
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

164
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:40,861
Walking down a strange, new street

165
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,867
Hearing words
that I have never heard

166
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,952
From a man

167
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:54,541
I've yet to meet

168
00:13:54,542 --> 00:14:01,590
He would be a kind
of handsome combination

169
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,761
Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer

170
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,307
And Bing

171
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,101
RONALD COLMAN'S VOICE:
Margy. My dear, little Margy.

172
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:18,315
I'd make the world a ruby for
your little finger and say,

173
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:24,154
"I love you.
I love you. I love you."

174
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,616
CHARLES BOYER'S VOICE:
Ah, Margy. You are beautiful.

175
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,619
You are so very beautiful.

176
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,373
BING CROSBY: And we feel so gay

177
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,209
In a melancholy way

178
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:43,508
That it might as well be spring

179
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,834
(VOCALIZING)

180
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,549
(WHISTLING)

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,182
MAN: Margy!

182
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,773
- Hello, Margy.
- Hello, Harry.

183
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,493
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.

184
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,955
Well, I'll see you when I get back.

185
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,533
Good-bye.

186
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,336
Gee, I wish I was going to
the fair with you tonight.

187
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,672
I'd rather be doing that
than anything I know.

188
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,675
- Oh, would you, Harry?
- Well, sure.

189
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,847
- Only I can't neglect my cows.
- Oh. Of course not.

190
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,850
- Say, I saw something today.
- What?

191
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,019
The sweetest bit of farmland
this side of Davenport.

192
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,064
I was thinking of puttin' a
bid in on it if you like it.

193
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,859
- If I like it?
- Well, sure.

194
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,572
You know I haven't made a plan since I was
12 years old that didn't include you.

195
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,324
- Got a house on it?
- Yeah, but it's too old.

196
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,202
- We'd have to build a new one.
- Oh, I like old houses.

197
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,580
It wouldn't fit in
with our kind of farm.

198
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:01,418
You know, I plan to do everything my
old man won't let me do on his place.

199
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,839
Scientific irrigation, electric
milking, separate hen roosts.

200
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,717
No horses. All tractor power.

201
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,970
- You see what I mean? Everything modern.
- But the house you live in...

202
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,308
It's gotta be the same. No
clapboard and shingle business.

203
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,019
There's a new kind of
plastic, prefabricated job.

204
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,813
I want you to see it.
Got the catalog at home.

205
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,149
- Is it pretty?
- Sure!

206
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,487
But what's more important,
it's termite-proof.

207
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,156
Wait till you see it. And they
tell you how to furnish it too.

208
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,117
No rugs or carpets.
They're just dust collectors.

209
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,622
- What's on the floor?
- Linoleum through the whole house.

210
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:44,169
Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick
and smooth and easy to keep clean.

211
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,422
Well, it's like every room
in the house was a bathroom.

212
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,175
- Sounds real cozy.
- Yeah, don't it, though?

213
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,553
- What I've always wanted.
- Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.

214
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,847
- Everything's sanitary.
- Sure.

215
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,517
- And if we had children...
- Oh, Margy!

216
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,228
I said if by any strange
chance we had children,

217
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,939
why, I could dress them
in cellophane rompers.

218
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,358
Say, I didn't know they had...

219
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,902
Life will just be ducky...

220
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:13,281
In our air-conditioned
patent-leather farmhouse

221
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,533
Plastic.

222
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,704
On our ultramodern scientific farm

223
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,709
We'll live in a streamlined heaven

224
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,714
And we'll waste no time on charm

225
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:35,220
No geraniums to clutter our veranda

226
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:40,475
Nor a single, little
sentimental thing

227
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,352
No Virginia creepers
Nothing useless

228
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,487
- What's the matter, honey?
- Oh, nothing.

229
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,073
Just restless, I guess.

230
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,201
Sure. I understand.
You like to travel.

231
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, I figured we'd make a little
trip, California or Bermuda or...

232
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,749
if it was May, we could go to
Washington, see the cherry trees.

233
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,586
- A honeymoon?
- That's what.

234
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,130
I'd almost marry you
to make the trip, Harry.

235
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:15,176
No kiddin' now, Margy. What do
you say? What do you say?

236
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,639
Well, I won't say anything
just now, Harry.

237
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,935
- Well, after the fair, maybe?
- Maybe.

238
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,812
(CHATTERING)

239
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,726
Wow!

240
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,434
Look at him, Marge!

241
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,486
(SQUEALING)

242
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,949
Holy cow! Gets bigger
every time I see him.

243
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,452
Biggest boar in the world, I bet.

244
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,076
All depends on how you spell it.

245
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,764
Eleanor can't go.

246
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,453
- Where's your mincemeat, Ma?
- Right here between my feet.

247
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:27,624
- Is the top on tight?
- Certainly, it's on tight.

248
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,959
- Why?
- Oh, nothin'.

249
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,084
Just don't want the flavor
to escape, that's all.

250
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,651
(MARCHING BAND)

251
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,001
(MAN SHOUTING, INDISTINCT)

252
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,641
- Hello, Miss Frake!
- Hello, there!

253
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,685
- How are you?
- Just fine.

254
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,395
We'll come see you as
soon as we get settled.

255
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,223
Yes, do that.

256
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,530
If Wayne doesn't come back soon to
take me around, I'm going by myself.

257
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,324
I do wish your father
would come to his breakfast.

258
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,744
If he'd rather stay with Blue
Boy than eat, well, let him.

259
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,496
But I've got
my whole day planned out.

260
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
Don't you know you can't
plan out a whole day?

261
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,869
- There's no such thing.
- I do it all the time.

262
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,377
You sound just like Harry. He thinks
you can plan out your whole life.

263
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,048
So you can.

264
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,756
Is that what he was
talking about yesterday?

265
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,179
Uh-huh.

266
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,929
Did you come to anything definite?

267
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,058
Uh-uh.

268
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,187
I don't know
what you're waiting for.

269
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,733
It would serve you right if Harry up and
married that Skidmore girl instead of you.

270
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,818
I almost hope he does.

271
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,236
Me too.

272
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,289
MAN: Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

273
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,375
Move in a little closer.
Don't be afraid.

274
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,546
Hurry, hurry! Play the game!
Three rings for a dime.

275
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,049
Prizes worth up to $20.

276
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,760
Positively no blanks. The prize
you win is the prize you get,

277
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,887
the prize you take away.

278
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,224
Don't any gentleman
want to try his skill?

279
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,143
Ain't nobody here
got the pioneer spirit?

280
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,270
I tell you what I'm going to do.

281
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:59,484
I'm goin' to put down three nice,
new, crisp one-dollar bills.

282
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,571
One here, one here, and one here.

283
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,908
Now, who will spend a dime
for three chances at $3.00?

284
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,326
Is that real money?

285
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,995
If you win 'em and you
don't like 'em, buddy,

286
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,198
I'll give you
a dollar apiece for 'em.

287
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,616
(LAUGHTER)

288
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,419
Hey, mister,
them hoops look mighty small.

289
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,256
- Do they fit over those things?
- Lots of people do it, sir.

290
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,883
- Lots of people do it.
- Yeah, I did it last year.

291
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,094
Remember me? I won a
pearl-handled revolver.

292
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,179
Well, now, there. You see?

293
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,598
Young Mr. Daniel Boone here
won a revolver off me

294
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,518
right at this very fair a year ago.

295
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,563
Bring down any grizzly bears
with that shootin' iron, sonny?

296
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,566
- (LAUGHING)
- Tell you what I'll do with you.

297
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,736
I'll just give you three rings on
the house to start things off.

298
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,782
Three chances for nothing.
I can't win. I can only lose.

299
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,452
But I love the game.

300
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,417
Remember, young man, you're
enjoying the courtesy of the house.

301
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,495
Don't cost us money.

302
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,300
(LAUGHS) I just lost $2.00!

303
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,803
But I'm having fun.
I love the game.

304
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,306
Here, my boy. I want you
to have a fair shake.

305
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,142
That ring looks warped.
Try this one.

306
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,471
This one's all right.

307
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,484
Well, well, you all see
how easy it is.

308
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,654
- Who else wants to try?
- I'll try again. Here's a dime.

309
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,283
- Who else wants a chance at a big prize?
- Here, mister, here's my dime.

310
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,827
How about you, sir? You look
like you've got a good aim.

311
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,830
- Why, you got a customer.
- Give me three rings. Here's my dime.

312
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,292
- He's trying to dodge the boy!
- (VOICES OVERLAPPING)

313
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,712
- All right, buddy. Here ya are.
- You didn't put any dollar bills back.

314
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,799
Ain't pearl necklaces and safety
razors good enough for ya?

315
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,719
Can't you enjoy the game
for the game's sake?

316
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,639
- Are ya money mad?
- (LAUGHTER)

317
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,683
Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll
win 'em anyway just to prove it.

318
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,852
(LAUGHS) Quite a character.

319
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,314
Step up, folks.
We're havin' fun here.

320
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,692
Just lost a pearl necklace,
but I'm laughing.

321
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,279
(LAUGHS) I love the game.

322
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,699
Why, the young man
is winnin' a fortune.

323
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,745
- Here you are, buddy.
- Look, pot metal molded in one piece.

324
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,664
What good's a vanity case
it won't even open?

325
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,207
Okay, fella, you had your fun.

326
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,375
Now, come on. Move along.

327
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,918
And those clocks,
they don't have any works.

328
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,044
What good are they?

329
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,963
Listen, kid, you know what
I'm payin' for this pitch?

330
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,173
- No. What?
- More dough than you'll ever see.

331
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,425
So you spend a dime,
take $3.00 in cash

332
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,719
and then try to tell the
public my prizes are no good!

333
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,596
Well, they aren't.
They're just a lot of junk.

334
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,307
Look, you, I've been nice
just long enough.

335
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,769
- Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman.
- WOMAN: Why don't you?

336
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,815
- What's that?
- I said, why don't you call a policeman?

337
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,067
He's only trying to bluff you.
The law says

338
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,528
he's got to sell you
all the rings you want.

339
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,489
- Otherwise, you can close up his place.
- Oh, a smart dame, huh?

340
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,367
A law student. Now, you listen
to me, Arsenic and Glamour,

341
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,203
- I don't know who you are...
- I'll tell you who I am.

342
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,998
My father's the chief
of police here.

343
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,293
- Your father is...
- The chief of police.

344
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,628
I was standing here
and saw the whole thing.

345
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,965
Say, how did you
get so good at this?

346
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,093
It's kind of a silly thing to be good at,
isn't it? But he made me sore last year.

347
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,429
I was trying for one of those
pearl-handled revolvers.

348
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,433
It cost me about $8.00. When I finally
did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all.

349
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,013
- It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy.
- Oh, ho!

350
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,064
- Defrauding the public, huh?
- Now, look, wait a minute.

351
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,942
I wouldn't have minded that so much,
but he kidded me in front of the crowd.

352
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,320
- So I...
- You practiced all year just to get even?

353
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,990
That's right. I figured I'd come back
and make as big a fool out of him

354
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,117
- as he made out of me.
- Oh, no, you don't.

355
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,327
Will you give him $8.00 back
if he promises to lay off?

356
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,289
- Look, you, I don't care who your father is.
- Okay.

357
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,583
Here. Here, here.

358
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,586
Here's your eight bucks,
and you don't come back, see?

359
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,672
- Is it a deal?
- Think it's all right to take it?

360
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,468
Well, sure, it's all right.
Here you are. Good-bye.

361
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,137
Good-bye!

362

- Oh, don't leave, folks. Prizes up to $20.

363
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,977
- Ah!
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

364
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,188
We're having fun here!

365
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,732
Gee, it was swell of you to stand
up for me like that. Thanks.

366
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,193
Well, that's all right.
He had it coming to him.

367
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,653
Well, uh, now that you helped
me get my money back,

368
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,905
how about helping me spend it?

369
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,158
- No, that won't be necessary.
- What about a frozen custard?

370
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,243
- No, thank you. I believe not.
- Hot dog?

371
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,788
No. Really, I have an appointment.
I'm late already.

372
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,373
Won't I see you again? How about tonight?
Will you be on the midway?

373
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,376
Tonight? Yes, I think so.

374
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,004
I hope so.
I'll sure be looking for you.

375
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,840
- Do that. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

376
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,401
You sure you won't change your mind?
How about some popcorn?

sitting in the seat behind?

- I thought you were...
- I changed my mind.

419
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,747
I was standing there
watching you walk away.

420
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,084
Every step you took, your hair bounced
up and down on the back of your neck.

421
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,838
It was really nice. I don't know if
that's what got me, but here I am.

422
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,132
Now it's your turn
to say something.

423
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,592
What can I say? I don't know you.

424
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,304
- I can arrange that.
- And all you know about me

425
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,181
is that my hair bounces
up and down when I walk.

426
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,893
- Everybody's hair bounces up and down.
- Mine doesn't.

00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,516
I mean, girls.

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,779
Well, look over there.

429
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,454
Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe
it was the way you held your shoulders.

430
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,909
- Walk away again. Let me see.
- All right.

431
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,133
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

432
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,469
- Where are you going?
- You told me to walk away.

433
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,179
- Yeah, but I...
- Really, I have to go anyway.

434
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,472
- Why?
- Well, I...

435
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,349
Well, what? What are you afraid of?

436
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,351
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.

437
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,603
Then what would be wrong with you
and me sitting down over there

438
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,854
and exchanging our ideas
of life over a Coke?

Nothing wrong. It's just that...

440
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,567
I'm not saying it's a great idea.
I'm just asking what's bad about it.

five minutes. What do you say?

Here we are, two people who
know nothing about each other.

Maybe we should. Maybe it would be
fun to find out what we're like.

444
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,212
- Maybe it'll be dull.
- What do we do if it's dull?

445
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,173
- We break it up.
- How do we do that?

00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,820
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

454
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:04,338
Hearing words
that I have never heard

455
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:10,387
From a man I've yet to meet

456
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,976
Now, with rolly coasters,
that's different. They're fun.

457
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,602
You oughta see the one in New York.

458
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,187
There's one in Chicago
that's pretty good.

459
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,689
There's one out at
the beach in Los Angeles.

460
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,900
It's not bad, but the one in New York,
the one across the river, that's the one.

461
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,320
- It's got a dip of 200 feet.
- You've been everywhere, haven't you?

462
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,698
Not yet. When I first
started out in this game,

463
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,825
I worked around
on different papers.

464
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,494
But now, I'm afraid the great Des
Moines Register's got me hog-tied.

465
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,538
Someday, I'll work on
a bigger paper though.

466
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm sure you will.

467
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,376
Well, I think I'd better go
the rest of the way alone.

468
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,337
I'd have a pretty hard time
explaining you to my folks.

469
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,632
Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody
has a hard time explaining me.

470
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,461
- See you again?
- Well, I...

471
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,471
Or would you like to say,
"Let's break it up"?

472
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,722
Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you?

473
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,644
Look, bobbylocks,
don't worry about me.

474
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,938
Anytime I wanna throw in the
sponge, you'll know it.

475
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,232
I just won't be around.

476
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,985
Well, I don't know what the
family's plans are for tonight.

477
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,112
- I don't know where I'll be.
- I'll find you.

478
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,239
- How?
- I'm a newspaperman.

479
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,909
It's my job to find the right
people at the right time.

480
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,863
You'll be seeing me. So long.

481
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,286
So long.

482
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,641
What's the matter with you?

483
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
What's the trouble, Blue Boy?

484
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,399
Ain't you feelin' good?

485
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,944
This ain't like you, son.

486
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,196
- Ain't sick, is he?
- Huh?

487
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:56,659
Sick? Oh, no, no.
He's in fine shape.

488
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,828
Just had a long trip. Kind of
resting up a bit, that's all.

489
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,997
Oh. I thought he was sick.

490
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,293
Oh, no. He's never
felt better in his life.

491
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,759
You see what a spectacle
you made of yourself?

492
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,970
What are people
gonna say about you?

493
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,305
- Hello, Hank.
- Hello, there.

494
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,349
- What you got this year?
- Never you mind.

495
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,352
She'll put anything you've got
in the shade. You wait and see.

496
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,313
- Come on. Get along, there. Get along.
- Hello, Hank.

497
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,649
Hello, there, Frake. How are ya?

498
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,693
Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh?

499
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,862
- And a good one too. Get in there.
- She's got nice color.

500
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,407
Well, she oughta have.
Her mother before her

501
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,867
was the most beautiful red
sow in the whole world.

502
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,995
- What's her name?
- Esmeralda.

503
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,291
- And she'll win the sweepstakes sure.
- (GRUNTING)

504
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,163
(GRUNTING)

505
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,850
Now you look like something.

506
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,103
I don't mind telling you, though,
you had me worried, son,

507
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,188
but I knew you'd come through.

508
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,642
Now you look like a real champion.

509
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,625
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Oh!

510
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,710
Why don't you look where you're goin'?
Gawking around like that,

511
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,795
people'll think you've never
been to a fair before.

512
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
I just thought we might meet
somebody we know.

513
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,051
- So what?
- Well, why are you looking around?

514
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,178
Who are you looking for?

515
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,806
I sort of had a half date, with
a guy I met here last year.

516
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,892
- Why don't you keep it?
- What would I do with you?

517
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,977
- Well, look, Wayne...
- MAN: I beg your pardon, sir.

518
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,146
- May I trouble you for a match?
- Sure.

519
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,066
- I think I have some right here.
- That's very kind of you.

520
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,314
Okay.

521
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,071
- Here you are. Thanks.
- Why don't you keep them?

522
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:01,116
- My brother has another pack.
- Sure, sure. Go ahead.

523
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,116
- That's okay.
- Thank you very much.

524
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,624
- You're certainly big with my matches.
- What do you care?

525
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,585
Your pockets are always
full of them.

526
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,339
Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your
date with that friend, I wouldn't mind.

527
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,007
- You wouldn't?
- No.

528
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,593
I hardly slept a wink
in that old truck last night.

529
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,762
What I really wanted to do
tonight was to go to bed early

530
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,972
but I didn't wanna disappoint you.

531
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,100
Oh, don't worry about me.

532
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,602
Uh, maybe you'd better.
You do look a little tired.

533
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,438
- And I can get back all right.
- Ah, that's swell, sis.

534
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,774
Thanks. I mean, get
a good rest now.

535
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,023
I will.

536
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,785
Hello.

537
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,788
MAN: Take home a beautiful
pennant from the state fair.

538
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,873
Come right over. Help yourself.

539
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,042
Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for
the chief of police's daughter.

540
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,962
- Have you seen her around here anyplace?
- His daughter?

541
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't believe I know her.

542
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,372
There's the chief over there.
Why don't you ask him?

543
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,424
Okay. Thank you.

544
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,395
- Good evening, Chief.
- Good evening, son. What can I do for you?

545
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,938
Could you tell me where
your daughter is?

546
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,815
I sort of had a date
to meet her here tonight.

547
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,276
- What?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a date.

548
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,361
She said... I mean, I told her...

549
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,407
Well, let's see.
She's around here somewhere.

550
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,700
Oh, Violet?

551
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,454
Yes, Daddy?

552
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,125
This young gentleman tells me you two
have a date to go out stepping tonight.

553
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,126
Huh?

554
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,421
Well, I guess I must
mean her sister.

555
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,590
I haven't got a sister.

556
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,042
(LAUGHTER)

557
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,344
Looks like someone's been
pulling your leg, my boy.

558
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,890
Yeah. That's a pretty good
joke on me, all right.

559
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,092
Well, thanks.

560
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,101
How many, please?

561
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,978
- Huh?
- How many tickets?

562
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,806
Oh. One.

563
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,425
MAN: And now for your favorite,

564
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,551
the lovely Emily Edwards,
and That's For Me.

565
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,424
(APPLAUSE)

566
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,730
Right

567
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:41,902
Between the eyes

568
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,405
Quite a belt

569
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,743
That blow I felt this morning

570
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,079
Fate

571
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,376
Gave me no warning

572
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,087
Great

573
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,423
Was my surprise

574
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,262
I saw you standing in the sun

575
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,891
And you were something to see

576
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,104
I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

577
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:23,278
And I said to myself that's for me

578
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,115
A lovely morning I remarked

579
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:32,744
And you were quick to agree

580
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,623
You wanted to walk
and I nodded my head

581
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,084
As I breathlessly said

582
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:43,422
That's for me

583
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:48,176
I left you standing under stars

584
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,598
The day's adventures are through

585
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,643
There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

586
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,770
And the dream in my heart

587
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:03,692
That's for you

588
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,403
Oh, my darling

589
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,654
That's for you

590
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,196
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

591
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,332
- There you are.
- Thank you.

592
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,878
- Who's that singing?
- That's Emily Edwards.

593
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,923
She's kind of cute,
but she's not my type.

594
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,634
She's a redhead.

595
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,470
Now, with brown hair,
that's different.

596
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,472
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.

597
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,557
- Hi, girls.
- How are you doin', honey?

598
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,513
- Quiet, you.
- I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you?

599
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,563
Well, in my racket, you know...

600
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:47,737
For you

601
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,523
(APPLAUSE)

602
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,463
- I, uh, just spoke to your father.
- My who?

603
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,924
Your father. You know,
the chief of police.

604
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,969
Oh, that. Didn't you know
I was kidding?

605
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,054
Well, I do now.

606
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,350
And just for that, you're gonna
have to have a drink with me.

607
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,522
When I first saw you up there,
I couldn't believe you were the same girl.

608
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,898
Why not? Was I that bad?

609
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,318
I didn't mean it that way.
You were good, wonderful.

610
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,656
That's just it. A girl singer like
you with Tommy Thomas's band,

611
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,826
I couldn't figure out why you went
to all that trouble today just for me.

612
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:40,330
- Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing wrong with me.

613
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,205
I mean, well, maybe there is,
but don't tell me.

614
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,626
- Like to dance?
- Uh-huh. Do you?

615
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:53,220
Sure. That's why
I brought it up. Sure.

616
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,968
- We can get our drinks later.
- All right.

MAN:
The big feature ride of the fair.

618
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:05,063
Get your tickets for the next ride.

619
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:10,777
This is the highest, fastest,
safest ride at the fairgrounds.

620

Get tickets now
for the big, fast ride.

621

- Come on. I dare you.
- I'm game.

622
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,655
- MAN: How many?
- Two, please.

624
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,305
- What you thinking about?
- Why?

625
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,099
Oh, you sort of had
a funny smile on your face.

626
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,518
- You really want to know?
- Uh-huh.

627
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,772
Well, I was just thinking about
you practicing all that time

628
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,650
with your mother's embroidery hoops
just to get even with somebody.

629
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,986
I guess you think I'm kind
of screwy, don't you?

630
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,489
No, I don't. I don't at all.

631
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,992
As a matter of fact,
I like that kind of a fellow.

632
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,162
That's lucky for me, because
I like the kind of a girl

633
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,457
who likes that kind of fellow.

Maybe it's more than the moon

Maybe it's more than the birds

651

Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

652

In a light too lovely for words

653
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,080
Maybe it's more than the earth

Shiny in silvery blue

655
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,713
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

656
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:38,049
Has something to do with you

I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

682

And I said to myself that's for me

683
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,990
A lovely morning I remarked

684
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,827
And you were quick to agree

685
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,038
You wanted to walk
and I nodded my head

686

- The day's adventures are through
- Ow!

There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

And the dream in my heart that's

692

Hey, cut that out!

I'll get you for that. You wait
and see now. You just wait.

You two sound like you had
a wonderful time last night.

- Sure did.
- Mmm, terrific.

Wish your father was enjoying himself
instead of brooding over that old pig.

Say, I thought you were going
to bed early last night.

702
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,268
Oh. Well, I was going to,
but I changed my mind.

703
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,354
I went for a ride
on the roller coaster.

- It's much better than it was last year.
- Oh, okay.

(LAUGHS)
I tell you, he's raring to go.

706
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,406
When I left him just now, he was
strutting around prouder than a peacock.

707
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,450
- You'd think he owned the place.
- Thank goodness.

708
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,619
Maybe now you'll
give me a little time.

709
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,954
Yes, sir, he's all right.
Wait till you see him.

There ain't a hog ever was or
ever will be that can touch him.

For what we're about to receive,
O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen.

- You said grace before, Daddy.
- Yeah.

713
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,802
I did? Well, I'm going to
keep on saying it all day.

00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,713
Quiet, please!

761
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,842
We are now ready to announce
the awards. Sweet pickles.

762
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:08,936
First prize to Mrs. Edwin
Metcalfe of Pottsville.

763
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,278
Second prize to...

764
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,572
To Mrs. Agnes Field

765
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,867
of Arcadia.

766
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,030
Sour pickles.

767
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,416
First prize to

768
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:35,920
Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

769
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,499
Oh, Mother.

770
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:48,684
Second prize to
Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.

771
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,108
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

772
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,695
Quiet, please. As you know,

773
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:05,324
we occasionally give a plaque
for distinguished achievement.

774
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,162
(CLEARS THROAT)
As you are doubtlessly aware,

775
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:13,332
this plaque is only given
in rare cases.

776
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,461
And on this occasion,
my colleagues and I

777
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,671
have voted unanimously

778
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:23,134
that it be given to a lady who has
concocted the most delicious,

779
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:27,764
the most succulent
and spiciest mincemeat

780
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,516
ever entered in a state fair.
(HICCUPS)

781
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,437
- (GASPS)
- The lady who wins this distinction

782
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:40,276
is none other than Mrs.
Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

783
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:44,527
- Oh, Mother! Oh!
- Congratulations. I'm so glad.

784
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,789
I've got the most a woman
can get in life, Margy.

785
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,745
- If I think any more about it, I'll cry.
- Stand where you are, please.

786
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,588
Hold it. Thank you.

787
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,964
Thank you very much, ladies.

788
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,175
Your picture will appear in the
Register tomorrow morning.

789
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,052
Good day.

790
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,430
- See, Mother? You're famous.
- I'm worn out.

791
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,599
I'm going up to the trailer
and lie down.

792
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,228
I never knew what a strain it was
to get something you really wanted.

793
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,396
- I'll take these, dear.
- Oh, my hat too.

794
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,441
Now you run along
and enjoy yourself.

795
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,993
My horse is number 8,
Tessie In the green shirt.

796
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,832
Come on, Tessie! Come on!

797
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,177
Get up there. Come on!

798
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,426
Attagirl, Tessie.
Pass her! Pass her!

799
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,769
Attagirl, Tess!

800
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,145
Oh, she made it!

801
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,395
She won! She won!
Oh, Pat, your horse won!

802
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,418
(ORCHESTRA, SLOW)

803
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,963
it can't be much fun for you

804
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,924
just hanging around waiting
to catch me between songs.

805
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,342
Can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.

806
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,468
(MUSIC ENDS)

807
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,347
Anyway, we can... I mean, can
we go someplace after the show?

808
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,641
I thought maybe we'd have
something to eat or something.

809
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,476
Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.

810
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,937
- It's Marty's birthday.
- Who's Marty?

811
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,482
The boy I sing with in the band. We're
giving a surprise party for him.

812
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,151
Wouldn't you like to come?

813
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,612
I was kind of counting
on being alone with you.

814
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,779
(ORCHESTRA)

815
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,323
I know. I'd like that better too.

816
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,700
But this is a party
we cooked up a week ago.

817
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,827
We're giving it in my rooms
at the hotel

818
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,456
- so I can't very well back out now.
- MAN: Hey, Emily.

819
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:02,168
- They're playing the introduction.
- All right, Marty.

820
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,337
Now don't go away.
I'll be right back.

821
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,214
Okay, let's go.

822
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,431
Listen, kids, I got
the greatest number here...

823
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,683
McGee, if you ever scare me
like that again...

824
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,771
I got the greatest number I ever plugged,
and I'm gonna give you first crack at it.

825
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,273
Buzz off, McGee. We're busy.

826
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,524
Eh, just like all singers,
they don't like songs.

827
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,703
- Hi, buddy.
- Hello.

828
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,290
- You in the music business?
- No. I'm a farmer.

829
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,337
A farmer. What a night I'm having.

830
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,422
Well, uh, you're a friend
of Emily's, ain't ya?

831
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,548
That's right.

832
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:53,344
- My name's McGee.
- My name's Wayne Frake.

833
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,805
- You in the music business?
- Yeah, I'm a song plugger.

834
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,891
- I work on songs till they get popular.
- How do you mean work on 'em?

835
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,227
I thought songs got popular
because people like 'em.

836
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,981
That's naive. How can people like
a song if they don't hear it?

837
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,691
You got to get the big
singers to sing it first.

838
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,900
How do you do that?

839
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,487
There's all kinds of ways,
and none of them is easy.

840
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,408
You got no idea what a snook like me has
to do to get a song on the hit parade.

841
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,910
Last week I fell down in
front of Dinah Shore's taxi

842
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,787
just to get in
conversation with her.

843
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:23,499
Every Christmas, I got to remember
to send Sinatra a new bow tie.

844
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,418
When a bandleader's
wife has a baby,

845
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,587
I gotta stay home with it
on the nurse's night out.

846
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,298
It's a big question whether Mairzy
Doats would have been a hit

847
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,427
if I hadn't had known
how to change a "didey."

848
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,930
- Is that a new song you got there?
- Yeah, and it's a honey.

849
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,516
A natural for your friend Emily.

850
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,269
You wouldn't wanna help me
get it to her, would ya?

851
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,269
I am not at all niggardly
when it comes to payola.

852
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,476
- Payola?
- Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it.

853
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:55,948
The man who wrote this song is
starving in an attic in Brooklyn.

854
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,617
His wife ran out on him,
left him penniless with two kids.

855
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,663
She even took the piano with her
so now he can't write no more.

856
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:07,001
If this song ain't a hit, there's
only one thing left for this man,

857
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,294
the river.

858
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,090
On the other hand, if somebody was to
get a great artist like Emily Edwards

859
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,676
to introduce it with
a band on the radio,

860
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:20,223
this man's fortune would be made and
his genius preserved for posterity.

861
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,683
How do you know he ain't
another Stephen Foster?

862
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,394
- I don't. Only...
- Just read those words.

863
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,648
Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum
the tune so you can see how they fit.

864
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,193
Follow me. (TAPPING FOOT)

865
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,395
(HUMMING)

866
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,154
Right there.

867
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,659
(CONTINUES)

868
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:49,376
ALL: It's a grand night for singing

869
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,172
The stars are bright above

870
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:57,218
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

871
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:01,222
I think I am falling in love

872
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,307
Falling

873
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:07,311
Falling in love

874
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,148
Maybe it's more than the moon

875
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,111
Maybe it's more than the birds

876
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,614
Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

877
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,077
In a light too lovely for words

878
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,455
Maybe it's more than the earth

879
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:31,127
Shiny in silvery blue

880
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,880
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

881
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,551
Has something to do with you

882
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:43,013
It's a grand night for singing

883
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,809
The stars are bright above

884
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:51,021
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

885
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:55,484
I think I am falling in love

886
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,570
Falling

887
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,531
Falling in love

888
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,985
La, la, la, la, la, la

889
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,913
- Hey, where's my drink?
- Let's see what else we've got here.

890
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,082
Look, Wayne, how about
your singing a chorus?

891
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,043
No, thanks. You're doing
all right without me.

892
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,255
- But I want them to hear you.
- You can't be as good as she says.

893
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,758
- You'd be surprised. Come on.
- No, really.

894
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,094
Come on. Don't tell me
we have to coax you.

895
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,221
How about singing one
of those corn-fed ditties

896
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,599
you guys sing around
these little towns?

897
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,226
- Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like.
- Yeah, you can't tell.

898
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,604
You might have something
we can use with the band.

899
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,107
As a matter of fact, if you need a new song,
I've got one right here I like very much.

900
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,818
He didn't expect to sing, but
he brought his music with him.

901
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,487
(LAUGHTER)

902
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,948
- Would you like to try it with me?
- You do it yourself.

903
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,949
- Did you write it?
- No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me.

904
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,747
- Okay, bud.
- Okay, bud.

905
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:50,831
(PIANO)

906
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,124
This ought to be something.

907
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:57,296
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

908
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,008
Maybe I'm not the boy
of your dreams

909
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:05,221
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

910
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,974
Swapping romantic gleams

911
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,728
Maybe you're not a girl
to have and to hold

912
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,398
Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay

913
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,444
But isn't it kind of fun
carousing around the town

914
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:24,281
Dancing the night away

915
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:28,077
Isn't it kind of fun holding hands

916
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,997
According to a sweet
and corny custom

917
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,876
Isn't it kind of fun making vows

918
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,922
Admitting that we both
intend to bust 'em

919
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,926
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy

920
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,304
Kidding across a table for two

921
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,517
But haven't you got a hunch
that this is the real McCoy

922
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,229
And all the things
we tell each other

923
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,478
Are true

924
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,487
I'm not a girl
for sentimental tripe

925
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,366
I never go for the Romeo type

926
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:11,120
Over a dewy-eyed Juliet

927
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,040
No one has seen me drool yet

928
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,544
I don't say our hearts are tied

929
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,548
By love's eternal tether

930
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:27,678
But using words less dignified

931
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,557
Isn't it kind of fun to be together

932
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:35,227
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

933
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:39,064
Maybe I'm not the girl
of your dreams

934
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:43,027
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

935
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:46,822
Swapping romantic gleams

Dancing the night away

940
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:06,300
Oh, isn't it kind
of fun holding hands

941
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:10,179
According to a sweet
and corny custom

942

Kidding across a table for two

946
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,698
- But haven't you got a hunch
- That this is the real McCoy

947
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,285
And all the things
we tell each other

948

Are true

949
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,627
- Wonderful.
- That was great.

950
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,838
You know, you're right about
that song, Wayne. I like it too.

951
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,216
- You do?
- "Billings Publishing Company," huh?

952
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,385
- A guy named McGee give you this?
- That's right.

953
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,095
How much did he slip you
for plugging it tonight?

954
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,304
Wait a minute, Marty!

955
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,430
He didn't slip me anything.

956
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,140
Didn't he promise to come
through with the old payola?

957
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,477
- He used that expression.
- I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily.

958
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,396
Your boyfriend cashing in on you.

959
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,765
(WOMEN GASP)

960
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,611
- MAN: How do you like that?
- EMILY: Wayne!

961
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,906
Wayne.

962
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,909
Wayne, wait a minute.

963
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,328
I'm sorry, Emily.
I just couldn't help it.

964
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,330
He's been putting in digs
ever since I got here.

965
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,705
I know he was asking for it,
but please don't go.

966
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,629
You don't think I'd cash in on being
friends with you like he said, do you?

967
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,008
Of course not. And he wouldn't have
said it, only he's had a few drinks.

968
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,053
- Please come back.
- It just wouldn't work, Emily.

969
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,053
I'd let him have it the first
time he opened his mouth.

970
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,183
Look. Why don't you
walk around the block?

971
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,388
Give me a chance to get rid
of them. How about that?

972
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,524
I'd hate to have you
break up the party.

973
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,359
I'll tell them I have a headache.

974
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,358
When you come back, we'll be alone.

975
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,989
That's the way
you wanted it, isn't it?

976
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,621
- Okay. How long?
- Come back in half an hour.

977
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,040
Emily, I...

978
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,268
- Half an hour.
- Make it 15 minutes.

979
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,233
All right.

980
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,136
Only a few stars left.

981
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,765
Yeah, and they look kind of tired.

982
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,059
Funny how a day creeps on.

983
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,437
So slowly at first
you think it's never coming.

984
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,191
Then all of a sudden,
it spreads out over the sky,

985
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,315
the sun starts shining.

986
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,818
People loom up like that too.

987
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:21,119
Are you really gonna go home and
marry that guy you're engaged to?

988
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,832
That's what girls usually do, isn't it?
Marry the men they're engaged to.

989
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,661
Yeah. They're usually
sorry afterward.

990
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,965
Think you'll every marry?

991
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,760
Who, me? Sure. Sometime.

992
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,763
Only trouble is, if I ever found
a girl I cared that much about,

993
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,975
I'd care too much about it to
wish a guy like me off on her.

994
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:47,646
- Sounds kind of hopeless.
- I guess it is.

995
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,148
It's pretty hard for me
to picture myself,

996
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,484
what do they call it,
popping the question.

997
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,654
Can you imagine me suddenly turning
to some girl and blurting out,

998
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,198
"Will you marry me?"

999
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,790
No. I can see you wouldn't.

1000
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,711
Well, bobbylocks, you've
made a very wise decision.

1001
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:14,792
Anyway, I'd be no good
for you, no good at all.

1002
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,920
Of course, you'd be
awfully good for me.

1003
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,724
Say, what about your old man's hog?

1004
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,605
Aren't they gonna judge
him this afternoon?

1005
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:31,224
Oh, yes. I guess
I'd better be going.

1006
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,194
- Wayne's probably in already.
- it's getting pretty late.

1007
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:40,616
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No. It's better if you don't.

1008
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,118
- Will I see you tonight?
- In front of the roller coaster?

1009
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,411
8:30.

1010
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,498
Well, I...

1011
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:58,376
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

1012
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,182
- Pat?
- Yes?

1013
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:10,514
I was only talking. I couldn't
marry anybody but you, ever.

1014
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,583
Well, Blue Boy,
this is the great day,

1015
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,161
your hour of judgment.

1016

Now take it easy there now.
Don't get your face dirty.

1017
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,513
Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already
won. There's his blue ribbon.

1018
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,307
Oh, that thing?
That's only the class award.

1019
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,268
That means he's won
his class of senior boars.

1020
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm getting him ready now to go
in for the grand championship.

1021
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,733
- Is he all right?
- All right? Why, just look at him.

- You too, Blue Boy.

- All right. Bye. See you later.

Is that a new dress?

an early start in the morning.

It's about that judge, the fella
that gave you the plaque.

01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:43,708
- And her strawberry jam and her pie
- Pie, pie, pie, pie

1216
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:47,879
- I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe
- Oh

1217
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,049
So I think I'll start
in owing Idaho

1218
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,218
Better stay

1219
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,429
Better stay

1220
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,723
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry if you go

1221
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,224
Don't I know

1222
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,477
When you leave your native state

1223
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,645
You'll be feeling far from great

1224
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:11,695
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

1225
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,493
I owe Ioway for her ham
and her beef and her lamb

1226
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,954
And her strawberry jam and her pie

1227
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,833
I owe Ioway more
than I can ever pay

1228
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,419
So I think I'll move
to Californ-i-ay

1229
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,798
I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A!

1230
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,879
Hooray! Ioway! Yea!

1231
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,438
What do you think of this
imitation champagne, Ma?

1232
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,149
First time I ever tried it,
and I love it.

1233
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,443
It's as good as that
French champagne any day.

1234
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,818
- Did you ever taste French champagne?
- No.

1235
01:23:58,825 --> 01:23:59,951
Who's that little runt?

1236
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,450
- Hmm?
- What's he grinning at?

1237
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:13,172
That's Mr. Hippenstahl,
the pickle and mincemeat judge.

1238
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,550
Oh. Oh!

1239
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,302
(CHUCKLES)
Well, that explains it. He's drunk!

1240
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,430
- Quiet, Pa.
- Come on, Ma.

1241
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,555
- Let's get out on the midway.
- All right.

1242
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,344
(ORCHESTRA)

1243
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:32,984
Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the
plug you gave that song last night.

1244
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:36,654
It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily
to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night.

1245
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,531
- Chicago?
- Yeah. That's their next date,

1246
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,074
the Palmer House.

1247
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,159
I'm going with them
on the plane tonight.

1248
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,829
Sticking close so they
won't change their mind.

1249
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,249
Emily didn't say she was... I didn't
figure on them leaving tonight.

1250
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,419
Sure, right after the show.

1251
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,922
I wish she'd hurry up and get
out here. I wanna talk to her.

1252
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,009
Kind of went overboard for
each other, didn't you, kid?

1253
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,678
- Kind of.
- She told me.

1254
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,681
Oh, they all tell me everything.

1255
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,184
- You going back to the farm soon?
- Tomorrow.

1256
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,514
That'll be good.

1257
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,148
(KNOCKING)

1258
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,941
Come in.

1259
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,901
- Oh, hello.
- I was just on my way out.

1260
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,363
- I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase?
- Suitcase? What for?

1261
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:23,242
The old man just phoned from Chicago.
He's gonna give you a crack at that job.

1262
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,537
- The Eastern syndicate?
- That's right. A column of your own.

1263
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,206
- I can't believe it.
- He's leaving for the coast in the morning

1264
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,959
and he wants you to fly up to
Chicago and talk to him tonight.

1265
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,420
- That means the 8:30 plane.
- How much time have I got?

1266
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:37,921
Practically none. I'm holding a taxi
downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.

1267
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,763
- Hey, wait!
- What's the matter?

1268
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:46,891
I can't leave now. I've got a girl
waiting for me out at the fair.

1269
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,560
- What'll I do?
- Do? Get another girl in Chicago.

1270
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,771
A girl waiting at the fair.

1271
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:55,441
I break my neck getting this chance for you
and you start yapping about some girl.

1272
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,611
- This is different. This is not just a girl.
- I know. She's wonderful.

1273
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,906
Only girl in the world. And I
suppose this job is just a job.

1274
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,991
The kind that comes up every day.

1275
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,952
Look, I wanna make something
very clear to you, sonny-boy.

1276
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,454
The old man is funny.

1277
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:11,248
When he wants you someplace,
you better, or you're through.

1278
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,959
- I know that, but...
- Do you want this job or don't you?

1279
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,414
You've got about two minutes
to make up your mind.

1280
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,087
Thank you very much.

1281
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:25,763
- What did she say?
- She sees a lot of money coming my way.

1282
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:30,142
- Good. I can use some.
- I don't think it'll do you much good.

1283
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,979
She says I'm going
to marry three times.

1284
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,065
MAN: There they are, folks,

1285
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:38,401
the eight fugitives
from the Follies.

1286
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:41,946
They did a little dance in New York,
but the police commissioner objected.

1287
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:45,324
He demanded that they take
certain things out of the dance.

1288
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:49,120
Understand? Well, rather than
do the emasculated version,

1289
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:54,125
they come out here to give you the
original dance with nothing cut out.

1290
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,920
Just to prove to you what you're
gonna see on the inside...

1291
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,297
Okay, Mike, let her rip!

1292
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:01,499
(BAND PLAYING)

1293
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:24,488
- Do you want to go in?
- Huh?

1294
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,408
It means nothing to me,
but if you'd like to see it,

1295
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:30,783
I'd be glad to take you in, hmm?

1296
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:33,865
Hmm?

1297
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,618
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

1298
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:50,556
What do you think?
Of course, like I say,

1299
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,976
it means nothing to me
unless you wanna go in.

1300
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,271
- You do? Come on.
- (CHUCKLES)

1301
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,564
Two, please.

1302
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:03,486
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, we are.

1303
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,734
That's good.

1304
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,617
What's that old buzzard
doing, following you around?

1305
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:14,699
Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing
the fair, having fun, same as we are.

1306
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,500
MAN: All aboard. Train now leaving.

1307

Get tickets for this ride.
Another train coming in.

1308
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:26,175
Get your tickets for that high,
fast ride through the sky,

1309
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:29,136
on the big roller coaster

WAYNE: But last night and all the
things we said, was that just kidding?

1312
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,106
- (ORCHESTRA)
- EMILY: No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.

1313
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,777
Well, it certainly wasn't with me.
I thought that...

1314
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,614
Oh, what's the difference
what I thought?

1315
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,409
But, Wayne, darling, I thought
you understood that...

1316
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,496
Well, after all, we were just
two people who met at a fair...

1317
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,039
And fell in love, didn't we?

1318
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,288
Well, that was something
I hadn't bargained for.

1319
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,581
Wayne, will you believe something?
Just one thing.

1320
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,758
It's every bit as hard for me
to give you up as it is for...

1321
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:11,595
Well, then why do it?
Why give each other up?

1322
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,930
Why don't you come with me,

1323
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,890
meet my father and mother
and go home with us tomorrow?

1324
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:19,103
- Because I can't, Wayne. I...
- Hey, Emily.

1325
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,932
- You ready?
- No, she isn't!

1326
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,646
I'll be right in, Marty.

1327
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,777
Wait here, Wayne.
I have to tell you something,

1328
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,450
something I should have
told you before,

1329
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,747
and I would have, if I
hadn't been such a coward.

1330
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,876
Please, wait, Wayne. Please.

(EMILY SINGING)

1333
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,766
You mind if I say something?

1334
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,854
- Such as what?
- First, let me get something straight.

1335
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:09,528
When you said that about
taking Emily home with you,

1336
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,698
did you mean the works,
a wedding ring and all?

1337
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:16,153
That's it, the works. And
that's the way it's gonna be.

1338
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:20,248
Look, I'll give it to you quick.

1339
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,495
She's married.
She's got a husband, see?

1340
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,005
He don't work at it very hard.

1341
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,674
They split up about a year ago.

1342
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,844
He claims he's a songwriter,
but he's just no good at it.

1343
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,390
As a matter of fact,
he's just no good, period.

1344
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:46,775
She liked him, though. Sort of
knocked her out for a while.

1345
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:51,105
Come to think of it, you're the first
guy she's looked at since then.

1346
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:55,699
I guess I just don't understand
the people in your business.

1347
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,369
Take my word, they're the
same as anybody else.

1348
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,789
They make mistakes, sure,
but don't everybody?

1349

Are all the people
in your town perfect?

1350
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,169
Why didn't she tell me?

1351
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,838
She told you why.

1352
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:12,292
She didn't want
to spoil everything.

1353
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,388
Maybe she figured she had a right
to a little happiness too.

1354
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,102
You know what you and me
need right now?

48! Who's next?

1360
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:42,955
Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.

1361
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,124
Not bad, huh? Thank you.

1362
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,960
But you didn't ring the bell,
though. Ho, ho, ho.

1363
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,546
I know I didn't ring the
bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.

1364
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:53,590
- Who can? Can you?
- I don't know. I never tried.

1365
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,427
- Why don't you?
- I don't know, but I will.

1366
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:59,930
Step right up, neighbor.
Step right up.

1367
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:02,766
- It's kind of heavy, isn't it?
- Allow me.

1368
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,103
- Thank you.

1369
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:08,939
Now, I suppose the idea is
to lean your weight on it.

1370
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,611
- Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it.

Come on, Ma. I'm tired.
Let's go home.

1373
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,749
I suppose it's too late to stop
someplace for a cup of coffee.

1374
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,998
Who said it was too late?

1375
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,640
- Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.
- I'm okay.

1376
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,893
Sure, you are.

1377
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:49,938
What about this Eleanor,
the girl from back home?

1378
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,483
You say you graduated
from school together, huh?

1379
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:56,111
Yep. She's a fine girl too.

1380
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,322
What does she look like, redhead?

1381
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:02,326
- Nope. Blond.
- Oh. I like the redheads.

1382
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:05,746
There's a redhead
lives on the floor below me.

1383
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,373
What a dish! I keep thinking,

1384
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:13,003
I'll get off the elevator at the
wrong floor, but I never do.

1385
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,505
Why not? Why don't you?

1386
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:18,131
And have my wife make
a cripple out of me for life?

like it used to.

1390
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:35,359
Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?
She's a girl I went to school with.

1391
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,778
- Yes. I know. I know.
- Wonderful!

you'll know it. I just won't be around.

when I've been as tired.

1401

It's that resting
you did at the fair, Ma.

1402

Three days' rest
will tire anybody out.

You're crying like there was
never gonna be another fair.

We'll be back next year.

- I never want to see another fair.
- You can say that again.

You meet a lot of people
who play you for a sucker

and have some laughs
at your expense.

When the fair's over, what?

1415
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,603
Just chalk it up to
experience, I guess.

1416
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:20,190
Sure, that's why you go
to a fair, experience.

coming home in grand style.

I got the grand award,

for the best boar in the state.

bad happened to any of us.

happened we don't know about.

None of that now.
Come across. $5.00.

- Yes!

Thank you, Mrs. Frake.
Believe I will.

He looks a little down.

toward the hotel or the Elk's hall?
