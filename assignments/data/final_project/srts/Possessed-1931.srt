1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:14,850
The beast that ascended
out of the bottomless pit

3
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,253
Shall make war against them

4
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:19,355
And shall overcome them

5
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:20,856
And kill them,

6
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:22,358
And their dead bodies

7
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,361
Shall lie in the street
of the great city.

8
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:30,266
Sister, we're all aware
of the book of revelations.

9
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:33,369
You can twist those words
to mean almost anything.

10
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,121
Right here
in Los Angeles,

11
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,707
15 people have been
brutally murdered.

12
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,876
All over the country,

13
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,953
Cult killings
are spreading.

14
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,830
They're signs
of his work.

15
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,600
Sister,
this is the 20th century.

16
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,303
So one mustn't mention Satan
in polite company.

17
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,807
His power is growing.

18
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:55,307
His power is growing.

19
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,310
All of these bodies
have been marked...

20
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,929
Inverted pentagrams...
his sign.

21
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,934
We appreciate the intensity
of your beliefs.

22
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,138
But the last thing
the church needs

23
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,491
Is to stir up
more sensationalism

24
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,293
About devil worship.

25
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:18,363
Otherwise, we may all
end up on Geraldo.

26
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:22,885
No, I believe it's best

27
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:24,887
If you return
to your convent,

28
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,123
And in seclusion,
meditate less on the devil

29
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:32,044
And more on the virtues
of our lord Jesus Christ.

30
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,131
Especially the virtue
of humility.

31
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:39,635
Thank you.

32
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,332
Yeah.

33
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:13,085
I know where
he's going next.

34
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,887
Listen, lady...

35
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:18,590
The marks are always
exactly 6 inches in diameter.

36
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,093
The wound is always
at the center.

37
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,394
Keep going.

38
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,096
One condition...

39
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,397
No killing

40
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,099
And no death penalty
either.

41
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,101
Ok. Whatever you say.

42
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,069
Swear it.

43
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,738
You got it.

44
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,040
What's your name?

45
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,742
Near sunset boulevard.

46
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:41,246
The south entrance
to elysian park.

47
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,747
When?

48
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,049
Soon.

49
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:47,252
Don't forget
your promise, Logan.

50
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,790
Sleeper?

51
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,296
Nothing.

52
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:33,799
Even a psycho fucking killer
is smart enough

53
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,301
To stay out of the rain.

54
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:36,802
To stay out of the rain.

55
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,925
How are
my lovebirds doing?

56
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,233
Hey, Carmen,

57
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,319
How about a nightcap
later?

58
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,621
Dream on.

59
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,472
It's too bad, Carmen.

60
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:59,124
Watching your ass

61
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,827
Is the only thing
keeping me awake up here.

62
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:17,342
3-Lincoln-7.

63
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,145
Franklin.

64
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:22,247
All positions clear.

65
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,299
See? 3 nights
of this shit.

66
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,351
Everybody's
burned out.

67
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:29,855
The broad on the phone
is his girlfriend,

68
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,156
Setting us up, ok?

69
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:34,359
You know these serial
freaks love mind games.

70
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,160
Trust me.

71
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,862
She wasn't his girlfriend.

72
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,531
He'll show.

73
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:41,883
That's all you've been
saying for 3 days.

74
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,236
"He'll show." You ought
to put that to music.

75
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,538
You know what
your problem is, Ollie?

76
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:50,242
All this mumbo-Jumbo occult
bullshit's got you spooked.

77
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:51,543
Shh...

78
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,745
Guy's got you thinking
he's the bogeyman

79
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,247
Or the ku klux klan.

80
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:56,298
Fuck you.

81
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:58,000
That's
"fuck you, sir."

82
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,414
What the fuck?

83
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:29,915
What the fuck?

84
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,417
Pull it over.

85
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,434
Is this a stakeout
or a fucking parade?

86
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,436
That what you call it?

87
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,354
I call it a jerkoff.

88
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:53,856
Russ, you asked
for 72 hours.

89
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,058
I gave 'em to you.
Nothing happened.

90
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:57,242
Look, I told you

91
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,244
I didn't know when
it was going down.

92
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,946
But this location fits
the pentagram pattern.

93
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,447
My informant says

94
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:04,975
This is where
he's gonna strike next.

95
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,202
I can't risk it anymore.
It's too thin.

96
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,004
I got 18 men sitting here,

97
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,323
But he's liable to hit
on the west side tonight.

98
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,224
Hey, Russ.
They lost Carmen.

99
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:14,826
Park side,
north of sunset.

100
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:15,327
Park side,
north of sunset.

101
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:17,462
Jesus.

102
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:29,091
Well, she's probably
just taking a piss.

103
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:29,541
Well, she's probably
just taking a piss.

104
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,396
Heaven in art,
which father our...

105
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:59,287
Shh.

106
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,758
It's all right.

107
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,262
I don't want you
to be afraid.

108
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:08,564
If you're afraid,

109
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:11,266
I won't be able
to help you.

110
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,774
Pulled her
into a car.

111
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:19,274
Pulled her
into a car.

112
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,077
Nobody came down
toward sunset.

113
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:24,780
Up there's the entrance
to the park.

114
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,581
Park?

115
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,282
Yeah.
It's locked.

116
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,172
We're just...

117
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:53,675
Going to go through
a very small door...

118
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,177
Here.

119
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,188
Here.

120
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:06,688
Here.

121
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,342
We're going to go through
backwards.

122
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,694
That's why I say
the prayers in reverse.

123
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,196
Heaven,
in art which father our...

124
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:17,699
Our father,
which art in heaven.

125
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,334
Do you understand?

126
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:19,835
Do you understand?

127
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,357
Take the road.

128
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,416
Shh.

129
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,432
Shh.

130
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:05,307
It's all right.

131
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,501
Piggy, piggy.

132
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:57,695
Aah!

133
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:09,474
Aah!

134
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:10,575
Aah.

135
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,960
Aah!

136
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,470
Hyah!

137
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,622
You son of a bitch!

138
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,274
You motherfucker!

139
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:27,976
How does it feel, huh?

140
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,978
How does it feel?

141
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:33,648
Logan!

142
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:35,850
Come on. Logan.

143
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,101
Go easy.

144
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,353
You got him.

145
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,660
Holy shit!

146
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,162
Get an ambulance!

147
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,864
13-843,
no warrant on suspect.

148
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:51,166
352 clear.

149
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:52,667
Detective Russell Logan

150
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,710
Has been taken off
the critical list

151
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,754
After a dramatic
life-And-Death struggle

152
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,056
In the early
morning hours.

153
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,875
This is the third time
in less than 5 years

154
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,677
That Logan
has been responsible

155
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:04,879
For the death or capture
of a serial killer.

156
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,880
Coworkers described

157
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,882
Alleged
pentagram killer,

158
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:08,883
Patrick Channing,

159
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:09,684
A 9-Year employee

160
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,286
Of the department
of water and power,

161
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,889
As quiet, solitary,
good at his job.

162
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,894
Freak used to work
in this place?

163
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:21,696
It gives me the creeps

164
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:24,032
To think he had anything to do
with the water supply.

165
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,035
I’ll stick to bottled water
from now on, thank you.

166
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:32,874
Detective Logan,

167
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,076
Do you think you'll get
the death penalty?

168
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,519
You better believe it.

169
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,962
There he is!

170
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,724
How's it going,
Russ?

171
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,226
Stomach ok?

172
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,533
Not gonna let these pussies
wimp out on me, are you?

173
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,486
If a twisted scumbag like me
doesn't deserve the big one,

174
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:02,487
Who does?

175
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,657
Right on.
I'm with you, pal.

176
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:08,993
I knew I could
count on you, Russ.

177
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,495
I owe you one.

178
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:14,999
See you around, buddy boy.

179
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,501
I doubt it.

180
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:19,254
Come on, franklin,
take it easy.

181
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:21,756
It's not a twist-Off,
you know.

182
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:22,624
Whoa!
Woo!

183
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,125
Hey!
Yeah!

184
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,127
Harold, it'll help
your hemorrhoids.

185
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,629
Come on.
Give it to me!

186
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:28,630
Hey, come on!

187
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,632
Sister Agnes,
I’m sorry, you know.

188
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:32,634
Logan, it's for you.

189
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:33,635
Yeah. Coming.

190
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:34,436
Classic vintage.

191
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,137
What is this,
early Thursday?

192
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:37,138
Yes, sir.
Drink up.

193
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,140
Logan. Shoot.

194
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:40,642
I warned you.

195
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:42,644
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to sp...

196
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:43,945
Jesus.

197
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,147
I'm sorry.
You'll have to speak up.

198
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:47,649
I warned you.

199
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:49,651
No death penalty.

200
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,153
Stop it before
it's too late.

201
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:54,656
What...hold...

202
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,829
Left one's a little loose.

203
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:53,047
Adios, creep.

204
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,577
It's just after-Shocks.

205
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,580
It's like a chicken
with his head cut off.

206
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:16,347
Get him!

207
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:32,730
Jack!

208
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,787
Getting a little jumpy,
huh, jack?

209
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:31,923
Aah!

210
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:32,423
Aah!

211
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:59,116
Detective Logan,
are you in there?

212
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,520
Headquarters needs you.
There's an emergency.

213
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,622
They'll have to wait.
Send the evidence techs.

214
00:23:04,822 --> 00:23:06,624
I got a fucking
blood bath in my...

215
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:14,749
Sir, they told us to
bring you immediately.

216
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:29,764
It's Carmen, man.

217
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:37,772
Freaks brought her back
to the same place.

218
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:15,893
Go to hell, lady!

219
00:24:59,186 --> 00:24:59,987
Are you all right?

220
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:01,689
You could have
been killed.

221
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:05,076
Yeah. Thank you.

222
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:07,078
I'm sorry.

223
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,092
Good-Looking broad,
nice threads,

224
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,710
Doesn't look
like a nut,

225
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,512
Says she knows
who did it,

226
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,864
And she'll only talk
to you, man.

227
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:29,216
Let's give the lady
what she wants.

228
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:43,614
Detective Logan,
miss...

229
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:44,115
Detective Logan,
miss...

230
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,118
Seaton.
Tess Seaton.

231
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,421
I didn't want to
come here,

232
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:53,124
But I didn't know
what else to do.

233
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:55,626
Well, you did
the right thing.

234
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:57,128
Sit down, please.

235
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:02,750
Why don't you
tell me what you know

236
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,252
About
the officer's death.

237
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:09,390
You seem frightened,
miss Seaton.

238
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,892
You really don't know,
do you?

239
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:15,012
You really don't know
who killed her.

240
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:16,514
Why don't you tell me?

241
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:18,816
The pentagram killer.

242
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:22,069
Patrick Channing,
the pentagram killer.

243
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:26,073
I don't have time
to play games.

244
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,375
Games?

245
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:29,076
You talk
about games?

246
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:30,378
I saw you on TV

247
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:32,079
Celebrating
a man's execution

248
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,731
Like it was a party.

249
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:34,882
Bye-Bye, Patrick.

250
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:36,584
Adios.
Good riddance.

251
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,886
Except he's back.

252
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:41,363
You might have
executed his body,

253
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:43,841
But his spirit
has been released.

254
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,526
Oh, I see.

255
00:26:45,726 --> 00:26:47,011
His spirit.

256
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,012
Yes, his spirit.

257
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:51,715
And I am frightened.
I am very frightened.

258
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:52,767
Thanks for coming in
to see me.

259
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,970
Don't patronize me.
I'm not some crackpot.

260
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,289
I am a professional
psychic.

261
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,974
I helped the St. Louis
police department

262
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:01,275
Find a missing child...

263
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,978
This isn't about
a missing child, is it?

264
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:04,779
No.

265
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:05,780
It's murder.

266
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,782
And it's not going
to stop.

267
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:09,984
You're not dealing
with a man anymore.

268
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:10,985
He's become a force.

269
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:13,988
I promise you
I’ll do the best I can.

270
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,490
You've already broken
one promise to me.

271
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,959
You promised
no death penalty.

272
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:19,960
You lied.

273
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:27,968
That was you?

274
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:32,923
It's certainly a pleasure
to meet you, miss Seaton.

275
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:34,425
I've been looking forward
to this.

276
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:35,926
Actually,
I wanted to thank you.

277
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:37,928
How well did you know
Channing?

278
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:39,230
I didn't.

279
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,432
Then how did you know
where he was going next?

280
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:43,367
I try to stay away
from police work,

281
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,070
But when I saw the picture
of the little girl he killed...

282
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:46,570
But when I saw the picture
of the little girl he killed...

283
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,375
I opened myself up to him,

284
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:55,079
And I’ve never felt
such blackness and rage.

285
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,881
So you used
your psychic powers

286
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:59,083
To figure out where
he was going next?

287
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:00,885
I suppose that's also

288
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:02,386
How you got
my home phone number.

289
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:05,089
I have a friend who works
at the phone company.

290
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,391
Look, I helped you,

291
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,243
And you broke
your promise to me.

292
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:11,095
And now he's not just
after you.

293
00:28:11,295 --> 00:28:12,596
He's after me, too.

294
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:16,300
How do I reach you?

295
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,438
You call me, Logan.

296
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,941
Soon.

297
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:33,951
So that's it?

298
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,452
After all this time,

299
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:36,754
She just walks in
like that?

300
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:38,956
Mazza, don't let her
out of your sight.

301
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:39,957
With pleasure.

302
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,258
We're on a roll.

303
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,459
They nailed
Carmen’s killer.

304
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,761
They just
brought him in.

305
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,497
You killed my friend,
asshole, didn't you?

306
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:47,498
Didn't you?!

307
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,253
He's been like that
since they found him

308
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:54,138
In an alley
across from the park.

309
00:28:54,638 --> 00:28:57,141
Had the murder weapon
in his hands.

310
00:28:57,341 --> 00:28:59,143
Looks like a slam dunk.

311
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:01,295
Who is he?

312
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:02,446
No I.D.

313
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:03,647
Just some junkie

314
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:05,649
With tracks
all over his legs.

315
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:12,273
I don't know what
this guy's vegged on,

316
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:15,276
But he's ready
for the salad bar.

317
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,567
See you around, buddy boy.

318
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:57,067
See you around, buddy boy.

319
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:01,205
What did you say?

320
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,708
I didn't say anything.

321
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:27,348
You ok?

322
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:32,853
Hey, Russ.

323
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,158
Did that guy look

324
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:39,360
Like he could
kill anybody to you?

325
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,162
Well, that's...

326
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:43,864
Hey, maybe he did it
and went into shock, man.

327
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:45,666
Yeah.

328
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:47,868
And Perkins loves you
like a father.

329
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,671
And just by coincidence

330
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:51,872
Our little psychic
shows up today...

331
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:53,374
Bullshit.

332
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,877
It's a setup, man.

333
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,381
Let's go.

334
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,543
Man, it wouldn't hurt
if we had a warrant.

335
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,796
We'll just tell the judge
we had a psychic hunch.

336
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:33,297
We'll just tell the judge
we had a psychic hunch.

337
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:39,220
Hey, kiss my black ass!

338
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,922
Looks like the psychic
business pays pretty well.

339
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:42,723
Forget it.

340
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:44,425
You wouldn't look good
in a turban.

341
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,926
Shit.
I don't know.

342
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:03,827
It's too bad the chick
doesn't have a view.

343
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:22,346
Hmm.

344
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:22,963
Hmm.

345
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:30,487
Ollie,

346
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,189
Look at this.

347
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:32,689
Look at this.

348
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,593
It's got my name on it.

349
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:38,495
It's your
horoscope, man.

350
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,197
Hey, you better
look out, man.

351
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:41,698
'Cause
she might have

352
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,201
A voodoo love doll
of you around, too.

353
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:09,593
You looking
for something?

354
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:10,394
What?

355
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:12,596
You've been following me
the last 2 blocks.

356
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:13,597
You're crazy, lady.

357
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:16,099
Don't bother lying.
It's all over your aura.

358
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:16,900
My what?

359
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,101
If you're lonely,

360
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,604
Try computer dating,
but leave me alone,

361
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:22,990
Or I’ll call the cops.

362
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,083
My name is Andrea Gregg.

363
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:36,286
Nancy Rosenberg says you're
the most accurate psychic

364
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:37,788
She's ever seen.

365
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,790
I'd like to set up
a private reading, please?

366
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,793
My number is 555-0511.

367
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:45,179
Uh, hi. It's Paul.

368
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,182
I'm not going to come over
Friday night.

369
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:50,184
You're just
too spooky for me,

370
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,686
Somebody who knows what
I’m thinking before I do.

371
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:55,089
I should have said this
to your face,

372
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,191
But I guess
I’m too chicken shit.

373
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:58,192
Bye, Tess.

374
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:04,064
Looks like the score
is pentagram 16, LAPD 1.

375
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,567
Nah. Not even 1, huh, Logan?

376
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,902
How about a romantic
rendezvous?

377
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:10,904
Church across
from lover street.

378
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:13,907
Buenos dias, buddy boy.

379
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,413
Church across
from lover street.

380
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:21,415
Buenos dias, buddy boy.

381
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:21,915
Buenos dias,buddy boy.

382
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:38,432
Come on in.

383
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:40,567
We're gonna have
a little chat.

384
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:41,869
I don't believe this!

385
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,071
You've been
going through my things?

386
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,122
Take a listen
to this, Ollie.

387
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:47,474
Those are private!
You can't do that!

388
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:49,826
I can do anything
I damn well want.

389
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:53,830
Somebody who knows what
I’m thinking before I do.

390
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,082
I should have said this
to your face,

391
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:58,335
But I guess
I’m too chicken shit.

392
00:34:58,535 --> 00:34:59,136
Bye, Tess.

393
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:01,338
It's the next one.

394
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,681
What was it?

395
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,183
He was on there.

396
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,186
There were 3 messages
on that machine.

397
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:17,187
Machine says
2 messages.

398
00:35:17,688 --> 00:35:18,188
Maybe
you erased one.

399
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:19,189
No, I heard him!

400
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,190
Who?

401
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:21,692
Channing!

402
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:25,696
I mean, somebody
imitating his voice.

403
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,614
Guess again, Logan.

404
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:29,116
What if it was Channing?

405
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:31,468
Listen to me.
No more horseshit.

406
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:33,820
No more goblins
or tooth fairies.

407
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,322
Tell me
about your friends.

408
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:36,823
What are you
talking about?

409
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,860
This yuppie psychic routine
just doesn't cut it.

410
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,713
I'm thinking you two
were part of the same cult.

411
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:44,715
I bet it was your
cute little idea

412
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:46,517
Leaving that zombie
in the alley,

413
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:48,719
Make it look like
he killed Carmen, right?

414
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:49,720
You found the killer?

415
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,721
You surprised?

416
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:52,022
No.

417
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,725
Probably some poor soul
that he possessed

418
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,026
And then abandoned.

419
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:57,227
Oh, yeah.
Don't fuck with me!

420
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:58,028
Let go!

421
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:00,347
A woman's dead,
and you're involved!

422
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:01,348
Let go of me!

423
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:03,350
Russ, cool out, man!

424
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,351
Russell.

425
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,357
You're in danger.

426
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,863
Lady, he's not in danger.
You are.

427
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:17,998
Where are you
taking me?

428
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:18,799
Lover street.

429
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,650
That's what
the machine said.

430
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,502
A romantic
little rendezvous?

431
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:39,019
Let's go.

432
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,025
He's here.
Channing.

433
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:46,326
Great.

434
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:48,028
Russ, excuse me.

435
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:57,187
What are we doing
down here, Russ?

436
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:59,539
"Church across
from lover street,"

437
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:00,540
That's what
the voice said.

438
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:01,541
What voice?

439
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,502
There was no voice
on that machine.

440
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:05,082
All right,
so maybe I did erase it.

441
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,663
I don't like
the feeling of this.

442
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:07,464
It's spooky.

443
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,166
And the chick is spooky,
you hear?

444
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:11,351
What if she's
on the level?

445
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,353
Come on, Ollie.
Give me a break.

446
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:16,556
I'm serious, man. You see
how she was looking at me?

447
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,058
She said
I was in danger.

448
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,561
We just need
to calm down.

449
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:25,565
Let's check out
the area.

450
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:26,066
Let's check out
the area.

451
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,186
Come on.

452
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:33,323
Aqui tenemos
carne asada.

453
00:37:58,348 --> 00:37:59,850
Ayyyy!

454
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:15,732
Logan, it's him!

455
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:24,641
Aah!

456
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:26,743
Ollie!

457
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:42,392
Stay back!

458
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,398
I saw him, Russ.

459
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,902
It was him.

460
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:52,903
Ollie.

461
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:53,904
Ollie!

462
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,161
Get an ambulance.

463
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:06,333
Hey, watch it!

464
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,184
Me and your friend
will be right back.

465
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:59,386
You're doing exactly
what he wants you to do.

466
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:00,387
Logan!

467
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:07,861
Piggy.

468
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,584
Hold it!

469
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,702
You move,
and you're dead.

470
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:38,792
See you around,
buddy boy.

471
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,988
Where did he go?

472
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,123
Who?

473
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:12,742
The guy who just jumped
off the roof.

474
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:14,744
Jumped off the roof?
What you been smoking?

475
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,246
We could use some.

476
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,142
All right, Russ.
Let's try it again.

477
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:29,643
All right, Russ.
Let's try it again.

478
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:32,145
What for?

479
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,147
Because
I want to know

480
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,149
How a guy jumps off
a 10-Story building,

481
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,651
Waves at you,

482
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:39,653
And then
just walks away.

483
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:40,153
And then
just walks away.

484
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:55,669
Where's my witness?

485
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:57,671
Oh, you mean the woman

486
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,173
Whose house you
illegally entered, hmm?

487
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,292
Who you then abducted

488
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,044
And recklessly
endangered the life of

489
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:07,681
During a high-Speed
auto pursuit?

490
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:09,582
Her lawyer came
and got her.

491
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:11,234
You want to hear
the size

492
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:13,436
Of the lawsuit
he was talking about?

493
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:16,940
It's too bad about
your suspect, Logan.

494
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,942
Maybe he flew away...

495
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:20,694
Like a little birdie.

496
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,196
Tweet tweet.

497
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:32,822
Look, Russ.

498
00:42:33,022 --> 00:42:33,823
Yeah.

499
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,826
I know.

500
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,081
Sir?

501
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:41,882
Yeah.

502
00:42:42,082 --> 00:42:43,083
They got Mazza.

503
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:43,583
They got Mazza.

504
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,268
How'd they get him
up there?

505
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,671
Get him out of here.

506
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:12,172
Get him out of here.

507
00:44:14,808 --> 00:44:17,060
Lieutenant grimes,

508
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,263
I want you to take over
the investigation immediately.

509
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,267
Yes, sir.

510
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:24,767
Yes, sir.

511
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,412
God, I hope
I am going nuts, al.

512
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:40,216
'Cause if I’m not,

513
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,418
Grimes isn't gonna do
much good.

514
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:03,216
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

515
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:06,452
How long since your
last confession, my son?

516
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:11,607
It's been a long time.

517
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:13,784
We had kind of a...

518
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:15,762
Parting of the ways.

519
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,114
Holy mother, the church,
accepts all

520
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:20,266
Who return penitent
to its fold.

521
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:22,351
I don't know
if I’m penitent, father.

522
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:24,237
I don't know much
of anything anymore.

523
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:27,423
I thought I knew where
things stood, but...

524
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:29,976
Please go on.

525
00:46:32,512 --> 00:46:33,613
My dad was shot,

526
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:35,114
And after that,

527
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:37,617
I guess I just said
"forget it."

528
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:39,118
I mean,
if there was a god,

529
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:40,620
How could
he take my dad,

530
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,123
Who never did anything
wrong in his whole life?

531
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:45,425
My mother went crazy.

532
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,960
She never stopped praying.

533
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,630
She never stopped saying
that my dad's death was...

534
00:46:52,131 --> 00:46:54,133
God's will.

535
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:01,457
Look, father, I’ve seen
a lot of dead bodies,

536
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:04,385
And when someone's dead,
they're dead, right?

537
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:07,313
Maybe I am going nuts,
but I need some answers.

538
00:47:07,513 --> 00:47:09,932
What is your question,
my son?

539
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:12,352
Can the spirits
of the dead return

540
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:15,621
And take over the bodies
of people still living?

541
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:17,156
You mean possession?

542
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,958
Yes.

543
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:20,994
How can they be stopped?

544
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:23,196
Before I answer
your question,

545
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:24,697
It is necessary

546
00:47:25,198 --> 00:47:27,867
That I ask you
one of my own, my son.

547
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,435
What is it, father?

548
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:31,504
How's the stomach,
buddy boy?

549
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,709
Logan!

550
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:34,210
Logan!

551
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,633
Hey!

552
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:42,635
Are you ok?

553
00:49:44,137 --> 00:49:46,639
Well, what about
the bottle?

554
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,152
Where's the priest
who just came in here?

555
00:49:59,352 --> 00:49:59,953
Priest?

556
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:02,155
I didn't see
any priest.

557
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,391
There it is!

558
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:23,593
There it is!
Pull over!

559
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:24,093
There it is!
Pull over!

560
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:38,357
Logan!

561
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:38,858
Logan!

562
00:50:48,484 --> 00:50:49,485
Channing.

563
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:03,132
No, Logan!

564
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:26,155
Tess!

565
00:51:26,656 --> 00:51:26,656
Tess!

566
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,785
What the fuck?

567
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:50,680
This is an emergency.

568
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,481
Move!

569
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:52,832
Look, I’m not
an anti-Cop type.

570
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:54,183
You need help
with some creep...

571
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:55,685
Shut up!

572
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:57,937
Aah!
Aah!

573
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:29,335
Oh! Aah!

574
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,328
Call this number

575
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:57,029
And ask for
inspector Perkins.

576
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:58,831
On second thought,

577
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:00,333
Talk to
lieutenant grimes.

578
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:02,034
He'll take care
of your damages

579
00:53:02,535 --> 00:53:03,336
Personally.

580
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:05,037
Any time, officer.

581
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:15,047
Look, miss Seaton...

582
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:15,848
Tess.

583
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:17,199
Tess. Right.

584
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:18,351
I want to...

585
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,353
You don't have to
thank me.

586
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:23,556
Would you quit finishing
my sentences for me?

587
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:24,357
Sorry.

588
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:26,058
I forget sometimes.

589
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,562
God, I could use
a drink.

590
00:53:30,062 --> 00:53:30,062
God, I could use
a drink.

591
00:53:31,564 --> 00:53:33,566
All right.

592
00:53:37,069 --> 00:53:39,071
Tell me again
from the beginning.

593
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:42,074
What the hell
is going on here?

594
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,076
I don't really know
myself, Logan.

595
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:47,580
All I know is
that he's a spirit now,

596
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,881
And except
for mind games,

597
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,083
Like making you
see or hear things,

598
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,235
A spirit can't really
do anything

599
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:55,087
In the physical world
without a body.

600
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:58,090
So Channing
possesses bodies.

601
00:54:01,594 --> 00:54:03,996
She just got out
of the hospital.

602
00:54:04,196 --> 00:54:06,599
Might want to
put her back in there.

603
00:54:18,611 --> 00:54:19,612
Ok, he possesses bodies,

604
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:22,048
But I saw him.
I saw him.

605
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:24,250
He wants you to see him.
That's his game.

606
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,252
He can reveal himself
to you,

607
00:54:26,452 --> 00:54:27,753
Or he can hide.

608
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:29,505
And what am I
supposed to do?

609
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:31,307
Look, I spend
most of my time

610
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:33,008
Telling people
about their love life

611
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:36,512
Or if their TV show's
going to be renewed.

612
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:39,014
I have heard of a woman,
though.

613
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:40,516
Maybe she could
help us.

614
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:07,710
Yes?

615
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,913
Hi. We'd like to see
sister marguerite, please.

616
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:13,415
Sister marguerite
doesn't see visitors.

617
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:14,717
Could you tell her

618
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,319
That it's a matter
police business, sister?

619
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,922
I'm afraid that will mean
very little to her.

620
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:21,423
Tell her it's
a very important

621
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:22,925
Spiritual matter.

622
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:25,928
All right.
Wait here.

623
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:33,936
I'm surprised you didn't
pull your gun on her.

624
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,951
Thank you.

625
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:49,451
Thank you.

626
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:55,708
Sister marguerite,

627
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,526
We need your help.

628
00:55:57,726 --> 00:56:01,297
An entity has returned
and is killing.

629
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:06,502
How did the entity die?

630
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:08,345
Execution.

631
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:09,989
Sister,

632
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:12,191
What can you tell us
about the first power?

633
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:17,095
The church doesn't
allow us to discuss that.

634
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:19,498
Sister, I don't mean
to be disrespectful,

635
00:56:19,698 --> 00:56:22,201
But I really don't care
what the church feels.

636
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,702
People are
getting killed.

637
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:25,204
Forget the first power.

638
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:27,206
It's not
to be played with.

639
00:56:27,706 --> 00:56:27,706
It's not
to be played with.

640
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:31,510
Sister marguerite?

641
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,213
Come on.
You heard the lady.

642
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:35,714
She just can't cut it.

643
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:43,222
So what's your next
hot lead?

644
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:48,727
You know, you're not doing
so great yourself, Logan.

645
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:50,729
Thing only thing
I’ve heard out of you so far

646
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:52,731
Is that you need
a drink.

647
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,483
Would have done me
more good

648
00:56:54,984 --> 00:56:56,485
Than seeing
the flying nun.

649
00:56:58,354 --> 00:57:00,356
Fine. Pull over.

650
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:02,158
What?

651
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:04,860
I said pull over.
I'm thirsty.

652
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:20,309
Hi.

653
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:22,511
2 scotches.
Doubles.

654
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:25,764
Look, I don't know what
you're trying to prove.

655
00:57:26,265 --> 00:57:26,765
What's the matter,
Logan?

656
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:28,267
I never heard
of a cop

657
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:30,769
Turning down
a free drink.

658
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,071
Should have told me

659
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,273
These were the spirits
you were looking for.

660
00:57:35,524 --> 00:57:36,826
Again.

661
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:40,029
Maybe this time I could
have it straight.

662
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:41,530
That was straight,
lady.

663
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,331
Well, then, McGuire,

664
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:44,333
You got a leak
in your roof

665
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,402
'Cause this stuff's
so watered down

666
00:57:46,652 --> 00:57:48,153
It tastes like
a god damn Perrier.

667
00:57:51,407 --> 00:57:52,908
I ain't McGuire.

668
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:57,162
I’ll do it.

669
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,367
You drink
like a vice cop.

670
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:20,569
That's seriously going
to fuck with your vibes.

671
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,571
You should slow down
on that stuff.

672
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:27,076
I'm trying to get
through to you, Logan.

673
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:28,861
I'm trying real hard,

674
00:58:29,061 --> 00:58:31,472
But you've got
this shell around you.

675
00:58:31,672 --> 00:58:34,083
It even started
in a place like this,

676
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:35,584
Didn't it?

677
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:40,890
Come on, Logan.
Talk to me.

678
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:44,093
It was 2 guys
in ski masks, right,

679
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:46,095
And your old man
by himself,

680
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:47,346
Closing up the bar?

681
00:58:47,546 --> 00:58:49,048
I don't need this shit
from you.

682
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:50,850
He died for no reason.

683
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:54,019
That's when you stopped
believing in anything.

684
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,555
You've got to believe
in something,

685
00:58:57,056 --> 00:58:58,357
And it can't
be vengeance.

686
00:58:58,557 --> 00:59:00,059
Otherwise, you're
just like Channing.

687
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:00,559
Otherwise, you're
just like Channing.

688
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:08,067
You've gotta believe
in this.

689
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:10,870
You always talk
this much?

690
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,072
It's no wonder
your boyfriend split.

691
00:59:14,573 --> 00:59:15,374
Wasn't my boyfriend.

692
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:16,975
We just went out
a few times.

693
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:18,577
Amazing it lasted
that long.

694
00:59:19,078 --> 00:59:19,078
Amazing it lasted
that long.

695
00:59:29,588 --> 00:59:30,089
Hey.

696
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:30,589
Hey.

697
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,591
Hey!

698
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:33,092
Hey!

699
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:35,895
What?

700
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:37,897
I was an asshole.

701
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:40,599
I shouldn't have said that
about your boyfriend.

702
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:44,103
It's all right.

703
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:44,603
It's all right.

704
00:59:45,604 --> 00:59:46,605
That's my problem.

705
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:48,507
I can tell
everybody else

706
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:50,809
What to do
with their life,

707
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:53,112
But my life
is a total wreck.

708
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,506
We have to go
to Channing's house.

709
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:10,813
I know he's returned
from the grave,

710
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:13,015
But do you really think
he's moved back in?

711
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,226
Mrs. Channing...

712
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:42,311
We're from the post.

713
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:44,012
We really hate
to bother you,

714
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:45,514
But these new
pentagram killings

715
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:48,016
Could prove that Patrick
wasn't guilty after all.

716
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:50,018
We'd like to talk to you
if we could.

717
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:50,519
We'd like to talk to you
if we could.

718
01:00:57,526 --> 01:00:58,527
All right.

719
01:00:59,027 --> 01:00:59,027
All right.

720
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:07,419
Is it too dark
in here?

721
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:11,423
Light hurts my eyes.

722
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:13,408
Cataracts.

723
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:15,377
No, it's fine.

724
01:01:15,577 --> 01:01:17,045
Well, sit down.

725
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:17,546
Well, sit down.

726
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:26,188
What made you decide
Patrick was innocent now?

727
01:01:26,388 --> 01:01:28,474
Why didn't you
see the truth sooner?

728
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:31,193
That's why we want
to get the real story,

729
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:32,194
Mrs. Channing.

730
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:36,698
That's my husband Louis.

731
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,702
He was a good man.

732
01:01:41,203 --> 01:01:41,203
He was a good man.

733
01:01:42,204 --> 01:01:44,706
The good always
die young.

734
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:52,681
Our daughter Sarah.

735
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,883
She was
Patrick’s mother.

736
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,886
She died when he was 7.

737
01:01:58,887 --> 01:02:00,889
What about
Patrick’s father?

738
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:02,941
Patrick never knew
his father.

739
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:05,260
Oh, that's right.
He was illegitimate.

740
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,662
He was not
illegitimate.

741
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:10,015
He didn't mean anything.

742
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:17,022
We loved him
very much...

743
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:18,523
Especially Louis.

744
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:22,844
Oh, I’m just
talking on.

745
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:25,197
Where was
Patrick’s room?

746
01:02:25,697 --> 01:02:26,498
Why?

747
01:02:26,698 --> 01:02:29,701
We'd like to see
another side of Patrick.

748
01:02:33,672 --> 01:02:35,674
I guess it would be
all right.

749
01:02:36,675 --> 01:02:39,177
What could it hurt?

750
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:03,201
I don't care
what anybody says.

751
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:05,704
He was a happy child.

752
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:07,455
You tell them.

753
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:09,007
Tell the world...

754
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:11,009
What a good boy he was.

755
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:13,512
A murderer?
That's just nonsense.

756
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:16,715
He was always so quiet
and considerate.

757
01:03:56,621 --> 01:03:59,124
Oh, he came in here
at night.

758
01:03:59,624 --> 01:03:59,624
Oh, he came in here
at night.

759
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:02,627
He was drunk.

760
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:10,135
Mommy!

761
01:04:10,635 --> 01:04:12,637
No, grandpa, no!

762
01:04:12,837 --> 01:04:14,439
Grammy!

763
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,641
Grammy, you have
to make him stop!

764
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:17,642
Help us!

765
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:20,145
Patrick.

766
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:21,279
What's he doing?

767
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,581
Not me.

768
01:04:22,781 --> 01:04:24,616
It's not me.
It's my mommy.

769
01:04:24,816 --> 01:04:26,634
Patrick,
is he hurting her?

770
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:28,644
Grandpa,
don't touch her!

771
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:30,655
I want you to leave now!

772
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,161
You were there,
weren't you?

773
01:04:37,662 --> 01:04:39,314
You saw it happen.

774
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:40,966
You let it happen.

775
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,818
I don't know what
you're talking about.

776
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:46,671
You let him molest
his own daughter?

777
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:53,678
Patrick never
knew his father?

778
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:55,180
I think he did.

779
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,683
It was his grandfather,
wasn't it?

780
01:05:02,187 --> 01:05:03,688
Wasn't it?

781
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:04,189
Wasn't it?

782
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,342
I know who you are.

783
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,694
You're not a reporter.

784
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:11,195
You're that cop!

785
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:12,697
You're a killer!

786
01:05:12,948 --> 01:05:14,249
A killer!

787
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:16,251
You're
the real murderer!

788
01:05:16,451 --> 01:05:19,087
Eternal punishment
will be yours!

789
01:05:19,287 --> 01:05:21,089
Burn in hell!

790
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,592
Burn in hell!

791
01:05:28,597 --> 01:05:29,598
Tess!

792
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:28,156
Tess?

793
01:06:33,662 --> 01:06:36,164
What's down there?
What do you see?

794
01:06:36,364 --> 01:06:37,199
Hey!

795
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:38,500
Hey, you!

796
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,453
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

797
01:06:41,837 --> 01:06:44,840
Homicide investigation.
Get that out of my face.

798
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,333
I don't care
who the hell you are.

799
01:06:46,533 --> 01:06:47,826
Can't stay down here.
It's unsafe.

800
01:06:48,026 --> 01:06:49,645
Why? What is this place?

801
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:51,963
Part of the city's
old water system.

802
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:53,265
Got shut down

803
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:56,351
After major earthquake
damage in '71.

804
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:58,654
Hey. Don't touch that.

805
01:06:58,854 --> 01:07:01,606
Those things still work.
It'll come flooding in.

806
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:03,875
Kid got drowned
down here

807
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:05,777
A couple of years ago.

808
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:08,480
That's why these things
were blocked off.

809
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,365
Channing used
to come down here,

810
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:11,366
Didn't he?

811
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:13,669
Hey, that was before me.

812
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,370
Come on, you guys.
We gotta leave.

813
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,873
He's mad
that we're here.

814
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:20,175
This is his place.

815
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:22,878
It's the only place
he ever felt safe.

816
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,798
He's...he's
laughing at us.

817
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:29,000
He's going to kill
again and again.

818
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:29,501
He's going to kill
again and again.

819
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:26,808
I never thought
you'd go this far,

820
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:28,110
Marguerite.

821
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,812
People came to me
for help.

822
01:08:31,012 --> 01:08:32,114
I turned them away.

823
01:08:32,314 --> 01:08:33,965
I can't do that
anymore.

824
01:08:34,165 --> 01:08:35,617
But that doesn't excuse

825
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:38,120
The theft of a sacred
church icon.

826
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,456
Is it theft to use this
for its real purpose?

827
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:44,793
I believe Satan has granted
one of his disciples

828
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:46,786
The first power.

829
01:08:46,986 --> 01:08:48,780
Resurrection?

830
01:08:50,332 --> 01:08:51,833
Marguerite.

831
01:09:03,228 --> 01:09:04,729
Marguerite.

832
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,230
Marguerite.

833
01:09:06,731 --> 01:09:08,683
I’ll pray for you.

834
01:09:28,086 --> 01:09:29,487
We have to hurry.

835
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:30,889
I don't know who,

836
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:34,092
But he's going to kill
someone else close to you.

837
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:35,393
Did you see where?

838
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:38,096
It's an area I recognize.

839
01:09:38,596 --> 01:09:40,715
It's off
the Santa Monica freeway.

840
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,722
Attention, all units.
Officer needs assistance.

841
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,724
2130 Julian, near alameda.

842
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,026
Attention, all units.

843
01:09:51,226 --> 01:09:53,128
Only a few blocks
from here.

844
01:09:53,328 --> 01:09:55,230
3-Lincoln-43.
I'm on it.

845
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,231
Hold on.

846
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:09,127
Stay here.

847
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:21,206
Attention, all units.
Officer needs assistance.

848
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:22,724
2130 Julian.

849
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:25,393
You know
which officer needs help,

850
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:26,895
Don't you, sweet cakes?

851
01:10:27,145 --> 01:10:28,646
It's Logan.

852
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:52,670
Aah!

853
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:58,176
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

854
01:10:58,376 --> 01:11:00,178
Logan, he's here.
Channing.

855
01:11:00,378 --> 01:11:02,180
I heard him
on the radio.

856
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,181
You what?

857
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:05,133
Piggy, piggy.

858
01:11:37,549 --> 01:11:38,550
Over here.

859
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:39,050
Over here.

860
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:44,973
This way.

861
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:47,559
Come on. Check it out,
buddy boy.

862
01:11:53,932 --> 01:11:54,933
Logan?

863
01:12:08,947 --> 01:12:10,949
You're holding it
upside down.

864
01:12:18,957 --> 01:12:21,459
You can't go on killing
forever, Patrick.

865
01:12:23,962 --> 01:12:25,964
You want to bet?

866
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:32,971
Aah!

867
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:37,475
Aah!

868
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:37,976
Aah!

869
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,251
Aah!

870
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:03,751
Aah!

871
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:25,523
Aah!

872
01:13:34,032 --> 01:13:35,033
Hey, asshole.

873
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:10,785
Are you trying
to tell me

874
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:13,588
That grimes tried
to kill you?

875
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:15,940
What do you think, al,
I dragged him up there

876
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,293
And dropped him on
that spike for nothing?

877
01:14:18,493 --> 01:14:18,960
All right.

878
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,813
Yeah, he was a drunk
and a total prick,

879
01:14:22,013 --> 01:14:24,666
But he was also
a lieutenant in the LAPD,

880
01:14:24,866 --> 01:14:26,801
And I do not believe...

881
01:14:28,303 --> 01:14:29,971
And I do not believe

882
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:33,475
That he suddenly
went fucking insane

883
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:37,679
Or was secretly a member
of some fucking cult.

884
01:14:37,812 --> 01:14:38,813
Sir,
chief is here.

885
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,482
Yeah, yeah!
I’ll be there.

886
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:43,685
You gotta give me
some more time, al.

887
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:44,185
You gotta give me
some more time, al.

888
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:49,090
Ok, but get that fucking girl
and get out of here,

889
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:52,193
And you don't talk to anybody.
You understand me?

890
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:56,197
Go out the back way.

891
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:35,570
Maid's day off.

892
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:52,220
What are we gonna do?

893
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:07,535
A buddy
on the bomb squad

894
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:09,854
Gave me this stuff
for a rainy day.

895
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:11,239
Channing can't do
anything to us

896
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:12,740
Without using
somebody's body.

897
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:14,642
So everyone he sends
at us,

898
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:16,244
We're gonna send
right back.

899
01:16:16,444 --> 01:16:17,245
That's great.

900
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:19,247
What are we gonna do,
blow up the whole city?

901
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:20,748
What do you want me
to say?

902
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:22,750
Tess, every time
you kill the fucker,

903
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,752
He bounces
into somebody else!

904
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,504
I'm sorry.

905
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:32,260
What about grimes?
How'd he get into him?

906
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,387
You said grimes
was an alcoholic.

907
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:36,451
And people like that
and junkies,

908
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,516
They have less of a hold
on reality,

909
01:16:38,716 --> 01:16:40,468
So they're vulnerable
to him.

910
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:41,269
Oh, terrific.

911
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:44,372
That narrows it down
to half of L.A.

912
01:16:44,572 --> 01:16:47,275
Logan, I don't know
how to stop him.

913
01:16:47,475 --> 01:16:50,611
He...he just keeps getting
stronger and stronger and...

914
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,623
Oh, Logan,
what are we doing?

915
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:03,875
This is crazy.

916
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:53,791
It's probably just
my old refrigerator.

917
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:54,292
It's probably just
my old refrigerator.

918
01:18:19,951 --> 01:18:21,102
Russell!

919
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:22,253
What?

920
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:23,955
What is it?

921
01:18:25,456 --> 01:18:26,758
The bag lady,

922
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:28,960
She was outside
the window.

923
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:39,337
Tess, there's
nothing out...

924
01:18:39,537 --> 01:18:40,338
Aah!

925
01:18:40,838 --> 01:18:40,838
Aah!

926
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:51,732
Don't you think
I look pretty, Logan?

927
01:18:53,985 --> 01:18:56,487
Not nice to hit a lady.

928
01:19:05,246 --> 01:19:07,248
Whee!

929
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:17,008
Hi, cutie.

930
01:19:22,013 --> 01:19:22,972
Oh, good.

931
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:23,931
A game.

932
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:25,433
Hide-And-Seek.

933
01:19:25,633 --> 01:19:27,134
I'm it.
I’ll count to 10.

934
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:29,170
1...

935
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,596
2...

936
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,023
3...

937
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:32,523
3...

938
01:19:39,146 --> 01:19:40,648
Where are we going,
Logan?

939
01:19:40,848 --> 01:19:42,149
There's nowhere to go.

940
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,154
Hi, Logan.
Did ya miss me?

941
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:47,655
Hi, Logan.
Did ya miss me?

942
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:50,791
Give me a kiss.

943
01:19:56,297 --> 01:19:57,048
Whee!

944
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:02,553
Come on. Pucker up.

945
01:20:04,055 --> 01:20:05,056
Aah!

946
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:11,679
Whoo-Ee! This is fun!

947
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:12,930
Whee!

948
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,181
Whoo-Hoo!

949
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:19,937
Ooh, look!
There's a big truck.

950
01:20:20,438 --> 01:20:20,438
Ooh, look!
There's a big truck.

951
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:05,483
Tess!

952
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:20,214
Tess.

953
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:23,167
Open up!

954
01:21:28,172 --> 01:21:29,323
You want to hide out
from the rest of the world

955
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:30,674
In this little rat hole,
I don't give a damn.

956
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:32,676
But he's taken Tess,
and I’m not leaving here

957
01:21:33,177 --> 01:21:34,678
Until you tell me
how to find her.

958
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:35,179
Until you tell me
how to find her.

959
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:39,650
You don't have any idea
what you'll be facing.

960
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,119
I don't care.

961
01:21:53,864 --> 01:21:55,166
If it's not too late,

962
01:21:55,366 --> 01:21:58,335
He will have taken her
to the dark place

963
01:21:58,535 --> 01:22:00,579
Where he performed
his rituals.

964
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:02,823
I know where that is.
Tess felt it.

965
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:04,341
How do I stop him?

966
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:06,844
It's not
just stopping him.

967
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:10,548
It's stopping a being
who has the first power.

968
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:12,016
There are 3 powers

969
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,518
That can be bestowed
by god or Satan.

970
01:22:14,718 --> 01:22:16,320
The third power
is the ability

971
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,022
To take over
another person's body.

972
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:20,524
Your friend the psychic
has the second power,

973
01:22:21,025 --> 01:22:23,177
The gift of knowing
the future.

974
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:25,529
The first power
is resurrection.

975
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:27,264
Immortality.

976
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:28,282
Look, sister,

977
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,284
I don't understand
these things.

978
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:34,238
All I know is that
I have to help her.

979
01:22:34,438 --> 01:22:36,740
There's just one way...

980
01:22:55,259 --> 01:22:57,261
Through the only soul
in history

981
01:22:57,461 --> 01:22:59,263
Who had all 3 powers.

982
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:21,595
Aah!

983
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:32,239
Bitch!

984
01:24:49,623 --> 01:24:50,624
Ha ha ha.

985
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:13,264
En nomini patri,
et matri

986
01:25:13,464 --> 01:25:14,281
Et spiritus sancti.

987
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:16,784
Are you all right,
sister?

988
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:17,785
Yes.

989
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:33,300
Logan.

990
01:25:34,802 --> 01:25:35,302
Hurry.

991
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:37,805
We have to get
out of here.

992
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:16,894
We have to hurry.

993
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:18,595
He's still here.
I feel it.

994
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:20,597
Sister marguerite!

995
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:23,183
Keep going.

996
01:26:35,312 --> 01:26:36,313
Sister.

997
01:26:37,815 --> 01:26:40,117
Take my hand.

998
01:26:40,317 --> 01:26:43,120
Gee, thanks, Russ.

999
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:43,320
Gee, thanks, Russ.

1000
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:05,592
Let her go, Patrick.

1001
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:07,594
So soon?

1002
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:08,095
So soon?

1003
01:27:10,597 --> 01:27:12,349
I just got here.

1004
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,352
Come out and face me,
you son of a bitch.

1005
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:16,654
Don't hide behind her.

1006
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:19,857
Don't you know
that cursing is a sin?

1007
01:27:27,364 --> 01:27:29,366
You won't shoot a nun.

1008
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:29,867
You won't shoot a nun.

1009
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,504
Not a good little
catholic boy like you.

1010
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:49,820
Sister.

1011
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,022
Oh, I’m afraid
she's not here.

1012
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:56,026
Keep fighting him,
marguerite.

1013
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:03,033
You can beat him.

1014
01:28:07,037 --> 01:28:08,038
Don't give up.

1015
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:08,539
Don't give up.

1016
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,042
He isn't powerful.

1017
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:15,346
He's just a scared
little boy

1018
01:28:15,546 --> 01:28:17,548
Who used to run
and hide in the dark.

1019
01:28:17,748 --> 01:28:19,850
You're pathetic, Logan.

1020
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:22,177
Tell me something,
Patrick.

1021
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:24,505
It's just
a wild guess...

1022
01:28:26,006 --> 01:28:28,008
But I bet the first
one you killed

1023
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,810
Was your
grandfather.

1024
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,513
Or should I say
your father?

1025
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:35,015
Shut up!

1026
01:28:35,265 --> 01:28:36,767
You didn't know
I knew that,

1027
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:37,568
Did you, Patrick?

1028
01:28:37,768 --> 01:28:40,737
You had to watch him,
didn't you?

1029
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:41,988
That was it.

1030
01:28:42,188 --> 01:28:43,040
Shut up, Logan!

1031
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,660
You can beat him,
marguerite.

1032
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,863
It's just you and me,
buddy boy.

1033
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:23,363
It's just you and me,
buddy boy.

1034
01:30:33,884 --> 01:30:34,885
Aah!

1035
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:37,020
Aah!

1036
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,279
Logan!

1037
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:04,298
Aah!

1038
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,312
Aah!

1039
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,071
Aah!

1040
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:46,206
Time for your acid bath.

1041
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:46,707
Time for your acid bath.

1042
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:00,103
Aah!

1043
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:11,732
Aah!

1044
01:32:24,878 --> 01:32:25,879
Aah!

1045
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:03,116
Aah!

1046
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,251
Aah!

1047
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:29,443
Freeze!

1048
01:33:29,643 --> 01:33:31,144
Drop the knife!

1049
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:31,645
Drop the knife!

1050
01:33:33,146 --> 01:33:35,148
No. Please.

1051
01:33:37,617 --> 01:33:38,827
Ohh!

1052
01:33:39,027 --> 01:33:40,237
Aah!

1053
01:33:40,737 --> 01:33:40,737
Aah!

1054
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,482
Russell.

1055
01:34:08,682 --> 01:34:11,134
Please come back to me.

1056
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:25,365
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

1057
01:34:36,877 --> 01:34:39,379
See you around, buddy boy.

1058
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:39,880
See you around, buddy boy.

1059
01:34:40,305 --> 01:35:40,160
