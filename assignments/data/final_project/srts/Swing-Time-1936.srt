1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:32,867
Go on, take a card, any card at all.

3
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,362
Now look at it.

4
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,233
Put it back.

5
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,111
Ace of spades.

6
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:52,084
- When did you change the act, Pop?
- I didn't. He did.

7
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:53,751
He did?

8
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:57,317
Yes, he said straight magic
is too old-fashioned.

9
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,506
Wait a minute, take a bow.

10
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,474
No, you take it. I got to get married.

11
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:14,740
Come here, they're applauding you.
They like it.

12
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,782
Lucky.

13
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,549
Now what?

14
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:28,115
- I want to reason with you, if I can.
- But you already did.

15
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:31,660
Have you really made up your mind
to leave me...

16
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,028
just to marry some girl
you happen to know?

17
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,000
It's kind of customary
to know the bride, isn't it?

18
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,833
I hate to see you leave show business.

19
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,805
A man with your talents...

20
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,704
My talent is gambling, Pop.

21
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:46,175
Hoofing is all right,
but there's no future in it.

22
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:47,438
I want to spread out.

23
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,442
I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky.

24
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:56,377
I know I'm going to miss you, Pop.

25
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:14,268
Is he staying with us, Pop?

26
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,330
No, he's made up his mind to get married.

27
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:17,534
How do you like that?

28
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,770
Letting his marriage interfere
with our career?

29
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,540
We shouldn't have played his hometown.

30
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:25,743
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.

31
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,546
Local boy makes bad.

32
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:35,086
- Father, has he come yet?
- No, and it's all very much as I expected.

33
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:44,835
Hi, fellows.

34
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,621
- How do I look?
- Marvelous, colossal, splendid.

35
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,018
Wait a minute. You're not going like that.

36
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,795
Of course. Big church wedding,
girl's family very social...

37
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,423
whole town there.

38
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:19,396
I guess it doesn't really matter,
just a hick town.

39
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,868
What doesn't matter?

40
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,467
- Last year's trousers.
- Last year's trousers?

41
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,975
No cuffs.

42
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,615
- No cuffs?
- No cuffs.

43
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,617
Whoever heard of cuffs on these?

44
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,175
Are you serious?

45
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,312
Don't be ridiculous.

46
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:42,956
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute. Let's see that.

47
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:48,489
- What do you think of that?
- You know, you're in a hurry and...

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,501
Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone.

49
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,936
Just a minute. I'll answer it for you.

50
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,264
It will only take about five minutes.

51
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,209
Let us have your pants.

52
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,509
- Hello.
- Hello, John. Will you hurry?

53
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,012
Tell him the minister is here.

54
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,952
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.

55
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,579
All right, I'll tell him.

56
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,723
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,031
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.

58
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,697
- Good.
- You see, there's plenty of material.

59
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,570
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
- No, you don't.

60
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:33,634
Pop, take them to Schmidt's
and have them back in five minutes.

61
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:37,648
- You want two cuffs on them?
- Yeah, one on each leg.

62
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,815
And hurry up. Tell him
I got to have them back right away.

63
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,354
While we're waiting,
we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport.

64
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,416
I'll get seven.

65
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,022
- The next man.
- That's it.

66
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,966
- Any word?
- They say he'll be here any minute.

67
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,938
You know, I told Margaret
this would happen.

68
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:05,636
I always say, marry in haste,
repent at leisure.

69
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:08,708
The young man is now
one hour and 25 minutes late.

70
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,374
That isn't exactly marrying in haste.

71
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,420
As long as I am living, and longer...

72
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,481
I have never seen cuffs on pants like these.

73
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,527
What's the matter, can't you make them?

74
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,119
I can make anything...

75
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:28,597
but I would rather not be wrong
than right.

76
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:33,194
I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs.

77
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:36,301
No. 10 times...

78
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,103
20 times, no.

79
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,634
Can't you understand?
Look, here, let me show you.

80
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:45,213
Do you see any cuffs there? Not one cuff.

81
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,408
Thousands of no cuffs.

82
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:52,114
Here, look these over. You see? No cuffs.

83
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,626
Millions of no cuffs.

84
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,663
No cuffs.

85
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,896
More than that, positively not one cuff.

86
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,339
Why not?

87
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:22,709
<i>- I want to speak to Mr. Garnett.
- Speaking.</i>

88
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,656
- Here he is, sir.
- Let me talk to him.

89
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,758
Say, listen, you,
the guests are all going home and...

90
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:32,991
I'm the happiest man in the world
because the wedding is off.

91
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:35,658
<i>And furthermore,
if you ever come to this house again...</i>

92
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,363
<i>I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?</i>

93
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:43,731
- Red, is that call for me?
- No, it's my dame.

94
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:48,836
Okay, sweetheart,
and a great big juicy kiss for you.

95
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:13,301
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.

96
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:19,506
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...

97
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,113
You ought to marry those dice.

98
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:27,008
Marry? Holy cats! What time is it?

99
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,781
- Pop, my pants!
- You've got them on.

100
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,219
Oh, yeah.

101
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:35,422
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.

102
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,222
I got to get married.

103
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,125
I'll bet you the bankroll
you don't get married.

104
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,965
That's a bet.

105
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,165
No cuffs.

106
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:52,736
The tailor says those kind of pants
shouldn't have cuffs.

107
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:54,905
What?

108
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,215
Nice fellows!

109
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,193
Hello.

110
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,702
Where's everybody?

111
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,173
Why, the guests have all gone, sir.

112
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,304
Did you wish to be announced?

113
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:35,284
Just let me get my hands
on that young man and I'll strangle him!

114
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:38,049
You leave him to me. I'll take care of him.

115
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:41,117
No, maybe I'd better surprise them.

116
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,524
He can't do a thing like this
to a daughter of mine.

117
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,256
This is my affair, you keep out of it.

118
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,594
I'm your father
and I'll settle this as I see fit.

119
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:50,361
We'll be the laughingstock
of this whole town!

120
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,536
So...

121
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,478
Here I am.

122
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,923
Young man,
why didn't you appear for your wedding?

123
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,719
I thought you'd ask me that.

124
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,386
Don't stand there like a statue.

125
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:20,863
You said you were gonna do something.
Well, do it.

126
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:25,830
What are you gonna do?

127
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't you dare touch him.

128
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,504
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.

129
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,578
I will, but...

130
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,409
Pardon me, I think I'm in the way.

131
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:39,780
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.

132
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:43,382
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.

133
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:47,287
I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000.

134
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:50,151
- How about twenty?
- Not for $20,000.

135
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:52,696
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...

136
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:56,834
Say, young man,
where could you get $25,000?

137
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,696
By dancing?

138
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,961
And there's another thing...

139
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,566
coming back to your own hometown
in a dancing act.

140
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,132
I'm going into a new business.

141
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,202
Only this afternoon I made $200.

142
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,247
$200?

143
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,146
Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding.

144
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,318
That makes it a little different.

145
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:20,755
I'm not consenting to your wedding...

146
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,827
but I always admire
any young man that can make money.

147
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:27,360
It shows character.

148
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:30,430
- That's too kind of you, sir.
- Not at all.

149
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,230
Then Margaret and I can get married?

150
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:35,898
If you go to New York
and work hard at your business...

151
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,972
and if you are successful...

152
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:41,334
you can come back here
and ask me for my Margaret.

153
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,538
Oh, Daddy.

154
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:46,277
And in all probability
I'll be very happy to give her to you.

155
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,848
Right, sir. Thank you, sir.

156
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,854
John, dear.

157
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,115
You'll come back soon, won't you?

158
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,683
That all depends upon the stakes,
the stocks...

159
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,922
Goodbye, my son.

160
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:02,255
Thank you, father-in-law.

161
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,769
I'll say goodbye again
because we'll both be waiting for you.

162
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,167
Hurry back, dear.

163
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,138
I feel that I'm a little to blame in this.

164
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:13,143
You know, I didn't realize what a bright,
upstanding young man you were.

165
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:16,044
And I don't care how big the city,
I feel confident...

166
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,945
you're going to be successful.

167
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,082
Thank you, sir.

168
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,854
Lucky, couldn't I go with you?

169
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,589
I'm afraid you'd try to be
a good influence on me.

170
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,653
No, honest I wouldn't.
I'm terrible bad when you get to know me.

171
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,857
Then I wouldn't want you
to come with me.

172
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,661
One to New York, please.

173
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,638
- Whose money are you using?
- Yours, thank you very much.

174
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,881
But our money belongs to us again.

175
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:54,709
What's the idea?

176
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,088
Remember our bet?
You see, you didn't get married.

177
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,351
- I'll pay you later.
- No.

178
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,456
All aboard!

179
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,894
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.

180
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,225
You know,
you didn't win that lucky quarter.

181
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,665
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.

182
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,629
I don't want to go to New York.

183
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,166
He doesn't want to go to New York.

184
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:21,044
Goodbye, Lucky, old boy. So long.

185
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,740
- Goodbye, Lucky.
- See you later.

186
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:28,308
Give my regards to the folks, will you?
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.

187
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:32,555
So long. Goodbye, Lucky.

188
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:55,071
Lucky, here's your suitcase.

189
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,291
Here's your toothbrush.

190
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,134
Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke.

191
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,473
- Well, take the quarter.
- No, sir, not the lucky one.

192
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:33,207
Wait a minute. I'll get a smoke.

193
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,012
I beg your pardon,
have you got a match, please?

194
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,356
Thank you.

195
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,626
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.

196
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,221
Then you won't need the matches.

197
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,753
I'm afraid that won't work,
unless you have a needle and thread.

198
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:18,156
Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?

199
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:25,892
Thank you very much.

200
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,264
You shouldn't have done that just for me.

201
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,603
I could've gotten along without them.

202
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,146
- You hold it.
- All right.

203
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:42,209
Looks like a jackpot.

204
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:46,347
Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick.

205
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,289
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.

206
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,629
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

207
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:00,630
Just a moment. That quarter,
I wonder if I could have it back?

208
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,730
This isn't getting you anywhere.

209
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,532
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.

210
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,510
All I want to know is...

211
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,579
It's all my fault, too.

212
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,753
I'm awfully sorry.

213
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:24,488
Yes, I know.
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.

214
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,361
All right, give it back.

215
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:36,138
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.

216
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,031
Come on, will you?

217
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,143
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.

218
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,578
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.

219
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:45,639
- Officer.
- Come on. Let's go, will you?

220
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:46,876
No, wait a minute.

221
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,715
What seems to be the trouble?
Good morning, sir.

222
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:53,821
Officer, this man stole a quarter
from my purse. Make him give it back.

223
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:56,951
Now, miss, does he look like a man
who would steal quarters?

224
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:59,553
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...

225
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,929
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.

226
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,275
Now you run along, sister...

227
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,314
before I run you in
for disturbing the peace.

228
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:18,575
But, Officer, he took my...

229
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:22,016
That'll be enough.
Run along now, you're obstructing traffic.

230
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,500
Why, you Cossack.

231
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:44,365
Officer, you had no right
to speak to that little girl that way.

232
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,808
I suppose you're going to tell me
what my duty is.

233
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:47,969
Not at all, but...

234
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:51,674
Listen, guys like you pay me
to protect them from screwy dames.

235
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,513
That's fine, but in this instance
I'm sure you were wrong.

236
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,382
So now I'm wrong.

237
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,354
You ought to thank me for what I've done.

238
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:00,515
- All right, thank you.
- All right.

239
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,959
What did you say?

240
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:14,931
I said, look out for the great big ditch.

241
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,726
Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?

242
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:39,558
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.

243
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,824
Give me that.

244
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,531
Wait for me.

245
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:58,878
Miss Carrol!

246
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,344
Hello, kids.

247
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:03,683
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.

248
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:06,746
Any more dilly-dallying and
some of you will lose your jobs.

249
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,587
Yes, and that goes for you girls, too.

250
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,425
Anybody would think
I had nothing else to do, but nothing.

251
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:13,921
One would.

252
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,364
Miss Anderson, good morning.

253
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,598
If you're late again, you'll be fired, too.

254
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,731
That's final. I have nothing more to say.

255
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,672
That's good.

256
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:29,244
- Is that you, Mabel?
- I don't know. Tell me, is it?

257
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,813
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.

258
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,214
I'm never sure these days.

259
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:40,552
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.

260
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,991
Would you mind waiting a second, please?
Thank you very much.

261
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,364
Miss Anderson, come quickly.

262
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,365
Please.

263
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,640
He's hissing at me again, the swan.

264
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,250
And good morning to you, too.

265
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:16,122
- Are you interested in the dance?
- I came here to see if I...

266
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:18,491
All the world loves a dancer.
To know how to dance...

267
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,655
Is to know how to control oneself.

268
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:22,699
Thanks. You saved me a lot of breath.

269
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,998
Our course is $45.
But the first lesson is given free...

270
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,698
to see if the prospective student
has any real aptitude.

271
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:32,607
That's why our school is so successful.
We never refuse the $45.

272
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,177
- I mean...
- You never let a pupil get away.

273
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,679
I understand.

274
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:37,907
We don't fool anybody.

275
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:44,214
Have you any preference as to the type
of instructress you'd like?

276
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:49,318
Yes, I have.
I'd like one that comes to about here.

277
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:52,828
And if she had red hair,
that would be a great help.

278
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,395
And a cute little nose.

279
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,729
She might be able to teach you
to move your feet.

280
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:59,201
Miss Anderson, my dear. Good morning.

281
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:01,903
Me, too.

282
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,803
- Mr. Gordon, this is Mr...
- Garnett.

283
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:08,538
How do you do, Mr. Garnett?
I'm delighted, I assure you.

284
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:11,274
- The young man would like a trial lesson.
- Of course.

285
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:13,179
I think Miss Carrol might please him.

286
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,718
Of course, Miss Carrol.
Come this way, will you?

287
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:17,481
She's one of our best instructresses.

288
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:20,319
You're a very fortunate young man
to learn to dance...

289
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:22,882
- to move...
- To flirt with Terpsichore.

290
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,723
Yes. What?

291
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:34,293
How do you do?
Do you mind if I wait here?

292
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,271
- No, help yourself.
- Thanks.

293
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,103
I mean to the chair.

294
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,043
Miss Carrol, this is Mr. Garnett.

295
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:45,380
This is Miss Penelope Carrol.

296
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:48,145
We're all so fond of her here,
we just call her Penny.

297
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,152
Penny, dear.

298
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,453
- This is Mr. Garnett.
- Penny.

299
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,827
Miss Carrol.

300
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:03,731
Mr. Garnett is very anxious
to learn how to dance.

301
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:07,632
So you won't always be stepping
on other people's toes.

302
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:11,502
- That's very good, isn't it?
- Yes, that's very good.

303
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,869
What kind of dancing
would you like to learn?

304
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:17,605
What kind have you got?

305
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,142
- Sap.
- Sap dancing?

306
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:24,449
- No, she means tap dancing.
- Tap dancing, of course.

307
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,546
You see, we have tap dancing...

308
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:29,320
and ballroom dancing
and aesthetic dancing.

309
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:33,223
If it's all the same to you,
I'll take a little of each.

310
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:35,026
A little of each, yes.

311
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,058
Miss Carrol wants to know
what kind you'd like to learn first?

312
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:41,837
Whichever takes the longest.

313
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:46,604
Go on, begin the lesson.

314
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,047
You must learn to walk first.

315
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:54,776
Now start with your right foot, please.

316
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:58,982
- No, your right foot.
- Sorry, I'm left-handed.

317
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:02,792
Right, left.

318
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:08,130
Miss Carrol, I'm sorry about your quarter.
But you see, Penny...

319
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,291
If you're trying to annoy me,
you're succeeding.

320
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,028
I know you don't care about dancing.

321
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,332
But I do. All the world loves a dancer.
Don't you?

322
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:19,075
Right, left.

323
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:25,878
- This is fun.
- Now you turn.

324
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:28,918
Start again. Right, left.

325
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:33,015
If you don't get out of here,
I'm going to lose my temper.

326
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:35,282
If you talk like that, I'll call a policeman.

327
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,418
- Why, you...
- Officer...

328
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:44,328
"Our young ladies are sweet-tempered,
patient and understanding. "

329
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:46,163
You're doing splendidly.

330
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:48,630
I don't think you need me here any longer.

331
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,174
I know I'm leaving you in good hands.

332
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,301
Lovely hands.

333
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:58,340
You know, that's the most marvelous trick
I've ever seen a magician do.

334
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:01,077
You mean the one with the four aces?

335
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,245
No, the way you made
my club sandwich disappear.

336
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:06,552
Who, me?

337
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,418
My dear young lady...

338
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,926
You'd better take a club sandwich
out of this hat.

339
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:14,898
Are you accusing me
of eating your sandwich?

340
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:17,933
You might begin by taking that piece
of lettuce off your necktie.

341
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,638
One, two, three. Turn.

342
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,108
Let's try it again from the beginning.

343
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:36,416
One, two, three. Turn.

344
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,655
- I'm getting it, aren't I?
- Yes.

345
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,225
Again.

346
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,488
One, two, three. Turn.

347
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,403
Now you've got it.

348
00:24:57,674 --> 00:24:59,972
I can't teach you anything.

349
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:35,898
All right, I'll show you again.
Remember, three steps to the left...

350
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,373
three steps to the right and turn.

351
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:41,502
One, two, three.

352
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,054
Listen, no one could teach you
to dance in a million years.

353
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,993
- Take my advice and save your money.
- Miss Carrol.

354
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:02,854
How do you think this school can exist
if you turn away applicants?

355
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,662
- You're discharged.
- But, Mr...

356
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:06,828
Get your things and go.

357
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,667
- But I...
- Get out.

358
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,240
That's quite all right, don't you worry.
I'll find you another instructress.

359
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,608
You stay right there.

360
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,909
So this is the way you treat
your customers?

361
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:21,473
I certainly don't treat them to sandwiches.
Get out of here.

362
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:23,886
Miss Anderson,
what is the meaning of this?

363
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:25,819
What's gotten
into everybody this morning?

364
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:27,857
My sandwich got into him.

365
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:30,616
You're fired.

366
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:33,657
Okay, swivel puss.

367
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:37,497
It might interest you to know
that I've also discharged Miss Carrol.

368
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,832
You've discharged Penny? Why?

369
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:42,599
Why, for no reason at all. Please see her.

370
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:44,641
But she said
she couldn't teach you anything.

371
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,107
She was trying to flatter me.

372
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:49,441
She's the most wonderful
little teacher I've ever heard of.

373
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,312
Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon
how much you just taught me.

374
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:54,372
No, never mind.

375
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,112
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

376
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:59,678
I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this.
It's an interesting experiment.

377
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:02,281
How did you say that last step went?

378
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,334
Shall we try it right through?

379
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,560
Won't you sit down, Mr. Gordon?

380
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:19,551
Wait!

381
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:22,757
Sheer heaven, my dears, sheer heaven!

382
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:25,332
- Is she still fired?
- Fired?

383
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:29,463
You took me too seriously, both of you.
Just you wait there for one moment.

384
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,767
Hey, he got her job back for her.
Wasn't that swell?

385
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:37,942
What one man can do, another man can.

386
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,253
All right, Al. Thank you.

387
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:47,887
Now listen, I've just made
an appointment for you for a tryout...

388
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,153
with Mr. Simpson,
the owner of the Silver Sandal.

389
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,685
The Silver Sandal!
That's wonderful, isn't it?

390
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,095
It certainly is.

391
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,745
Penny, you wear your white lamé gown.

392
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:13,749
That's how I see you. You in white,
and Mr. Garnett here in dinner clothes.

393
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:17,818
- Dinner clothes?
- Yes, certainly.

394
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,916
You'll do it? You'll be there?

395
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:28,462
Now do you think I could disappoint you?
I'll be there.

396
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:39,370
You are still fired!

397
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:54,851
Pop, you can pay the cab.

398
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:00,862
- Have you got change for $10?
- I have.

399
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,199
Thanks.

400
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,602
Here you are, buddy. You keep that.

401
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:13,503
Now I don't want you to worry
about losing your job.

402
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:14,908
I'll take care of you.

403
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:17,446
Yes, but I'll take care of my own $10.

404
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,104
Wouldn't you like to double it?

405
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:21,878
Sure, I love to gamble
if I'm sure I'm going to win.

406
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:26,082
- The trouble is, you lose sometimes.
- No. We always win.

407
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,685
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

408
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:35,254
That's fine then.
I'll telephone you when I'm ready.

409
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:37,323
- All right.
- Where do you live?

410
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,571
- Right here.
- Since when?

411
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,241
Since from now on.

412
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:55,510
How am I going to get a dinner jacket
for tonight?

413
00:32:55,585 --> 00:32:59,316
Don't worry about that.
Look, I borrowed this from Mabel.

414
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,922
You're marvelous.

415
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,853
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

416
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,588
I want to get suite for myself
and Mr. Cardetti, please.

417
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:08,096
- Something at about...
- Just about...

418
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:10,098
Yes, that's about enough.

419
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,667
Doctor, would you mind rushing down
to the docks...

420
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:15,899
to see if our trunks
have passed through the customs yet?

421
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:18,936
Just a moment.
You may need my verification.

422
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:39,762
- What size chest?
- Chest?

423
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,898
You mean that little chest.
The one in the hold?

424
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,195
Yeah.

425
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:49,670
- That chest is 36 inches.
- 36.

426
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,573
How long do you intend to stay with us?

427
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,437
That'll be entirely up to you.

428
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:07,313
Did you get a dinner jacket?

429
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,826
No, I went broke trying to win enough
to buy you one.

430
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:12,926
- What am I going to do?
- Now don't worry.

431
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:16,159
I got you the swellest looking outfit
you ever saw in your life.

432
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:17,529
Where is it?

433
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,035
It looks like a perfect 36.

434
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:30,610
I want you to meet my old friend, Eric...
What's your name again?

435
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:34,607
My name is Eric Lacanistram.

436
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:38,083
I met Eric in the gambling house.
He lost all his money, too.

437
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,451
I lost all my money, too.

438
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,919
- Eric just loves to gamble.
- Really?

439
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,486
It's in the Lacanistrams' blood.

440
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:51,625
Yeah, he'll play you for his necktie
or his shirt or anything he's got on.

441
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:54,465
Well, I'll toss you for the whole outfit.

442
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:57,404
No, I'm off pitch and toss.

443
00:34:57,907 --> 00:35:00,467
The Lacanistrams' game is piquet.

444
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,577
Has been for years and years and years...

445
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:08,008
before the conquest
and then after the conquest...

446
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:10,812
for years and years and years.

447
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:15,714
In fact, we've been playing piquet
for years...

448
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,320
and years...

449
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:23,429
- But I don't know piquet.
- Don't worry, I do.

450
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,334
Yes, Al. All right, goodbye.

451
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,197
If we're not at the Silver Sandal
in 10 minutes, the tryout's off.

452
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:33,071
But 20 minutes ago,
Lucky said he'd be here in five minutes.

453
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,611
He's said that for the past hour.
I'm gonna go get him.

454
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,011
I wish you would. I feel like a fool.

455
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:40,047
But you are.

456
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:06,833
Twenty-four, twenty-five,
twenty-six and twenty-seven.

457
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:10,270
And that's piquet, Mr. Garnett.

458
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,540
Pop, you certainly did show me
how to play piquet.

459
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,783
You're doing fine.

460
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,921
Fine? This fellow will have my skin
in a minute.

461
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:24,357
Come in.

462
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:29,026
Penny!

463
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:34,063
Listen, Penny. Look, Penny.
Listen, let me explain.

464
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,670
The clothes that I had before...

465
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:39,334
When you're talking to a lady,
you should take your hat off.

466
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:44,775
Your petticoat's showing.

467
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,370
Keep up the good work, boys.
The public is with you.

468
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:23,077
Mabel, will you get down from there
and stop being ridiculous?

469
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,713
Maybe you're the one
that's being ridiculous.

470
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:30,158
For a whole week you've been sulking
at him for something that wasn't his fault.

471
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:31,955
I suppose it was my fault.

472
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:35,825
It's your fault that you're missing
the tryout that Lucky arranged tonight.

473
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:37,696
He's only doing it for you.

474
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,927
You're not so smart,
letting your stubbornness...

475
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,369
interfere with the very thing you want.

476
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:45,030
I like being stubborn
where he's concerned.

477
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:46,807
It must be love.

478
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:49,467
How could I fall in love
with a common gambler?

479
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,411
When a man takes a little quarter...

480
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,075
and builds it into a bankroll
that would choke a horse...

481
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,142
and makes my little $10
grow into hundreds...

482
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:59,812
I'd call him an uncommon gambler.

483
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,097
Come in, comrade.

484
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:17,264
You, outside.

485
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:22,642
My card.

486
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,515
You're a big success.
She's willing to arbitrate.

487
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,811
I told you it would work.

488
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:32,048
Mabel, will you tell that fellow to get out
of the hall and stop annoying me?

489
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:34,586
No, you sit down.

490
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,119
You just hold your ground.

491
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,097
Yes?

492
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,195
Hello.

493
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,144
- Penny.
- You'd better get out of here.

494
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,544
All right, I will.

495
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:07,622
However, before I go, I want to tell you
that maybe I was wrong the other night.

496
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,486
But I didn't know it at the time.

497
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,050
- So now you know.
- Yes, I do.

498
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:14,590
Goodbye.

499
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:19,825
Wait a minute.
Maybe, in a way, I might have been wrong.

500
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,066
No, this one is on me.

501
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:26,033
Listen, Lucky Garnett,
there's no use arguing.

502
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:29,338
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

503
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,045
All right, goodbye.

504
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:48,027
Lucky, wait a minute.

505
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:57,046
<i>This concludes the Ricardo Romero
Romantic Melody Hour.</i>

506
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:01,012
You know, I don't like that fellow.

507
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:03,557
- He's very nice.
- That?

508
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,321
You have no reason to dislike him.
You don't even know him.

509
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:08,829
It's true, but when I dislike someone
for no reason...

510
00:43:08,897 --> 00:43:10,831
I always find it more enjoyable.

511
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,868
As a matter of fact,
he's asked me to marry him several times.

512
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,563
Of course you laughed.

513
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,834
Or does he make you lose
your sense of humor?

514
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,100
- Ricardo.
- Hello.

515
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:26,341
I want you to meet Mr. Garnett.
He's going to dance with me tonight.

516
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:30,476
How do you do? I played that last number
especially for you.

517
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:31,985
Thank you.

518
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:39,416
Now I know him and I still don't like him.

519
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,822
Beautiful, isn't it?

520
00:43:46,468 --> 00:43:48,993
- What is?
- The music.

521
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:52,967
What music?

522
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:57,602
- The music they're playing.
- Yes.

523
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,180
What made you think of it?

524
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,210
- Think of what?
- The music.

525
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,150
I don't know.
My mind was wandering, I guess.

526
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:18,763
You as scared as I am?

527
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:22,528
Don't be nervous. It's only a dance.
It's nothing to worry about.

528
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:25,664
That's right. Don't worry at all, my dear...

529
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:29,973
because you're not going to dance.
Because there isn't going to be any music.

530
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,043
But, Ricky, you promised.

531
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:35,413
I promised you could dance
anytime you want, alone.

532
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:37,145
I'll dance with Lucky or not at all.

533
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:41,451
That's what I said, too, not at all.
Good night.

534
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:48,563
Come on, we'll see about that.

535
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,574
- Mr. Simpson?
- Hello, Garnett.

536
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:03,634
Will you please tell Romero
that he has to play for our dance?

537
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:07,614
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Romero's played his last tune for me.

538
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,512
- But you said that...
- I know I did.

539
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:12,109
But I lost his contract last night
playing cards.

540
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:15,179
He's now the property of Dice Raymond.

541
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:18,288
Orchestras usually play for somebody.

542
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,329
This is the first I've heard
of anybody playing for an orchestra.

543
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:23,830
- I guess there's nothing we can do.
- Wait a minute.

544
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:27,494
Do you think we could interest Raymond
in another game for that contract?

545
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:29,093
I doubt it.

546
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:32,072
He's always wanted Romero's band
for his club...

547
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,402
but he's a gambler.

548
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,070
Where is this Raymond's place?

549
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,082
Thirty-sixth floor, Club Raymond.

550
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,522
Thirty-six.

551
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:10,775
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello, Ricardo. Looks like a big night.

552
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,510
Because where Ricardo Romero goes,
the others come.

553
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:26,485
Here goes everything on the red.

554
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:32,060
Will you excuse me for a second?
I think I need a bit of fresh air.

555
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:34,125
- I can't stand the strain.
- Wait a second.

556
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:38,600
Twenty-seven, red, and third dozen.

557
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:40,401
This is no strain.

558
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,626
Please, don't be angry.
I want to talk to you.

559
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:11,962
I don't want to talk to you.

560
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:15,871
I'm awfully sorry if I hurt you...

561
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:19,341
but I didn't want to see anyone else
dance with you.

562
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:22,276
It makes me jealous.

563
00:47:22,784 --> 00:47:24,274
Jealous?

564
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,487
Because...

565
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:28,919
I love you.

566
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:31,420
You have a very funny way of showing it.

567
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:32,983
On the red.

568
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:37,924
I want you to look at this new fellow.
He's taking me, and fast.

569
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:41,560
Say, if that hits for you,
you'll have just exactly enough.

570
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,370
Enough for what?

571
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:45,972
Why, enough to go back
and marry Margaret.

572
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,168
What? Wait a minute. No bet.

573
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:52,437
Seven. The red wins, and the first dozen.

574
00:47:53,515 --> 00:47:55,949
Pop, you're a pal.
In fact, you're more than a pal...

575
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:58,383
you're a partner. I'm going to cash in.

576
00:47:58,453 --> 00:48:01,183
So you won enough,
you're going to leave us.

577
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,781
Yes, winning more money
doesn't interest me.

578
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:06,119
Boy, you like to gamble.

579
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:09,230
I'll cut you once, double or nothing.

580
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:14,430
- No, thanks.
- Scared?

581
00:48:17,672 --> 00:48:19,697
You have a contract with Romero,
haven't you?

582
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:26,637
I'll tell you what I will do.

583
00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:34,020
All my winnings against his contract.

584
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:36,853
No, I win the orchestra...

585
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,453
I keep the orchestra.

586
00:48:39,527 --> 00:48:40,789
Scared?

587
00:48:42,831 --> 00:48:45,823
You're on. I'll high-card you.

588
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:48,493
Tony, bring a fresh deck.

589
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,968
Keeps them on the ice.

590
00:48:56,544 --> 00:48:57,977
You're covered.

591
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:07,883
Shuffle.

592
00:49:14,262 --> 00:49:16,730
- Cut.
- After you.

593
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:26,297
King of spades.

594
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:31,378
Wait a minute.

595
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,110
Let me, will you?

596
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,245
Sure, let the old boy cut.

597
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:42,045
Ace of spades.

598
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:52,161
Excuse me, boys,
I got to go and get a double sundae.

599
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:55,302
Maybe we play
for this orchestra again someday.

600
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,462
Thank you, Mr. Raymond.

601
00:49:57,806 --> 00:49:59,899
Pop, cash in for me, will you?

602
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:02,500
Okay, give us dough for these, will you?

603
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,810
Maybe we can have that dance after all.

604
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:10,749
- How?
- Look, I just won Romero's contract.

605
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:17,990
- That's a nice orchestra you have there.
- Just about the best.

606
00:50:18,126 --> 00:50:22,119
- The leader's the same as the orchestra.
- It's awfully nice of you to say that.

607
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:25,291
I wonder if you'd be kind enough
to play something for us...

608
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:27,467
- if you don't mind.
- But I do.

609
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:32,998
I'm afraid you'll have to because, you see,
I now own you.

610
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:34,632
What do you mean, you own me?

611
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:38,145
He just won you at the gambling tables.

612
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,274
I see.

613
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,408
Congratulations on winning
such a valuable piece of property.

614
00:50:43,485 --> 00:50:44,782
Thank you.

615
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:46,684
Now will you play your waltz for us?

616
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,223
No. If you read the contract carefully...

617
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,953
you will see I don't have to play
after this hour unless I want to.

618
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,188
So you won't play?

619
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:59,199
You're right. I won't play for you.

620
00:51:00,168 --> 00:51:01,157
I see.

621
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,466
That's all, boys.

622
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:09,204
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
my favorite maestro, Ricardo Romero...</i>

623
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:13,743
<i>has very kindly requested that Ms. Carrol
and I dance to his newest composition...</i>

624
00:51:13,815 --> 00:51:15,806
<i>the lovely Waltz in Swing Time.</i>

625
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:19,547
<i>- Wait a minute. I didn't say...
- Look, he wants to be coaxed.</i>

626
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:23,954
<i>What's the matter, Ricky, old boy,
you bashful?</i>

627
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:28,752
<i>My pal.
This is the moment I've been waiting for.</i>

628
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:30,405
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- I'm going to get Pop.

629
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:34,039
I'll get him. I mean, I'll do it for you.
Sit still.

630
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:43,014
What's the matter with Lucky?
He seems to have something on his mind.

631
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:45,616
You mean something else besides you?

632
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,590
I don't know. I only get to see him
at the rehearsals or with you and Pop...

633
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:52,561
or when somebody else is around.

634
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:56,195
Don't worry, darling. I'm going to see
that you get a break this afternoon.

635
00:54:56,271 --> 00:55:00,230
Say, whose idea was this, anyway?
Going to the country on a day like this.

636
00:55:00,575 --> 00:55:03,271
It was Mabel's, but she's made it mine.

637
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,340
Listen, you got to do me a favor.

638
00:55:05,413 --> 00:55:08,644
No matter where we go or what we do,
don't leave me alone with Penny.

639
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:11,708
What's the matter,
ain't you in love with her?

640
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:15,716
You wouldn't pin me down
with a question like that, would you?

641
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:19,954
I see. Why, that's fine.
Why don't you tell her?

642
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:23,125
She's too sweet a kid, and besides that...

643
00:55:23,197 --> 00:55:26,428
I can't go on like this without her knowing
something about Margaret...

644
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:30,704
and I haven't got the nerve
to come out and tell her, that's all.

645
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:35,542
You don't have to go back to Margaret
unless you get $25,000.

646
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,770
Yeah, I know.

647
00:55:36,844 --> 00:55:41,213
So you haven't got it.
So you don't have to go back.

648
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,818
Yes, but it's more than money.
I'm in a fine spot.

649
00:55:45,787 --> 00:55:48,085
- I'm going to take care of this.
- Pop, no.

650
00:55:48,156 --> 00:55:52,149
- You better lay off gambling for a while.
- But I don't want to lay off.

651
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:00,623
- Hello, Lucky.
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.

652
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:03,398
I was looking for you.
Have you seen the improvements?

653
00:56:03,471 --> 00:56:06,599
The decorators are working day and night,
and when we're through...

654
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:09,040
the Silver Sandal
should be the finest place in town.

655
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,045
And with you and Penny
dancing to Romero's music...

656
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:13,580
we're going to clean up.

657
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:16,173
Yes, but I'm not sure I can stick around.

658
00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:18,915
Yes, you can.

659
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:23,112
But you must. Look, if you're not satisfied
with the terms...

660
00:56:23,624 --> 00:56:25,114
I'll make you a half partner.

661
00:56:25,526 --> 00:56:30,088
I'll give you 50%. That should make you
about $30,000 for the season.

662
00:56:30,665 --> 00:56:35,034
My advice is to take 25%
and be on the safe side.

663
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:39,033
Let me see.
25%, that would give me $15,000.

664
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:43,039
You're right. Not over 25%.

665
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:45,304
- Is it a deal?
- Sure.

666
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,574
Right.

667
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:54,351
Remember what I told you about
not leaving me alone with, you know...

668
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:57,154
Would you say he was crazy, or am I?

669
00:56:57,225 --> 00:56:58,783
I wouldn't say.

670
00:56:59,305 --> 00:57:59,459
