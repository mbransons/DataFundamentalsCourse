1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,588
- Father O'Malley?
- Yes.

3
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,134
- Welcome to St Mary's, Father.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,684
I suppose you're tired
after your travelling.

5
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,225
Oh, yeah, it's pretty tiresome,
all the way in the day coach.

6
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,723
I'll take you up to your room,
it's all ready.

7
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,600
There's nothing to do now
but go to bed.

8
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,819
Is Father Fogarty still here?

9
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,689
No. They took him away this morning.

10
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,986
Poor man.
My heart went out to him.

11
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,110
Poor man? Why?

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,658
Oh, you'll find out.

13
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,880
Well, I think you'll find
everything you want here, Father.

14
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,428
Er... sure I couldn't get you
a cup of tea now?

15
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,471
No, thanks.

16
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,266
I don't understand what you mean
about Father Fogarty.

17
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,639
I'll find out. I'll find out what?

18
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,233
What Father Fogarty found out.

19
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,772
Oh, the poor man.

20
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,442
There you go again.
What happened to him?

21
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,782
They took him away mumbling to himself
in a wheelchair.

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,324
They took him away? Where?

23
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,539
Shady Rest.

24
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,993
He even said a prayer for you

25
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,836
that your stay here
might be successful and enjoyable,

26
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,796
though he doubted it very much.

27
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,217
You see, he had very definite ideas
about running this school,

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,837
about the raising and education
of children, and so have they.

29
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,306
- They?
- The sisters.

30
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,848
Father Fogarty said
they wanted their way in everything,

31
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,893
and after he was confined
to a wheelchair, they had it.

32
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,360
Well, maybe he was just
getting along in years.

33
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,152
Oh? He looked all right
when he got here.

34
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,078
That's strange.

35
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,243
I don't anticipate any trouble.

36
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,204
You don't, eh?

37
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,673
You've never been pastor
of a parochial school, then?

38
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,297
No, it's my first experience.

39
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,007
Huh...

40
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,260
Well...

41
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,181
I can see you don't know what it means
to be up to your neck in nuns.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,892
No.

43
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,898
- Goodnight, Father.
- Goodnight.

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,076
Sleep well tonight.

45
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,925
Oh...

46
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,559
Morning, Sister. I'm Father O'Malley.

47
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,522
Good morning, Father.

48
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,852
This is our school bell.

49
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,674
We usually ring it about an hour from now
when the children are here.

50
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,362
I see... Do you think I could I see
Sister Superior? Is she up yet?

51
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,326
I'm sure she is now, Father.

52
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,787
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

53
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,628
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning.

54
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,171
Sam.

55
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,848
Sister Benedict and the others
are very eager to meet you, Father.

56
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,824
Please sit down,
and I'll tell her you're here.

57
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,606
Thank you.

58
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,198
Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

59
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,319
Our cat had kittens
and they're all over the place.

60
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,618
The father's a member
of the parish, I presume.

61
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,911
Excuse me, Father.
I'll tell Sister you're here.

62
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,676
- Good morning, Father.
- Won't you sit down?

63
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,476
- Good morning, Father.
- Would you sit down, please?

64
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,536
Good morning, Father.

65
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,083
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Father.

66
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,959
Good morning, Father.

67
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,672
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Father.

68
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,592
Good morning, Father.

69
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,894
Good morning, Father.

70
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,909
- It has been my...
- Father, this is Sister Superior.

71
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,450
Father O'Malley,
Sister Mary Benedict.

72
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,699
- How do you do, Sister?
- How do you do, Father?

73
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,793
- Sisters, this is Father O'Malley.
- How do you do?

74
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,164
Father O'Malley is here
as a substitute for Father Fogarty,

75
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,463
who, as you know, has departed
for a much needed rest.

76
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,881
We do hope your stay here
will be a pleasant one, Father.

77
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,013
Thank you, Sister.

78
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,803
We're looking forward expectantly
to your views as an educator.

79
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,975
I'm sure that Father wishes to say
a few words to us.

80
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,597
Well... yes, I...

81
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,110
St Mary's has been here
a great many years,

82
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,700
and has seen the labours of a...
good number of the sisters of your order.

83
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,495
And I know that the work
hasn't been easy.

84
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,458
In the eyes of the world,
very few even take notice of it,

85
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,293
but earthly honours and rewards
are not for you.

86
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,247
You've sent forth generations of pupils

87
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,548
who have been a credit
to the teachings inculcated here.

88
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,218
St Mary's has grown old doing good.

89
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,101
As for myself, may I tell you

90
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,097
that I'm happy I've been selected
as pastor of St Mary's.

91
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,486
Working in a parish
where there's a parish school

92
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,030
is going to prove
a new experience for me

93
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,903
and I'm sure
a very interesting one.

94
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,915
Yes, I see what you mean.

95
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:12,384
However, as in all things we assume
the tasks assigned to us without complaint

96
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,672
and with a hopeful view
to the future.

97
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,012
Yes...

98
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:30,690
By the epistle of Saint Peter,
where he says, "Be sober and watch."

99
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,651
What's the matter, was it Saint Paul?

100
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,035
Now just to get serious
for a moment, it...

101
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,422
I see...

102
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,885
In conclusion,
may I say that I'm happy...

103
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,398
I, er... I'm sorry,
but that's the first bell

104
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,192
and the sisters have to go
to their classes.

105
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,566
Would you like to say a few words
to the pupils before the second bell?

106
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,784
You may prefer speaking
to the children.

107
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,370
- I'd certainly be more at ease.
- Yes.

108
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,410
I want to speak to you, too.

109
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:32,542
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

110
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,218
and to the republic
for which it stands,

111
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:44,309
one nation, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

112
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:49,430
Children, our new pastor,
Father O'Malley, wishes to speak to you.

113
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,398
I'm sure you'll be very glad
to greet him,

114
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:56,362
and I'm also sure that he has something
very important to say to you.

115
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,118
Well, children, you're going to see
a lot of me in the future.

116
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,989
I'm gonna be around here
a great deal.

117
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,707
You're gonna hear the shortest speech
you ever heard.

118
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,418
This is a holiday.
Everybody, take the day off.

119
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,305
Pretty effective speech, huh?
I had to get my self-confidence back.

120
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,183
See, when we were kids,
we used to just live for holidays.

121
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,401
We should never get too far away
from our childhood.

122
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,144
Do you realise what you've done?

123
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,442
These children are liable
to get into mischief.

124
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,987
The responsibility is yours.

125
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,529
It seemed like a good idea.

126
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,654
But you can't call a holiday
just like that.

127
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,281
You have to get permission
of the superintendent of schools.

128
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,909
What will we tell him?

129
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,456
Well, I'll call him.

130
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,298
There's a man that really needs a holiday.
I may give him the day off.

131
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,593
My school wasn't like this.

132
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,139
See, I could look out the window
and see fields and trees,

133
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,761
and the old swimming hole.

134
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,729
You know, hang your clothes
on a hickory limb.

135
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,019
Last one out finds them
tied up in knots.

136
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,983
- Where, Father?
- Missouri.

137
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,602
I came from Ireland.

138
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,650
I used to.

139
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,486
Where are you from, Sister?

140
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,846
I was born in Sweden,
but when I was very small, I came to...

141
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,453
Uh-uh-uh, don't tell me.
Minnesota.

142
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,415
Well, that's right, Father.

143
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:37,163
I love the winter. I used to ski to school,
and there was one big hill like...

144
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,539
Oh.

145
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,292
You carry them home after.

146
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,781
You wouldn't guess it, Father,
but she was a tomboy from what I hear.

147
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,886
- That so?
- Yes.

148
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,882
She played baseball and football
with the boys.

149
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,509
- How good were you at the...?
- Oh, I hit over 300.

150
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,978
Oh, that was in the wheat belt.

151
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,306
I guess we all had it better
than these kids, didn't we?

152
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,892
They haven't even got a place to play.

153
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,440
That used to be our playground.

154
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,528
Over there where that is?

155
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,115
Yes. We had to sell the ground.

156
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,485
We needed money to fix our building.

157
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,703
They were going to condemn it.

158
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,199
- Where'd you put the money?
- Oh, you'd be surprised, Father.

159
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,826
We had to put in a new sprinkler system,
new fire escapes.

160
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,455
The foundation had to be reinforced.
It was very expensive.

161
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,673
Hardly seems worth it.

162
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,211
We think so, Father.

163
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,302
Oh... yes, yes. Of course.

164
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,473
What are the other classrooms like?

165
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,229
Say, what's going on up there?

166
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,274
We're repairing the roof. It leaks.

167
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,318
A trifle.

168
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,210
You're very overcrowded here too,
aren't you?

169
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,068
Oh, yes.

170
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,819
A trifle.

171
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,916
Looks like St Mary's
is in a bad way... a trifle.

172
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,127
We're relying on you
to help us, Father.

173
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,505
It's too bad you don't have
a building like that now.

174
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
That'd be your answer to everything.

175
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,267
That's where we intended to build
our new St Mary's.

176
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,316
A building very much like that.

177
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,773
There it is,
only we don't own it.

178
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,280
Confidentially, Father,
that's what we've been praying for.

179
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,494
You've been praying for what?

180
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,993
That the owner will wake up one morning
and give it to us.

181
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,918
That who would wake up when
and give you what?

182
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,791
Mr Bogardus, the owner.

183
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,919
Yes, that's what we are praying for.

184
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,637
Oh, woman, great is thy faith.

185
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,927
Well, if faith can move mountains...

186
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,971
You figured you could just
move right in, huh?

187
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,346
- Yes.
- You gotta be practical, let's face it.

188
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,894
Does the owner know anything
about this? Anybody ask him?

189
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,436
No, we just prayed.

190
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,150
That's where you could help us.

191
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,486
What do I do when he says no?

192
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,211
Hey, there, all you kids!
Get down outta there!

193
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,421
Why aren't you in school?
You hear me?

194
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,216
That's bad.
They shouldn't be doing that.

195
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,677
After all, it's a holiday.

196
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,215
Who's this coming here?

197
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,386
Well, that's Mr Bogardus.

198
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,764
I think we better go now.

199
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,733
And you can tell him
why the children aren't in school.

200
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,195
You want me to say anything
about the building?

201
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,154
Some other time.

202
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,161
Hey! Hey, you. Here.

203
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,622
Well, what's going on here?

204
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,490
- You see that fence?
- Yeah.

205
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,539
You see what those children are...
Who are you?

206
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,209
- I'm the new pastor.
- Oh, you are, eh?

207
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,333
Well, I want you to see to it
that those little brats are punished.

208
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,053
I'll take care of it, Mr Bogardus.
I will censure them severely.

209
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,674
- Oh... so you know who I am, huh?
- Yes, I do.

210
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,809
Are you the fella I'm supposed
to do business with?

211
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,270
I've been sent here by my superiors
to make some recommendations.

212
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,562
- I've been looking over the school.
- Oh, you have, eh?

213
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,527
Well, there you are.
What do you think of it?

214
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,525
- Looks pretty tired.
- Tired, eh? Tired is no name for it.

215
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,152
And if you don't sell it to me...
You got my offer, didn't you?

216
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,308
- Got it right here in my pocket.
- What do you say?

217
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,416
It's a difficult decision to make.
I can't jump at it, you know.

218
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,378
Well, I warn you, if you don't sell it to me,
it's gonna be condemned.

219
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,748
- By whom?
- The City Council.

220
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,671
- How do you know?
- I'm chairman.

221
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:56,137
- Oh, you are, eh?
- You're darned right I am.

222
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,349
And when they order you to tear it down,
you've got to pay for it.

223
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,847
- You look like a practical man, Father.
- I do?

224
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,316
Well, take my word for it, there's not
a mother or father in the parish

225
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,528
that wouldn't rather see their children
over at St Victor's.

226
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,114
Fine modern building.
Everything up to date.

227
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,529
Sunlight, good heat in the winter.

228
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,779
I wouldn't think of sending my children
into that firetrap.

229
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,076
- You have any children?
- No.

230
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,455
- That's a long story.
- Skip it.

231
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,420
- All right.
- Just being practical, Mr Bogardus.

232
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,211
How far do the children have to go
to get to St Victor's?

233
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,755
Just about as far as I had to go
when I was a child.

234
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,548
Well, let's walk over.

235
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,343
Well, why not take my car?

236
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,217
I can't walk too much.
I've got a bad ticker.

237
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,264
Let's ride out to St Victor's
and take a look.

238
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,807
Now you're talking.

239
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,400
All you gotta do is close this school
and send the children over to St Victor's.

240
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,279
- And sell the property to you?
- That's right, it's that simple.

241
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,202
Well, you can always find me.
I'm here all day and every day.

242
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,620
I promise I won't make a move
without talking to you.

243
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,165
Can take a little while,
I'm a pretty slow thinker.

244
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,040
Now you don't look it to me.
No, sir.

245
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,208
Goodbye.

246
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,396
Father?

247
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,932
How do you do?

248
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,686
Are, er... are you in charge
of the school here?

249
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,656
Well, that's a question.
I have some authority.

250
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,274
Er...

251
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,112
You look like a man
who could understand my language.

252
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,864
Well, let's find out.
Start talking.

253
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,494
I'd like very much
to put my daughter in school here.

254
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,587
Mm-hmm.

255
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,253
You see, er...

256
00:18:55,384 --> 00:19:00,971
Well, I... I think it would be better
if she was away from me for a while.

257
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,598
Could she board?

258
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,388
It might be arranged,
but why did you...?

259
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,886
Does she need any references?

260
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,936
I mean, do you have to know
very much about her background?

261
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,185
Oh, yes. That is customary.

262
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,860
Well, er... it's like this.

263
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,615
I ran away from home
when I was very young to get married.

264
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,743
Stop me if you've heard this, Father.

265
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,494
He left me a long time ago
in Syracuse.

266
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,291
Thirteen years, to be exact.

267
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,833
Did you get married?

268
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,709
Oh, yes, after a little argument.

269
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,259
I think he was a little afraid
of settling down.

270
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,974
- He was a piano player.
- Oh.

271
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:51,021
- He had a wonderful smile, Father.
- I'll bet he had.

272
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,980
Very like yours.

273
00:19:54,944 --> 00:20:00,690
He had a little band,
kind of a non-recording orchestra.

274
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,987
Did you ever hear
of Gallagher's Gambleers?

275
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,362
No. Did anyone else?

276
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,159
I doubt it.

277
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,502
Well, anyway, the little band
got an offer to play in Cincinnati.

278
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:18,465
And he promised as soon as he got
a few dollars ahead, he'd send for me.

279
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,458
So you were left alone in Syracuse?

280
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,587
Till the baby came.

281
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,925
You've been supporting her
all this time?

282
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,551
Mm-hmm.

283
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,432
I... suppose you're wondering
as to how.

284
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,646
So is she.

285
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:42,193
She's, er... she's getting to be
a big girl now, Father, and...

286
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,572
...she's beginning to think
I'm no good.

287
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:53,037
I wanna put her in your care
before she finds out she's right.

288
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,041
I feel anyone who's as much concerned
about their daughter as you are

289
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,085
isn't doing too badly.

290
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,051
If there was anything really wrong
with you, you wouldn't give a dime.

291
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:09,258
Joe was the only man
I was ever really in love with, but...

292
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,689
If you care as much for Joe as you say,
why didn't you ever look him up?

293
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,102
I... I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to start.

294
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:24,732
Besides... he ran out on me, Father.

295
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,029
Oh, that's it.

296
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,746
Well, I'll do the best I can for you
if you send your daughter to see me.

297
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,287
- What's her daughter's name?
- Patricia.

298
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,250
Patricia.

299
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,421
I'll tell you,
I'll make a deal with you.

300
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,258
I'll take care of your daughter,
if you'll take care of yourself.

301
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,511
Thank you, Father.

302
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,221
- Father...
- O'Malley.

303
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,887
- O'Malley.
- Goodbye, Mrs Gallagher.

304
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,429
Goodbye.

305
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,518
- Father?
- Mm-hmm?

306
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,312
There's a young lady
calling to see you.

307
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,526
Oh, yes. Send her in.

308
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,857
- Miss Gallagher?
- Yes, Father.

309
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,577
I've made arrangements for you to board
across the street with Mrs Breen.

310
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,493
That will be just... lovely.

311
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,457
My boy will take your bags.

312
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,328
Eddie, take those bags over
and put them in the back bedroom.

313
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,954
OK, Mum.

314
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,504
Well, Patricia...

315
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:36,178
I think the sisters were expecting
someone much younger, and so was I.

316
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,147
Well, I was trying to look older, Father.

317
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,016
I've been out looking for work.

318
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,393
I thought maybe I could quit school
and take a job.

319
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,521
I was up really early answering ads.

320
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,488
I'm perfectly able
to take care of myself.

321
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,107
Mm-hmm.

322
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,077
Patsy, I think you're gonna be
very happy here at St Mary's.

323
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,945
You're gonna enjoy every minute of it.

324
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,700
You'll find that life can be very bright,
very beautiful here.

325
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:04,461
It's the character that came off.
Let me take a look at you now.

326
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,377
Oh, that's fine.

327
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,129
Yes, sir. You just give us a chance,
Patsy, and we'll fix you up.

328
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,097
What have we got here?

329
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,891
What are you smuggling?

330
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,107
What... what's this here?
What is this?

331
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,725
It's a rat, Father!

332
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,946
Well, you'll find around here
that you can't even wear a small mouse.

333
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,565
Things are brightening up already,
aren't they?

334
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,035
Oh, goodness.
Holy Toledo! Look at that.

335
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,794
You... you sent for me, Sister?

336
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,417
Yes, Patricia.

337
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,511
I wanted to talk to you.
You're falling behind in your studies.

338
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,134
If the work is too hard, Patsy,
I'll be glad to help you.

339
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,603
- If there's anything I can do...
- That isn't it, Sister. I...

340
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,724
I guess I'm just sort of a featherhead.

341
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,105
Don't you like school?

342
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,239
You're holding back on me, Patsy.
What's troubling you?

343
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,208
Nothing, Sister.

344
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,165
If you'll only work a little harder,
you'll get good marks.

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,008
We want to send your mother
a nice report card.

346
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,220
You want your mother
to be proud of you, don't you?

347
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,736
That's all, Patsy. You may go.

348
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,604
Thank you, Sister.

349
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,158
Hi, Pat.

350
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,254
- How's she doing?
- Not very well.

351
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,877
Oh no?

352
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,337
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

353
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,557
When we accepted this child,
it was on your recommendation.

354
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,679
We know very little about her parents.
What kind of a home life did she have?

355
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,806
You know, the usual, er...

356
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,274
- You said you met her mother?
- Yes. Yes, I have.

357
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,065
Do you know Mrs Gallagher well?

358
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,404
Yes, yes, I know her quite well.

359
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,172
- And her father, did you meet him?
- No, but I've heard about him.

360
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,366
- What is his occupation?
- He's a... musician.

361
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,911
They tell me
he has a charming personality, too.

362
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,784
I like people who like music,
don't you?

363
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,628
Are they separated?

364
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,165
Yes.

365
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,215
Is there anything... anything
that I should know that would help?

366
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,902
Well, no, that's...
that's all that I, er...

367
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,723
Care to tell?

368
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,969
Well, yes.

369
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,556
Did anyone ever tell you
that you have a dishonest face?

370
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,269
For a priest, I mean.

371
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,004
Here! Break it up
or I'll knock your two heads together.

372
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,622
The winner!

373
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,751
You're pretty shifty, aren't you?
Let's see you operate here.

374
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,297
Eh... whoop!

375
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,671
Can't lay a glove on you.
Look at your shoe.

376
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,517
- You gotta watch all the time.
- Eddie. Eddie, come over here.

377
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,642
You better go inside
and wash your face.

378
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,061
Why didn't you fight back, Eddie?

379
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,298
You're a pretty handy lad.
What's your name?

380
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,322
Tommy Smith, Father.

381
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,884
Tommy Smith.
Well, keep your head up now.

382
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,615
- Yes, Father.
- He's all right.

383
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,860
I think you better speak
to Tommy, Father.

384
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,578
He's a new boy here
and I'm afraid he's a troublemaker.

385
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,368
He's a good fighter, though.

386
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,412
We don't tolerate fighting
in this school.

387
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,384
I think you better speak to him,
because if he continues to pick fights,

388
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,497
we may have to send him
to another school.

389
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,498
But aren't we supposed
to be educators, Sister?

390
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,218
I mean, instead of sending him away,
let's try and correct him.

391
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:25,642
I observed very little correction
in your attitude, Father.

392
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,352
As a matter of fact,
I detected a slight note of pride.

393
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,058
Naturally, I like to see a lad
who can take care of himself.

394
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,025
On the outside, it's a man's world.

395
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,278
How are they doing, Father?

396
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,030
Not doing too good.
But you know what I mean.

397
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,030
Sometimes a man has to fight
his way through.

398
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:53,207
Wouldn't it be better to...
to think your way through?

399
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,672
That's pure conjecture, of course,
from someone on the inside.

400
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,917
That's very well put, though.

401
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,385
But don't you think sometimes
in raising boys,

402
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,506
a woman's influence
can be carried too far?

403
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,598
You mean they may
become sissies, Father?

404
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,219
Yes. Yes, that's right.

405
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:14,190
Well, you look after Tommy,
and I'll look after Eddie,

406
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,652
who lost the fight
because he listened to me.

407
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,821
Eddie?

408
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,491
Yes, Sister?

409
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,459
Come over here and we'll fix you.

410
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,579
Let me look at that.

411
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,330
Tell me, how did all this happen?

412
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,300
I was going along
minding my own business,

413
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,043
when Tommy trips me.

414
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,092
Although I was very... mad,

415
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,763
I controlled myself, Sister,
just like you said.

416
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,386
And I said to him,
"Why'd you do that?"

417
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,887
Then what did he say?

418
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,482
He didn't say anything.
He just hauled off and hit me right here.

419
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,852
Oh, fine thing.

420
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,569
Then what did you do?

421
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,361
I remembered what you said, Sister,
and I turned the other cheek.

422
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,906
Then he really let me have it.

423
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,370
Well, you're a very good boy, Eddie.

424
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,366
I turned away to ignore him,
and then he kicked me!

425
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,081
I'm very proud of you.

426
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,795
I don't feel so hot.

427
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:22,918
No. No, Eddie, but you really won
a victory over Tommy.

428
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:27,423
- Did I, Sister?
- Yes. You were really the better man.

429
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,549
You and I know that.

430
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,768
Nobody else knows it.

431
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,057
To tell you the truth, I don't know it.

432
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,181
I don't think anybody was proud of me.

433
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,729
And even Father O'Malley.

434
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,275
Don't you think he thought Tommy
was the best man?

435
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,239
The better man.

436
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,693
I was thinking, Sister.

437
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,915
Since I've taken such a beating,
and I've been through so much,

438
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,707
maybe I wouldn't have
to go to school today.

439
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,798
Maybe.

440
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:06,761
But if you think I should go, Sister,
I'll go no matter how bad I feel.

441
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,849
Well, maybe I'll declare a holiday
just for you, Eddie.

442
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,772
Thanks, Sister.

443
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,797
- Are you interested in baseball?
- Oh, yes, yes.

444
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,175
Tell me, have you any textbooks
on the manly art of self-defence?

445
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,304
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, she means pugilistics.

446
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,556
- I mean boxing.
- Boxing?

447
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,229
Yes. Yes, of course.

448
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,193
They're right over here.

449
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,698
Now, here's a book
endorsed by James J Corbett.

450
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,240
He won ten straight fights.

451
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,208
Nobody could lay a glove on him
till Fitzsimmons knocked him out.

452
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,454
Did Mr Fitzsimmons
write a book?

453
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,421
Did Mr Fitzsimmons write a book?

454
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,175
No.

455
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,461
Oh, there's a very scholarly book here
by Mr Tunney.

456
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,589
Oh, well, we'll take that.

457
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,590
That'll be one dollar.

458
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,690
Thank you. Thank...

459
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,784
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

460
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,835
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Good afternoon, Sister.

461
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,937
Move this table so we get
a little more room. That's fine.

462
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,936
- Nice of you to come on a Saturday, Eddie.
- It's worth it, Sister.

463
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,189
I read this whole book last night.
It's just what we need.

464
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,317
- Your homework, Sister?
- Yeah.

465
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:39,369
Now, the four most valuable punches,
it says here,

466
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,957
are... now let me show you...

467
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,293
A straight left.

468
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,042
A right cross.

469
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,040
A left hook.

470
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,338
And a right uppercut.

471
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,885
See? Now let me see
how you stand. Well?

472
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,427
- Well...
- Like that?

473
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,892
- Yes.
- How do you fight?

474
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,763
Well, er... like that.

475
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,350
Oh, no, no, no. It's nothing like it.

476
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,150
We'll have to start from the beginning.
Now put this foot back a bit.

477
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,614
Back. That's it.
See how I stand? Like this.

478
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,984
And bend your knees a little bit.
Bend them.

479
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,862
Er... no, your toe should be here.

480
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,412
That's right, that's right.
And your hands up like that.

481
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,706
Yes, that looks pretty good.
Your head should be down. That's right.

482
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,833
Now, that's fine.

483
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,384
Now just like that.

484
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,926
Let me see now,
what do we do next?

485
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,390
Yes. We start to move around.

486
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,259
We move around a little bit,
just like that.

487
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:45,229
And keep, keep, er...
keep shooting your left.

488
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,440
That's right. Right. Uh-huh.

489
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,567
That's good.

490
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,606
Now, Eddie, keep your chin down,
keep your chin down like this

491
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,980
and get your shoulder up.

492
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,858
Well, I... I can't do it so well
in this collar.

493
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,610
You know what I mean?
You protect your chin that way, you see?

494
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,988
And another thing,
you have to be weaving.

495
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,483
Weaving, that's right.
And bobbing.

496
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,997
A moving target is much harder to hit.
Remember that.

497
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,120
For instance, if I try to hit you
on this cheek,

498
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,016
then you move to the other side
or you weave.

499
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,873
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

500
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,251
You should be weaving,
you see what I mean?

501
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,470
See, like that.
And now, the other side.

502
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,930
That's right. Now faster.
That's right.

503
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,298
Gosh, Sister, that's better
than turning the other cheek.

504
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,138
It's much more fun if they miss,
don't you think?

505
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,641
Well, I... I'll admit
it's easier on your face.

506
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,187
You said it, Sister.

507
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,363
Well, now, where were we?
Let me see.

508
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,576
Although they say this is the most
valuable punch of all, the left jab...

509
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,697
it seems this is the payoff.

510
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,994
Now, now we'll try both hands.

511
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,869
Now, one...
Eddie, keep your mouth closed.

512
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,338
Now that's very important.
Keep your mouth closed.

513
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,128
The man devoted
two whole pages to that.

514
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,363
But all he meant was
that if you don't, you'll be sorry.

515
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,595
Now keep your mouth closed, real tight.

516
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,389
Now use both hands.

517
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:07,228
Now, if I try to... if I try to hit you here,
you block it with this hand, you see?

518
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,099
That's right, and you block it there
and then again.

519
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,816
That's right. That's right.

520
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,607
But be careful.
Look out for the payoff!

521
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,024
There are a lot of things
to remember, Eddie,

522
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,823
lefts and rights
and bobbing and weaving.

523
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,947
Let's try them all now.
Move around, move around.

524
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,244
Come on, here we go.
Look me right in the eye.

525
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,493
See if you can anticipate my blows.

526
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,040
Look out now. Look out.

527
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,710
Ooh, that was very, very good.

528
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,298
That's splendid, Eddie.

529
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,842
Yes. You learn fast. That's right.

530
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,306
Now let's go again. Come on.

531
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,266
Move around, move around.

532
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,515
You're so clumsy.

533
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,640
You have to be up on your toes.
Move around quickly, you know?

534
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:55,439
Oh, that's my fault.
I forgot to tell you about footwork.

535
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,563
It says there:
"Footwork is almost a lost art."

536
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,690
It's very important.
We have to learn it.

537
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,862
It's lots of fun.
You're going to like it.

538
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,657
Mmm? Sometimes it gets very fancy.
Yes, it's...

539
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,282
Well, maybe... maybe
that's too much for the first lesson.

540
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,707
Yes, I think so. I think we'll wait.
We have enough to think about.

541
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,252
Come on, let's just try now to, er...
You try to hit me.

542
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,125
That's right.
Come on. Come on.

543
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,502
Uh-huh, that's right.
And then a little... No!

544
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,800
You see?
You just can't hit me, can you?

545
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,673
Come on... Go ahead, Eddie.

546
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,893
- But I don't wanna hit you.
- Oh, don't worry.

547
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,558
Come on now.
I won't be there.

548
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,524
Ah, you see? You see what I mean?
You just can't...

549
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,130
I'm sorry, Sister.

550
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,421
Oh, that's all right.

551
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,385
That's enough
for the first lesson, though.

552
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:08,178
You forgot your footwork.
You forgot something, didn't you?

553
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,141
Something?

554
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,102
I forgot everything.

555
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,018
I forgot to bob, I forgot to weave.

556
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,937
I had my mouth open.

557
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,111
And I ran right into the payoff!

558
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,653
Oh...

559
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,532
- Good evening, Father.
- Good evening.

560
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,660
- Patsy's right in here.
- Good.

561
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,545
- Hello, Father.
- Eddie.

562
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,132
Now, will you stop that now
and get off to bed?

563
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,092
Stay up. You'll get a draw.

564
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,199
I don't know what's the matter with him
lately. He's been acting very peculiar.

565
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,826
I think he's been out in the sun
too much.

566
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,388
Not during school hours, I hope.

567
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,351
- Good evening, Patsy.
- Good evening, Father.

568
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,891
Sit down.

569
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,357
You're up a little late tonight, aren't you?
What's the matter? You in trouble?

570
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:02,399
Father, don't you think I ought
to quit school and maybe take a job?

571
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,362
What can you do?

572
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,363
You have to know something
to do anything, you know.

573
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,784
You shouldn't get discouraged, Patsy,
I've been watching your marks,

574
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,077
and they're all right,
they're getting better.

575
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,496
Oh, Father, you're just being nice.

576
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,211
I don't know,
every time I think I know one thing,

577
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,251
and they ask me something else.

578
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,342
I'm just a perfect blank.
Guess I haven't got what it takes.

579
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,962
Now, don't ever think you're dumb.

580
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:32,387
All right, Father, let's just say
I'm not very bright.

581
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,853
What's the, er... problem tonight?
Why are you up so late?

582
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,972
It's an essay, Father.

583
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,271
"The Five Senses."
That's an interesting subject.

584
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,893
What have you discovered
about them?

585
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,021
Nothing. See what I mean?

586
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,318
What are the five senses, Patsy?

587
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,285
Well, to see, to hear,
to taste, to smell...

588
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,909
- ...to feel.
- That's right.

589
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,203
- Who's the essay for?
- Sister Benedict.

590
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,749
Sister Benedict? Oh, we'll have
to take dead aim on this one,

591
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,963
see if we can get you an A.

592
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,860
But you don't wanna be
like the rest of the class.

593
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:09,549
They'll all going to come up
with those same stereotyped answers.

594
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,843
We wanna be different, be unique.

595
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,308
We'll write Sister an essay
on another sense, huh?

596
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,848
Let's see, man is endowed
with certain powers

597
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,316
which we call the five senses.

598
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,942
Now, if he has common sense,
he'll get great happiness out of life

599
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,905
by using these powers
within right reason.

600
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,616
For instance, you're happy
you came to St Mary's, aren't you?

601
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,485
Yes, Father.

602
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,155
To be...

603
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,867
...to be glad you're alive,

604
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,586
to be grateful
because people are kind to you,

605
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,707
to be able to see some of nature's
great wonders,

606
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,504
the budding of the flowers
in spring

607
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,628
and the changing of leaves
in the autumn,

608
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,052
to be able to appreciate
beautiful music,

609
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,846
to be conscious of the beauty
of tasting and feeling

610
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,312
and hearing only the things
that are good for you.

611
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,726
To be aware of why you're here.

612
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,445
Oh, I could go on and on
and on, but...

613
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,566
Well, why don't you, Father?

614
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,694
Hmm, I think I will.

Now, Patsy, I'll leave you
with those few little thoughts.

632
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,403
What do you make of them?

633
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,905
Well...

634
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,581
if you can't appreciate your five senses,
then your life isn't worth five cents.

635
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,922
That's good, good.
I hope you do well tomorrow.

636
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,382
Thank you, Father.
I feel much better.

637
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,586
I feel pretty good myself.

638
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,678
Now, children!

639
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,234
Seems I can't leave you
for a minute.

640
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,485
"Dear class, it's a holiday."

641
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,451
Now, who did this?

642
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,498
I must ask you again, who did this?

643
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,748
Now, children, I'm putting you
on your honour.

644
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,542
Who did this?

645
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,876
It's your duty to tell me.

646
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,967
Good morning.

647
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,763
We're honoured
with your visit, Father.

648
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,390
Be seated, children.

649
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,687
Won't you take my chair?

650
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,277
We'll take this matter up later.
Now we'll continue.

651
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,992
I want you to read what you've written,
so Father O'Malley may hear it.

652
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,281
Luther.

653
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,496
Luther? How'd he get in here?

654
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,456
We never knew.

655
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,993
"The Five Senses.

656
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,246
"I like to see a good movie
with Roy Rogers."

657
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,586
"I like the taste of ice-cream cones,
especially strawberry.

658
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,681
"I like to listen to the 'Lone Ranger'.
'Hi-yo, Silver!'

659
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,597
"I like the smell of hot dogs
at the ball park.

660
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,220
"I like to feel... good."

661
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,145
Don't laugh, children. Don't laugh.

662
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,610
Luther means he wants
to be a good boy.

663
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,230
You want to feel good in here,
don't you, Luther?

664
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,280
No, Sister. I meant to feel good
is like when the bell rings at 3 o'clock

665
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,994
or when it's Easter vacation,
better still.

666
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,740
That's how I meant to feel good.

667
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,917
Well, it has both honesty
and imagination.

668
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,789
You can sit down.

669
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,633
And now, er... Patricia.

670
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,215
"The Six Senses."

671
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,964
The subject I gave you
was the five senses.

672
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,843
Well, I chose for my subject
six senses.

673
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,888
Well, go on, Patricia, go on.

674
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,815
"The six senses:
to see, to hear, to taste,

675
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,780
"to smell, to feel, to be.

676
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,486
"And the most important is the last.

677
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:27,113
"The sixth sense is to be able
to enjoy the five senses properly.

678
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,541
"To be, that's what really matters.

679
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,957
"It's a like world inside us,
and it's up to us what we make of it.

680
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,789
"We see others, we hear others,

681
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:41,294
"we know others with our five senses,
but how do we ever know ourselves?

682
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,671
"Through common sense.

683
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,923
"Common sense is an internal sense

684
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,720
"whose function it is to differentiate

685
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,435
"between the various reports
of the senses

686
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,350
"or to reduce these reports

687
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,565
"to the unity of a common perception."

688
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,820
Two great words: to be.

689
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,360
Other words grow out of them:

690
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,075
I am, you are, he is,
we are, they are.

691
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,821
That sort of takes in everybody.

692
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,370
As Shakespeare said,
"To thine own self be true

693
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,584
"and it shall follow,
as the night the day,

694
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,795
"thou canst not then be false
to any man."

695
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,131
And he was so right, Sister.

696
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,591
Oh, yes.

697
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,803
He was just talking
about the sixth sense.

698
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,763
To put it in my own words,

699
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,555
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."

700
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,397
Very good, Patricia. Very good.

701
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,356
And one more thing, Sister...

702
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,478
Saved by the bell.

703
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:45,733
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

704
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,700
You may go now, children.

705
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,290
- Well, I really learned something.
- Oh?

706
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,945
She shows a lot of promise,
don't you think, Sister?

707
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,631
Oh, definitely.

708
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,503
What are you gonna give her,
a B, perhaps?

709
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,255
Oh, no. I think an A.

710
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,391
Good. That's fine.

711
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:14,012
As a matter of fact, I think it should be
maybe an A+, don't you, Father?

712
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:18,641
- Oh, that might be overdoing it a little.
- It had a plus quality to it.

713
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,812
Yeah... Well, a girl like Patsy
needs a lot of encouragement.

714
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,234
She... she has such a fine mind.

715
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,732
Yes. Remarkable.

716
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,110
In fact, she has the mentality
of a man your age.

717
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,406
- There's another sense, you know, Sister?
- Oh, don't tell me.

718
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,784
Yeah. Sense enough
to know when to leave.

719
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,506
Good morning, Sister.

720
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,386
Little Bobby wants to play with you.

721
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,350
Fight! Fight! Fight!

722
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,210
Yay!

723
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,229
I'm sorry
I had to do that to you, Tommy,

724
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,317
but if you're a good sport,
we'll shake hands and we'll be friends.

725
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,027
I'll even buy you
an ice-cream cone.

726
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,942
- Two scoops?
- Two scoops!

727
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,566
- Eddie, how'd you learn to fight?
- That's a secret.

728
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,279
Sister.

729
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,498
You, er...
you missed some excitement here.

730
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,288
- I did?
- Yes, you did. The, er...

731
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,704
Yes, you did.

732
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,874
- It was quite a fight.
- Oh.

733
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,253
That, er... that little Eddie there...
That is Eddie, isn't it?

734
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,799
Oh, yes. Yes, that's Eddie.

735
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,951
That's the little boy that was in that fight
a few weeks back?

736
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,386
Mm-hmm. Yes.

737
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,471
Quite a change.

738
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,890
It's incredible.

739
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,851
He's an improved man.

740
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,900
I wonder.

741
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,775
Does it mean anything, Father?

742
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,403
Does it prove anything
to beat up your fellow man?

743
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,326
Somehow, don't you think
it's what we are in here that matters?

744
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,211
I mean...

745
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,422
I mean, to be.

746
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,464
You're so right.

747
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:20,216
But how do you account for such
a sudden change in such a short time?

748
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,186
Oh, we... we try to do our best
to raise masculine little men

749
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,056
with our limited knowledge
of the outside world.

00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,264
I'm sorry, Father,
but you're disturbing us.

764
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,141
- Disturbing who?
- We're rehearsing a play

765
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,380
and the children can't keep their minds
on what they're doing.

766
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,067
It's the first grade, you know,
and they are easily distracted.

767
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,281
You mean we're making
too much noise?

768
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,618
To use your own words,
yes, Father.

769
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,829
Oh, well, Sister,
we heard about your play

770
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,716
and we've prepared
a little surprise for you.

771
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,746
You can't have a Christmas play
without "Holy Night" or "Adeste Fideles".

772
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,119
Oh, yes, yes.

773
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,108
You mean there's no room
in your play for "Holy..."

774
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,132
Not in our play, Father.

775
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,672
What? I'd certainly like to see
a play like that.

776
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,163
Would you like to see a rehearsal?

777
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,880
Yes, I certainly would.
You kids stay here and practise awhile.

778
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,475
I'm gonna check into this.
What are you gonna use for music?

779
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,936
Come with me
and you'll find out.

780
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,774
Bobby! Bobby!

781
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,502
Well, here's he is. Here's the little man
I was telling you about.

782
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,904
I know Bobby.
He's an old pal of mine.

783
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:43,025
- You in the play, Bob?
- Yes. In fact, I made it up.

784
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,243
Ooh-ooh!
I bet you've got a good part.

785
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,613
Yes. It's beautiful.

786
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,410
Can we see the play now, Bobby?

787
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:54,878
Well, it's a little bit not good.
You see, we're just practising it.

788
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,088
Er... it'll be better at Christmas.

789
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:00,380
- Yes, but we won't mind a few mistakes.
- No. What's the play about?

790
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,503
That's what I tell you
at the beginning.

791
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,130
Why don't we begin? You ready?

792
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:16,107
I must tell you, the children
have done this all by themselves.

793
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:19,069
Every time they do it,
the dialogue is different.

794
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,280
Every line is a surprise to me.

795
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,400
Heaven knows what it's going to be
at Christmas!

796
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,615
When they do it in front of their parents,
they'll probably forget everything.

797
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:44,382
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph,
and we're going to Bethlehem

798
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:50,009
to see if we can have someplace...
find someplace to stay.

799
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:53,228
And that's all
you have to know, really.

800
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,025
- Knock, knock.
- Hello?

801
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,894
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph.

802
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:05,740
And we came to Bethlehem to see
if we could find a place to stay.

803
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:08,326
- Well, do you have any money?
- No, sir.

804
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,117
Well, then you can't
stay here tonight.

805
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,661
Well, that's too bad for us.

806
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,706
Mary, we can't stay there
because we don't have any money.

807
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,669
I'll be all right, Joseph,
as long as I'm with you.

808
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:30,048
Well, you see,
I think we ought to find a house

809
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,346
because it might rain soon.

810
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,640
It's winter, you know.

811
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,765
Well, why don't you try next door?

812
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,482
Good idea.

813
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,194
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

814
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,655
You can't stay here
because you don't have any money.

815
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:49,322
I didn't even ask you yet.
Go back inside again.

816
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,864
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

817
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,787
- Hello there.
- Hello.

818
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,252
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph
and could we...

819
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:04,625
could we stay here
for the night, please?

820
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,251
Do you have any money?

821
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,094
No, but Mary's awfully tired.
Could you think it over?

822
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,714
OK.

823
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,678
What did he say, Joseph?

824
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,514
He said he'd think it over.

825
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,768
- Well, when will he know?
- I don't know.

826
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:29,070
Hey, Joseph, I thought it over.
You can stay in the stable.

827
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,160
Golly gee, did you hear that?

828
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,949
Yes, Joseph.

829
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:47,088
Er... the next scene will be
the Lord Jesus' birthday.

830
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,552
Come on.

831
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,428
You're supposed to lift it.

832
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,945
No, no, Jimmy.
Jimmy, go back.

833
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,694
Go on back. You're in the play.
Don't come here, go...

834
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,497
His baby brother.

835
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,306
Well, here we all are
in the stables,

836
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:39,348
and we're very happy here
in Bethlehem,

837
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,938
and... there's our star.

838
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,730
Here's our angel
there are the shepherds,

839
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:52,153
and here are the wise men,
there, there, and there.

840
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:56,028
And, oh, here...
and the neighbours are coming in,

841
00:56:56,163 --> 00:57:00,248
bringing their presents
because it's his birthday.

842
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:11,297
Thank you.
You make Mary and I very happy.

843
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,597
What do you do now, Bobby?
You sing "Holy Night", perhaps?

844
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,559
No, Father.
We have another song.

845
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,140
Oh? How's it go?

846
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,937
♪ Happy birthday to you

847
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:31,734
♪ Happy birthday to you

848
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:36,951
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jesus

849
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:42,620
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

850
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,675
Well, Father?

851
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,465
Oh, their simplicity is beautiful.
I wouldn't change a word of it.

852
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,588
Oh, but they will.

853
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,965
You won't be needing my talents
at Christmas.

854
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:00,683
No. No, Father.

855
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,895
Maybe at Easter time
I could stage an egg hunt, hmm?

856
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,513
Mm-hmm.

857
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,397
Look, Sister.
There's Father O'Malley.

858
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,867
I hope he finds him
in a favourable mood.

859
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,087
He could be.
It's spring, you know.

860
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,425
We're not getting anywhere, Father.
We got...

861
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:37,341
Well, it's a difficult decision to make,
Mr Bogardus,

862
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,055
to decide that there'll be
no more St Mary's.

863
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,176
Hmm... if you ask me,
it's not much now.

864
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,139
It is to the sisters.

865
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,514
You see, to you, that school
is just a piece of property,

866
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,151
but to them, it's...
well, it's everything.

867
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,612
It's not just the idea
of selling you the property,

868
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,572
it's the thought of selling them out.

869
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,192
You're getting a little sentimental,
aren't you, Father?

870
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,320
Well, it's just that I've been here
long enough to find out how they feel.

871
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,618
What are you going to do
when it's condemned?

872
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,039
- They're expecting a miracle.
- A miracle?

873
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,583
What kind of a miracle
is gonna get them out of trouble?

874
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,706
You'd be surprised.

875
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,009
Oh! Oh, gee!

876
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,090
No. No, Delphine,
you're not doing it right.

877
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,716
Show me, Sister.

878
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,681
Well, you-you... you don't hold it right.

879
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,227
This is the way you should hold it.
And straight.

880
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,441
And then you chop it.

881
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,060
Don't chop like that.

882
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,735
Keep your hands together
and step into it. You see?

883
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,449
Hit one, Sister.
Come on, throw.

884
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,864
No, I don't think so.
You better do it.

885
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,164
- Ooh!
- Yay! Yay!

886
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,665
Doggone those kids!
There they go again!

887
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,202
Here's your chance, Bogardus.
They're coming over to apologise.

888
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,434
Why don't you ask them
if they're willing to sell?

889
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,915
You mean if it's all right with them,
it's all right with you?

890
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,432
Definitely, I'll recommend it.
Of course, you'll have to see the bishop.

891
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,435
- The bishop?
- Oh, yes. He has the final word.

892
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,482
What kind of a man is he
to do business with?

893
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,974
You'll be glad to come back to me
and you'll have to anyway,

894
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,613
because I have to give you a letter
so you can see the bishop,

895
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,347
and I can't give you a letter
to see the bishop

896
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,034
until you've straightened yourself out
with the sisters.

897
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,157
Here they come now.
Good luck.

898
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,374
Oh, I'll never get this deal closed.

899
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:38,458
- Is he very angry?
- I think you'll find him quite forgiving.

900
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,550
You mean, for giving?

901
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,532
You mean, it'll be a good time
to ask him, Father?

902
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,138
Never be any better.

903
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,389
Oh, we are so sorry, Mr Bogardus.

904
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,683
It's nothing, Sister.
It's perfectly all right.

905
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,399
- We'll pay for it.
- Don't think of it, Sister. It's nothing.

906
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:58,941
It's a little hard to get glass today,
but I'll get it.

907
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,314
It is a magnificent building
you have here.

908
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,530
Thank you, Sister.

909
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,243
I know exactly how you feel when I look
at that tumbled-down school of yours.

910
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:11,408
I have one problem, however,
before my dream is complete.

911
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,619
It's a parking problem.

912
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:19,499
You see, The Bogardus corporation
will have several hundred employees,

913
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,466
and they all have cars.

914
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,338
Parking's becoming
more of a problem every day.

915
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,430
You see,
here's where my desk is going to be.

916
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,724
Here are the blueprints.

917
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:40,645
It would take us years to raise the money
to build a building like this.

918
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:45,275
Oh, you could never do it.
You'd be surprised what it's cost me.

919
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,613
Would you like to see
the rest of my building?

920
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,991
Oh, yes. By all means.

921
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,958
You just follow me.

922
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,754
Shall we ask him now?

923
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,967
Ever see anything like this?

924
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,760
Oh, it's tremendous, Mr Bogardus.

925
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,976
15,000 square feet
without a column.

926
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,554
The balcony seats 400.

927
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,443
We can hold dances here,
conventions, everything.

928
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,486
It certainly is ideal.

929
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,109
It's perfect.

930
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,157
The Lord must've been the architect.

931
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,950
I wish he had been.

932
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,916
I had Butler and Deane,
a couple of thieves.

933
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,832
Robbed me right and left.
It cost me 30% over the estimate.

934
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:41,547
But you must be very happy
with your accomplishment.

935
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:46,386
There's just one thing could make me
happier and you know that.

936
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,005
I believe we're thinking
about the same thing.

937
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,140
Yeah?

938
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:54,432
It isn't what we acquire in life, is it?
It's what we give.

939
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:58,226
And this...
this is a monument to you.

940
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:04,480
I can see the cornerstone reading,
"Donated to St Mary's

941
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:09,029
"through the generosity and benevolence
of Horace P Bogardus."

942
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,198
Oh, you're a very fortunate man,
Mr Bogardus.

943
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,821
I am?

944
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,660
You know it's more blessed
to give than to receive.

945
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,754
This will live long after you're dust.

946
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,167
Now that is real happiness.

947
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,673
Can't you just picture that?

948
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,013
Would you mind saying that again?

949
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:42,108
Picture what? When I'm dust?

950
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,488
But you don't have
to make up your mind right away.

951
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,825
- Why don't you sleep on it?
- I can't sleep now.

952
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,445
I know you're surprised,
but you shouldn't be.

953
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,416
Sometimes we don't know
why we do things.

954
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,081
You didn't know
why you built this building.

955
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,625
I didn't? I thought I did.

956
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:07,250
No, you built it
in answer to our prayers.

957
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,877
We've been praying and praying for this.

958
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,424
And we're going on praying.

959
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,242
Do you mean to say
that you've got the idea that...?

960
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:18,512
We'll... we'll leave you now
with this thought...

961
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,768
"Donated to St Mary's

962
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,736
"through the generosity and benevolence
of Horace P Bogardus."

963
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,369
Generosity...

964
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,247
...benevolence...

965
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,367
...and dust.

966
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,473
I'm sure that nice little man
is going to give us his building.

967
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,142
We must pray
and keep on praying until...

968
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:06,233
- God's will be done?
- And may God's will be our will.

969
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,353
But what if our prayers
aren't answered?

970
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,730
Oh, thou of little faith.

971
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,449
We have reason to know
more things are wrought by prayer

972
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,694
than this world dreams of.

973
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,914
Therefore, let thy voice rise
like a fountain, night and day.

974
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:25,749
What's all the excitement?
Notre Dame win another one?

975
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,294
No, no. But I asked him.

976
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,258
- And?
- He didn't say no.

977
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,426
Oh, so you finally got here, eh?

978
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:39,801
Been waiting for you fellas
since 6 o'clock.

979
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,137
Will you stop flying off the handle?

980
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,607
You're working too hard, Horace.
You ought to be home in bed.

981
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,566
With this building on my hands?

982
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,108
Should've been ready
for occupancy three months ago.

983
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,901
You don't know
how much money I'm losing.

984
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,524
If you're talking about money,
why don't you see your banker?

985
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,744
I'm your doctor.
You can't go on like this, Horace.

986
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:03,040
You don't know what I'm going through.
Took me three weeks to get that glass.

987
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:06,002
There you are, brother.
Sign this, will you?

988
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,166
What's this?
What's... what's all this?

989
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,379
What's all what? Sign it.

990
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,339
I wanna know what I'm signing,
I can't sign...

991
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,302
That's overtime!
We get time and half after 6 o'clock.

992
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,762
You should've been here
before six. I was here.

993
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,382
Didn't even leave
to go to my doctor's office.

994
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,600
One more crack outta you,
we'll take that glass back

995
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,391
and it'll take you six weeks
to get it put in again.

996
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,933
Sign it.

997
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,523
See what I'm up against?

998
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,720
- Now, calm down, Horace.
- That's the way they do things.

999
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,584
- You mustn't let anything upset you.
- Yeah, I know. I know about that.

1000
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,698
- You're too big a man for that.
- I'm not so big.

1001
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,325
- Go home and get a good night's rest.
- Home...

1002
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,703
Nothing can take the place
of a good night's sleep.

1003
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,333
- Mm-hmm.
- Rest. Tranquillity. Relax.

1004
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,051
A man in your position
hasn't got a worry in the world.

1005
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,173
- Just keep saying to yourself...
- I can say it, but I won't feel it.

1006
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,443
Now what's the matter?

1007
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,322
You don't know
what they're doing to me.

1008
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,823
I'll stop that.

1009
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,170
What's the matter with you, Horace?

1010
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,140
First, you're out of patience.
Now you're out of glass.

1011
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,726
And now you want me to sleep.

1012
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,478
What's new, Horace?
I heard the crash.

1013
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,441
I wondered if anybody got hurt.

1014
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,610
Oh, er... Father O'Malley,
Dr McKay, my physician.

1015
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,677
- How do you do, Doctor?
- Glad to know you, Father.

1016
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,701
Thank you.

1017
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,241
Say, that's really too bad.
Isn't glass a little hard to get these days?

1018
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:08,616
Oh, hard to get? I'll say it is.

1019
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,913
Can't you get them to stop that,
Father?

1020
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,583
Stop it, Horace?
Why, I think it's beautiful.

1021
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,128
- His nerves are all shot.
- It's hardly noticeable.

1022
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,670
What is that, Father?
Isn't that "O Sanctissima"?

1023
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,046
That's right, Doctor.

1024
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,298
Beautiful. I've heard it many times.

1025

Oh, Father,
I was... I was wondering

1041
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,837
what's so important you couldn't
tell me over the telephone.

Well, I don't know

What's wrong, what's she done?

No, it's not bad news, necessarily.
In fact, this could be good news.

Oh... I'm so glad.

1047
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,943
She's been getting along so well, if...

1048
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,925
Well, if anything should happen
to upset her now...

01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,531
Now, take it easy.
Nothing has happened.

1050
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,070
What's it got to do with Patsy?

1051
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,882
You said it had something
to do with Patsy.

1052
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,325
Well, it has. I found her father.

1053
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,703
- Joe?
- Well, I think so.

1054
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,546
I told him the story
as you told it to me.

1055
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,006
I described you to him and...

1056
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:24,218
- How on earth did you run him down?
- Well, he's a piano player.

1057
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,507
Once a piano player,
always a piano player.

1058
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:30,599
I got him through the Musician's Union.
I went right to the top, Petrillo.

1059
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,600
- I really don't know what to say.
- Neither do I.

1060
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,143
Well, er...

1061
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,560
Is, er... is he in town?

1062
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,687
In town?
He's here, he's out in the hall.

1063
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,314
- Oh, no!
- Yeah. Shall I bring him in?

1064
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:48,784
Oh, no! Not... That is...

1065
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,869
Wait just a minute, will you?

1066
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,832
I, er... you know.

1067
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,631
She'll be a few minutes.

1068
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,255
She's fixing her hair, powdering her nose,
and one thing or another.

1069
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,221
You know how it is.

1070
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,940
Father, this is, er...
kind of a big moment for me.

1071
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:24,732
Mind you, it's... it's 13 years.
I was a little bit younger then.

1072
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,277
He hasn't exactly been on ice,
you know.

1073
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,159
Well...

1074
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,280
Well... shall we?

1075
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,726
Hello.

1076
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,771
Hello.

1077
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:03,566
Goodbye.

1078
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,778
- Don't go yet, Father.
- No, Father. Please stay a little while.

1079
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,319
- All right.
- Joe, sit down.

1080
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,944
You, too, Father.
Sit down a little while.

1081
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,491
Thank you.

1082
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,913
You haven't changed a bit.

1083
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,172
Neither have you, Joe.

1084
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,131
- Do me a favour, will you?
- What's that?

1085
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,599
- Play the piano.
- Oh...

1086
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,558
Please, please.
I want Father to hear you.

1087
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,021
I've been telling him all about you.
Don't let me down.

1088
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,310
Listen to this, Father.
He's really good.

1089
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:49,067
What was that song
we used to love so much?

1090
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,158
You mean, er... "By the Sea"?

1091
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,118
No, Joe.

1092
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:59,160
No, it... it had a bit
of the Rosary in it.

1093
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,133
But... but that wasn't the melody.

1094
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:15,389
Joe, don't you remember?

1095
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,135
We said that...
that no matter what happened,

1096
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,513
that song would always
see us through.

1097
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:26,392
And then we pressed
the rosebud in the book.

1098
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,194
What happened?

1099
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,655
Yeah.

1100
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,866
- Where's the book?
- Mmm...

1101
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:39,409
What's the matter? Do you know it?

1102
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:44,126
Why, sure. That's an old song called
"In the Land of Beginning Again".

1103
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,251
- Why didn't you say so?
- You never asked me.

1104
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,374
Well, come on over here
and get in, then.

1105
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,125
You'll be sorry.

1106
01:13:54,513 --> 01:14:01,513
♪ There's a land of beginning again

1107
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:09,110
♪ Where skies are always blue

1108
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:16,696
♪ Though we've made mistakes,
that's true

1109
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:25,162
♪ Let's forget the past
and start life anew

1110
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:34,588
♪ Though we've wandered
by a river of tears

1111
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:43,477
♪ Where sunshine
won't come through

1112
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:52,815
♪ Let's find that paradise
where sorrow can't live

1113
01:14:54,281 --> 01:15:01,281
♪ And learn the teachings
of forget and forgive

1114
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:10,165
♪ In the land of beginning again

1115
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:19,967
♪ Where broken dreams
come true ♪

1116
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,894
The girls are all excited,
aren't they, Sister?

1117
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,111
Yes.

1118
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,572
It reminds me of when I graduated.

1119
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,942
Yes, it's a big moment in their lives.

1120
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,491
Incidentally, it's the first time
they're wearing high heels.

1121
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,041
I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

1122
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,880
Look, Sister.

1123
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,349
Yes, that's really nice, Patsy.

1124
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,891
It's very... push the sleeve up
a little bit like that.

1125
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,604
I think it's a little long.

1126
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:13,476
- It's supposed to be, Sister.
- Yes, but not... only on one side.

1127
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,603
Yes. You don't want to stumble.

1128
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:19,231
Look, girls. Sister Benedict
is giving Patsy all the attention.

1129
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,857
Oh, no, Delphine.
That isn't right.

1130
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,326
- Patsy's teacher's pet.
- Meow!

1131
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,447
She is, too.
You gave her the prettiest dress.

1132
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,494
It would look much better on me,
I'm sure.

1133
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:33,087
Girls, I think that's about enough.
You better take your dresses off.

1134
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,876
Sister, I just got a funny idea.

1135
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,626
Suppose, after all this, I flunk?
Wouldn't that be terrible?

1136
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:42,380
- Sister, you wouldn't do that to us.
- Oh, no.

1137
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,098
Sister, it would a great idea
to cut out the finals entirely.

1138
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:48,390
Well... No, you can't
get around me that way.

1139
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,513
Run along, now.
Take your dresses off.

1140
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,139
Be careful.

1141
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,311
- Sister?
- Yes, dear?

1142
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,446
I was just thinking...

1143
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,884
Could I take this dress over
to show it to my mother, perhaps?

1144
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,068
Yes, certainly. I think
that would make her very happy.

1145
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,152
Thank you, Sister.
I know it will.

1146
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,245
OK, darling.
I'll get the tickets to Syracuse.

1147
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,211
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, honey.

1148
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,170
Hold it!

1149
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,014
Would you like a stick of gum?

1150
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,302
I answered this one two ways,
Sister. Yes and no.

1151
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,843
- All right, Luther. Run along.
- Thanks.

1152
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:56,180
I'm sorry, Patsy. Time is up.

1153
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,944
May I come in?

1154
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,493
Oh, don't get up.
I'm just the pastor here.

1155
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,120
- Grading the papers, I see.
- Yes, Father.

1156
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,998
- They're a wonderful bunch of children.
- Yes.

1157
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,341
- You should be very proud of them.
- We are.

1158
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,802
I ran into some of the girls
out there.

1159
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,593
They're dying with curiosity
about their marks.

1160
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,683
I'm supposed to come in
and without your knowing, of course,

1161
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,895
find out how they turned out.

1162
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,107
I presume you opened your heart
and passed them all, didn't you?

1163
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:42,897
All but one, Father.

1164
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:47,067
Patsy?

1165
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,403
Oh, no.

1166
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,530
Well, this is only one subject.

1167
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:55,497
The others are even worse.
Her average is below 60.

1168
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,536
Well, she got the date right
and she spelled her name right.

1169
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,551
Couldn't you give her something on that?
Add it up again, maybe pass her?

1170
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,417
Don't you think the honour of the school
means anything?

1171
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,758
But what about Patsy?

1172
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,007
St Mary's isn't being
very much help to her.

1173
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,977
Don't you think
we should help a child like that?

1174
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,187
She's beginning to believe in herself.

1175
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:22,399
A blow like this,
the child may never get over it.

1176
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,569
Do you believe
in just passing everybody, Father?

1177
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,652
Maybe.

1178
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,034
Maybe I do.

1179
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,287
I can't believe you mean it.

1180
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,249
It's easier for some children
to make the grade than others.

1181
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,368
They don't have to study.

1182
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,496
But I've known some
that got the best marks in school

1183
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:47,624
and never made
much of a mark afterwards.

1184
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,256
I knew a character once...
a fellow named Elmer Hathaway.

1185
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,632
He and I went through school together.

1186
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:59,603
Or rather, I went through school.
Elmer just stood still.

1187
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,222
I think he was three years
in the eighth grade.

1188
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,350
He was quite a boy.

1189
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:07,728
The teacher often wondered how
he found his way to the school house.

1190
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,604
Sometimes he didn't.

1191
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,982
Kids used to make fun of him.

1192
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,949
He was sort of a dreamer.

1193
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:19,998
Sometimes he'd even forget what day it was
and he'd come to school on Saturday.

1194
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,711
Asked him who Plato was one day,
and he said, "Plato who?"

1195
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:29,674
But he was good with his hands.
He built a boat, a sailboat.

1196
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,136
One time he disappeared
for two, three days.

1197
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,505
When he came back,
they asked him where he'd been

1198
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,349
and he said, "Oh, just sailing."

1199
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:43,931
Well, he got to be about a foot taller
than anybody else in the class.

1200
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:47,730
They felt sorry for him,
so they decided to pass him.

1201
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,403
Besides, I think they needed the desk
at the time.

1202
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:57,945
He never knew about it, and from
that time on, he developed assurance.

1203
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,577
You've heard of Hathaway Shipyards,
haven't you?

1204
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,950
- Yes.
- That's Elmer.

1205
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:07,955
And to this day, he takes care
of his less fortunate pals,

1206
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,504
you know, the ones
that used to get 99 and 100.

1207
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,969
If any of them are broke or out of a job,

1208
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:17,931
they can always work for Hathaway.

1209
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,890
He's a good man.

1210
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,928
By the way,
just what is passing anyhow?

1211
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,646
Well, 75, you know that.

1212
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,187
Yes, I know that, but who started it?

1213
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,560
Our school is based on it.
Every school is.

1214
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,109
- If we don't have standards...
- Yes?

1215
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,655
- But... but certainly you're not serious?
- I am.

1216
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,639
Aren't we here to give the children
a helping hand

1217
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:42,827
or are we here to measure their brains
with a yardstick?

1218
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,792
Why do they have to have 75 to pass?

1219
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,502
- You'd put the standard at 65, Father?
- Why not?

1220
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,373
Then why not at 55?
Why any grades at all?

1221
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,445
Why don't we close the school
and let them run wild?

1222
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,052
Maybe.
Be better than breaking their hearts.

1223
01:22:57,014 --> 01:23:01,725
That's unfair, Father,
my heart aches for Patsy,

1224
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:06,472
and when you infer it doesn't hurt me,
you're being very unjust.

1225
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,940
Please realise I've done
everything possible to help her,

1226
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,808
but I must uphold our standards.

1227
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,530
If you order me to pass her...

1228
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,575
...I shall do so.

1229
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,789
But her mark remains the same.

1230
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,839
- Come in, Patsy.
- Thank you, Sister.

1231
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,966
- Hello, Father.
- Patsy.

1232
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,435
I, er... I failed, didn't I, Sister?

1233
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,646
Yes, you did, Patsy.

1234
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,766
- That's what I thought.
- I'm sorry.

1235
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:54,736
Well, that's all right, Sister.
It wasn't your fault.

1236
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,276
I was... I was just thinking that...

1237
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:01,071
Well, I... I won't be needing
this now, and...

1238
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,786
and... well, Delphine liked it so much.

1239
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,156
I was just thinking that, er...

1240
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:12,086
I was just thinking that maybe
I'll do better next year, Sister.

1241
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,072
Sister, you and I have had
our little differences of opinion,

1242
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:23,136
but they haven't been important.
This is... this is serious.

1243
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,974
I'm not gonna order you
to do anything.

1244
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,344
It's up to you, but...

1245
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,312
But she failed.

1246
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,283
Hooray, Luther made one!
Give him a hand, fellas.

1247
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,201
Who's next? On you go.

1248
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,324
Good try! Good try!

1249
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,209
Hold on. I'll be right back.

1250
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,255
I'll go with Sister.

1251
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,759
What's happened?

1252
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,123
Sister Benedict's quite ill.
She had a fainting spell in the chapel.

1253
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:12,560
- Did you call a doctor?
- She doesn't want one.

1254
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,808
Oh, she doesn't, huh?

1255
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,401
Come in.

1256
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,508
The doctor's on his way over.
How are you feeling, Sister?

1257
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,024
Who sent for a doctor?

1258
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,401
She did.

1259
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,869
You can't trust the man.
He's an informer.

1260
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,580
- How are you feeling, Sister?
- I feel all right.

1261
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,870
Won't you sit down, Father?
I want to talk to you.

1262
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,834
Please excuse us.

1263
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,337
What have I done now?

1264
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,378
You've been writing.

1265
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,250
You've been writing to Mother General.

1266
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,129
- Oh?
- Going over my head.

1267
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:47,594
Yes, I received that letter from her.

1268
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:52,221
Well, I just wrote
expressing my own opinion, Sister.

1269
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:55,520
- But I hope that hasn't brought this on.
- No.

1270
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,064
No, I-I... I'm just tired.

1271
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:03,815
But you actually considered
tearing down St Mary's

1272
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,784
and sending our children
to St Victor's?

1273
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,996
That's right.
I thought about it quite a bit.

1274
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,615
We have to face facts, Sister.

1275
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,715
Yes.

1276
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,129
Yes, I know what you mean, Father.

1277
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:31,893
We've tried so hard...
not to face facts.

1278
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,184
But there... there must always be
a St Mary's.

1279
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:43,313
Of course, of course, Sister.
Now, just relax. Take it easy.

1280
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,237
- Pardon me, but the doctor's...
- Come in. Come in, Doctor.

1281
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,455
- Hello, Father.
- This is Dr McKay, Sister.

1282
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:54,502
- How do you do, Doctor?
- How do you do, Sister?

1283
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:58,085
He's Mr Bogardus' doctor, you know.

1284
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:01,122
Oh, yes?

1285
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:07,129
- Are you his personal physician?
- Yes. I have other patients.

1286
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,224
Possibly a hundred or so,
and Horace P Bogardus.

1287
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,434
Lately, he's been a full-time job.

1288
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,645
Rings me up all hours of the night.

1289
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,684
We pray for him all the time.

1290
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,650
That's very nice.
He certainly could use it.

1291
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,019
- But may I ask why?
- They need a new school, Doctor.

1292
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:25,818
And they're praying for Mr Bogardus
to give them his building.

1293
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,407
Give? Bogardus?

1294
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:33,283
- Pardon me.
- It's all right. I have a sense of humour.

1295
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,435
Yes, well, maybe your prayers
are having some effect.

1296
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:39,169
He can't sleep nights. That's why
I'm giving him sleeping tablets.

1297
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,913
Prayer's a wonderful thing, Father,

1298
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:45,166
but if Bogardus ever gives you
that building, I'll...

1299
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:48,136
Bup-bup-bup.
Nothing spectacular, Doctor.

1300
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:51,847
OK.

1301
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:59,014
Hm-mmm.
Well, I can't do much here.

1302
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:02,438
If you're well enough to come down
tomorrow, I'll give you a check-up.

1303
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:05,027
There's nothing's wrong with me.
I'm just tired.

1304
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:08,489
I know, I know,
but you let me be the judge of that.

1305
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:11,610
I want to know the cause
of your being tired.

1306
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,408
- But I...
- She'll be there, Doctor.

1307
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,623
You keep right on praying, Sister,
but not tonight.

1308
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,164
- You need a good night's rest.
- So does Bogardus.

1309
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,786
Yes, that's right.

1310
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:26,423
You heard what the man said.
You take it easy.

1311
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,090
Now you won't forget, Father?

1312
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:31,991
You'll see she gets down
to the office tomorrow?

1313
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:35,349
She has a mind of her own, you know,
but I'll get her down there.

1314
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:39,266
- Is this anything serious?
- Well, she's running a little temperature.

1315
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:43,186
- You say she's had these attacks before?
- That's what I heard today, yes.

1316
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,810
I hope it's nothing serious.
She's such a remarkable woman.

1317
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:50,111
She certainly is. I could tell that
the minute I walked into the room.

1318
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,076
Does she really believe that
Bogardus is gonna give that building?

1319
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,035
Yes.

1320
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:58,497
Well, I've heard of such things
but I've never come across it before,

1321
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:03,745
not since I was a little boy and wished
for what I wanted for Christmas and got it.

1322
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,212
It's sort of the same thing.

1323
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,174
But when we grow up,
we... we get practical.

1324
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:12,295
- She's not very practical, is she?
- She thinks she is.

1325
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,033
What is she gonna do
when she doesn't get...

1326
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,049
You see? Now she's got you worried.

1327
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,427
Yes, she has.
I hate to see her disillusioned.

1328
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:21,896
Say, Doctor, not to change
the subject much,

1329
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,187
but Bogardus has a bad heart,
doesn't he?

1330
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,479
Yes.

1331
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,694
What are you giving him for it, pills?

1332
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,314
Why?
Have you got a better prescription?

1333
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,863
Well, I... I knew a fellow once.

1334
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,578
He had a very bad heart.

1335
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:40,198
In fact, they only gave him
six months to live.

1336
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,666
But he spent that six months
doing so much good,

1337
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,036
do you know that he lived to be 90?

1338
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,912
That so?

1339
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:50,462
You mean doing good for others
is good for a bad heart?

1340
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:53,086
You spend your life doing for others,
don't you, Doctor?

1341
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,213
Well, yes. Yes.

1342
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,340
- How's your heart?
- Fine.

1343
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,475
There you are.

1344
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:00,204
Are you tampering
with the laws of medicine?

1345
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,220
Well, we have a good deal
in common, Doctor.

1346
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,347
We're both interested
in the good heart.

1347
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,646
And your suggestion is, per chance,
that I change my prescription?

1348
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:09,268
You're the doctor.

1349
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,646
I'm not so sure, O'Malley.

1350
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,613
- Good day.
- Good day.

1351
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,416
Mr Bogardus.

1352
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,095
Father O'Malley.

1353
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,636
Oh, yes, Father O'Malley.
Excuse me. I didn't see you.

1354
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,871
I thought it was you, but you seemed
to be looking right past me.

1355
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:44,262
Oh, my mind was
a million miles away.

1356
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,105
Yes, you don't seem
to be yourself today.

1357
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:50,101
I'm not, Father.
I've just come from my doctor.

1358
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:57,905
You know, Father,
if I had to live my life over again,

1359
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,698
there'd be a lot of changes made.

1360
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,446
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a lot of changes.

1361
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,876
You know, there's great beauty
in this world

1362
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:10,121
if you just have the eyes to see it.

1363
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:12,248
- Isn't there, Father?
- Oh, naturally.

1364
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:14,667
Oh.

1365
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:22,678
Thank you.

1366
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:34,107
- Ah, yes, life can be very beautiful.
- That's right.

1367
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,858
And you know, Father, you've spent
your whole life doing things for people.

1368
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:40,280
- No, I...
- Oh, yes, you have.

1369
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,996
Come to think of it, Father,
how's your heart?

1370
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,911
Great, great.

1371
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,125
That's what I mean.

1372
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,587
Would it be all right, Father,
if I go into the church?

1373
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:53,672
You're perfectly welcome. There it is.

1374
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,541
And here's a thought that might help you.

1375
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,669
It's meant a lot to me.

1376
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,296
"I shall pass this way but once.

1377
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,845
"If there's any good
I can do for anyone,

1378
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,559
"let me do it now and not put it off,

1379
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,304
"for I shall not pass this way again."

1380
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:11,766
Oh, thank you, Father.
God bless you.

1381
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:14,063
- Thank you, Father.
- Goodbye.

1382
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,833
Wait a minute.

1383
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,123
Wait!

1384
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,548
That's a puppy.

1385
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,090
Oh, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

1386
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,091
Allow me, lady.

1387
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,932
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1388
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,139
It's a beautiful world, isn't it?

1389
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,857
Yeah, you pretty near left it there.

1390
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,853
I nearly did. I'll get off to church.

1391
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:48,054
Oh, Mr Bogardus.

1392
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:49,924
I'm sorry about this, Sister.

1393
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:52,221
I didn't realise he'd followed me
into the church.

1394
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,845
Sweet little fellow, isn't he?

1395
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:58,315
That's quite all right.
Bring him anytime.

1396
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:01,026
Well, I mean, it doesn't matter.

1397
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:02,986
I see that animals love you.

1398
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,946
Oh, yes, but people don't.

1399
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,406
You must be wrong.

1400
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,447
I'm sure that when people
get to know you, they love you.

1401
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,322
No, no, no.
That's when they don't.

1402
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:15,040
- You see, Sister...
- Yes, Mr Bogardus?

1403
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:18,661
I've never had any children
of my own.

1404
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:23,166
And I've never even liked children.
And they don't like me.

1405
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,840
Why don't people like you?

1406
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,765
Well, I've been very selfish.

1407
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,975
And lately, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1408
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,893
Come to any conclusion?

1409
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,728
Yes.

1410
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:44,027
This is going to surprise you.

1411
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:47,781
And I do want people to like me,

1412
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,198
so... I was wondering...

1413
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:56,119
...if you would accept my building.

1414
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,662
Oh!

1415
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,794
What's the matter?

1416
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,543
- It's a bit of a shock to you?
- Yes, yes.

1417
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,262
Well, you can have it.
You can have it!

1418
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:13,554
I'll go straight to my lawyer and have him
make out the deeds right away.

1419
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:15,347
Oh, thank you, Mr Bogardus!

1420
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:18,312
St Mary's will never forget it,
and the children will love you.

1421
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,932
They will? I'll have the necessary papers
made out right away.

1422
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,559
Yes.

1423
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,278
Come on, doggy.
Come on, come on, come on.

1424
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:38,407
What happened?

1425
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:42,582
All right, back it away, back it away.
Back it away.

1426
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:44,554
- What's the big idea?
- I don't need any help.

1427
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,354
Mr Bogardus, how are you?

1428
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,218
- I'm all right!
- And your legs?

1429
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,337
OK. No bones broken.

1430
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,034
Oh, Father O'Malley. Oh!

1431
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,453
Well, Sister, that was lovely.
What is it called?

1432
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:06,078
It means, er... "It's spring."

1433
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,046
Don't let me slow you.
Sing something else.

1434
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:10,166
What do we know?

1435
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,384
How about, er...
do you know "Birmingham Bertha"?

1436
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:14,344
- No.
- It's a tune!

1437
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:15,963
How about the school song then?

1438
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:18,842
Oh, yes. Sister has a new version of it
with a fix and everything.

1439
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:20,808
- She's a bit proud of it.
- Well, sing that.

1440
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:24,521
- Won't you sing the melody, Father?
- Sister, you talked me into it.

1460
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:16,587
Haven't had a chance like that in years.
I had to try it.

1461
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:24,884
- Father.
- Yeah?

1462
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,181
- The doctor's here.
- Oh, good.

1463
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,628
- How are you, Father?
- Hello, Doctor.

1464
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:34,588
Sister Benedict was in to see me.

1465
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:38,105
She's in great spirits, Doctor,
probably the happiest person alive.

1466
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:40,233
Isn't it wonderful
what faith can do?

1467
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:44,908
Father, everyone's so happy around here,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

1468
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,122
I examined Sister Benedict.

1469
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:50,209
- Can she be sent away for a while?
- Why? Where?

1470
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:53,750
Some place like Arizona,
for instance?

1471
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,873
- You see this area here?
- Yes, what is it?

1472
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:58,842
That's her right lung.
And here, in this area...

1473
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,553
Well, I never could make anything
out of those things.

1474
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:04,597
What is it, Doctor, TB?

1475
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:07,718
Yes. A very early stage.

1476
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:16,565
Oh, it's not that bad.
We're lucky to catch it right now.

1477
01:41:16,696 --> 01:41:19,939
That's what I meant when I asked
if she could be sent to a drier climate,

1478
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,817
to an infirmary
or a home for old people,

1479
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:27,447
some place where she could have
light duties, not another school.

1480
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:30,416
If it has to be done,
I guess it can be done...

1481
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,411
...but not to be with children...

1482
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:37,881
No, not for a while.
Not until this condition's cleared up.

1483
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,046
- Does she know about this?
- Not yet.

1484
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:42,134
It's very important
that she doesn't know it.

1485
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:45,506
She has a wonderful vitality,
a natural optimism,

1486
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,678
and that's the best medicine
anyone can have.

1487
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,472
If that spirit is dampened,

1488
01:41:49,604 --> 01:41:53,097
it would have a depressing effect
and delay her recovery.

1489
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:58,147
She'll have to know about it.
We can't just send her away without...

1490
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:02,569
Don't you people, more or less,
go where you're told without question?

1491
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:07,574
Yes, and we're supposed
to have the stamina to take it.

1492
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,446
She has plenty of that.

1493
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,042
But you don't quite understand, Doctor.
You see...

1494
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:19,256
...Sister and I haven't always agreed
on how to run the school.

1495
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:24,758
It's been one rather serious
difference of opinion.

1496
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:28,553
Now, if she's sent away
without any explanation, why...

1497
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:31,175
...she's bound to think that...

1498
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,392
Up to here, Father,
we were discussing her health,

1499
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,014
what's best for her.

1500
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,982
Now we're discussing your feelings.

1501
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:40,853
It's a heck of a way to put it, Doc.

1502
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,150
I only want to see her get well.

1503
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:49,403
Well, I guess I can see to it
that she's transferred, but...

1504
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:53,115
...not to tell her why...

1505
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,793
...send her away
without any explanation...

1506
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,049
You would put it that way.

1507
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:06,011
Her opinion of me or her health.

1508
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,597
Right down here, men.

1509
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:11,136
There.

1510
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,139
All right.

1511
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,853
Just straighten it a little bit.

1512
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:20,225
There, that's...

1513
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:22,353
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

1514
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:27,942
This is... This is to go up there.

1515
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:31,615
There.

1516
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:35,912
Be sure to leave room for their knees.

1517
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,706
You know how they go.
You remember.

1518
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,964
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning, Sister.

1519
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,926
Look out! Look out, Father,
you're in the way.

1520
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:55,802
Here, let me help you with that.

1521
01:43:58,733 --> 01:43:59,814
There.

1522
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:02,275
Just put it down there.
That'll do for now.

1523
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:04,756
I'm so glad you came over, Father.
I have so much on my mind and...

1524
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,271
I want to talk to you, too, Sister.

1525
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,399
When you bring the desk,
put it over here.

1526
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:09,866
Yes, Sister.

1527
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,327
Let's go where there's less noise.

1528
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:18,708
Now we can finally tear down
our old school

1529
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:20,668
and that can become our playground.

1530
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:23,539
It's all so wonderful.
And I'm tired.

1531
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:26,542
- I think I'll sit down for a minute.
- You've been working too hard.

1532
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:29,010
You shouldn't be lifting things
around here.

1533
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:32,302
It must be all the excitement.
Now, what was it I was going to say?

1534
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,595
Yes, about commencement.
Did you ask Mr Bogardus?

1535
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:37,811
- Yes, and the doctor.
- Fine. He's a nice man.

1536
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:41,773
He telephoned and told me
that I had nothing to worry about.

1537
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,894
Yes, I'll have you know that he said
there was nothing wrong with me.

1538
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,440
I'm perfect.

1539
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:49,030
- That is good news.
- Yes, isn't it?

1540
01:44:49,158 --> 01:44:51,094
About Bogardus, do you want me
to thank Bogardus publicly?

1541
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,952
Oh, yes, by all means,

1542
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,743
and convey our sincere gratitude
for his wholehearted generosity.

1543
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,537
But don't make a long speech.

1544
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:01,660
Sister, I'll be the soul of brevity.

1545
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:05,836
The children will be restless and
the parents will be interested only in them.

1546
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:08,208
But of course you'll impress
upon the graduating class,

1547
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:11,007
that they must never give up
their pursuit of learning

1548
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:17,351
and at all times carry uppermost
in their minds the ideals of St Mary's.

1549
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:20,343
Yes, I... I think that'll take care
of everything, Father.

1550
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:25,685
If you think I'm gonna be long-winded,
why don't you write the speech?

1551
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,233
I have, Father. I have it here.

1552
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:29,696
And I have one more wish:

1553
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:32,407
that the next year will be
a joyous and successful one,

1554
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,027
and that we'll never have
any more misunderstandings.

1555
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,994
Serious ones, I mean.

1556
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,412
I know how you feel about Patsy.

1557
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:49,125
You still disagree with me, don't you?

1558
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:57,675
Father, sometimes we have to do things
that aren't easy.

1559
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:01,895
No matter how much they hurt us,
we have to do what we believe is right.

1560
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:08,522
I have something to tell you, Sister,
that isn't going to be easy.

1561
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:12,064
What is that, Father?

1562
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:15,943
Well, you'll be notified shortly...

1563
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:19,870
...that Sister Michael is going
to be in charge here next year.

1564
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,808
Well, she...

1565
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:47,269
She'll be so happy.

1566
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:02,576
And I...?

1567
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,418
Will...

1568
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,503
Will I-I be her assistant?

1569
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,918
It's only fair to tell you, Sister,
that you're being transferred.

1570
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:44,410
It's going to be difficult
to leave St Mary's.

1571
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:52,707
But we shouldn't become
too attached to any one place.

1572
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:59,929
Any other school may seem...
strange at first,

1573
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:06,304
but... as long as
I'm around children I'll be happy.

1574
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,315
How do you know all this?

1575
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:21,534
Have you been writing
Mother General again?

1576
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:33,250
- Will I be here for graduation?
- Yes, Sister, of course.

1577
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:37,467
Is this the desk
that goes in your office, Sister?

1578
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,386
Yes.

1579
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:43,348
Yes.

1580
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:46,851
Was there anything else
you had to say, Father?

1581
01:48:46,979 --> 01:48:48,971
- That was all?
- Yes, Sister.

1582
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:50,938
I'll go with you.

1583
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,426
Sorry you couldn't be with us, Pat.

1584
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:25,969
Thanks, Del.

1585
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:29,594
- What happened to my dress?
- Sister has it. It didn't fit me.

1586
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:31,892
- Too many milkshakes!
- Yeah.

1587
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,016
Well, better luck next year.

1588
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:36,393
- I'll be rooting for you.
- Thanks.

1589
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:52,291
Where is she?

1590
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:57,213
- Which one's Patsy?
- Well, I... I don't see her.

1591
01:49:57,341 --> 01:50:00,630
I'll look for her, Joe.
You go find Father O'Malley.

1592
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:01,968
OK.

1593
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:24,073
- Who is that?
- My mother, Sister.

1594
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,912
Is she here for the exercises?

1595
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:34,075
I guess so.

1596
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,376
You didn't tell her
you're not graduating?

1597
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:45,470
No, Sister.

1598
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,386
My dear child, why not?

1599
01:50:52,271 --> 01:50:54,729
She's been out of town.

1600
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:00,147
It's embarrassing, Patsy, I know...

1601
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:04,481
...but you mustn't feel so badly
about not graduating.

1602
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:08,155
If we don't fail sometimes,
our successes won't mean anything.

1603
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:12,747
You must have courage.
Don't give up.

1604
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:21,290
I'll explain to your mother,
so she won't think ill of you.

1605
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,257
I know she loves you,
and you love her,

1606
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:26,219
and where there's love,
there's complete understanding.

1607
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:29,589
Understanding? If you ask me,
nobody understands anything.

1608
01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:30,925
You don't understand anything,

1609
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,537
Father O'Malley
doesn't understand anything,

1610
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:33,972
my mama does...

1611
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:37,476
Oh, Sister, I'm sorry.

1612
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,941
What is troubling you, Patsy?

1613
01:51:40,068 --> 01:51:42,481
Oh, Sister, help me.

1614
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:45,105
Oh, please help me.

1615
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,072
Yes, of course.

1616
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:48,783
Of course I want to help you.

1617
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:51,574
I want to be a nun, Sister.

1618
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,867
How can I become a nun like you?

1619
01:51:53,999 --> 01:51:56,912
There's one thing I do know,
something is troubling you.

1620
01:51:57,044 --> 01:52:00,537
No. No, I just want to be a nun.

1621
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:09,053
You don't say it that way, my dear.

1622
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:11,343
"I want to be a nun."

1623
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:17,809
You don't become a nun
to run away from life, Patsy.

1624
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:21,315
It's not because you've lost something.

1625
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:24,569
It's because you've found something.

1626
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:33,369
You're still a little girl.

1627
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:34,988
You don't know yet.

1628
01:52:35,123 --> 01:52:37,115
Oh, but I do.

1629
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,493
I just want to be like you.

1630
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,589
You don't know
what the next four years will bring.

1631
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:48,585
You haven't been to high school yet.
Those are years you'll always treasure.

1632
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:53,966
New companions, new interests,
lots of fun, as well as study.

1633
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:57,351
Going to... to parties.

1634
01:52:57,479 --> 01:52:59,391
Football games.

1635
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,435
Your first prom.

1636
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:04,149
Your first party dress.

1637
01:53:04,278 --> 01:53:05,689
Your first waltz.

1638
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:09,155
You can't give up these things
if you know nothing about them.

1639
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:14,828
Not until you've known all this
and more...

1640
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:20,037
...can you say
with complete understanding,

1641
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:22,410
"I want to be a nun."

1642
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:24,629
Oh, but I can. I can!

1643
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:26,839
I know them all now.

1644
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:31,337
Well, then, Patsy, there's another thing.
Your marks aren't good enough.

1645
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:34,930
- You have to pass your examinations.
- But I could have.

1646
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,050
I could have passed.

1647
01:53:37,185 --> 01:53:39,017
I didn't want to.

1648
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:42,939
You mean you failed on purpose?

1649
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:46,810
I thought maybe
I could stay here another year.

1650
01:53:46,945 --> 01:53:50,564
Everything's so nice here, Sister.
You don't know.

1651
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:53,988
Everything's so clean
and so good and...

1652
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:57,487
...well, even if I am in the same grade,
I don't care.

1653
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:59,454
I'd be with you.

1654
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:04,410
Oh, Patsy.

1655
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,998
I'm beginning to see what's wrong.

1656
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:12,589
Did Father O'Malley know about this?

1657
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:14,553
Nobody knows, Sister.

1658
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:16,513
Nobody but me.

1659
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:19,429
- "I."
- No, Sister, you're wrong.

1660
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:22,474
"But" can be used as a preposition
as well as a conjunction,

1661
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:24,518
and then it takes the objective case.

1662
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:28,063
Dear me! That was
on the examination, wasn't it?

1663
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:31,814
Uh-huh, and I missed it.
I'm brighter than you think I am, Sister.

1664
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:34,110
Go ahead,
ask me some more questions.

1665
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:36,905
Honestly, I wouldn't be a dumb nun.

1666
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:39,029
Oh, Patsy.

1667
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:45,118
Sister, this is
Mr and Mrs Joe Gallagher.

1668
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,290
Patsy's mother and father.

1669
01:54:48,173 --> 01:54:49,835
How do you do?

1670
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,601
Patsy, your father.

1671
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:08,103
Hello, Patsy.

1672
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:21,328
Don't look at me like that, Patsy.

1673
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:25,374
Give me time.
I may grow on you.

1674
01:55:35,971 --> 01:55:39,305
Darling... darling, don't cry.

1675
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:43,885
Everything's going to be
different from now on.

1676
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:47,601
Mummy and Daddy are going to see
that you have a home,

1677
01:55:47,732 --> 01:55:51,567
a real home,
and have a room all your own.

1678
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:55,898
You can have children over now
as often as you like.

1679
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,523
You...

1680
01:55:58,118 --> 01:55:59,609
...well, you...

1681
01:56:00,537 --> 01:56:02,620
...you won't be lonely anymore.

1682
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,409
Oh, Mama!

1683
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:06,624
Oh, Mummy!

1684
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:11,462
- Is this my real daddy?
- Yes, darling.

1685
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:17,001
- Yes.
- We came to see you graduate, Patsy.

1686
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:19,678
Isn't it time you were getting ready?

1687
01:56:26,563 --> 01:56:31,058
We were just about to get ready,
weren't we, Patsy?

1688
01:56:31,193 --> 01:56:32,855
Yes, Sister.

1689
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:47,369
How were her marks, Father?
I didn't see her report card.

1690
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:50,414
Hmm? Her marks?
Oh, they were exceptional.

1691
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:52,585
There wasn't a child in the class
anywhere near her.

1692
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:54,083
Oh.

1693
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,728
My dear friends, this is indeed
a great day for St Mary's,

1694
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:58,853
I might call it the first birthday
of the new St Mary's.

1695
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,823
There's the old, and here's the new.

1696
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:06,194
And we owe it all to the generosity
and benevolence of one man,

1697
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:10,323
a man whose name will be graven
on our cornerstone and in our hearts

1698
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:12,120
for many years to come.

1699
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:16,087
Speaking of hearts,
a truly great heart beats in the bosom

1700
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:19,423
of Mr Horace P Bogardus.

1701
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:21,292
Ah, bup-bup-bup!

1702
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:24,011
Mr Bogardus is a very modest man.

1703
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:26,051
But when you have a heart
that loves children,

1704
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:30,051
that thinks only of others and
that's capable of doing so much good,

1705
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:33,679
then, my friends, you have a heart
that can laugh at the years.

1706
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:39,394
Mr Bogardus is a fine example
of the joy of giving.

1707
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:42,613
To him, every day is Christmas.

1708
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:45,484
Indeed, he has holly in his heart.

1709
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:51,155
Thank you.

1710
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:56,332
St Mary's is founded
on faith, hope and charity.

1711
01:58:56,463 --> 01:58:58,125
The greatest of these is charity...

1712
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:00,919
And a gift to the church, you know,
is deductible.

1713
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:04,385
...so we thank
Mr Bogardus for his generous gift.

1714
01:59:04,512 --> 01:59:05,923
Now I'd like to say a few words

1715
01:59:06,056 --> 01:59:08,969
to the boys and the girls
of our graduating class.

1716
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,592
I'm gonna make it very brief.

1717
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:14,516
Today is a joyous one for you,
because you're graduating.

1718
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:17,516
It's also a sad one,
because you're leaving St Mary's.

1719
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:22,483
I can't sum up in a few minutes
what you've learned here in eight years.

1720
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:26,358
What you're taking with you is...
is not just what was in the books.

1721
01:59:26,493 --> 01:59:29,110
That's important,
but it isn't everything.

1722
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:33,114
What you're taking with you
is what you have to give now to others,

1723
01:59:33,249 --> 01:59:36,742
what the good sisters have taught you.

1724
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:40,333
I want to say it right here
that if any of you are ever in trouble,

1725
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:44,425
no matter what,
you just dial "O" for O'Malley.

1726
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,823
- Did you order the cab?
- Yes, it'll be waiting outside.

1727
02:00:56,958 --> 02:00:58,950
Sister Benedict in the chapel?

1728
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,971
Oh...

1729
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:42,743
Dear Lord...

1730
02:01:46,174 --> 02:01:48,006
Dear Lord...

1731
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:52,712
...remove all bitterness from my heart.

1732
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,802
Please...

1733
02:02:00,897 --> 02:02:04,732
...help me to see thy holy will
in all things.

1734
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:09,520
Help me.

1735
02:02:13,201 --> 02:02:14,692
Please.

1736
02:02:15,829 --> 02:02:17,991
Oh, please, help me.

1737
02:02:51,114 --> 02:02:53,106
Are you going with me, Sister Angela?

1738
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:55,073
Yes, Sister.

1739
02:02:55,827 --> 02:02:57,568
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.

1740
02:02:57,704 --> 02:03:00,196
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.

1741
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:03,036
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye, Sister.

1742
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:05,750
Goodbye, Sister Genevieve.

1743
02:03:05,879 --> 02:03:08,337
You know that wherever I am,

1744
02:03:08,464 --> 02:03:11,298
my heart will always be with St Mary's.

1745
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:15,003
Goodbye, Sister Benedict.

1746
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:17,463
Goodbye, Sister Michael.

1747
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:24,557
Father...

1748
02:03:24,689 --> 02:03:26,430
Sister, we know your heart will be here.

1749
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:29,149
We'll always remember you
in our prayers.

1750
02:03:33,948 --> 02:03:35,359
Thank you.

1751
02:03:38,286 --> 02:03:40,619
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1752
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:05,931
Sister?

1753
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:08,810
Sister Benedict?

1754
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:25,452
Sister, I can't let you go like this.

1755
02:04:27,085 --> 02:04:30,419
You know, when Dr McKay
said you were perfect,

1756
02:04:30,546 --> 02:04:35,257
he was right...
for that's what you are.

1757
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:40,508
But he didn't mean physically...

1758
02:04:42,392 --> 02:04:46,102
...because, Sister,
you have a touch of tuberculosis.

1759
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:55,312
Now, Dr McKay felt that
you shouldn't know about this, but I've...

1760
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:58,863
Thank you, Father.

1761
02:05:00,076 --> 02:05:01,487
Thank you.

1762
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:04,032
You've made me very happy.

1763
02:05:08,418 --> 02:05:10,250
I'll get well quickly now.

1764
02:05:11,713 --> 02:05:13,796
- Of course you will, Sister.
- Of course I will.

1765
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,923
And if you ever need anything,
no matter what it is

1766
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:18,167
or wherever you happen to be...

1767
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:20,419
Yes. I know.

1768
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:24,089
I'll just dial "O" for O'Malley.

1769
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:26,467
Right.

1769
02:05:27,305 --> 02:06:27,207
