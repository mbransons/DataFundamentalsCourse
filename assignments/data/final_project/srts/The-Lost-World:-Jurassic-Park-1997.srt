1
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:28,893
That looks fabulous.

2
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,926
Thank you, Geoffrey.

3
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:35,289
We'll also take a bottle of red as well.
Thank you.

4
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,331
Thank you, Barry.

5
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:45,286
That looks wonderful. Beautiful day.

6
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,926
Where are you going?

7
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:50,572
- To eat my sandwich.
- You won't be hungry for prawns.

8
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,485
- I don't like prawns.
- Darling, don't wander off.

9
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,960
For God's sake, leave her alone, Deirdre.

10
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,047
- Go play with your ball.
- Don't be so annoying!

11
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,970
Darling...

12
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,128
...what about snakes?

13
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:14,249
There aren't any snakes on the beach.
Just let her enjoy herself for once.

14
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,685
Edward?

15
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,407
Hello, there.

16
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:56,885
What are you, a little bird or something?

17
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:05,481
Are you hungry? Take a bite.
It's roast beef.

18
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,560
It's good. Come on. I won't hurt you.

19
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:14,445
Mummy! Daddy! Come see this!
I found something!

20
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:29,677
Cathy, darling, lunch is ready!

21
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,441
Are you looking at this?

22
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,758
I'm afraid there isn't enough to go around.

23
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,240
Paul?

24
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:46,394
Cathy?

25
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,997
Will you hurry up? Hurry up!

26
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,992
You're him, right?

27
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,839
Excuse me?

28
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,153
The scientist? The guy? I saw you on TV.

29
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,473
I believed you.

30
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,586
Who shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling?

31
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,396
Ian Malcolm. I've been summoned.

32
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,435
Dr. Malcolm!

33
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,467
Hello, Dr. Malcolm.

34
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:03,988
Kids, kids.

35
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,073
- It's so great to see you.
- It's so great to see you.

36
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,434
Look at you.

37
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:11,274
You came to see Grandpa?

38
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,472
Yeah, he called me.
Do you know what it's about?

39
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,144
I don't, either.
This joint's kind of creepy, isn't it?

40
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:20,623
Is everything okay?

41
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,945
Well, not exactly.

42
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,745
Dr. Malcolm.

43
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:40,226
Dr. Malcolm. Here to share
a few campfire stories with my uncle?

44
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:49,985
<i>Convince the Washington Post
and Sceptical Inquirer of what you want...</i>

45
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,666
...but I was there.
I know what happened and so do you.

46
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:55,949
Do you believe everyone
who chose discretion did so...

47
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:59,149
...for a nefarious motive?
Even Lex and Tim?

48
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,665
Leave them out of it. It's not a game.

49
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:05,910
No. You signed a nondisclosure agreement
before you went to the island...

50
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:10,064
...that forbade you from discussing what
you saw. You violated that agreement.

51
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:13,109
I did. And you lied about the deaths
of three people.

52
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,268
You misinformed the public,
which made me look like a nut.

53
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,102
Not so good for my career-

54
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,943
We made a generous compensatory offer
for your injuries.

55
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,463
A payoff and an insult.

56
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,101
When you spin reality, cover up evidence,
it hurts more than my reputation.

57
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,782
As I recall...

58
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,988
...your university revoked your tenure
for your selling wild stories to the press.

59
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,987
I didn't sell anything.
I took no money and I told the truth.

60
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,377
Your version of it.

61
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,223
There are no " versions" of the truth.
InGen can't keep spewing out-

62
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:46,421
InGen is my responsibility.
I will jealously defend its interests.

63
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:48,779
Yours? What about Mr. Hammond?

64
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,898
It is our board of directors I must face,
not my uncle.

65
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:57,504
Trust me, your problems
are about to be rendered moot.

66
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:01,264
In a few weeks' time,
they'll be long forgotten.

67
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,666
Not by me.

68
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,266
Careful.

69
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,220
This suit cost more than your education.

70
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:15,255
<i>You were right and I was wrong. There!</i>

71
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:18,099
<i>Did you ever expect
to hear me say such a thing?</i>

72
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,423
Thank God for Site B.

73
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,305
Site B?

74
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,538
Isla Nublar was just a showroom
for tourists.

75
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:33,780
Site B was the factory floor.
Isla Sorna, 80 miles from Nublar.

76
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:37,535
We bred the animals there,
nurtured them for a few months...

77
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,855
...then moved them into the park.

78
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,021
Really? I did not know that.

79
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,900
After the accident in the park...

80
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:48,454
...Hurricane Clarissa wiped out
our facility on Site B.

81
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,415
Call it an act of God.

82
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,342
We had to evacuate.
The animals were released...

83
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,341
...to mature on their own.

84
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:00,902
" Life will find a way,"
as you once so eloquently put it.

85
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,055
By now we have a complete
ecological system on the island...

86
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:07,061
...with dozens of species
living in social groups...

87
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,977
...without fences, boundaries
or constraining technology.

88
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,940
And for four years...

89
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,972
...I've tried to keep it safe
from human interference.

90
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:22,659
Right. Hopefully, you've kept
the island quarantined and contained.

91
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:26,701
But I'm in shock.
I mean, that they're still alive.

92
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,933
You bred them lysine-deficient.

93
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:32,736
Shouldn't they have kicked after seven
days without supplemental enzymes?

94
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,210
But, by God, they're flourishing.

95
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:38,418
That's one of 1,000 questions
I want the team to answer.

96
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,656
Team?

97
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:45,213
I've organised an expedition to go in...

98
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,055
...thank you, and document them.

99
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,418
To make the most spectacular living
fossil record the world has ever seen.

100
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,697
Go in and document?
You mean with people?

101
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,169
Yes, the animals won't know they're there.
Very low impact.

102
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:01,932
Strictly observation and documentation.

103
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,974
Our satellite infrareds
show the animals are fiercely territorial.

104
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:10,291
The carnivores are isolated
in the interior of the island...

105
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,813
...so the team can stay on the outer rim.

106
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,648
Don't worry.
I'm not making the same mistakes again.

107
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,252
No, you're making all new ones.

108
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,292
John! So, there's another island
with dinosaurs...

109
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:27,888
...no fences this time,
and you want to send people in...

110
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:31,333
...very few people, on the ground, right?

111
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:34,690
Who are the four lunatics
you're trying to con into this?

112
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,655
It was hard to convince them
of what they would see...

113
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,052
...in the end had to use my chequebook.

114
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:44,528
But there's Nick van Owen,
a video documentarian...

115
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:49,453
...Eddie Carr,
who's a field equipment expert.

116
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,205
We have our palaeontologist...

117
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:57,245
...and I was hoping that perhaps
you might be the fourth.

118
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:02,764
We've been on the verge of Chapter 11
since that accident in the park.

119
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,490
There are those in the company
who wanted to exploit Site B...

120
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:08,412
...in order to bail us out.

121
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:12,807
They've been planning it for years,
but I've stopped them until now.

122
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:17,089
A few weeks ago,
a British family on a yacht cruise...

123
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:22,494
...stumbled across the island
and their wee girl was injured.

124
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:24,527
She's fine.

125
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:30,091
But the board has used the incident
to take control of InGen from me.

126
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:34,165
Now it's only a matter of time before this...

127
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,366
...lost world is found and pillaged.

128
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:43,887
Public opinion is the one thing I can use
to preserve it, but to rally that support...

129
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,726
...I need a complete photo record...

130
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,724
...of those animals alive
in their natural habitat.

131
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:53,409
So you went from capitalist
to naturalist in just four years.

132
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,441
That's something.

133
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,886
It's our last chance at redemption.

134
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,605
John...

135
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:08,800
...no.

136
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,487
Of course, no.

137
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:15,245
And I'm going to contact
the other three members of your team...

138
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,241
...and stop them from going.

139
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,600
Who's the palaeontologist, by the way?

140
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,165
She came to me, I want you to know.

141
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,325
Who did?

142
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,562
Leave it to you, Ian, to have associations...

143
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,766
...even liaisons with the best people
in so many fields.

144
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,043
Not Sarah.

145
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:36,725
Palaeontological behaviour study is a new
field, and Sarah Harding is on that frontier.

146
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,007
Her theories on parenting and nurturing
in carnivores have framed the debate.

147
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,717
- What are you doing?
- Where's your phone?

148
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,527
It's too late.

149
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,040
She's already there.

150
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,276
The others are meeting her in three days.

151
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,285
You sent my girlfriend to this island alone?

152
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,959
" Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.

153
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,755
She was already in San Diego,
doing research at the animal park.

154
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,400
It's only a few hours' flight from there.

155
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:20,001
She was adamant,
absolutely adamant about, here you are...

156
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,959
...about making the initial foray by herself.

157
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,157
She thinks she's Dian Fossey.

158
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:29,358
" Observation without interference,"
she said. You know how it is.

159
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:33,115
After you were injured in the park,
she sought you out.

160
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:36,517
Then she went all the way to a hospital
in Costa Rica...

161
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:40,154
...to ask someone she didn't know
if the rumours were true.

162
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,997
If you want to leave your name
on something, fine.

163
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:46,360
But stop putting it
on other people's headstones.

164
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:51,115
She'll be fine. She's spent years
studying African predators.

165
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:54,640
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.

166
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,358
And, believe me, the research team will-

167
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:03,598
It's not a research expedition anymore.
It's a rescue operation and it's leaving now.

168
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:25,793
I can't shave three days off my deadline
and expect to be ready.

169
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,349
I'm not supplied.
I haven't tested any of this.

170
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,279
Why give her a satellite phone
if it doesn't work?

171
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,831
Could be solar flares, the satellite,
or maybe she turned it off.

172
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:38,311
I need half air on the tires.
We're flying pressurised.

173
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,595
- Does she know how to use it?
- You kidding?

174
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,592
She's faxed me refinements
on half the plans for this stuff.

175
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,433
Don't do that. You have to baby it.
Love it.

176
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,353
- I'll love it when it works.
- It'll work when you love it.

177
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,750
- You coming along?
- I don't usually, but I can't resist.

178
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,671
Thanks for the two-minute warning.

179
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,671
Nick van Owen, Ian Malcolm.
Nick's our photographer.

180
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,637
How do you do?

181
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:03,155
- You do wildlife photography?
- Wildlife, combat, you name it.

182
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,754
<i>When I was with Nightline,
I was in Rwanda, Chechnya, Bosnia.</i>

183
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,433
I do volunteer work for Greenpeace
once in a while.

184
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,429
What drew you to Greenpeace?

185
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,027
Women.

186
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:15,556
Greenpeace is 80-percent female.

187
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:17,187
Noble.

188
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,871
Noble was last year.
This year I'm getting paid.

189
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,553
Hammond's check cleared,
or I wouldn't go on this wild-goose chase.

190
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:28,632
You're going to the only place
where the geese chase you.

191
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,269
Dad! Dad!

192
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,430
Kelly, honey, you found it.
What took you so long?

193
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:37,910
Couldn't get a cab.

194
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:42,786
Sweetie, that's okay.
I've got to tell you something.

195
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:48,024
- I don't even know this woman.
- You've known Karen for 10 years.

196
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:51,393
She doesn't have Sega.
She's such a troglodyte.

197
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:53,467
Cruel, but good word use.

198
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,752
Why can't I stay with Sarah?

199
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,713
She's out of town. Karen's fantastic.

200
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,628
She'll take you places.
You'll have a fantastic time.

201
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,673
Stop saying "fantastic. "
Where are you going?

202
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:09,512
It's only for a few days.
I wouldn't be going if it wasn't important.

203
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,031
I'm your daughter full time. You can't
abandon me whenever opportunity knocks.

204
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,988
That hurts. Your mom tell you to say that?

205
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,383
<i>Dr. Malcolm, downstairs, please.</i>

206
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,944
I know we've had some hard going.

207
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:25,509
But in the last few years,
we've started to work things out.

208
00:16:25,713 --> 00:16:29,831
Yeah, but crack on me a bit. Ground me
or something. Send me to my room.

209
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,864
You never do any of that stuff.

210
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,069
Why would I? You turned out so...

211
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:37,589
...beautiful, brilliant, powerful,
funny and generous.

212
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,742
The queen, goddess. My inspiration.

213
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:40,907
<i>Dr. Malcolm.</i>

214
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:44,507
I could come be your research assistant,
like in Austin.

215
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,942
This is nothing like Austin.

216
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,388
Anyway, you have your own stuff.

217
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:53,623
Your gymnastics competition.
You've been training for months.

218
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,064
Gymnastics?

219
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,900
I scrubbed out, got cut from the team.
Thanks for knowing.

220
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,909
I'm sorry, honey.

221
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,225
I know how much that meant to you.

222
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:09,346
You like having kids.
You just don't want to be with them.

223
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,986
It wasn't me who dumped you and split
for Paris, so don't take it out on me.

224
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,346
<i>Dr. Malcolm, downstairs!</i>

225
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,864
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

226
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:31,541
You want some good parental advice?
Don't listen to me.

227
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,100
How are we doing here?

228
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:42,022
The specs say it can't deform at 12,000 PSl,
so we'll test it.

229
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,576
- Let's clear. We clear?
- What's this?

230
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:47,581
A high hide.

231
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,385
A high hide.
You know, you go up and hide, high.

232
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:56,337
It goes up to where the trees are and
keeps the researchers out of harm's way.

233
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:00,218
Actually, it puts them
at a very convenient biting height.

234
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,665
Do you have the time?

235
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,616
- Why?
- We're leaving in three hours.

236
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,257
This is so cool.

237
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,649
Lindstradt air rifle.
Fires a subsonic Fluger dart.

238
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,619
- It work better than your satellite phone?
- Funny.

239
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,535
<i>I loaded it with enhanced venom from
Conus purpurascens: South Sea cone shell.</i>

240
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:37,090
Most powerful neurotoxin in the world.
Acts within 0.002 of a second.

241
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,171
Faster than nerve-conduction velocity.

242
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,451
So the animal's down
before it even feels the dart.

243
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,657
- Is there an antidote?
- Like if you shot yourself in the foot?

244
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,777
Don't do that.
You'd be dead before you realised it.

245
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,254
He says he's unloading us here.
He won't go further up the river.

246
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:02,130
He's heard too many stories.
He'll drop us off and anchor offshore.

247
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:03,811
What kind of stories?

248
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,611
Stories of fishermen that came too close
to the island and never returned.

249
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:17,176
He has a radio. He has a satellite phone.

250
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,015
When you need him,
call and he'll be here in two hours.

251
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,248
But he will not stay here.

252
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:29,177
He won't stay anywhere near these islands.

253
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:32,334
<i>They call the islands " Las Cinco Muertes"?</i>

254
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:36,176
What does that mean?

255
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,215
" The Five Deaths"...

256
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:41,129
...he says.

257
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:59,532
I put a location sensor in Dr. Harding's
phone, so we should get a reading.

258
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:02,288
- I'm so relieved.
- Don't push my buttons.

259
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,003
We're almost on top of her dot.
She should be around here.

260
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:08,247
Over there.

261
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:22,488
Sarah!

262
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,970
Sarah Harding!

263
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,086
How many Sarahs do you think
are on this island?

264
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:41,927
What?

265
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,331
Something big.

266
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,488
This is magnificent.

267
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,887
Yeah. " Ooh, ah,"
that's how it always starts.

268
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:24,407
But then later
there's running and screaming.

269
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,523
Nick!

270
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:55,041
I guess you got the jump on us,
didn't you, Sarah?

271
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,116
Yeah.

272
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:04,116
Ian, I never thought Hammond
could get you to come here.

273
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,803
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Sarah.

274
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,317
Got a granola bar or something?
I'm starving.

275
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,884
Did you see those animals?

276
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:20,117
A family group, a pair-bond and a subadult,
long after the juvenile was nest bound.

277
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:23,123
Every egg clutch I've seen has crushed,
trampled shells.

278
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:26,720
Hatchlings stay in the birth environment
a long time. That's conclusive.

279
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,115
I can end that controversy
if I get a shot of the nest.

280
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,242
Have you been attacked?

281
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,720
No, that's my lucky pack.
That's how it always looks.

282
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:39,118
Okay, Sarah-

283
00:23:39,204 --> 00:23:41,957
Is that a Nikon? Can I borrow it?

284
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:44,834
I'll be right back, I promise.

285
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:52,359
When Hammond called you,
why didn't you say something to me?

286
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,833
I knew you would have stopped me
from coming.

287
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:57,118
I would have tied you to the bed.

288
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,559
- I know how they survived without lysine.
- I don't care.

289
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:03,197
The herbivore species that are thriving...

290
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:06,592
...eat mostly agama beans, soy,
anything lysine-rich.

291
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,840
And the carnivores eat
the herbivores, so...

292
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,320
Wait.

293
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:17,515
Stay there. Be quiet. I'll be back.

294
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,234
Stay there.

295
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,958
She's much too close.

296
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,507
- What is she doing?
- Too close.

297
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:19,434
She has to touch it. She can't not touch.

298
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:24,067
- She's going right up to it.
- Once she sees something, she has to...

299
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,667
Is this even possible?

300
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:36,865
What?

301
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:42,151
This? What did you think you'd document?
What did you think you'd see?

302
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,511
Animals. Maybe...

303
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:47,908
...big iguanas.

304
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:51,904
Fruitcakes.

305
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,594
He got very angry.

306
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:13,429
Shoot him!

307
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:15,106
They're protecting their baby.

308
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:16,388
So am I!

309
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:38,824
I think they're leaving.

310
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,507
Incredible. Guys shoot their whole life
and never get stuff half this good.

311
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,225
Just give me the Pulitzer right now.

312
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:59,790
The competition's over, close the entries,
I'd like to thank everyone who lost.

313
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:03,226
Don't light that!
Dinosaurs pick up scents from miles away.

314
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,063
We're here to observe and document,
not interact.

315
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,823
Which is a scientific impossibility.

316
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,107
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
What you study, you change.

317
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,620
I'll risk it. I'm sick of scratching around
in rock and bone...

318
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,418
...making assumptions about
the nurturing habits of animals...

319
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,302
...that have been dead for 65 million years.

320
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:26,144
Then you fill my head with stories.
Of course I came down here.

321
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,107
Stories of mutilation and death.
Were you paying attention?

322
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,702
Please! Don't treat me like a grad student.

323
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:34,382
I've worked around predators
since I was 20.

324
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:36,942
Lions, jackals, hyenas, you.

325
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,299
Where's the fire?

326
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:49,385
I'm trying to change 100 years
of entrenched dogma.

327
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:53,102
Dinosaurs were characterised early on
as vicious lizards.

328
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:56,463
There's resistance to the idea of them
as nurturing parents.

329
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:58,981
Robert Burke said the T. Rex was a rogue...

330
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:02,979
...who abandoned its young at the first
opportunity. I can prove otherwise.

331
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:05,944
Fire! Dr. Malcolm, fire, base camp!

332
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:14,624
No! Water makes the smoke billow.
Use dirt!

333
00:28:14,746 --> 00:28:16,542
Who started the fire?

334
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,015
I just wanted to make dinner.

335
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,263
I wanted it ready when you guys got back.

336
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:28,258
Do you see any family resemblance there?

337
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,136
You practically told me to come.

338
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:32,452
I... What?

339
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,619
You said, " Don't listen to me. "
I thought you were trying to tell me-

340
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:39,457
Kelly, you knew exactly what I meant.
You have no-

341
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:43,139
You want to lock her up for her curiosity?
Where do you think she gets it?

342
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:47,182
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Don't start the teaming-up thing.

343
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:52,299
Out of the conversation. Please. Really.

344
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:56,572
Eddie, why doesn't this thing ever work?

345
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:59,894
It's not a land line.
You're not in a phone booth.

346
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,013
Wait for a decent signal.

347
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:07,738
Violence and technology:
not good bedfellows.

348
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:13,891
Hammond wants your equipment
as close to the animals as possible.

349
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:17,257
Great idea. And why don't you smear on
a little sheep's blood?

350
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,329
Eddie, is there any reason to think
the radio in the trailer might work?

351
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,894
Don't tease me.

352
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:26,491
If you feel qualified,
try flicking the switch to " on. "

353
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:30,658
Okay, I'm taking my daughter out of here.

354
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,772
Anyone coming with me,
this is your last chance.

355
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,335
When you're out in the field...

356
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,738
Nick, if you're staying, I'll gladly deliver
a letter to your wife or loved one...

357
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,572
...so you can say good-bye.

358
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,577
Eddie, if you have any personal effects...

359
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,571
...it's the least I can do.
I'll be in there, guys.

360
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,219
Our presence needs
to be 100-percent antiseptic.

361
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,608
If we so much as bend a blade of grass...

362
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:56,572
- Dad, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I'm furious.

363
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,016
This looks like your room.

364
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,487
- I was going to clean it up.
- Right now.

365
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:06,815
What is this? There are 100 switches!

366
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:10,732
Don't be mad. I was going to call
to let you know where I was.

367
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,769
I always do, don't I?

368
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,890
I'm the best kind of girlfriend there is.

369
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:19,970
One who travels a lot. You like that.
You love your independence.

370
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:24,255
I've gotten used to being apart,
but that's not how I want to live.

371
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:28,809
Kelly, this is tall talk. Just for a minute.

372
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:31,610
It's like a height restriction
at an amusement park.

373
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:35,693
If you wanted to rescue me,
why didn't you save me from...

374
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,052
...that museum fundraiser
three weeks ago?

375
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:42,692
This is a slightly different situation.

376
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:46,365
What about the dinner with your parents
you never showed up for?

377
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:51,171
Why not rescue me when I need it?
Be there when you say you will?

378
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,691
I have made a career
out of waiting for you.

379
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:57,165
You know, she has a pretty good-

380
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:01,645
It's so important to your future that you
not finish that sentence. Please, outside!

381
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:05,888
Ian, come on. Look.

382
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:11,848
I love that you rode in here
on a white horse. I really do.

383
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:16,205
It's very touching, very dramatic.

384
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:19,805
I just need you to show up in a cab
now and then, too.

385
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,805
What are you doing? Don't go out there.
It's not safe.

386
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:25,646
Stay in here. Come back. Shut the door.

387
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:35,648
I know what I'm doing.
You guys should definitely go.

388
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,444
But I'm staying.

389
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:42,203
I love you. I just don't need you right now.

390
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,643
What you need is a good anti-psychotic.

391
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:50,890
- I'll be back in five or six days.
- You'll be back in five or six pieces.

392
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:53,849
What bothers you is that I'm not afraid
and you are.

393
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:56,365
Of course I am. That's the whole thing.

394
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,169
What's that sound?

395
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,364
I'll get you out on one of these right now.

396
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,121
Hello! Over here!

397
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:19,958
I don't get it.
It says InGen on the side of that chopper!

398
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,921
I don't get that.
Why would Hammond send two teams?

399
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:27,765
Cut the umbilical, Dad!

400
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:31,126
Doesn't he trust us?
We haven't even started.

401
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:41,878
This is as good a place as any
for base camp.

402
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,522
That's first priority after we're finished.

403
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:48,401
I want it up and running in 30 minutes.
That's half an hour.

404
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,081
- Understood? Over.
- Cancel that order.

405
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:52,920
What? Why?

406
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:56,363
This is a game trail.
Carnivores hunt on game trails.

407
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:59,085
You want to set up base camp or a buffet?

408
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:05,722
Let's find a new spot, shall we?
Over and out.

409
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:09,919
Peter, if I run your little camping trip,
there are two conditions.

410
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:13,083
First, I'm in charge.
If I'm not around, Dieter is.

411
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:17,920
You just pay us, tell us we're doing well,
and serve us Scotch after a good day.

412
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,764
Second, my fee. You can keep it.

413
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:24,634
All I want for my services,
is the right to hunt a Tyrannosaurus.

414
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:27,443
A male. A buck only.
How and why are my business.

415
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:30,118
If you don't like those conditions,
you're on your own.

416
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:34,800
So go ahead, set up base camp here,
in a swamp, or in the middle of a Rex nest.

417
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:40,473
I've had too many safaris with rich dentists
to listen to any more suicidal ideas.

418
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,554
Okay?

419
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:52,838
Cycle, break off the stray from the herd
and flush him to the right.

420
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:56,598
Snaggers, stay ready.
He's bringing them out to you. It'll be a...

421
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:01,281
...Pachy... Pachya... Oh, hell.

422
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:04,356
The fat head with the bald spot.
Friar Tuck.

423
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,995
Stop.

424
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,559
Pachycephalosaurus.

425
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,868
Carnivore?

426
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,275
No, herbivore, late Cretaceous.

427
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,029
See the distinctive domed skull?

428
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,917
Nine inches of solid bone. Now, careful.

429
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:55,396
A pachy's neck attaches at the bottom
of its skull, not at the back of its head.

430
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,307
When it lowers its head,
its neck lines up with its backbone...

431
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:02,196
...which is perfect for absorbing impact.

432
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:11,632
Snagger, Friar Tuck's on the loose,
just about to cross your path.

433
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:19,791
Dieter, get in the outrigger.
You're closing in on a carina...

434
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,748
Say that again, Roland. A what?

435
00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:27,302
The one with the big red horn.
The pompadour. Elvis.

436
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,509
Take me out.

437
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:47,623
Okay, Carter, reel me in.

438
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,346
Easy!

439
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,949
Not too close.

440
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,108
Go for the legs! The legs! Watch the tail!

441
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:48,616
Burke!

442
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:50,666
Come here.

443
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:57,418
Recognise this trackway?

444
00:37:57,546 --> 00:37:59,502
Yes, I do. Tyrannosaur.

445
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:05,660
Roland.

446
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,303
Where do you think you're going?

447
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:17,536
To collect my fee, Mr. Ludlow.
To collect my fee.

448
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,339
Oh, my God.

449
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:36,742
<i>Procompsognathus Triassicus,
found by Frass in Bavaria in 1913.</i>

450
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,382
Is it dangerous?

451
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:41,701
No, I wouldn't think so.

452
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:45,660
The Compy's been presumed
to be a scavengers, like jackals.

453
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:50,019
It gives me the creeps.
It's like it's not scared.

454
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,457
There haven't been any visitors
to this island.

455
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,453
There's no reason for it to fear man.

456
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:01,251
Now it does.

457
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:22,620
It's the Rex nest.

458
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,211
It's probably only a couple weeks old.
Never left the nest.

459
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,774
Offspring that young, the parents
won't leave him alone for too long.

460
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,257
Make your blind here?
Wait for the buck to return?

461
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,687
If the nest is upwind, then so are we.

462
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,852
When he comes back, he's gonna know
we're here without us having a chance.

463
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,255
The trick is to get him...

464
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:58,089
...to come where we want him.

465
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:50,368
This is why Hammond was in a hurry to
get you here. He knew they were coming.

466
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,450
My God, they are well-organised.

467
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,445
Those are major-league toys.

468
00:40:56,414 --> 00:41:00,248
Maybe I should ask to use their phone.
Their dish is bigger than yours.

469
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:03,333
So they actually want
to build another park here?

470
00:41:03,414 --> 00:41:06,008
After what you said happened
on the other island?

471
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:09,608
They're not building anything.
They're taking these animals out of here.

472
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,012
Back to the mainland.

473
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:16,008
I think I should tell you. Hammond told me
these people might show up.

474
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:19,881
He thought we'd be finished by the time
they started, but if they weren't...

475
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:21,167
...he sent a backup plan.

476
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:22,605
What backup plan?

477
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:24,481
Me.

478
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:29,643
Simply put, InGen is seeking limited
partners to defray some of our expenses.

479
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:33,124
The prospectus you've been given
by the board details...

480
00:41:33,212 --> 00:41:35,965
...our projected hardware
and construction expenses.

481
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:40,647
As you can see by my two friends here,
the software is already fully developed.

482
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:46,644
<i>One might say, "It'd be up and running. "</i>

483
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,168
<i>In a moment,
I'll take you on a stroll through the camp...</i>

484
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,003
<i>...and you'll see some larger,
more impressive specimens.</i>

485
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:24,884
You don't bring people halfway
around the world to visit a zoo.

486
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,926
You bring the zoo to them.

487
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:29,438
San Diego is the perfect setting.

488
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:33,683
People already associate our beautiful city
with animal attractions:

489
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:38,958
San Diego Zoo, Sea World,
San Diego Chargers.

490
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:07,243
Mr. Hammond knew this.

491
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,355
Before he ever dreamt of an island...

492
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:14,159
...he began construction
on an amphitheatre...

493
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:19,039
...very near to where you're sitting now,
the InGen waterfront complex.

494
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,601
But he abandoned it...

495
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:25,516
...in favour of something far grander...

496
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,954
...and ultimately impossible.

497
00:43:29,124 --> 00:43:32,594
And so, the facility sits unused,
unfinished...

498
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:37,635
...when it could be completed and ready
to receive visitors in less than a month.

499
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:01,359
Ajay, look out! Jump!

500
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,754
That's the last time I leave you in charge.

501
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:54,514
Oh, my God. Are you out of your mind?

502
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:57,795
She's got a broken leg.
Let's get in the car before they hear us.

503
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:01,029
- You have any idea what that is?
- Come on, open the door.

504
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:02,947
You're nuts.

505
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:07,671
Man, Ian's not going to like this.

506
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,396
What's going on?

507
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,110
Isn't it obvious?

508
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:20,072
We're not alone on this island.

509
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,587
It's not set to the frequency.

510
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:36,144
Look here.

511
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,267
What the hell is that?

512
00:45:57,634 --> 00:45:59,033
Hello?

513
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:06,270
No, not Enrique. Ian Malcolm.
Are you on the boat?

514
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,146
No, is this the boat?

515
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:14,912
<i>We're on Isla Sorna.
We need to talk to the boat, Mar del Plata.</i>

516
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,306
I'll get him.

517
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:26,141
All right. That's it. I got you.

518
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:28,580
- I got you.
- Hurry up.

519
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:32,301
Let's go. Go. Come on.
Watch his tail. Get the door.

520
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:36,265
Boy, is she mad at you.

521
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:39,070
- I feel sorry for that guy, Enrique.
- No lectures, please.

522
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:42,063
Honey, stay back. Don't stand up, okay?

523
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:43,664
- I got it!
- Watch his head.

524
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:46,901
- Watch his head.
- Ian, he's hurt!

525
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,422
No, honey, no.

526
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,386
He'll snip at you. Watch his tail.

527
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,103
- All right?
- Okay, I got him.

528
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,179
- Got him?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,743
There you go.

530
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:05,138
What must I do, hit her with a stick?

531
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:06,742
No, don't get close, honey.

532
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:10,060
- Watch out! Don't stand too close.
- He has that not-so-fresh smell.

533
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,060
No, lady, enough! Wrong frequency.

534
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:22,387
Nick, don't let him
get those things around you.

535
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,219
Okay, let's take a look at this.

536
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:33,461
Easy, easy. Just calm down now.

537
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:37,578
Okay, here are the metatarsals.

538
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:45,664
Tibia, fibula. There it is.
There's the fracture.

539
00:47:45,747 --> 00:47:47,702
- Right above the epiphysis.
- How bad is it?

540
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:51,984
If we don't set it, he'll die. It won't heal.
He won't be able to pivot on his ankle.

541
00:47:52,266 --> 00:47:55,622
He won't be able to run or walk.
A predator will pick him off.

542
00:47:57,026 --> 00:47:58,618
Carlos, come in.

543
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:01,062
Goddamn it, you bastard, listen...

544
00:48:01,985 --> 00:48:04,021
Other animals are going to hear this.

545
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:06,335
Come in, please. Can you hear me?

546
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,575
I've got to get out of here. I want to leave.

547
00:48:08,665 --> 00:48:11,259
- I'm calling the boat.
- I want to go someplace else.

548
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:13,779
I don't want to be here.
I want to be somewhere safe.

549
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:16,856
- Isn't it safe here?
- I want to be somewhere high.

550
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,261
What? What is it? What's going on?

551
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,462
Information, please. What?

552
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:25,980
You're much happier not knowing.
Get us up. Here we go.

553
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:28,659
There we go.

554
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:33,935
I'm so stupid.
I shouldn't have come along with you.

555
00:48:35,023 --> 00:48:36,012
Can you set it?

556
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:40,494
Yeah, I just need something temporary
to break apart and fall off as he grows.

557
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,341
Whenever you're ready.
He's fighting, Dr. Quinn.

558
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:50,852
What's the frequency for the boat?

559
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:53,331
15888. Third from the top.

560
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:59,097
Okay, we're high.
This is the safest place you can be.

561
00:48:59,742 --> 00:49:03,575
Like Sarah said, the plants make it
so the animals won't know you're here.

562
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:07,097
You're just saying that.
I remember the stories you told.

563
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:12,331
No, this is nothing like that. We're in
a completely different situation now.

564
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,299
Is there a way to communicate
with the trailer?

565
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,091
He's moving again, more morphine.

566
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,888
We have no idea what his metabolism is.
We'll kill him with too much.

567
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:37,538
I need your hand here.
Put some pressure there.

568
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,092
No answer. What a surprise.
How do I get down?

569
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,331
Tie this belt around you.

570
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:45,297
Where are you going?

571
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:47,529
Stay here. Come on, stay here.

572
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,290
Squeeze this rope hard.

573
00:49:49,378 --> 00:49:51,528
The harder you squeeze, the slower you go.

574
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:54,178
- If you don't squeeze at all-
- I get the idea.

575
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:55,816
Dad, please stay here.

576
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:59,808
- Stay here, please.
- Honey, the queen? The goddess?

577
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:02,650
Your inspiration?

578
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,373
Now you're talking. All right.

579
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:11,575
I'm coming right back. I give you my word.

580
00:50:11,857 --> 00:50:13,734
But you never keep your word!

581
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,610
Personally, I would have squeezed
just a little harder.

582
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:24,727
Okay, I'm almost finished.

583
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:28,611
Damn. I need another adhesive.
Something pliable I can...

584
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,291
Spit.

585
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:37,450
Your gum.

586
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:16,606
Get the amoxicillin and fill a syringe.

587
00:51:16,932 --> 00:51:19,651
Quick injection of antibiotics
and he's out of here.

588
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:27,852
For once in your life,
would it kill you to pick it up?

589
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:31,163
- Help me get it out of here.
- No, we just set its leg.

590
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:38,004
Mommy's very angry.

591
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:55,394
This isn't hunting behaviour, Ian.
They're searching.

592
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:58,237
They came for their infant.

593
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:01,363
Let's not disappoint them.

594
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:05,363
Let me get his head, okay?

595
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:08,043
Careful. Be careful.

596
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:10,844
I got him.

597
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,319
Muzzle off.

598
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,356
<i>- Yes, Eddie?
- They're going back to the jungle.</i>

599
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:58,996
<i>- I know. I see. How's Kelly?
- She's fine. She's right here.</i>

600
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:01,631
Hello?

601
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:04,599
<i>- Kelly, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.</i>

602
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:09,315
<i>Stay there. Don't move.
I'll be right back up. Understand?</i>

603
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:10,954
Yeah, I understand.

604
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,076
I beg people to listen to me.
I use plain, simple English.

605
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,789
Shut up.

606
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,633
That should make an interesting chapter
in your book.

607
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,555
The debate over the parental instincts
of the T. Rex is now academic.

608
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:34,715
Hang on. This is gonna be bad.

609
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:54,868
They're pushing us over the cliff.

610
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,473
Oh, my God.

611
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,316
Come on, come on.

612
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:06,433
- Once we're out of here-
- Into the woods.

613
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:10,305
- Straight into the woods. Come on!
- This is where they hit us.

614
00:55:17,076 --> 00:55:19,544
- Hang on to something!
- Hang on to something!

615
00:55:57,513 --> 00:55:59,663
Oh, my God. Oh, God, please!

616
00:56:05,393 --> 00:56:06,621
Don't move!

617
00:56:07,593 --> 00:56:10,391
I'm coming down for you.
Here I come. Stay still.

618
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:13,185
Here I come, Sarah.

619
00:56:22,032 --> 00:56:23,863
The satellite phone, get it!

620
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:57,342
Give me your hand.

621
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:04,702
Heads up!

622
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:18,142
Your lucky pack.

623
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:25,056
I got her.

624
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:56,822
- Nick?
- We're in here.

625
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:58,901
Wait. Hold on! I'm coming!

626
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:00,780
I'm coming.

627
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,019
What did this?

628
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:11,614
Kelly. What'd you do with Kelly?

629
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:13,900
She's okay. She's in the High Hide.

630
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:17,458
- Who's hurt? What do you need?
- We need rope.

631
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,223
Rope. Anything else?

632
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:22,623
- Three cheeseburgers with everything.
- No onions on mine.

633
00:58:22,704 --> 00:58:24,341
And an apple turnover.

634
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:01,890
Hold on.

635
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,136
I'm coming!

636
00:59:05,821 --> 00:59:07,493
Bring the rope. Let's go.

637
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,138
- I'm coming.
- Now, now.

638
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,928
- Eddie, you all right?
- Yeah. I'm coming.

639
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,688
We need the rope. Throw it down here.
Hurry!

640
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,688
Good throw. Did you tie this to anything?

641
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,333
- We're sliding!
- We're sliding down!

642
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,497
Up you go.

643
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,407
Increase your rate of climb.

644
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,280
Our communication equipment's
been destroyed.

645
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,228
And if your radio and satellite phone
were in those trailers-

646
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,629
- They were.
- Then we're stuck here.

647
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,115
And stuck together, thanks to you people.

648
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,872
We came to watch.
You came to strip-mine the place.

649
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,189
- Back off.
- At least we came prepared.

650
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,870
Five years of work and electrified fence
couldn't prepare the other island.

651
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,078
- You think your Marlboro men will help?
- You're looters. You came to take.

652
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:34,274
You have no rights.

653
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:36,918
An extinct animal brought
back to life has no rights.

654
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,115
It exists because we made it.
We patented it. We own it.

655
01:04:41,398 --> 01:04:44,231
- You looking for a problem?
- And I found you, didn't I?

656
01:04:48,878 --> 01:04:49,992
I know you.

657
01:04:50,757 --> 01:04:52,793
You're that Earth First bastard.

658
01:04:53,077 --> 01:04:55,227
- What's Earth First?
- Professional saboteurs.

659
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:56,670
- Environmentalists!
- Criminals.

660
01:04:56,757 --> 01:04:58,395
Knock it off! Listen to me.

661
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:02,192
Moving the baby to our camp may have
changed the adults' perceived territory.

662
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:03,426
Their what?

663
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:06,230
That's why they attacked the trailers.

664
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:09,752
- They're defending this entire area now.
- We have to move now.

665
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:14,028
To where? Our boat and their airlift
are waiting for orders we can't send.

666
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:19,668
There's a communications centre here
near the old operations building.

667
01:05:19,755 --> 01:05:23,543
Everything ran on geothermal power.
It was never meant to need replenishing.

668
01:05:24,035 --> 01:05:26,947
If we can get here,
we can send a radio call to the airlift.

669
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:30,029
- You know the frequency?
- Here in this book.

670
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:32,669
- We'll mind those.
- How far is the village?

671
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:34,626
A day's walk, maybe more.

672
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:40,429
- That's not the problem.
- What is?

673
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:43,193
What is the problem?

674
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,268
Velociraptors.

675
01:05:50,553 --> 01:05:54,705
Their nesting sites are
in the island's interior, which is why...

676
01:05:55,073 --> 01:05:58,190
- ... we were keeping to the outer rim.
- Wait. What's a Veloc-

677
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:01,071
Velociraptor. Carnivore. Pack hunter.

678
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:03,748
Two meters tall, long snout...

679
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:07,866
...binocular vision, strong forearms,
killing claws on both feet.

680
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:12,589
The Rexes may track us, too,
if they feel we're a threat to their infant.

681
01:06:12,752 --> 01:06:15,789
No, we'll lose them
once we leave their territory.

682
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:19,910
Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has the
largest proportional olfactory cavity...

683
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:22,710
...of any creature in fossil record,
except one.

684
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,627
The Turkey Vulture
could scent up to 10 miles.

685
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:32,068
Right. This is all very thrilling,
but I say we should head for the village.

686
01:06:32,191 --> 01:06:34,420
We could head back down to the lagoon.

687
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,503
And sit out in the open,
near a heavily used water source...

688
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,947
- ... hope that your captain comes back?
- He won't. He knows better.

689
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:45,739
Then we head for the village,
find shelter and call for help.

690
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,703
Rex just fed, so he won't stalk us for food.

691
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:51,701
Just fed? You mean Eddie?
Show some respect.

692
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,099
- He saved our lives by giving his.
- Then his troubles are over.

693
01:06:55,189 --> 01:06:57,908
My point is predators don't hunt
when they're not hungry.

694
01:06:57,989 --> 01:07:00,344
- No, only humans do.
- You're breaking our heart.

695
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:02,863
Saddle up!
Let's get this moveable feast underway.

696
01:07:20,027 --> 01:07:21,426
Excuse me, cowboy.

697
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:24,306
You want some gum?

698
01:07:26,707 --> 01:07:30,177
You seem like you have common sense.
Why the hell are you here?

699
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:35,017
Somewhere on this island
is the greatest predator that ever lived.

700
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:37,825
The second greatest predator
must take him down.

701
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:40,784
- You going to use that?
- If he doesn't surrender, yes.

702
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:42,784
- Let me see it.
- No.

703
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:48,061
The animal exists for the first time
in tens of millions of years...

704
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:51,023
...and the only way you can express
yourself is to kill it.

705
01:07:51,105 --> 01:07:53,983
Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
I forget his name.

706
01:07:54,065 --> 01:07:57,023
Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
Came down nearly dead.

707
01:07:57,305 --> 01:08:00,024
They asked him,
"Why did you go up there to die?"

708
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:02,863
He said, " I didn't. I went up there to live. "

709
01:08:07,904 --> 01:08:11,579
I didn't wish you luck on your new venture.
You're off to a promising start.

710
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:14,462
My team is intact.
I'm sorry for the loss of your man.

711
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:18,736
It's easy to criticise someone
who generates an idea, assumes the risk.

712
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:21,735
When you try to sound like Hammond,
it comes off as a hustle.

713
01:08:21,823 --> 01:08:24,895
It's not your fault.
They say talent skips a generation.

714
01:08:25,343 --> 01:08:27,811
I'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks.

715
01:08:28,143 --> 01:08:31,055
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
Mine does not.

716
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:33,174
Taking dinosaurs off this island...

717
01:08:33,262 --> 01:08:37,016
...is the worst idea in the long,
sad history of bad ideas.

718
01:08:37,102 --> 01:08:39,536
And I'll be there when you learn that.

719
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,176
Take a break. Five minutes.

720
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:27,258
Are you injured?

721
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:34,169
No, it's the baby's. I set its broken leg.
It won't dry in the humidity.

722
01:09:34,298 --> 01:09:36,368
Roland, a word?

723
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:40,133
I'd love to know where we are.

724
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:47,088
Making friends with Ahab?

725
01:10:01,816 --> 01:10:04,091
Carter, I'm going to the ladies' room.

726
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,566
Wait for me here. Okay?

727
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:57,208
It's not polite to sneak up on people.

728
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:19,928
Carter! Where are you?

729
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:26,642
I got turned around in here.

730
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:29,999
Shit!

731
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:33,649
Carter, let me hear from you!

732
01:13:30,722 --> 01:13:32,758
Okay, break's over. Moving on!

733
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:41,836
Carry me.

734
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,108
Get off!

735
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:14,912
- When did you last see him?
-10, 15 minutes.

736
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:20,506
Come with me. And you.
If he's alive, we'll find him.

737
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:24,271
The rest of you go on.
You'll reach the ridge in 10 minutes.

738
01:15:24,515 --> 01:15:25,914
Wait for us there.

739
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:30,951
No one tells the little girl.

740
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:39,026
Right. Let's carry on.

741
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:43,510
Everybody up.

742
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:46,751
Come on. Up, up.

743
01:15:48,193 --> 01:15:50,912
All right guys, let's get the hell out of here.

744
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,022
Did you find him?

745
01:16:46,549 --> 01:16:49,188
Just the parts they didn't like. Map.

746
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:56,057
The operations building
is right down in there...

747
01:16:56,468 --> 01:16:59,266
...about a mile and a half
from the base of these cliffs.

748
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,498
- How do you know that?
- I've seen it.

749
01:17:02,148 --> 01:17:04,025
The climb down won't be easy.

750
01:17:05,348 --> 01:17:07,657
We'll let them sleep one more hour.

751
01:17:09,188 --> 01:17:10,462
Then we hit it.

752
01:19:14,259 --> 01:19:15,408
What is that?

753
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:52,327
Stay down! Don't move!

754
01:19:52,817 --> 01:19:53,726
Don't run!

755
01:20:02,016 --> 01:20:04,007
Don't look, just run! Run!

756
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:19,691
Bastard!

757
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:55,807
You son of a bitch!

758
01:21:56,088 --> 01:21:58,044
He can't reach you! Stay back!

759
01:22:00,288 --> 01:22:01,687
He can't reach us!

760
01:22:13,207 --> 01:22:16,005
Oh, my God! A snake!

761
01:22:16,487 --> 01:22:17,681
Stay back!

762
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:31,315
It's okay.

763
01:22:32,326 --> 01:22:33,725
It's coming back!

764
01:22:37,405 --> 01:22:38,281
Dad!

765
01:22:40,365 --> 01:22:41,400
Thank you.

766
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:56,039
Don't go into the long grass!

767
01:23:01,484 --> 01:23:03,714
Not into the long grass!

768
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,594
Look at this.

769
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,229
- What is it?
- I think it's Ajay's bag.

770
01:24:23,878 --> 01:24:26,346
Go, as fast as you can.

771
01:24:27,878 --> 01:24:28,754
Go!

772
01:24:59,316 --> 01:25:00,954
I see structures there.

773
01:25:02,036 --> 01:25:05,550
They said the communications centre
is in the operations building.

774
01:25:05,635 --> 01:25:09,025
I'll get in there and send the radio call.
See you there.

775
01:25:09,315 --> 01:25:10,907
- Wait for us.
- Every second counts.

776
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:13,065
If you can keep up, you're welcome to try.

777
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:15,510
- Okay, here we come.
- No! Rest.

778
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:14,742
Damn it!

779
01:27:20,346 --> 01:27:24,100
CQ, this is InGen Operations
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.

780
01:27:24,226 --> 01:27:27,138
Repeating, I'm calling
for InGen Harvest Leader...

781
01:27:27,306 --> 01:27:30,742
<i>- ... seeking InGen Harvest Base.
- Go ahead, Harvest Leader.</i>

782
01:27:30,866 --> 01:27:33,299
The operation has suffered
severe casualties.

783
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:37,537
The survivors are now in mortal danger.
I need you to send rescue immediately.

784
01:27:37,705 --> 01:27:40,094
Our co-ordinates here are...

785
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:44,418
...9° 58' north, 85°...

786
01:29:15,019 --> 01:29:16,134
Here, here!

787
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:19,011
Inside! Anywhere!

788
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,279
Go.

789
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:23,402
- Where do I go when I'm out?
- I'm right behind you-

790
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:50,363
Look out!

791
01:31:54,048 --> 01:31:55,322
Up here!

792
01:32:19,526 --> 01:32:20,515
Hey, you!

793
01:32:40,405 --> 01:32:42,282
The school cut you from the team?

794
01:32:42,365 --> 01:32:43,684
Get out of here!

795
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,152
Come on. Let's go!

796
01:34:06,839 --> 01:34:08,636
Let's go!

797
01:34:30,877 --> 01:34:34,028
- What about the other survivors?
- Another chopper's coming.

798
01:34:52,476 --> 01:34:54,034
It's okay. It's over.

799
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:59,073
That's one souvenir
they won't be taking with them.

800
01:35:07,515 --> 01:35:09,346
Find the infant tyrannosaur.

801
01:35:09,515 --> 01:35:12,552
Roland knows where the nest is.
I want it on my jet.

802
01:35:13,034 --> 01:35:16,026
I'll take it directly to the infirmary
in San Diego.

803
01:35:16,674 --> 01:35:20,030
Hurry. I want to be airborne
before the female knows.

804
01:35:27,593 --> 01:35:29,265
You probably saved InGen.

805
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:31,828
We lost everything
we came after on this trip.

806
01:35:31,913 --> 01:35:34,905
But this animal
and its infant will bail us out.

807
01:35:35,193 --> 01:35:36,512
Congratulations.

808
01:35:37,073 --> 01:35:38,711
You've got your trophy!

809
01:35:39,113 --> 01:35:40,148
A buck.

810
01:35:40,953 --> 01:35:45,264
But it's alive! Everyone will line up
and appreciate it and what you did for us.

811
01:35:47,192 --> 01:35:48,591
What's the matter?

812
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:50,788
He didn't make it. Ajay.

813
01:35:52,072 --> 01:35:53,266
I'm sorry.

814
01:35:54,272 --> 01:35:55,830
Really, I am.

815
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:01,621
I remember the people who help me.

816
01:36:01,831 --> 01:36:04,425
There's a job for you in San Diego,
if you want it.

817
01:36:04,511 --> 01:36:05,705
No, thank you.

818
01:36:07,991 --> 01:36:10,630
I've spent enough time
in the company of death.

819
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,019
Oh, my God.

820
01:37:23,626 --> 01:37:26,139
<i>Fifteen years ago,
John Hammond had a dream.</i>

821
01:37:26,825 --> 01:37:31,057
<i>Like John himself, the dream was grand.
It was outsized. It was bold.</i>

822
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:34,143
<i>It was impractical. It was not to be.</i>

823
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:36,383
Half an hour from now...

824
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:39,782
...John Hammond's dream,
re-imagined, will come true.

825
01:37:40,705 --> 01:37:44,458
For. 01 of the cost
of building a destination resort...

826
01:37:45,464 --> 01:37:47,182
Is this the Ludlow affair?

827
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,255
- This is private property.
- We're on the list.

828
01:37:49,344 --> 01:37:50,857
Turn around, get back in your car.

829
01:37:50,944 --> 01:37:54,493
- This is Dr. Harding, I'm Dr. Malcolm.
- We have Mr. Ludlow's test results.

830
01:37:54,784 --> 01:37:56,262
There's good and bad news.

831
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:59,103
Tonight we will christen
Jurassic Park, San Diego...

832
01:37:59,183 --> 01:38:02,220
...a mega-attraction
that will drive turnstile numbers...

833
01:38:02,303 --> 01:38:04,658
...to rival any theme park in the world.

834
01:38:08,463 --> 01:38:12,421
I want to thank each one of you for coming
in these wee small hours of the morning.

835
01:38:13,822 --> 01:38:16,290
- The ship is here.
- It's early?

836
01:38:17,622 --> 01:38:19,101
You better come now.

837
01:38:21,022 --> 01:38:22,375
It's so exciting!

838
01:38:24,302 --> 01:38:26,690
- See that couple?
- Sir, you need to look at this.

839
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:28,533
Let them see this up close.

840
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:34,010
I need a direct line to the Coast Guard.

841
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:38,291
Look. That's their transponder signal,
Venture 5888.

842
01:38:39,021 --> 01:38:42,057
- They're coming in, but I can't raise them.
- Try again.

843
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:47,098
Skipper, SS Venture, this is InGen
Harbour Master. Do you copy? Over.

844
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:53,089
Skipper, SS Venture, you are approaching
the breakwater at flank speed.

845
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,613
Reduce at once. Over.

846
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:11,133
SS Venture, reduce your speed at once.

847
01:39:11,218 --> 01:39:15,496
SS Venture, this is InGen Harbour Master.
You are entering a docking area.

848
01:39:16,298 --> 01:39:18,050
What's everybody looking at?

849
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,050
We should've stayed in the car.

850
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:17,612
- You okay, Mr. Ludlow?
- I don't know. How do I look?

851
01:40:48,972 --> 01:40:50,928
- Oh, my God.
- Where's the crew?

852
01:40:52,892 --> 01:40:54,324
All over the place.

853
01:41:04,571 --> 01:41:06,050
I smell a fuel leak!

854
01:41:41,648 --> 01:41:43,127
Check the cargo hold!

855
01:41:43,688 --> 01:41:46,998
- There may be crew down there.
- Everybody off the boat!

856
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:56,365
No! Get away from that!

857
01:42:28,805 --> 01:42:30,443
Now you're John Hammond.

858
01:42:59,603 --> 01:43:03,642
- Why wasn't it tranquillised?
- It was hit it with two darts of Carfentanil.

859
01:43:03,723 --> 01:43:06,112
- It was over 10 milligrams.
- That'd put it in a coma.

860
01:43:06,203 --> 01:43:08,921
It stopped breathing.
We gave it naltrexone to counteract.

861
01:43:09,002 --> 01:43:10,117
But we didn't know how much.

862
01:43:10,202 --> 01:43:12,716
You gave an antagonist
without knowing the dosage?

863
01:43:12,802 --> 01:43:15,555
You put it in a narcoleptic state.
It's a locomotive now.

864
01:43:15,642 --> 01:43:18,440
- We're prepared here.
- Any more dinosaurs on the boat?

865
01:43:18,522 --> 01:43:21,832
No, the infant was flown in.
We had this to tranquillise it.

866
01:43:26,521 --> 01:43:28,159
Do you have the infant?

867
01:43:29,881 --> 01:43:30,996
It's safe.

868
01:43:34,921 --> 01:43:37,832
The animal's dehydrated.
First, it'll go to a water source...

869
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,559
...then look for the next thing
its body needs.

870
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,639
All the containment equipment is here.
We must get it back to the boat.

871
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,312
I know what you're gonna say.

872
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,834
When we brought the baby to the trailer,
it came.

873
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:52,195
There's no reason why it won't do
the same thing here.

874
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,152
Where's the infant?

875
01:44:01,159 --> 01:44:03,150
In a secured facility. Why?

876
01:44:06,398 --> 01:44:07,911
Where's the facility?

877
01:45:29,233 --> 01:45:31,349
There's a dinosaur in our backyard.

878
01:45:37,632 --> 01:45:39,509
Benjamin, what are you doing?

879
01:45:39,712 --> 01:45:41,145
What are you doing?

880
01:45:41,952 --> 01:45:42,782
What?

881
01:45:44,032 --> 01:45:46,546
Come on. There's a dinosaur
in our backyard.

882
01:45:47,032 --> 01:45:49,500
The problem is, you need to read to him.

883
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:54,071
If you serve him dinner,
he won't be up all night.

884
01:45:54,151 --> 01:45:55,823
It's the stupid fish tank!

885
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:58,300
He needs a proper nightlight.

886
01:45:58,391 --> 01:46:01,463
- It may as well be daytime.
- Just turn it off.

887
01:46:22,269 --> 01:46:24,146
Slow down. Slow it down!

888
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:48,417
There it is.

889
01:46:55,027 --> 01:46:56,221
He's sedated.

890
01:46:58,347 --> 01:47:01,578
Really heavily. Give me a hand.

891
01:47:04,786 --> 01:47:08,779
When the adult sees us again
with his baby, isn't he going to be like:

892
01:47:08,866 --> 01:47:09,901
" You!"

893
01:47:11,026 --> 01:47:14,382
There may be some angry recognition.

894
01:47:15,866 --> 01:47:18,664
Who knows?
He may be just happy to see us.

895
01:47:19,465 --> 01:47:21,376
What the hell are you doing?

896
01:47:22,985 --> 01:47:24,498
We're taking the kid.

897
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:28,018
If you really want to stop us, shoot us.

898
01:47:29,825 --> 01:47:32,783
- How will we find the adult?
- Follow the screams.

899
01:48:50,259 --> 01:48:52,056
- There.
- Oh, my God.

900
01:49:05,418 --> 01:49:06,487
It's too drugged.

901
01:49:06,578 --> 01:49:09,172
He won't know we have it
unless it makes some sound!

902
01:49:09,258 --> 01:49:11,453
Wake up. Come on.

903
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:20,212
He knows.

904
01:49:35,496 --> 01:49:37,293
Ian, slow down a little.

905
01:49:39,336 --> 01:49:40,689
I don't think so.

906
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:03,450
This guy's almost fully awake.
You know where you're going?

907
01:50:04,574 --> 01:50:07,247
The waterfront's on the other side
of these warehouses.

908
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:10,371
- Is there a way through?
- There could be.

909
01:50:16,294 --> 01:50:17,408
There we go.

910
01:50:20,173 --> 01:50:21,891
You have to follow me now.

911
01:50:21,973 --> 01:50:23,167
There we go.

912
01:50:24,013 --> 01:50:25,492
- Got him?
- Yep.

913
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:30,211
- Ready?
- Where's the Rex? Is it still behind us?

914
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,281
There's the water.

915
01:50:39,372 --> 01:50:41,886
Shoot it. Tell them to shoot it.

916
01:50:46,372 --> 01:50:50,683
No, you idiot, the adult. Shoot the adult.
I want the baby back alive.

917
01:51:22,249 --> 01:51:24,604
What have you done with it?
I want that infant!

918
01:51:55,087 --> 01:51:56,361
Are you there?

919
01:52:25,885 --> 01:52:27,204
There you are.

920
01:54:51,995 --> 01:54:55,146
<i>There's a first-rate shot
of the deck of the ship...</i>

921
01:54:55,395 --> 01:54:57,989
<i>...and the cargo hold that,
for the moment...</i>

922
01:54:58,075 --> 01:55:02,067
<i>...contains the animal itself,
presumably with the infant alongside.</i>

923
01:55:02,594 --> 01:55:07,031
<i>By our calculations, they are nearing
the halfway point of this trip.</i>

924
01:55:07,114 --> 01:55:09,184
<i>Jim, can you hear me there?</i>

925
01:55:09,834 --> 01:55:12,746
<i>Yes, I can, Bernard.
We are halfway to the island.</i>

926
01:55:12,834 --> 01:55:16,030
<i>It is 206 nautical miles
from our present location.</i>

927
01:55:16,113 --> 01:55:17,910
<i>The ship is moving at 20 knots...</i>

928
01:55:17,993 --> 01:55:21,144
<i>...which will put it in at about 11:30 a. m.,
Eastern time.</i>

929
01:55:21,233 --> 01:55:24,509
<i>One of the Navy's primary concerns
has been safety.</i>

930
01:55:24,713 --> 01:55:27,864
<i>If we look at the ever-growing escort
around the ship...</i>

931
01:55:28,033 --> 01:55:31,661
<i>...they're taking no chances of a repeat
of the San Diego incident.</i>

932
01:55:32,232 --> 01:55:35,269
<i>Let's take a moment to run the tape...</i>

933
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:38,264
<i>...of our interview earlier today
with John Hammond.</i>

934
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:41,265
<i>He's the former head
of InGen BioEngineering...</i>

935
01:55:41,392 --> 01:55:44,030
<i>...the man who is now spearheading
this movement...</i>

936
01:55:44,111 --> 01:55:46,671
<i>...not only to return the animals
to their island...</i>

937
01:55:46,751 --> 01:55:49,265
<i>...but to keep the island itself intact.</i>

938
01:55:50,271 --> 01:55:53,229
<i>It is absolutely imperative...</i>

939
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:57,943
<i>...that we work with the Costa Rican
Department of Biological Preserves...</i>

940
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:00,100
<i>...to establish a set of rules...</i>

941
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:04,379
<i>...for the preservation and isolation
of that island.</i>

942
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:11,501
<i>These creatures require our absence
to survive, not our help.</i>

943
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:15,506
<i>And if we could only step aside...</i>

944
01:56:17,309 --> 01:56:18,981
<i>...and trust in nature...</i>

945
01:56:20,069 --> 01:56:22,378
<i>...life will find a way.</i>
