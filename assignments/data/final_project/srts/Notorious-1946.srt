1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,561
Where you gonna be 10 years from now?

3
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,723
Ten years from now,
where do I wanna be?

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:39,169
I wanna be... just living, man.
Just living comfortably with my wife, you know.

5
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,503
Just layin' back. Just chilling.
You know what I'm saying? Living.

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,511
Where do I think I'll be in 10 years?

7
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,845
I don't think I'll be seeing it, dog, for real, man.
I don't think my luck is that good.

8
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,647
I hope it is, but if it ain't,
so be it. I'm ready.

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,725
¶ Come on, hah, sicker than your average poppa ¶

10
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,858
¶ Twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink ¶

11
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,868
¶ Pink gators

12
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,564
- Puffy! Congratulations!
- ¶ Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn ¶

13

¶ Dead right, if they head right

14
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,867
¶ Poppa been smooth
since days of Underoos ¶

15
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,811
Can't wait for the new al bum, man.
Congratulations.

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,784
Yeah!

17
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,021
Yo, Big, let's change the world.

18
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,190
Let's roll. Let's roll, y'all.

19
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,198
You needa real man.

20
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,537
- We back, baby. We back!
- No doubt.

21
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,806
We back on top, baby!

22
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,685
- Yo, what's up, ma?
- What's up?

23
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,516
You looking fine.
I'm going to have to get your number.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,920
I don't know.
What's up with you?

25
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,727
In the beginning...

26
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,160
God gave me a clean slate.

27
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,034
But where I grew up,
I knew I couldn't stay clean.

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,044
If you was a nice, ordinary kid...

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,014
you was an easy mark for the wanna be gangsters
and cutthroat girls in the school yard.

30
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,209
- You wanna check out this magazine?
- Right on. Let's go.

31
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,310
Fab 5 Freddy. There we go.

32
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,754
Kurtis Blow, man!
He's the man! You know-

33
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:43,022
¶ Clap your hands, everybody
lf you got what it takes ¶

34
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,566
¶ 'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow
and I want you to know that these are the breaks ¶

35
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,567
¶ Break it up, break it up
break it up ¶

36
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,398
- There we go.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,870
I know.

38
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,498
Y'all want our autograph?
We gonna be in a magazine one day.

39
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,941
Chris Shy-ass can't be in no magazine.

40
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,240
He's too fat, black and ugly.

41
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,284
At least there ain't
no train tracks in my mouth.

42
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,289
What do I tell you?
If you just pay attention...

43
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,555
you study hard, always do your best
and look what happens.

44
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,358
A hundred percent!

45
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,695
- I'm proud of you, Chrissy-poo.
- Don't call me that!

46
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,134
Oh, I forgot.
You're all grown-up now, huh?

47
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,639
My moms was from a small town in Jamaica...

48
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,301
where they left the doors
unlocked at night.

49
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,039
But in our neighborhood,
the only time she let me off the stoop...

50
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,081
was when she walked me home from school.

51
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,585
We've seen that 12, 13 times.
Don't you wanna see something different?

52
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,214
This was Brooklyn. Do-or-die Bed-Stuy.

53
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,384
And there was just some shit
Moms couldn't protect me from.

54
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,195
Voletta.

55
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:01,430
Christopher, say hello to your father.

56
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,077
Sugar?

57
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,422
A hundred dollars.

58
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,494
Is that all he's worth to you?

59
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,758
Are you even planning on
being in his life?

60
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,494
- Thin gs are complicated.
- Things?

61
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,502
I feel like if you and I could just...

62
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,371
It was easy to lie about your wife.

63
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,104
Now, when it comes to your child,
"things"are complicated.

64
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,341
Bye, Voletta.

65
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,680
You for got something.

66
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,833
What's up, y'all?

67
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,960
This is Super Rocking
Mr. Magic holding it down.

68
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,539
This is DJ Marley Marl.
- Check it out, y'all.

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,541
- It's all the way live.

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,342
He ain't coming back, is he?

71
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,885
No. I don't believe so.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,982
Good. I'm glad.

73
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,323
Oh.

74
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,388
Come here.

75
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,642
We're gonna be all right, just you and me.

76
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,404
¶ You ain't no pops to me ¶

77
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,348
¶ You just some nigga
sipping on tea ¶

78
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,252
¶ Moms don't want your money
so run and flee ¶

79
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,685
Flee...

80
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,558
¶ Back all hunched over
'cause you gotta admit ¶

81
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,359
¶ I don't need you in my life
'cause you ain't shit ¶¶

82
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,047
Right then and there...

83
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,243
I decided to stop being
that little kid on the stoop.

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,789
I knew life was a fucked-up game...

85
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,631
and I knew D Roc was fucked up enough
to show me how to play.

86
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,363
- What's up, D Roc?
- What up, big boy?

87
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,172
- Your mama finally let you out the house?
- Told you I would come.

88
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,939
- I ain't on lockdown like that.
- So you ready to be a big baller?

89
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,514
What I gotta do?

90
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,313
Remember, just act like
you slapping the nigga five.

91
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,517
¶ Five, six
One, one, two, two, three ¶

92
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,857
¶ Four, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five ¶

93
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,089
The phone is ringing.

94
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,097
Motherfuckers got
addicted to crack after they first hit...

95
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,734
but I got addicted to money
after my first sale.

96
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:31,477
By the time I was 17,,
I wasn't no ordinary kid. I was paid.

97
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,779
Christopher, you're not still
lying in that bed, are you?

98
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,944
No.

99
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,022
Christopher, what are you doing?

100
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,150
You saying your prayers?

101
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,160
Praying that God teaches you how to knock.

102
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,992
Please. Don't you mock your prayers.

103
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,032
You don't think Jehovah
has a sense of humor?

104
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,730
He must have, if he made you.

105
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,707
We always gotta listen
to this corny old country music?

106
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,506
I happen to like this music.
They tell good stories.

107
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,980
So, who were you yappin'
on the phone with last night?

108
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,914
Jan.

109
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,680
It's perfectly normal
for a mother to feel jealous...

110
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,688
when her son cares about another female.

111
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,190
Oh, for crying out loud!

112
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,987
By the way, Ma...

113
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,994
- What?
- How much does a garbage collector make?

114
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,394
I think about 28,000 a year. Why?

115
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,696
- No reason.
- Would you hurry up before you make us both late for class?

116
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,997
- Hey, Voletta. Is that the new Watchtower?
- Of course.

117
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,372
We gonna see you this weekend, right?

118
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,344
¶ "W" for Wallace

122

¶ Wax 'em and buff'em

124
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,695
Shit!

125
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,812
You need to add 3X to the other side.

126
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,584
Now, you need to solve the problem for X.
Who wants to come up and do that?

127
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,795
Come on up, Mr. Wallace.

128
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,472
7X equals 84...

129
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,941
then 12 equals X.

130
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,973
Impressive. You're actually
smarter than you look.

131
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,846
- Ooh!
- Mr. Webber.

132
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,080
- Yesterday you said I was gonna end up a garbageman.
- That's right.

133
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,315
Lf you keep cutting class,
that's exactly what you'll become.

134
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:58,460
Well, I found out a teacher
makes 24,000 a year...

135
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,967
and a garbageman makes 28,000 a year.

136
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:08,371
I'm gonna make $4,000 more
than his dumb ass.

137
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,999
All right. Get out.

138
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,338
Hey! Get out of my class.

139
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,894
Thanks for meeting up.

140
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,331
You know you got it like that.

141
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,369
When my moms see that phone bill,
she gonna kill me.

142
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,635
We gotta chill with all that wild-ass phone sex.

143
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,875
Um-

144
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,142
I'm pregnant.

145
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,253
I went to the doctor and everything.

146
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,925
We gonna have a baby.

147
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,831
- Damn.
- Damn?

148
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,205
Is that it? I was half way hoping
you was gonna be happy.

149
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,935
But if this fucks up your world,
then I'm sorry.

150
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,069
Whoa, whoa.
Jan, hold up. Sit down, baby.

151
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,079
What you talking about?
Sit down.

152
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,877
What's wrong with you?

153
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,285
If you're carrying my seed,
it means you are my world.

154
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,585
- You're not sitting there thinking, "Oh, fuck"?
- No, I'm not.

155
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,461
- You know I got you.
- You got me?

156
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,696
No doubt.

157
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,238
Come here.

158
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,105
Oh, fuck.

159
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,145
- What's up, D Roc?
- Yo, what up's, son?

160
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,725
You okay?

161
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,954
Yeah, I'm all right.

162
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,054
Let's get this money then.

163
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,429
Me and D Roc were like factory workers...

164
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,596
and Fulton Street
was the assembly line.

165
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,008
¶ Here we go ¶

166
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,777
But every now and then,
D Roc would say, "Yo, can I get a rhyme?"

167
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,547
See, drug dealing was like my wife.

168
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,713
Rapping was just some chick on the side.

169
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,350
Before I knew it, word got out
a bout my skills and shit.

170
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,485
Then this kid named Primo
called me out.

171
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,032
Everyone was jocking him,
'cause he never lost a battle.

172
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,660
It was one thing to rhyme for your boys,
but it was another to battle.

173
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,005
- ' Bout time you stopped running.
- ' Bout time your ass stopped talking shit.

174
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,643
- Yeah. That's Chris.
- Come on, man.

175
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,475
Get out ofhere. Y'all got big

176
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,982
This what y'all wanna see? Huh?
Y'all wanna see me and big boy?

177
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,212
We got MC quest out here.
That's what- MC Quest.

178
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,618
Come on, man. Y'all know
who the king of Fulton is.

179
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,623
Hey, deejay, play me something nice, man.

180
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,625
All right. Do it.

181
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,161
I 'm gonna get some barbecue chicken
when I'm done with big boy.

182
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,356
You sure you don't want
no barbecue chicken?

183
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,956
¶ Now let me tell you a little story

193
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,818
Man, get this fool out of here.
You can't be serious, man.

194
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,223
Let's do it though, kid.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,764

- Yo, that was hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.

216
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,548
Get him downtown.

217
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,624
Primo. Who the hell is that?

218
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,497
What's up, Mom Dukes?

219
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:08,138
So I was by Fulton Records and I thought,
"What would make Slim happy??"

220
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,300
So I bought you the corniest
country album I could find.

221
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,914
In the last month,
you have missed 20 days of school.

222
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,484
All right. Look.
I tried, Ma.

223
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,786
I missed a few days.
But I went back three weeks straight.

224
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,757
Then three people came to
my class on career day:

225
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,125
A computer technician,
a store owner, a doctor...

226
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,257
- and they all looked like poor, broke-down niggas.
- You watch your mouth.

227
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,699
I can't see myself going to
school to end up like them...

228
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,703
'cause I got something to do right now.

229
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,500
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

230
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,132
Jan's pregnant.
I'm gonna be a father.

231
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,278
Please tell me that you are not that stupid.

232
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,649
Why would you even say
something like that?

233
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,484
Because you are still a damn boy.

234
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,024
Is this why you think
I came to the States-

235
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,324
So I can spend all my days
taking care of you, feeding you?

236
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,889
Cleaning up old plates of mashed potatoes
you leave underyour bed?

237
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,094
- What?
- You can't take care of your self.

238
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,831
- How are you gonna take care of a baby?
- What did you do with it?

239
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,136
- Where's the plate?
- I threw it in the trash. It was disgusting.

240
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,336
It's my work, man.

241
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,075
- What are you doing?
- Those wasn't no damn mashed potatoes, all right?

242
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,918
Look at me.
I said, "Look at me."

243
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,421
Are you telling me
what I think you're telling me?

244
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:45,763
Boy, you gonna end up like those
worthless bums you hang with.

245
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,171
- Don't you see that?
- Bums don't have chains, and boys don't have money. I'm a man.

246
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,040
You think that makes you a man?

247
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,748
Get out.

248
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,879
- Ma.
- Get out.

249
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,296
¶ The fuck is goin'on ¶

250
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,775
I wasn't the man my moms wanted me to be.

251
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,780
So fuck it. I was gonna be
the man I needed to be.

252
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,077
¶ When I die, fuck it
I wanna go to hell ¶

253
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,709

256
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,984
¶ God will pro bably have me

257
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,030
- ¶ No sleepin' all day ¶
- What up, baby?

258
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,099
- What up, man?
- Yo! What up, Chris?

259
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,134
I 'm telling you, Lil' Cee,
the corner ain't no place for you.

260
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,100
Yo, man. I'm just chilling.
That's all.

261
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,297
Yo, D!
Yo, D. Come here.

262
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,637
- Hell.

263
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,577
Does this look like a Lamaze class to you?
Hey, yo, Sandy, take your ass home.

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,274
- Come on!

265
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,147
¶ She don't even love me like she did

266
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,243

267
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,653

268
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,352
¶ For give me for my disrespect
For give me for my lies ¶

269
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,022
- ¶ My baby mother's eight months Her little sister's two ¶
- Thanks, black man.

270
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,464

273
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,466
Yo! You selling crack
to someone who's pregnant.

274
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,338
Fuck a pregnant bitch.
I ain't get in this game to be no social worker.

275
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,344
¶ A worthless fuckin' buddha-head ¶

276
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,610
I got tired of that
nickel-and-dime shit, so I stepped up my game.

277
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,981
¶ I feel like death is fuckin' callin'me ¶

280
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,387
I had four young cats out on the streets.

281
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,030
Look at you, man.
All grown up and shit.

282
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,533
Shut the fuck up and get back by the door.

283
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,628
I wasn't hanging with
my boys, wasn't messing with no chicks.

284
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,731
I was too busy counting paper.

285
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,972
But I was moving too fucking fast and I slipped up.

286
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,584
You have a collect call from

287
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,176
Christopher Wallace.

288
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,017
an inmate at the Wake County Jail.

289
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,358
Ma.

290
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,826
Damn you, Christopher.

291
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,160
I fucked up.
I need your help.

292
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:32,260
No. You got your self into this mess.
You get your self out.

293
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,362
I can't ask you to pray for me?

294
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,941
I never stop praying for you.

295
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,808
But you need to stop wasting God's time
and pray for your self.

296
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,519
Close your eyes, Christopher.

297
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,284
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

298
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,055
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

299
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,531
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

300
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,093
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

301
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,438
Thoupreparest a table
before me in the presence of mine enemies.

302
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,341
My cup runneth over.

303
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,381
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
all the days of my life.

304
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:21,043
You got your self
into this mess. You get your self out.

305
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,348
That was the first time in my life I thought...

306
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,787
if i was dead,
my fucking problems would go away.

307
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,458
I started rhyming 'cause I was bored.
Plain and simple.

308
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,000
But then my frustrations turned into rhymes,
and those rhymes told my story.

309
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,901
¶ The 23 rd Psal m was what
my moms had to offer ¶

310
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:46,537
¶ No collection plate
to make hard time feel softer ¶

311
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,676
¶ I know how it feels
to wake up fucked up ¶

312
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,445
¶ Pockets broke as hell
Another rock to sell ¶

313
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,421
¶ I got P-A -l-D
That's why my moms hates me ¶

314

322
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,707

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,189
Here.

326

No, no, no, no. Like this.

327
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,767
Hmm.

328
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,071
What's wrong, Ma?
She ain't that ugly.

329
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,077
Chris!

330
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,876
Mmm.

331
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,351
- Hey, what's going on?
- Chris?

332
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,122
You be a great father.

333
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,963
No doubt. No doubt, Ma.

334
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,029
Yo, what's up?

335
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,729
Hey. Look who's back, man.

336
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,968
Oh, shoot! Yo, it's Chris, man.
What's up, Chris?

337
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,306
- What you doing down here, man?
- I'm chilling. I'm chilling.

338
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,312
Holding niggas down in here, man.

339
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,882
- You know he a pop now, right?
- Word! Are you a pop?

340
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,951
- Yeah.
- Yo, what you got, a boy or girl?

341
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,385
- Little girl.
- Wow. Thank God she look like her mother.

342
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,981
- You know Mister Cee right here.
- What's up, dog? How are you?

343
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,152
Hey, yo, Big. I hope you remember
how to smoke one of these.

344
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,753
It's what I do, man.
Keep this out your hand.

345
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,390
That's for grown folks, man.

346
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,069
- Give me that shit.
- Hey, yo. Now that you out, what you gonna do?

347
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,939
Having a daughter
made me want to be a different kind of cat.

348
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,341
Got a little shorty I gotta support,
you know what I'm saying?

349
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,609
But not being able to
support her felt like a whole other kind of jail.

350
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,412
- Me and D Roc gonna hold it down like we always did.
- Hell, yeah.

351
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,333
Come on.

352
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,775

360
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,724
- Biggie Smalls.
- Biggie Smalls, huh?

361

So you don't get it twisted,
I'm not a gainst making money.

410
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,849
My business is about the streets,
but my business ain't in the streets.

411
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,522
And I can't be building nothing around no artist
that can get locked up any minute.

412
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,499
I'm saying, if you got real paper coming my way,
I'm out the game.

413
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,728
Don't chase the paper.
Chase the dream!

414
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:23,035
I started off as Andre Harrell's assistant.
Now I'm damn near running this place.

415
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:28,340
Nigga, I'm hungry! You can throw me butt-naked
in the jungle, and I'll come out with a...

416
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,746
with a chinchilla coat, a leopard hat
and 10 pounds heavier from eating them niggas.

417
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,820
With all due respect, Puff,
dreams ain't paying the bills, G.

418
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,319
His do.

419
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,947
Puffy, I don't know about a chinchilla...

420
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,152
but if you throw me out to the jungle,
I'll have them motherfuckers dancing.

421
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:51,097
Maybe in the right hands, I could be,
like, one of the greatest.

422
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,035
Hmm.

423
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,575
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

424
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,440
By the time you 21,
I'll make you into a millionaire.

425
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,177
We can change the world, Biggie Smalls.
We can change this game.

426
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,083
Saying the West Coast-
They got Snoop, they got Dre, they got Cube.

427
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,283
They killing it. The East Coast just
waitin' for somebody to fill that void.

428
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,256
The decision is yours.

429
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,123
You can be the average
nigga from Brooklyn...

430
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,128
or you can rap about
the average nigga from Brooklyn.

431
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,131
You gotta let me know whether
it's the streets or the studio.

432
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,235
So you in?

433
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,914
What's up, big mama?

434
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,318
What'd you just call me?

435
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,445
Big mama.

436
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,591
You looking damn good.
How's work today?

437
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,457
Every day you ask me how I'm doing.
What's that about?

438
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,624
- It's 'cause I care. Know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, right.

439
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,634
What ever you say, big poppa.

440
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,670
You got a smart-ass mouth.

441
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,705
You gonna do something about it?

442
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,809
I ain't think so.

443
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,745
Hold up.

444
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,187
You wanna get something to eat?

445
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,655
Fuck. Oh, I like it.

446
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,527
Oh, shit, Big.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

447
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,501
Oh, damn. I want you
to get on top of me, Big.

448
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,504

Oh, it feels so good, big poppa.

450
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,941
Oh. Oh. Oh!

451
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,787
You seein' anybody?

452
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,189
Kind oflate to be asking.

453
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,465
Well, I was seeing someone.

454
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,135
He kept thinkin'
we was in a Mike Tyson fight.

455
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,910
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you no more.
I got you, all right?

456
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,653
Oh, shit.
We got Puff out, huh?

457
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,158
Been out here waiting for y'all asses.

458
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,820
What's up, man?

459
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,865
- What's up, Big?
- What's up?

460
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,402
Andre said there only can be
one lion in the jungle.

461
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,768
The fuck you talking 'bout?

462
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,771
I got fired, Big.

463
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,007
So what about my deal?

464
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,943
You really had my ass goin'.

465
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,045
Just didn't know
it was all fucking bullshit.

466
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,149
Only thing I got lined up is some-
some college shows.

467
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,128
It's gonna be a minute
before I get something real.

468
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,028
Hey, Big.

469
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:12,432
My father died hustling on these streets
when I was two years old.

470
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,963
Ain't no future in this right here.

471
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,236
Just because we got knocked down,
don't mean we can't get back up.

472
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,413
What don't break a nigga make a nigga.

473
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,361
I thought I hada record deal, and now
I can't even buy fuckin' diapers for T'yanna.

474
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,797
Gotta punch the clock and shit.

475
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,995
- I thought you told Puff you gonna stop hustling, man.
- I thought I was.

476
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,270
- Oh, shit.
- Shit!

477
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,815
Yo, toss that! Toss that!

478
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,590
We got another one.
He's heading to Saint Mark's.

479
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,862
There's no where to go.

480
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,633
Let's do this the easy way, huh?

481
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,040
Show me your hands.
Come on, show me your hands.

482
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,478
You show me your hands,
I'll put the piece away.

483
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,352
You know, when I was a kid...

484
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,015
you had a switchblade, brass knuckles,
you were a bad dude.

485
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,524
Now you got 13-year-olds
looking to shoot the big niggers...

486
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,561
on the corner so they could start
running shit themselves.

487
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,857
I mean, what the fuck
is the world coming to...

488
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,956
when a drug dealer can't
walk the streets at night?

489
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,628
Tell me, Chris, what do you put on first?

490
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,331
Your socks, your jacket, your piece?

491
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,169
I ain't never saw that gun before.

492
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,205
- So then it must be yours.
- Nah.

493
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,682
Okay, one of you is goin' down
for carrying an illegal firearm.

494
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,514
Which ever one it is, I don't give a shit.
But there's no way...

495
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,521
that the two of you
are walkin' out of here.

496
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,728
I give you one minute.

497
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:28,928
- He just trying to make us sweat.
- Yo, we play hardball with him, he's gonna dust it for prints.

498
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,838
- We'll cross that bridge when we get there.
- No, by then it i'll be too late.

499
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:38,011
Look, y-you got priors.
You're looking at five or six years, easy.

500
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:43,253
If l plead guilty, I get three and a day.

501
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,484
- No, D Roc. My gun, my bid.
- No, man. That's bullshit.

502
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,459
Look, this music shit you got going on...

503
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,791
It don't come around every fuckin' day.

504
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,424
When a motherfucker like you make it,
we all make it.

505
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,460
- What if I don't make it?
- Listen.

506
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,540
I told you how to get into the drug game.

507
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,337
Now I'm telling you
how to get the fuck out.

508
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,969
You don't have a record deal?
Then go out and get one.

509
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,980
But you're not going back on the block.

510
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,307
Not when you got the skills
to do something...

511
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,751
and not if I take this bid for your ass.

512
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,256
So you're gonna make it.

513
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,256
So?

514
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,662
I put my socks on first, motherfucker.

515
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,236
Okay.

516
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,948
Go ahead. Take a walk.

517
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,566
Big, what's going on?
You good?

518
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,693
Look, Mark, I 'm gonna be

519
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,328
This is my motherfucking life,

520
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,839
I feel like I'm stuck in the mud, yo.

521
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,842
Tell Puff l'm down with chasing the dream.

522
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,936
Whatever he want me to do, I'm in.
But this shit gotta jump off now.

523
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,642
I'm gonna tell Puff.

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,994
Now here I was
walking into a party with him.

597
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,594
It was crazy. Females were ready
to jump out their clothes to get at him.

598
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,140
- Yo, man.
- And all the brothers gave him mad respect.

599
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,905
What's up, baby?
When you starting out, that's the best time.

600
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,947
'Cause as soon as you get on top,
that's when the shit start.

601
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,016
I figured if it was this good starting out...

602
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:23,018
then being as large as Pac
must be the shit.

603
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,588
Catch you later, Big.

604
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,861
You see that fine-ass girl over there?

605
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,865
Which one?

606
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,765
Right over there.

607

00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,664
I ain't gonna laugh at you.

Damn, shorty.
I'm loving that.

639
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,706
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

640
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,719
- What else you love?
- Mmm. I love it when you call me Big Poppa.

641
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,583
- I don't understand what you're doing.
- I am being a man.

642
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,818
You're coming in here
all hours of the night.

643
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,157
- Jan's calling me.
- Me and Jan ain't even kicking it.

644
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,356
You breaking up with your daughter too?
You too busy hanging out to go see her.

645
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,365
I'm not hanging out.
I'm working.

646
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,027
And I'm starting to question
what this job really is.

647
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,037
Puff got it all lined up.

648
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,098
What kind of man, grown-ass man,
calls himself "Puffy"?

649
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,109
That's just absolutely ridiculous.

650
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,543
- Puffy doesn't even have a job himself.
- It's not even like that.

651
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,081
- It's not like what? It's not like what?
- Jesus.

652
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,583
- What isn't it like, huh?
- Excuse me, Ms. Wallace.

653
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:12,178
Ifl could just explain
why Chris has been late.

654
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,484
Please. I want to hear this.

655
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,584
Yes, ma'am. Uh-

656
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,664
Your son has something special.

657
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:25,599
And sometimes it's gonna mean late nights
and hard work, but I think it's gonna pay off.

658
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,869
Now, the minute I see him slacking,
I'll be the first to let you know.

659
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,605
I been talking to Mark
about becoming my manager.

660
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,646
Good.

661
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:47,520
And if you're asking me to hold you
equally responsible, Mark- believe me, I will.

662
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,991
Yes, ma'am.

663
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:54,292
- I need to have a word with Chris.
- Yes, ma'am.

664
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,915
My doctor found a lump in my chest.

665
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,385
What?

666
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:21,151
My surgery is next week. They need to act
aggressively if I'm gonna have a chance.

667
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,919
"If"?

668
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,587
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I want to be up front with you, Christopher.

669
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,062
- No, Ma. No, I don't want to hear all that.
- No, listen.

670
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,999
- I need you to know something. Christopher! Please!
- I don't want to hear this, Ma.

671
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,435
Listen, yo. I got these ideas in my head.

672
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,482
Like, I've been thinking all night.
I can't get-Whoo!

673
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,552
Look, look, yo. I've been thinkin'
about my cousin Wayne. He's smart.

674
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,247
I been thinking about bringing him in
to help me with the management.

675
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,586
I think you'll dig him, Big.

676
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,662
Yo.

677
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:06,032
Big. Big.
Do you want to talk about it?

678
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,969
- About what?
- I mean, whatever's buggin' you, Big.

679
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,270
You haven't said shit
for the past couple days, man.

680
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,709
My moms has breast cancer.
Talkin' gonna fix that?

681
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,350
Shit.

682
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:26,480
No. I guess not.

683
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,394
I was only 15
when I lost my moms to cancer.

684
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,060
How'd you deal with shit?

685
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,102
I ain't feel like talking.

686
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,072
Look, Big, I know you goin'
through hard times right now.

687
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,515
But you're gonna have to be
a soldier for your moms.

688
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,413
You gonna have to be there
and support her, man.

689
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,511
I'm gonna pray for your moms, Big.

690
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,166
Some of y'all wrote me off.

691
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,002
Maybe some of y'all in this room.

692
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,633

694
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,281
Yo, Puff, can I holler at you

695
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:34,050
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.

She just got back from the hospital.
Look, Puff, man, this Bad Boy shit for real?

698
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,926

I'm wearing this
to my first show coming up.

847
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,609
What you think?

848
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,712
That ain't bad.

849
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,260
Ain't bad?
You must be going blind.

850
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,728
I'm trying to make you
the Marilyn Monroe of hip-hop.

851
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,731
That ain't turning no heads.

Come on, y'all.
This ain't no funeral.

859
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:51,918
It ain't even a photo.
It's a mission statement.

860
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:55,318
Bad Boy ain't here to be in the game.
Bad Boy here to take over the game.

861
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:57,288
Every body, take 10 minutes.

862
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:03,827
Watching Faith, all I could think was, "Damn!"

863
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:06,832
She was like some chick
fresh off a movie screen.

864
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:13,105
My baby. Thank you.

865
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:16,438
So, why a brother
gotta be left out in the cold?

866
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:18,739
You done show everyone
up in here them pictures, except me.

867
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,382
Look, uh, no offense.

868
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:26,476
I think you're an incredible rapper
and I'm sure you're a nice guy...

869
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:28,578
but I don't need all that right now.

870
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:30,316
All what?

871
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:33,958
What you saying?

872
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:36,427
You don't need a brother
to make you smile?

873
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,930
Sorry, but I'm not smiling.

874
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,024
Not yet.

875
00:57:46,807 --> 00:57:50,299
All right, fine.
My daughter, Chyna.

876
00:57:51,412 --> 00:57:53,676
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

877
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:55,612
Just like her mother.

878
00:57:57,318 --> 00:57:59,616
What were you doing before
you hooked up with Puffy?

879
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,281
- Pharmaceuticals. You know how it is.
- Typical.

880
00:58:05,426 --> 00:58:11,365
So, are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

881
00:58:11,465 --> 00:58:13,456
I'm someone trying to make it.

882
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:17,264
- How'd you start singing?
- North Baptist Church choir.

883
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:20,704
Typical.

884
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:23,834
I wrote a couple joints
for other artists and finally I got my shot.

885
00:58:25,613 --> 00:58:29,014
I don't know what I'd be doing,
but I ain't think I'd be doing this.

886
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:32,085
When I was a little girl,
everybody told me singing was my destiny...

887
00:58:32,186 --> 00:58:34,984
but I was secretly hoping to make a career
at doing the beat box.

904
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:45,883
Yo, Big. Thanks for representing for
the brothers hustling on the corners, man.

905
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:49,759
Your story telling is the shit. For real.

Prosperity and adversity.

914

And, for saking all others,
to always be faithful.

915

You know me about a month, Big.
Don't say it if you're not ready.

Maybe I don't feel like doin' it
your wack-ass way.

929
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:32,359
- Look, bitch, stop being so fucking difficult.
- Who you calling a bitch, nigga?

930
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:36,095
You wasn't talking that shit when you was
eating my pussy the other night.

931
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:39,000
Turn that shit off.

932
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:46,037
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Are you out of yours?

933
01:01:46,146 --> 01:01:48,410

You said, "I got you."

938
01:01:58,726 --> 01:02:01,286
- Shit.

939
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:04,694
Look, this fucking recording studio
ain't big enough for all that personal shit.

940
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,791
What do you see in her that you
don't see in me? I want to know.

941
01:02:08,903 --> 01:02:11,235
You're my fucking artist.
All right?

01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:13,431
You're my fucking artist.

and you get 10 different answers.

1141
01:14:04,618 --> 01:14:06,916
But he was all that and more...

1142
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:11,855
and sometimes he was just someone
who liked to fuck with you.

01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,291
- Give me your money. Take your little lunch money.

01:14:15,395 --> 01:14:20,833
But like Pac told me,
the best time would be when I was coming up.

1145
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,664
Because once you on top,
you can only go down.

01:14:57,671 --> 01:15:00,139
Hey, yo, Big.

1153
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,140
Yeah?
Go get him.

1154
01:15:02,242 --> 01:15:04,642
All right.

1155
01:15:04,744 --> 01:15:07,941
- You know Big and them on the 10th floor. They in a session.
- Yeah? How their session going?

1156
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:10,812
- Come on, man. You know he doing his thing.
- Just make sure they're working.

1157
01:15:12,152 --> 01:15:15,053
Yo, I hope Pac got some
of that good weed, man.

1158
01:15:15,155 --> 01:15:18,386
They say, "Puff, puff, pass."
But if it's that good, I ain't passing nothing.

1159
01:15:28,268 --> 01:15:30,702
Yo, get those motherfuckers
back in the elevator!

1160
01:15:30,804 --> 01:15:34,069
Get the fuck back in the elevator, man!

1161
01:15:34,174 --> 01:15:38,634
Yo, Big, man! Pac is downstairs getting rolled
on, man! They had the gun in my face!

1162
01:15:38,745 --> 01:15:42,078
- Don't move. Stay here.
- They're still down there. Let me come with you, man!

1163
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:49,378
Fuck! Press 12.

1164
01:15:57,697 --> 01:15:59,460
Motherfucker jacked me in the lobby, man!

1165
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:01,431
Pac!

1166
01:16:05,071 --> 01:16:06,629
Stop right there!

1167
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,470
- Hold on.
- Shut the fuck up and keep your hands in the air!

1168
01:16:09,576 --> 01:16:12,602
Yo, somebody call the ambulance.
Yo, Pac. What happened, Pac?

1169
01:16:12,712 --> 01:16:15,112
Tupac didn't know who the fuck to trust.

1170
01:16:15,215 --> 01:16:17,547
Get away from me.

1171
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:22,785
Which one of y'all set me up?
I'm right here, motherfucker!

1172
01:16:22,889 --> 01:16:24,914
What? Huh? Fuck!

1173
01:16:25,024 --> 01:16:27,891
- As far as he was concerned-
- Oh, shit.

1174
01:16:27,994 --> 01:16:29,791
Everyone near was responsible...

1175
01:16:29,896 --> 01:16:31,921
Oh, shit. Fucky'all, man!

1176
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:34,499
Including me.

1177
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:39,970
In the aftermath
of the Tupac Shakur shooting at Quad Studios...

1178
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:43,304

Sean "Puffy" Combs...

1179
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:46,436
What? No!
This is full of shit.

1180
01:16:46,546 --> 01:16:50,778
Yo, Big, come on, man.
You don't need to be watching this right now.

1181
01:16:50,884 --> 01:16:52,784
I warned him about those guys.

1182
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:56,322
Naming music producer Sean "Puffy" Combs
and the rapper Christopher Wallace...

1183
01:16:56,423 --> 01:16:59,824
Now he's blaming me? How the fuck
could he say i do some shit like that?

1184
01:16:59,926 --> 01:17:04,329
- Yeah, they're full of it, man.
- They wouldn't even let me see him in the hospital.

1185
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:06,661
Fuck it!
I'm gonna call him.

1186
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:09,496
- He know who shot him.
- Yo, Big, hold up.

1187
01:17:09,602 --> 01:17:11,627
Yo, Big, hold up.
Big!

1188
01:17:11,738 --> 01:17:14,969
Yo, Big, ho- Big, hold up.
Hey, Big, hold up, man.

1189
01:17:15,074 --> 01:17:18,737
They just found your man
guilty on that sex abuse.

1190
01:17:18,845 --> 01:17:22,337
He ain't thinking clearly right now.
You know what I'm saying?

1191
01:17:22,449 --> 01:17:26,510
Just give him some time.
Just give him some time, let this cool down.

1192
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:28,587
Shit doesn't make any sense.

1193
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:31,088
At the Superior Court
where he faced ajury...

1194
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:34,092
in the sex-abuse trial
brought against him last year.

1195
01:17:34,194 --> 01:17:37,425
He was acquitted of six counts in the indictment
and found guilty of three others.

1196
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,021
He now faces sentencing
and probable jail time.

1197
01:17:40,266 --> 01:17:44,134
Hey, yo, check this out. Let
me tell y'all who the winneris.

1198
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:46,865
And the winner is

1199
01:17:46,973 --> 01:17:50,204
Above the backboards and the rims.
You know what I'm saying?

1200
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:53,211
Pac went to jail on the sex-abuse charge.

1201
01:17:53,313 --> 01:17:56,214
We thought all the bullshit
would die down...

1202
01:17:56,316 --> 01:18:00,343
but Suge Knight, the owner of Death Row Records,
had something else in mind.

1203
01:18:00,453 --> 01:18:03,354
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep his guards up.

1204
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:06,823
We riding with him.
And one other thing I'd like to say.

1205
01:18:06,926 --> 01:18:12,592
Any artists out there that want to be artists
and want to stay a star...

1206
01:18:12,699 --> 01:18:16,897
and don't- don't have to worry
about the executive producer...

1207
01:18:17,003 --> 01:18:23,033
All up in the videos, all on the records, dancin'...

1208
01:18:24,477 --> 01:18:26,274
come to Death Row!

1209
01:18:29,315 --> 01:18:32,580
- Hell, yeah! West Side, boys!
- Yo, come on, man.

1210
01:18:33,853 --> 01:18:37,118
Yo, we gotta rise above this.

1211
01:18:37,223 --> 01:18:41,023
Big, what is the East Coast-West Coast rivalry?

1212
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:44,563
Are you afraid for your life?

1213
01:18:44,664 --> 01:18:48,532
- Any further comments on Death Row?
- Biggie, what did Puff Daddy do?

1214
01:18:48,635 --> 01:18:50,535
Did you shoot Tupac?

1215
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:55,871
What are you going to do now
that Pac's getting out of jail?

1216
01:18:55,975 --> 01:18:58,637
Go, go!
Get us the fuck out of here!

1217
01:18:58,745 --> 01:19:00,645
Pac and his people have been saying...

1218
01:19:00,747 --> 01:19:02,647
that "Who Shot Ya?"
The joint Biggie came out with...

1219
01:19:02,749 --> 01:19:05,980
is trying to dis Pac a bout
the shooting at Quad Studios.

1220
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:08,713
But Biggie's camp is saying he wrote that song
before the shooting ever happened.

1221
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:10,721
And he stopped playing that song now.

1222
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:13,189
Yeah, he stopped playing the song.
And now Pac is coming out...

1223
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:15,659
with this new song getting at Biggie.
The whole thing is getting out of control.

1224
01:19:15,762 --> 01:19:18,890
The fans are choosing sides,
the labels are choosing sides.

1225
01:19:18,998 --> 01:19:21,330
What's up?

1226
01:19:21,434 --> 01:19:25,165
What? You're just gonna
sit there looking stupid?

1227
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:27,671
- Yo, your boy's been wilding out, man.
- Who?

1228
01:19:27,774 --> 01:19:32,768
Pac. He's been on a mission
ever since Suge bailed him out of jail.

1229
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:40,651
¶ First off, fuck your bitch
and the clique you claim ¶

1230
01:19:40,753 --> 01:19:42,948
¶ West Side when we ride
come equipped with game ¶

1231
01:19:43,056 --> 01:19:45,320
¶ You claim to be a playa
but I fucked your wife ¶

1232
01:19:45,425 --> 01:19:47,916
¶ We bust on Bad Boy's niggas
Fuck for life ¶

1233
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:49,585
¶ Plus, Puffy tryin'
to see me weak ¶

1234
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:53,689
That's some dumb shit. I ain't sweating it.

1235
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,734
¶ We keep on coming
while we running for your jewels ¶

1236
01:19:55,835 --> 01:19:58,497
¶ Steady gunning Keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules ¶

1237
01:19:58,605 --> 01:20:00,402
¶ Little Caesar
go ask your homey how I'll leave you ¶

1238
01:20:00,506 --> 01:20:02,838
¶ Cut your young ass up leave you in pieces
Now be deceased ¶

1239
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:05,467
¶ Lil' Kim, don't fuck around
with real G's ¶

1240
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:08,479
- ¶ Quick to snatch you gly ass off the street ¶
- Where you get this from?

1241
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:10,776
Got it from the store, man.
It's all over the place.

1242
01:20:10,883 --> 01:20:14,683
¶ So let the West Side ride tonight ¶¶

1243
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:19,690
Been singing since I was
in the choir as a little girl.

1244
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,352
Go see what that is.

1245
01:20:22,462 --> 01:20:25,727
- Um, I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on.
- Where the fuck is Faith?

1246
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:28,164
- Big, I'm doing an interview.
- When were you going to tell me?

1247
01:20:28,267 --> 01:20:31,134
I gotta find out about it like this?
You fucked that motherfucker? Huh?

1248
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:33,137
Come the fuck here.

1249
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:36,333
Get the fuck over here.
Let me talk to you.

1250
01:20:36,442 --> 01:20:38,933
You fucked that motherfucker? Huh?

1251
01:20:39,045 --> 01:20:41,445
You want to fuck with niggas?
You want to fuck with niggas?

1252
01:20:41,547 --> 01:20:43,447
- Huh?
- Get out of here!

1253
01:20:43,549 --> 01:20:46,746
Yo, Big, go downstairs, man.
You know somebody called security by now!

1254
01:20:46,853 --> 01:20:49,083
Big, get the hell out!

1255
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:51,088
Get the hell out, man!

1256
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,624
- What were you thinkin'?
- I wasn't fuckin' thinking.

1257
01:20:53,726 --> 01:20:57,389
I just fucking snapped, all right?
I just wanted to get the truth.

1258
01:20:57,497 --> 01:21:01,058
Yo, man, truth is your Pac, he trying to
bring you down to the gutter with him...

1259
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:03,067
and you playing right into his hands, Big.

1260
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:05,433
I mean, well, we can squabble...

1261
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:09,634
but, yo, I just got finished
signing with Clive for $42 million.

1262
01:21:09,742 --> 01:21:13,701
And you getting $5 million, Big.
Don't mess that up.

1263
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:33,756
Fay-Fay? Come on, FEW, open the door.
I want to talk to you.

1264
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:37,028
Come on, open the door.
Please.

1265
01:21:37,136 --> 01:21:39,104
Fay.

1266
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,100
Can you open the door?

1267
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:46,178
Fay!

1268
01:21:54,921 --> 01:21:56,821
What's going on?

1269
01:21:56,923 --> 01:21:59,949
Fuck you!

1270
01:22:00,059 --> 01:22:03,426
I don't even know
who the fuck you are anymore.

1271
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:05,827
Can you listen for a minute?

1272
01:22:05,932 --> 01:22:09,493
- Fay, just listen to me for a minute.
- It's over.

1273
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:13,800
I'm sorry about bugging the fuck out.
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

1274
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:16,636
Why couldn't you just be a man and ask me?

1275
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:22,071
Okay, I'm asking.
What happened with you and Pac?

1276
01:22:24,283 --> 01:22:26,581
I saw him at the House of Blues.

1277
01:22:26,686 --> 01:22:29,780
We took that picture,
and that's all it was supposed to be.

1278
01:22:29,889 --> 01:22:32,153
And that's all there was.

1279
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:33,987
End of story.

1280
01:22:35,695 --> 01:22:39,597
- Okay.
- May be now you have an idea what it feels like to be cheated on.

1281
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:44,602
I'm not bragging, Fay, but I could have had
10 bitches a day if i wanted.

1282
01:22:44,704 --> 01:22:48,367
So go have 10, 20.
I don't give a fuck.

1283
01:22:49,909 --> 01:22:52,503
I ain't mean that.

1284
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:03,953
No, Chris.

1285
01:23:06,092 --> 01:23:08,322
I'm not laughing.

1286
01:23:09,562 --> 01:23:11,189
- Not anymore.
- Come on, Fay.

1287
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,006
Damn!

1288
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:34,719
- What?
- This Notorious?

1289
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:37,722
- Yeah.
- You gonna be wearing a toe tag, nigga.

1290
01:23:37,824 --> 01:23:40,418
- Who this?
- West Coast, motherfucker.

1291
01:23:42,628 --> 01:23:46,257
- What size are these?
- Those are 14s like you asked.

1292
01:23:46,365 --> 01:23:48,333
These ain't no fucking 14s.

1293
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:51,232
Fucking 12s.
These ain't no fucking 14s.

1294
01:23:51,337 --> 01:23:53,737
- All right, every bod yout.
- Cease, go get the car!

1295
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,899
- Everybody out!
- All these fucking problems.

1296
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:58,704
- Out, people. Come on. Come on.
- Hey, Mark, y'all playing around.

1297
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:01,211
- You ain't doing your job!
- Y'all sent over the wrong size shoes!

1298
01:24:01,314 --> 01:24:04,215
Y'all sent the wrong size shoes!
Now he ain't going on!

1299
01:24:04,317 --> 01:24:06,512
I ain't got time for no tempertantrum!

1300
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:09,417
Look, you need to chill, Puff.
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

1301
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:12,685
What? He stressed out about them
Death Row niggas in the audience?

1302
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:16,125
Big ain't worried about it.
It ain't that, man. Fay's pregnant.

1303
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:19,130
How'd that knuckle head get her pregnant?
I thought they was broke up.

1304
01:24:19,232 --> 01:24:21,632
All this soap opera drama.
Yo, Big!

1305
01:24:21,734 --> 01:24:24,567
- I'm not going on.
- Big, come on, man. Don't do this to me.

1306
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,104
- Don't do this to your self!
- I've done just about...

1307
01:24:27,206 --> 01:24:29,265
every fucking thing
you have ever asked of me.

1308
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,742
All I want in return is some
motherfucking shoes that fit.

1309
01:24:32,845 --> 01:24:35,143
Yo, man, yo, man.

1310
01:24:38,618 --> 01:24:41,086
- There you go dancing again.
- Yeah.

1311
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:46,820
Maybe I take my shoes too seriously.

1312
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:48,917
Size 14, I would take them seriously.

1313
01:24:57,737 --> 01:25:00,228
I know lately that it ain't been easy.

1314
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:02,239
Pac is talking about us.

1315
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:04,241
The media is doing whatever they can...

1316
01:25:04,343 --> 01:25:06,470
to keep this
East Coast-West Coast thing going on.

1317
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:09,571
I wanna be the last cat still standing.

1318
01:25:09,682 --> 01:25:12,651
I'm hoping that you want the same thing.

1319
01:25:17,123 --> 01:25:20,422
Yo, look, i just got these
from Big Sexy.

1320
01:25:20,526 --> 01:25:23,495
They ain't fly or nothin',
but they gonna have to work, baby.

1321
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:27,589
I used to sling rock for nice kicks.
Now look at me.

1322
01:25:28,868 --> 01:25:31,860
This your idea of us changing the world?

1323
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:35,429
We can't change the world
unless we change our selves.

1324
01:25:43,449 --> 01:25:47,545
Yo, Big. What now, huh, motherfucker?
Huh? West Side, motherfucker!

1325
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:51,555
Now you on the best side! What you gonna
do now, bitch? Huh? Huh, motherfucker?

1326
01:25:51,657 --> 01:25:54,319
- Let me talk to you, man.
- Your bitch ass set me up!

1327
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:57,863
What you gotta say now, motherfucker?
That's why i fucked your wife!

1328
01:25:57,964 --> 01:26:00,694
Oh! He got the strap!
He got the strap!

1329
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,234
- You set me up, motherfucker!
- He got the strap.

1330
01:26:03,336 --> 01:26:05,133
Let's go!

1331
01:26:05,237 --> 01:26:07,296
What the fuck? Come on, man!
West Side, bitch!

1332
01:26:07,406 --> 01:26:08,998
Catch you on the rebound, big boy.

1333
01:26:09,108 --> 01:26:12,168
Me and Pac should have said, "Fuck that bullshit.

1334
01:26:12,278 --> 01:26:14,508
Let's go somewhere
and talk this shit out."

1335
01:26:14,613 --> 01:26:17,707
But the fact is,
we were both way be yond that now.

1336
01:26:20,786 --> 01:26:22,686
The media went crazy.

1337
01:26:22,788 --> 01:26:24,688
It had nothing to do with hip-hop...

1338
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:27,554
but everything to do with
selling papers and magazines.

1339
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:29,059
If it ain't New York, it ain't shit.

1340
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:30,526
West Side, Compton in the house!

1341
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:33,393
- We got Biggie. We got everybody.
- We got Pac. We got Dre.

1342
01:26:33,499 --> 01:26:34,898
Play our shit on the East Coast.

1343
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:36,901
None of that shit get played
in the clubs in the Bronx.

1344
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:39,267
We created all this
rap shit anyway. East Coast.

1345
01:26:39,372 --> 01:26:43,604
West Side! They might think they started
the game, but we elevated that motherfucker.

1346
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:45,939
Tupac knows what he's talking about.
He talks about the hood.

1347
01:26:46,045 --> 01:26:48,411
He talks about what's actually
going on on the streets.

1348
01:26:48,514 --> 01:26:52,883
I know Big set him up. That's why my man Pac
came back with "Hit 'Em Up."

1349
01:26:52,985 --> 01:26:54,953
That's some bullshit.
Set him up?

1350
01:26:55,054 --> 01:26:57,420
Biggie wrote "Who Shot Ya??"
Because he got something to do with Pac.

1351
01:26:57,523 --> 01:27:00,185
Big wrote "Who Shot Ya??" months
before that shit went down with Pac.

1352
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:04,729
How is Pac gonna really think
that Biggie would set him up like that?

1353
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:06,889
Fuck West Coast.
Man, they can eat a motherfucking dick.

1354
01:27:06,999 --> 01:27:08,626
I don't give a fuck
if you think it's gangsta.

1355
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:10,634
- Fuck Compton, man.
- Fuck the East Coast.
- Fuck the West Coast.

1356
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:14,433
That's what the fuck I think about
the motherfucking East motherfucking Coast.

1357
01:27:23,983 --> 01:27:27,043
- ¶ Just give me the loot, give me the loot ¶

1374
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:08,755
¶ With the same clip
and the same 4-5-¶

1375
01:28:14,467 --> 01:28:15,934
Yo, enough. Cut that.

1376
01:28:20,973 --> 01:28:23,305
Shut that shit down!

1377
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:27,172
- Yo, put that joint on.
- Big, what you doing?

1378
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:29,873
Sometimes you gotta rise above it.
Sometimes you gotta step on in.

1379
01:28:29,982 --> 01:28:32,473
- Don't sing that song, man.
- I got to.

1380
01:28:32,585 --> 01:28:37,022
Yo, check it out. This industry will turn
your best friends into your worst enemies.

1381
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:39,489
Pac warned me, but I didn't believe him.

1382
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:41,685
This song was made months a go.

1383
01:28:41,794 --> 01:28:45,560
He probably won't believe me.
Maybe nobody will.

1384
01:28:45,664 --> 01:28:48,565
But frankly, I don't give a fuck.

1385
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:51,067
Drop that joint, DJ Enuff.

1386
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:53,570

¶ I seen the light

1414
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,650
Head line news at the top of the hour.

1415
01:30:13,752 --> 01:30:17,153
Right now we've got some breaking news
for you out of Las Vegas.

1416
01:30:17,256 --> 01:30:20,748
An apparent drive- by shooting
targeting rapper-actor Tupac Shakur.

1417
01:30:20,859 --> 01:30:23,828
- Hey, yo, Big, come in here, man!
- At the time of the shooting-

1418
01:30:23,929 --> 01:30:25,863
What the hell you hollering about?

1419
01:30:25,965 --> 01:30:29,128
Shakur was accompanied
by his producer, Suge Knight.

1420
01:30:29,235 --> 01:30:31,703
Police are not yet
indicating any suspects.

1421
01:30:31,804 --> 01:30:35,638
However, eye witnesses reported
hearing multiple gunshots.

1422
01:30:35,741 --> 01:30:40,235
Shakur was air lifted to the Las Ve gas University
Medical Center with four gunshot wounds...

1423
01:30:40,346 --> 01:30:42,610
and is reported to be
in critical condition.

1424
01:30:42,715 --> 01:30:44,740
What the fuck?

1425
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:22,945
I pray all this East Coast-West Coast
mess is over now.

1426
01:31:23,055 --> 01:31:26,081
I saw his mother on TV.

1427
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:28,182
She's a strong woman.

1428
01:31:29,895 --> 01:31:32,864
But no parent
should have to bury their child.

1429
01:31:32,965 --> 01:31:36,492
I just always figured we had time
to straighten things out.

1430
01:31:36,602 --> 01:31:39,537
You don't think this had
anything to do with your argument?

1431
01:31:39,638 --> 01:31:41,936
No.

1432
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:44,009
I don't.

1433
01:31:45,377 --> 01:31:49,541
Well, nobody is invincible, Son.

1434
01:31:49,648 --> 01:31:52,481
That's why we have to make
everything we do now count.

1435
01:31:54,653 --> 01:31:58,180
I'm chilling with my man Pac, who schooled me
to the game and shit. Know what I'm sayin'?

1436
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:02,989
Now we a bout to wreak havoc on you
motherfuckers, man. Know what I'm sayin'?

1437
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:10,768
I don't know when the hell
they'll fix your truck...

1438
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:13,429
but I 'll get us home before
we're seen in this piece of shit.

1439
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:16,906
I don't care, Cease.
Just drive.

1440
01:32:20,145 --> 01:32:21,840
Watch out!

1441
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:27,477
In that one moment, I had that thought a gain.

1442
01:32:27,586 --> 01:32:31,022
Dying would be better
than dealing with this shit.

1443
01:32:31,256 --> 01:32:34,225
I was leaving,
and I was sitting in a hotel, and a voice said...

1444
01:32:34,326 --> 01:32:36,521
"Do you see any niggers?"

1445
01:32:36,628 --> 01:32:40,086
And I said, " No." And it said, "You know why?
'Cause there aren't any."

1446
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:43,225
- Yeah, I been here three weeks,
I haven't even said it.

1447
01:32:43,335 --> 01:32:45,929
I ain't gonna never call
another black man nigger.

1448
01:32:46,038 --> 01:32:50,031
Look at you. Your mama
should have never let you out the house.

1449
01:32:50,142 --> 01:32:52,406
Oh, shit.

1450
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:54,877
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, bro, what's going on?

1451
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,971
- When did you get out?
- Yesterday.

1452
01:32:57,082 --> 01:33:00,074
- You picked up some weight.
- Man, look who's talking.

1453
01:33:00,185 --> 01:33:02,312
Damn.

1454
01:33:02,421 --> 01:33:04,355
Wow.

1455
01:33:04,456 --> 01:33:07,789
Biggie motherfuckin' Smalls.
I'm proud of you, dog.

1456
01:33:07,893 --> 01:33:11,989
When the brothers in the pen found out
you was my boy, I got mad love.

1457
01:33:12,097 --> 01:33:14,327
Yeah?
How much love did you get?

1458
01:33:14,433 --> 01:33:16,196
Man, fuck you, bitch.

1459
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:20,738
D Roc, there's not a day that don't go by
when I don't think about what you did for me.

1460
01:33:20,839 --> 01:33:22,932
I set some paper aside for you.

1461
01:33:26,578 --> 01:33:28,478
I didn't do it for no payoff.

1462
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:33,176
If shit was reversed, I don't know
how I could do that bid for you like that.

1463
01:33:33,285 --> 01:33:38,416
Well, if shit was reversed, I don't know
if I could have been strong enough to make it.

1464
01:33:38,524 --> 01:33:41,357
Making it?

1465
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,996
It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

1466
01:33:45,097 --> 01:33:46,997
More money, more problems.

1467
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:49,363
- Beats the corner.
- Guess so.

1468
01:33:49,468 --> 01:33:52,028
Hell, yeah.

1469
01:33:52,137 --> 01:33:54,002
So how's Tee-Tee doing, huh?

1470
01:33:56,275 --> 01:33:58,436
Okay. I guess.

1471
01:34:05,517 --> 01:34:08,782
I'm gonna check you out
a little later on, all right?

1472
01:34:10,656 --> 01:34:16,219
You know, neither one of us had our fathers
around to teach us how to be men.

1473
01:34:16,328 --> 01:34:19,297
We were just learning
as we was going along.

1474
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:26,302
But maybe making it
ain't just about the shit you do on stage.

1475
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:28,635
You a philosopher now?

1476
01:34:30,809 --> 01:34:34,745
Man, I think everyone
that's in the pen is a philosopher.

1477
01:34:34,847 --> 01:34:39,341
But when you're on your back,
laying on that cot...

1478
01:34:39,451 --> 01:34:42,648
you spend a lot of time
staring at the ceiling...

1479
01:34:42,754 --> 01:34:44,722
Iooking for God...

1480
01:34:46,124 --> 01:34:48,684
thinking about what's important.

1481
01:34:49,795 --> 01:34:51,660
Keep making it, Chris.

1482
01:35:11,049 --> 01:35:13,745
You gotta let me know
whether it's the streets or the studio.

1483
01:35:17,322 --> 01:35:20,382
You think that makes you a man?

1484
01:35:20,492 --> 01:35:23,222
You be a great father.

1485
01:35:23,328 --> 01:35:25,592
What if I don't make it?

1486
01:35:25,697 --> 01:35:28,962
I love you too.

1487
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:32,434
We gonna be all right, just you and me.

1488
01:35:32,538 --> 01:35:34,267
You're too fat, black, and ugly.

1489
01:35:34,373 --> 01:35:37,968
I don't even know who the
fuck you are anymore.

1490
01:35:38,076 --> 01:35:41,375
Are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

1491
01:36:01,867 --> 01:36:04,995
And I want you to know...

1492
01:36:05,103 --> 01:36:06,832
¶ That these are the breaks ¶

1493
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:09,499
¶ That these are the breaks ¶

1494
01:36:09,608 --> 01:36:12,008
¶ Break it up, break it up
break it up ¶

1495
01:36:14,513 --> 01:36:16,879
Now go play. That's my girl.

1496
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:26,948
- Hello?
- Hey. What you doing?

1497
01:36:27,059 --> 01:36:29,926
- I'm just kicking it with my daughter.
- How's the leg?

1498
01:36:30,028 --> 01:36:31,859
It's all right.

1499
01:36:31,964 --> 01:36:34,489
I got one more stop, and then I'm on my way.
You need anything?

1500
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,158
That's not a good idea.

1501
01:36:38,103 --> 01:36:41,129
- What isn't?
- I'm just here kicking it with my daughter.

1502
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:45,005
- You were the one who told me to come over.
- I'll call you later.

1503
01:36:47,145 --> 01:36:50,205
I'm done with this.
I'm sick of you treating me like shit.

1504
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:54,115
You know what, nigga?
Don't even bother calling. All right? Fuckyou.

1505
01:36:54,219 --> 01:36:55,880
Fuckyou too, bitch.

1506
01:37:03,428 --> 01:37:05,396
Come here, Tee-Tee.

1507
01:37:12,471 --> 01:37:15,634
I'm gonna teach you something
I never want you to forget.

1508
01:37:15,741 --> 01:37:17,641
Another rap?

1509
01:37:17,743 --> 01:37:21,941
No. More important than any rap song.

1510
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:24,447
Look at me.

1511
01:37:24,549 --> 01:37:26,881
See, you're my princess.

1512
01:37:26,985 --> 01:37:31,251
So no matter what, for any reason...

1513
01:37:31,356 --> 01:37:33,984
never let a man call you a bitch.

1514
01:37:34,092 --> 01:37:36,583
- You got it?
- Yes, Daddy.

1515
01:37:36,695 --> 01:37:38,993
- You sure you got it? You better have it, you hear?
- Yes.

1516
01:37:50,308 --> 01:37:53,505
Hey, yo, isn't that Sandy?

1517
01:37:53,612 --> 01:37:56,581
Yo, she used to be a crack head.

1518
01:38:14,633 --> 01:38:17,625
People dying for that next
Biggie Smalls joint.

1519
01:38:17,736 --> 01:38:21,263
Tell me the reason why you're here
'cause you ready to get back in the studio.

1520
01:38:21,373 --> 01:38:23,773
I can't talk about the same shit anymore.

1521
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:26,969
A motherfucker's a work in progress.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1522
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:30,537
But I ain't hustling
on the streets no more.

1523
01:38:30,649 --> 01:38:35,109
I got two kids. Half the time
I don't even feel like the same cat.

1524
01:38:36,755 --> 01:38:38,655
I wanna do something different.

1525
01:38:38,757 --> 01:38:42,284
So if it's cool to try some new shit...

1526
01:38:42,394 --> 01:38:44,089
I'm ready to come back.

1527
01:38:51,203 --> 01:38:53,364
Yeah.

1528
01:38:53,472 --> 01:38:55,667
What?
The Notorious baby-What?

1529
01:38:55,774 --> 01:38:57,935
- Uh-huh. You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

1530
01:38:58,043 --> 01:39:01,410
- Ready to run the world? Ready to take it?
- Ain't trippin'.

1531
01:39:01,513 --> 01:39:04,038
I don't see nobody.
What's up? I'm walking around...

1532
01:39:04,149 --> 01:39:06,049
- don't see nobody.
- You know how we do it.

1533
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:09,211
All right.
That's what I'm talking about.

1534
01:39:09,321 --> 01:39:11,516
- Yo, welcome back, Biggie.
- Let's get it.

01:40:24,863 --> 01:40:27,730

01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:30,666
- Going to L.A.X.
- Cali?

1560
01:40:30,769 --> 01:40:34,330
- No doubt, baby. California.
- Yeah.

1561
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:36,873
I don't like you going out there.

1562
01:40:36,975 --> 01:40:40,240
I think me being in L.A.
Is gonna finally put an end to all of this.

1563
01:40:40,345 --> 01:40:43,940
Besides, I'm just promoting the album.
I'll be home soon.

1564
01:40:44,049 --> 01:40:46,517
Mmm.

1565
01:40:47,552 --> 01:40:50,282
Hey, Ma. I'm proud of you.

1566
01:40:51,957 --> 01:40:55,449
Proud of me? For what?

1567
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:59,519
Fighting cancer, then getting your master's,
sticking with it...

1568
01:40:59,631 --> 01:41:01,622
even with everything you've been through.

1569
01:41:06,638 --> 01:41:08,606
Thankyou.

1570
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:16,012
I want you to be careful, Chrissy-poo.

1571
01:41:16,114 --> 01:41:18,878
I hate it when you call me that.

1572
01:41:18,984 --> 01:41:23,387
I forgot.
You're all grown-up now.

1573
01:41:24,823 --> 01:41:29,556
West Coast rappers
were still scared to come to the East Coast...

1574
01:41:29,661 --> 01:41:32,095
and East Coast rappers
were scared to come out west...

1575
01:41:32,197 --> 01:41:35,325
but it was time
to put an end to all this shit.

1576
01:41:35,433 --> 01:41:37,833
So I went to Cali to promote my album.

1577
01:41:37,936 --> 01:41:41,099
Y'al I see how sexy I looked last night
at the Soul Train Awards?

1578
01:41:41,206 --> 01:41:45,006
- Yeah. We saw you.
- I gotta stay out here and promote the album.

1579
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:47,135
You think T'yanna could come out?

1580
01:41:48,513 --> 01:41:51,141
Maybe my moms could bring her?

1581
01:41:52,651 --> 01:41:54,619
Um-

1582
01:41:56,421 --> 01:41:58,946
Okay.

1583
01:41:59,057 --> 01:42:01,582
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

1584
01:42:03,628 --> 01:42:05,562
Thanks, man.
These shits are hot!

1585
01:42:05,664 --> 01:42:07,791
I'm gonna holler at you later, all right?

1586
01:42:07,899 --> 01:42:10,697
Yeah, man. Oooh!

1587
01:42:10,802 --> 01:42:13,600
- Man, that shit look real good, man.

1589
01:42:25,216 --> 01:42:28,982

- My ass too tired.

1590
01:42:29,087 --> 01:42:31,055
Folks wanna see you.

1591
01:42:31,156 --> 01:42:33,181
- Yeah.

1592
01:42:33,291 --> 01:42:36,727

he's not gonna make it out of L.A. Alive.

1593
01:42:36,828 --> 01:42:40,127
Fuck you, motherfucker.
We ain't hidin'!

1594
01:42:40,231 --> 01:42:44,167
- Another one?
- Yeah, man.

1595
01:42:51,876 --> 01:42:55,573
Fuck it.
We in Cali, right?

1596
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:58,808

Hip-hop royalty from both coasts...

1598

1599
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:21,628
Vibe magazine is hosting a major party
in honor of yesterday's Soul Train Awards...

1600
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,709
and some big names are expected to attend.

1601
01:43:24,809 --> 01:43:27,437
Hello?

1602
01:43:27,545 --> 01:43:30,912
- You coming to the party?
- Yeah, we on our way over there right now.

1603
01:43:31,016 --> 01:43:33,280
- I thought you were going to London.
- I was...

1604
01:43:33,385 --> 01:43:35,478
but I gotta stay here
and promote the album.

1605
01:43:35,587 --> 01:43:38,954
So when you get back to New York,
I want you to send C.J. Out here with my moms.

1606
01:43:39,057 --> 01:43:42,788
Jan's letting me scoop up T'yanna,
so I need my son to be here.

1607
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:47,858
All right, we can work that out.

1608
01:43:47,966 --> 01:43:49,934

I think all my life I was trying to become a man...

1634
01:45:17,889 --> 01:45:23,486
but for some reason on this night
I didn't have to try any more.

1635
01:45:27,465 --> 01:45:31,697
My second album was about to drop...

a clean slate all over again.

1703
01:53:08,459 --> 01:53:14,022
I'm saddened that his life
was cut down at the age of 24...

1704
01:53:14,131 --> 01:53:19,865
but I find solace in knowing
that he became a man...

1705
01:53:19,971 --> 01:53:22,633
and he was ready to live.

1706
01:53:25,209 --> 01:53:28,770
As I looked out
at all those faces...

1707
01:53:28,879 --> 01:53:31,177

1708
01:53:31,282 --> 01:53:34,843
Someone in the crowd
turned on their radio...

1709
01:53:34,952 --> 01:53:39,946
