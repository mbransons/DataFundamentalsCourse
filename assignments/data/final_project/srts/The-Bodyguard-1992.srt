1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,164
Sergeant David Budd,
Metropolitan Police.

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:06,793
British Transport Police have put out
an alert on a possible suicide bomber.

3
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:09,665
Don't do that! Please don't do that!
Please just stay still.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,063
<font color="lime">You have children?</font> Yes. I do, two.

5
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,063
That's Ella. She's ten.

6
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:18,903
Charlie. He's eight.

7
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:21,703
The Government is intent on
forcing through a beefed-up

8
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:26,063
Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act, RIPA-18 as it's being dubbed,

9
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:28,543
spearheaded by you.

10
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,983
Only those intent on acts of
violence have anything to fear.

11
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:35,503
I want you right beside me,
not because it's your job,

12
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:36,863
but because it's our choice.

13
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:40,383
This is a very, very dangerous
politician.

14
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,345
Someone who must be stopped.

15
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:52,543
Despite the heroic efforts
of our emergency services,

16
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:57,023
the Home Secretary, Julia Montague,
succumbed to her injuries

17
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,903
and was pronounced dead
a short while ago.

18
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:03,383
Someone tampered with my gun.

19
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:04,983
The police searched your flat.

20
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:07,303
If they found an illegal firearm,
they'd seize it,

21
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:09,503
they wouldn't just change out
the bullets for blanks.

22
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:12,703
The PM's asked me to step up
to Acting Home Secretary.

23
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,983
Now, it goes without saying,
I'd never wish in a million years

24
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,983
to assume this role under
these circumstances.

25
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,063
There's a simple, plausible story
for you to stick to.

26
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,343
And you will stick to it.

27
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,383
Finally.

28
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,823
We've got your shooter.

29
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,743
Sergeant Andrew Apsted.

30
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,143
Served in Helmand Province,
two tours.

31
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:32,343
This could be the original
bomb-maker.

32
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:36,863
The war in the desert, we've brought
it back to the streets of Britain.

33
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,503
Andrew Apsted.

34
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:39,543
We need more on him.

35
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,263
Who he joined the Army with,
who he served with.

36
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:43,983
And where did he get that rifle?

37
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:45,183
A PSL, with no history.

38
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,623
Traceable back to me.

39
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,265
Maybe I can make a couple of calls.

40
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,703
I thought they were sending you
a cab? Yeah.

41
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,543
I don't need their shitty cab.

42
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:59,623
Chanel Dyson was the late Home
Secretary's PR, until she was fired.

43
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,223
Thank you for being such
a sweetheart that day.

44
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,463
You're very welcome.

45
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,145
Just cos I was going to suggest
a drink.

46
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,423
The male subject has been identified
as Luke Aikens.

47
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:13,183
Aikens is believed to be
a senior figure in organised

48
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,425
criminal enterprises.

49
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,063
Nadia, we're desperate to find
the person who's been creating

50
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,383
these devices.

51
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:22,025
Is this the man your husband met?

52
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:25,263
Only problem is they know about you.

53
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:27,543
That'll be David Budd.

54
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,103
He's the only one who challenged me.

55
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,463
In her hotel room a few days
before she was killed,

56
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,703
the Home Secretary received
a visit from Longcross.

57
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,023
He supplied her with an encrypted
file of kompromat

58
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,103
she subsequently shared
with the Prime Minister.

59
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,143
She offered them greater powers
in return for the

60
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:43,623
<font color="yellow">compromising material.</font> A series
of scandals, all covered up.

61
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,823
A sexual assault.

62
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,063
Drug addiction.

63
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,903
Financial impropriety.

64
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,063
Last night, I learned they relate
to the Prime Minister.

65
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,543
It looks like they're convinced
the kompromat wasn't with

66
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:56,583
the Home Secretary at the time of
the explosion.

67
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,423
It's still out there.

68
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,625
They seem pretty sure if anyone
knows where it's hidden, you do.

69
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:06,063
Julia Montague's home was
thoroughly searched,

70
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:07,585
all of her devices seized.

71
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,825
There was no tablet found.

72
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,703
TV REPORTER: Six long weeks
have passed since the incident

73
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,903
that triggered the current
terror alert...

74
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:26,343
The Metropolitan Police remain on
the highest level of vigilance,

75
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:29,023
responding to terror alerts
on a daily basis,

76
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,943
most of them thankfully
false alarms...

77
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,863
The police and Security Service MI5
stand at an almost

78
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,743
unprecedented level of alertness
to a home-grown terror threat,

79
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:41,143
yet still there have been no
further arrests, no breakthrough,

80
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:44,503
and the assassination of
Home Secretary Julia Montague rem...

81
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:53,303
VOICEMAIL: Hey, David, it's Chanel.

82
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,943
Um, it was really lovely
to run into you.

83
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,745
<font color="yellow">I meant it about that drink, may...
</font>

84
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,223
David!

85
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:04,143
I was getting worried you were
never going to call me back.

86
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,623
Anything to play hard to get.

87
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,423
Well, let's meet up.

88
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,905
I know just the place.

89
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,665
Ma'am.

90
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:49,385
As you were.

91
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,903
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font> Deepak.

92
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,983
<font color="yellow">Sorry, nobody told me...
</font>I wanted an update.

93
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,223
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:58,383
We've now interviewed all
the security staff on duty

95
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,983
the night before the bombing
at St Matthew's College.

96
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:04,823
They all claim not to have witnessed
any kind of break-in or intruder.

97
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:06,063
"Claim"?

98
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,703
The bomb didn't plant itself, ma'am.

99
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,623
Maybe we're looking at bribery
and/or intimidation.

100
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,183
They also needed access to the CCTV,
to delete part of the recording.

101
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,703
This sounds like a new line
of inquiry.

102
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:18,103
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:19,663
Luke Aikens.

104
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,983
We're exploring whether he
could've played a role in the

105
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,583
assassination of the Home Secretary.

106
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,303
Possible motivation being to prevent
increased scrutiny

107
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,143
<font color="yellow">into criminal communications.
</font>RIPA-18?

108
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,183
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:33,023
Aikens is a significant player in
organised crime, and as you know,

110
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,583
ma'am, he's always successfully
avoided criminal charges.

111
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,625
"As I know"?

112
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:39,703
Er, yes. I saw in the file.

113
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:41,545
You led the Organised Crime Unit...

114
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,265
..across the investigations
into Aikens' activities.

115
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,423
Well, that was some time ago.

116
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,983
Why wasn't I informed earlier about
this new line of inquiry?

117
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,383
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, ma'am, I...
</font>Who initiated it?

118
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,585
I'm acting on information
from David Budd.

119
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,305
Every step forward,
we take one back.

120
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,945
Something happened, boss?

121
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,903
There's always been whispers
Luke Aikens had senior officers

122
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:36,943
in his pocket - officers prepared
to sabotage investigations into

123
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:38,065
his criminal empire.

124
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:40,505
Our officers?

125
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,903
There's still so much of the
Home Secretary's assassination

126
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,263
we can't put together, but a lot
of it can be explained

127
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,905
if all along there's been
an inside man...

128
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,505
..or woman.

129
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,145
You made it!

130
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,663
Never one to turn down a free drink.

131
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,503
We have a table downstairs,
if that's OK?

132
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,863
It's your manor, your rules.

133
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,343
What would you like to drink?

134
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,383
Er...

135
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:19,823
A beer's fine, please.

136
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,943
Oh, cheap date!
The same again, please.

137
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,105
But we'll have them downstairs.
Sure, Chanel.

138
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,983
Welcome to my manor.

139
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,143
Actually, it was good running
into you.

140
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,983
Because here we are.

141
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:35,863
That too. I...

142
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,143
When you finished at the Home
Office, I heard a few things.

143
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,183
About me?

144
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,863
Yeah, about you.

145
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,383
They were always beefing me.

146
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,023
What was it this time?

147
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:48,183
That your money comes from companies
registered offshore.

148
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,623
So?

149
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,783
I think there was a concern these
companies weren't fully legit.

150
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:55,263
Listen, David, you're not
a business person.

151
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,463
And I'm certainly not.

152
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,423
I have clever people to do all that
for me.

153
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:01,583
So, we could sit here and talk
about corporate law all night

154
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,463
and neither of us will be any
the wiser.

155
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:04,503
Fair point.

156
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,783
Paid for with Nazi gold.

157
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,425
Thank you.

158
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,185
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font> Cheers.

159
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:28,423
What?

160
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,985
Just trying to figure you out.

161
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:36,543
Well, depending on who you talk to,
I'm either deceptively deep

162
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:37,945
or deceptively shallow.

163
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,705
Either way, you're deceptive.

164
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,543
What's wrong?

165
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,585
I'm sorry...

166
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,385
Well?

167
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,505
A...belt on the right-hand side.

168
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,145
We don't normally allow coppers.

169
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,783
And we definitely don't allow THEM.

170
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,903
Makarov, is that right?

171
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:14,745
Looks like someone's been talking.

172
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,863
Well, you go around asking for
a PSL,

173
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:19,625
it's going to come to my attention.

174
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:21,945
You supply Andy Apsted?

175
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:27,825
Tell me one thing.

176
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:31,905
He come to you,
or did you go to him?

177
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,105
Well, here's a question for you.

178
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,303
Is that thing loaded?

179
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:39,345
What do you think?

180
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,545
It's what it's loaded with
that matters.

181
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:48,545
You swapped in the blanks?

182
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,623
Apologies, everyone. The lad's just
had too much to drink.

183
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,465
Try not to let it spoil
your evening.

184
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,983
Sarge, you're going to want
to log in to Thornton Circus.

185
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,225
We've got something
on Andrew Apsted. Yeah?

186
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,543
Boss.

187
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,903
We've completed cross-checks on
everyone Andrew Apsted served

188
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,863
alongside with in the Army.

189
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,423
Apsted was posted
to Helmand Province

190
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:57,823
with 16 Engineer Regiment in 2009.

191
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:01,063
Now, there were a number
of operations carried out

192
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,943
alongside the Royal Albion Regiment.

193
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,665
And serving in the Royal Albion
at that time was, um...

194
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,583
..was David Budd.

195
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,625
Shit.

196
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,383
Yeah.

197
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,425
Yeah, it gets worse.

198
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,023
Budd went back to Julia Montague's
house and broke in

199
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,863
via the back entrance -
that's unguarded.

200
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,143
I mean, he appears to have keys.

201
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,303
He must've secretly got them cut
when he was her PPO,

202
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:29,543
which is suspicious enough
in itself.

203
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:32,023
I mean, he was only on the premises
for one or two minutes,

204
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,143
which means he knew exactly
what he was after. <font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

205
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:35,185
The kompromat.

206
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:37,665
You were right, boss.

207
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,505
There's been an inside man
all along.

208
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,503
The fucker has played me
since day one.

209
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:45,545
He's played us all.

210
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:49,265
We're going to be the ones
to bring him in.

211
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,985
Let's find the bastard.

212
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:04,463
POLICE RADIO: Observations for
a male wanted in connection

213
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,463
with the murder of Julia Montague.

214
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:11,783
Police Sergeant David Budd,
IC1 male, early 30s, dark hair.

215
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,543
Subject may be armed
and is extremely dangerous.

216
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:18,465
Repeat, David Budd is to be treated
as extremely dangerous.

217
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:29,105
Mrs Budd, do you know the name
Andrew Apsted?

218
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,263
No.

219
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:33,943
Apsted and David served
in Afghanistan together.

220
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,023
Apsted had a history of
post-traumatic stress

221
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,145
and took his own life.

222
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,103
One of our current lines of inquiry
is that Apsted and your

223
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,463
husband were accomplices in
the Thornton Circus attempt

224
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,985
on the Home Secretary's life.

225
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,423
No... No!

226
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,623
Dave would never...

227
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,863
David has lied and lied
to all of us, you included,

228
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:56,265
and our priority now is to bring him
safely into custody.

229
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:00,705
Has he said anything to you that
might shed some light on his plans?

230
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,063
Um...

231
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:05,983
Well, he did say one thing
the last time I saw him,

232
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,543
which really worried me.

233
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:11,423
He said he needed to act now
"before it was too late".

234
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,543
I...

235
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,583
Is he in danger?

236
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,543
Mrs Budd, I believe what David meant
by "before it's too late"

237
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,503
is before his link to Andrew Apsted
was detected.

238
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,263
Hence all the lies
and the betrayals.

239
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:25,943
Now, I'd like you to accompany me
to Walworth Police Station

240
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:27,863
to help with our inquiries, OK?

241
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,423
Vicky, Ella and Charlie are safe
and well, no sightings of David,

242
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,463
but we've dispatched an officer
to the school for

243
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,343
<font color="cyan">safeguarding purposes.</font> No.

244
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:36,983
Dave would never hurt the kids.

245
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,023
Never.

246
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,265
Who would he hurt?

247
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:48,983
Madam, don't be alarmed.

248
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,143
Please can I use your telephone?

249
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:53,385
Please, I just need some help,
ma'am, please.

250
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:59,903
Madam, stop! Police officer.

251
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,223
I understand the state I look.

252
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:02,903
My name's
Police Sergeant David Budd.

253
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,623
Do you have a mobile telephone,
please? Uh...

254
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,823
All I need you to do is call 999
and hold the phone on speaker

255
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:10,463
so I can contact
the Police Operator.

256
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,543
The call's free of charge.

257
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:15,185
Madam, it's an emergency.
Please.

258
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:18,745
Thank you.

259
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,743
<font color="cyan">Emergency, which service
do you require?</font> Police.

260
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,025
Putting you through now.

261
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:28,623
Police, what is your emergency?

262
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,103
PS David Budd, using a member of
the public's phone,

263
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:33,785
I am Status Zero on
Saltmarsh Street.

264
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:37,303
Can you confirm your name, please?

265
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:38,825
Police Sergeant David Budd.

266
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:42,583
Units are on their way, PS Budd.

267
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,185
Please return the phone
to the member of the public.

268
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,545
What's going on?

269
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:55,745
Shit.

270
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,143
Obs on David Budd.

271
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,343
Saltmarsh Street.

272
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,663
Received. Saltmarsh Street,
blue-light it.

273
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,303
What's going on?

274
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,143
I need your full cooperation, Vicky.

275
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:32,505
This could turn into
a negotiation situation.

276
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,345
Control Trojan,
stand by for sit-rep.

277
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,745
Did you see where he went?

278
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,465
Extend the search outwards.

279
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:09,703
Come with me.

280
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:12,385
Trojan sit-rep -
unarmed, clear to enter.

281
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:21,143
Sarge.

282
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,423
PS Mason, ma'am.

283
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,863
Lorraine Craddock, Budd's boss.

284
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:25,783
I'm hoping I can talk him into
cooperating.

285
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:26,825
Ma'am.

286
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:39,263
Ma'am, DS Rayburn, SO15.

287
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,705
I've got Budd's wife with me.

288
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,463
I'm cooperating. Don't shoot!

289
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,303
Armed police! Hands in the air!

<font color="yellow">I can't!</font> David, please do as we say!

292
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,063
No-one needs to get hurt!

293
00:18:58,065 --> 00:18:59,463
I need to explain!

294
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:00,703
Raise your hands!

295
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,223
David, please. Raise your hands!

296
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,703
Final warning!

297
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,705
RAISE YOUR HANDS!

298
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:09,863
Shit!

299
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:10,905
Pull back!

300
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:13,145
Clear the area!

301
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,783
David, don't move!

302
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,503
Stay perfectly still!

303
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,785
It's a dead man's switch!

304
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,423
Anything happens to me,
it'll go off.

305
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,103
Control, active message.

306
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:27,223
RADIO: Go ahead, Trojan.

307
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:28,343
I didn't do this!

308
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:29,423
You need to believe me.

309
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:32,423
Subject armed with PBIED,
require safe route.

310
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,463
We need Expo here and a negotiator.

311
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,505
Ma'am.

312
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:38,303
Control, Charlie Yankee Five Seven,

313
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,703
request Expo and negotiator
to Saltmarsh Street.

314
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,423
I didn't do this!

315
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,303
I was put in this vest!

316
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:47,145
We need to get him away from
all these buildings. <font color="lime">Agreed.</font>

317
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:51,223
We need to move you to
a less built-up area!

318
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,343
It's a DMS.

319
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:53,383
Don't shoot!

320
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,263
You need you to comply right now!

321
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:57,463
I AM COMPLYING! Do not shoot!

322
00:19:57,465 --> 00:20:00,545
Turn around slowly with your hands
in the air.

323
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,623
RADIO: Trojan, route via
Saltmarsh Mews.

324
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,665
Wait!

325
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:12,025
Taking the street to your right,
walk there slowly now.

326
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,223
Control from Trojan, active message.

327
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,945
Request directions to safe area.

328
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,743
Just keep moving.

329
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:24,823
No sudden moves.

330
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,783
RADIO: Trojan, destination is
Pope Square,

331
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:30,143
approximately 500 metres south-west
of your position in Saltmarsh Road.

332
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,383
Armed police, get back!

333
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:36,303
Left turn into Pope Lane, followed
by right turn into Pope Square.

334
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,303
Traffic control and air ops
covering the route.

335
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,583
Received.

336
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:41,625
Keep walking!

337
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,985
Sir, we're just tapping
into the CCTV camera now.

338
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:09,103
Get out of the park!
Keep it moving!

339
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,863
Keep moving.

340
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,425
As far away from the buildings
as possible.

341
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:33,383
Control, Trojan.
Subject now confined to Pope Square.

342
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,583
Require critical shot authorisation.

343
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,545
Received, stand by.

344
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:45,543
He's saying it's trigger-activated.

345
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,863
<font color="lime">Are we safe to get a radio to him?
</font>Ma'am?

346
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:49,823
If we're going to get him
to surrender,

347
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,505
we'll need to be able to talk.

348
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:02,103
David, I'm going to lay the radio
down for you, OK?

349
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,385
Do not move yet!

350
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,025
OK!

351
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,103
Bring the wife, just in case, OK?

352
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,665
Got the radio? Cheers.

353
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,145
Stay still until I tell you.

354
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,945
OK.

355
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,465
Pick up the radio!

356
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:59,263
Back to back on 2.

357
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:02,703
David, please listen to me
very carefully.

358
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:06,103
I really hope this can be resolved
with no-one getting hurt.

359
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:10,503
For your own sake,
for your family and colleagues,

360
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,665
please give yourself up.

361
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:17,063
Ma'am, I've tried
to remove the vest.

362
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,343
It's booby-trapped with co-ax
connectors across the clasps.

363
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:22,503
They're wired to the control unit.

364
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:26,503
I give you my solemn promise
your previous good service

365
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,383
and the effect of your recent
traumatic experiences

366
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:32,303
<font color="lime">will be taken into account.
</font>Ma'am, you're not listening to me.

367
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:35,743
I was knocked unconscious.
When I came round I was in this vest

368
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:37,463
with my thumb taped to the DMS.

369
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:40,063
David, you've got to be
straight with us.

370
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:43,063
You hid your relationship
with Apsted.

371
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:46,383
You hid your involvement in
Julia Montague's assassination.

372
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,463
I had nothing to do with
Julia's assassination, nothing!

373
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:50,783
I tried to save her!

374
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:54,103
David, you've betrayed
everyone's trust.

375
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:56,223
We won't be fooled again.

376
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,305
I'm telling the truth!

377
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:03,943
I'm sorry, David.
I did my best for you.

378
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:07,983
What? Your best? What are you doing?

379
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,943
This is an SO15 operation.

380
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,745
Ma'am, what are you doing?

381
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:16,545
David, let's try
and stay calm, yeah?

382
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,583
David, are you receiving me?

383
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,223
Vic, get away from here!

384
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,025
<font color="cyan">Dave, they want me here.
</font><font color="yellow">Get away!</font>

385
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,783
Just get Expo here, Louise,
please, get me out of this thing.

386
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:32,183
Stay still and keep your hands
where we can see them.

387
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,343
My hand is on the DMS.

388
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,863
What's the matter with you?
Are you blind?

389
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,583
No, David.

390
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,143
I'm being set up!

391
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,663
The people that did this to me,
they're the ones who killed Julia!

392
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,465
OK, David.

393
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:51,703
Louise, I know I betrayed
your trust.

394
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,663
I lied about Andy Apsted.

395
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,743
But if I'd come clean,
I'd have been the fall guy

396
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,583
and the people
that really killed Julia

397
00:24:57,585 --> 00:25:00,463
would have gotten away with it.
I didn't wanted to lie. I had to!

398
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,503
David, please,
just do what they say!

399
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:03,743
She's fine.

400
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,743
David, you need help, please!

401
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:07,505
Vic, I'm telling the truth!

402
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,543
Trojan, Control.

403
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,943
Go ahead, Control.

404
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,543
Message from SFC.

405
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,823
Critical shot authorised.

406
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,625
Received.

407
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,985
Line of fire, behind me.

408
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:31,183
I know I lied, I hid things,
but you have to understand

409
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,423
I had nothing to do with
Andy trying to kill Julia.

410
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,263
Nothing to do with the bomb
that killed her.

411
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,943
I wanted to know who did it.

412
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:38,663
I don't know who did it!

413
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:41,943
It was Security Service,
Organised Crime, terrorism -

414
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,825
that's what I was trying
to find out.

415
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,023
Pictures up.

416
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:51,223
RADIO: Also an SO15 DS
awaiting Silver to Status Six.

417
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:53,623
Control, Silver seconds away.

418
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,503
<font color="cyan">Get me live with the field.</font> Sir.

419
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,823
DAVID: I know you think I'm lying...

420
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,983
Any RT revealing
what he's told them so far?

421
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:02,223
No, sir. Get this blown up.

422
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:05,423
Sir. ..the conspiracy, whatever,
to kill Julia.

423
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:08,103
There was security pictures
of St Matthew's College.

424
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,823
They knew about
the Home Secretary's itinerary.

425
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:12,343
By me, sir.

426
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:14,703
<font color="yellow">Silver, Status Six.
</font><font color="lime">Control, received.</font>

427
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,903
Boss. Any idea what kind of
explosive's in the device?

428
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,023
Not yet, no, boss,

429
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:21,583
and I wouldn't hold much store
in Budd's answers either.

430
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:23,703
It's been a stream of bullshit
since day one.

431
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:26,583
All right, Louise, I hear you, but
let's lower the temperature a bit.

432
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,425
<font color="cyan">What channel?</font> Two.

433
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,423
David, Deepak Sharma, receiving?

434
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,025
Receiving.

435
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:36,625
What can you tell us
about the PBIED?

436
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,983
It resembles the device
worn by Nadia Ali

437
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:42,745
during the 1st of October attack.

438
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,623
How can you be so sure?

439
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,023
I saw hers up close
before it was con-exed.

440
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,383
The HE, the detonators,
the control unit.

441
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:52,263
Mine appear exactly the same.

442
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:55,023
You understand our doubts here,
mate? Our inquiries have led us to

443
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:57,143
the probability of an inside man
within the force

444
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,343
who conspired in
the security breaches necessary

445
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:00,983
to assassinate the Home Secretary.

446
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,983
I'm not the inside man!

447
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,983
But here you are,
wearing the exact same PBIED

448
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,625
employed by an active terror cell.

449
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,223
This is how it happened, sir.

450
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,663
I was contacted by Chanel Dyson.

451
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:15,583
She set a trap. I was ambushed by
Luke Aikens and put into this vest,

452
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,703
to frame me, to point the finger
away from Organised Crime.

453
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:21,423
You keep asking us to believe you,
David, and now you're telling us

454
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,943
you're arranging a secret meeting
with one of the suspects.

455
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:26,783
I was trying to trace
Andy Apsted's PSL rifle!

456
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:28,423
It was supplied by Luke Aikens.

457
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,383
It was his men
that broke into my flat.

458
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:31,823
Why do you think that, David?

459
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:34,343
I used a pistol I brought back
from Afghanistan as bait.

460
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,343
Luke knew all about it.
Knew it had been tampered with.

461
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:42,143
Look, ask Vic. She knows.

462
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,663
She knows! She'll prove
that I'm telling the truth.

463
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,185
Vicky, will you tell him?

464
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:50,023
He's telling the truth.

465
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,423
The pistol,
someone tampered with the bullets,

466
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:54,023
they replaced them with blanks.

467
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,545
How do you know this?

468
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:58,823
After the Home Secretary died,

469
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,783
David tried to shoot himself.

470
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:03,303
But, look, why would Dave
try and shoot himself with a blank,

471
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,743
unless he didn't realise the gun
had been tampered with?

472
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:07,345
Thank you.

473
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:11,903
David, clearly we need
to look into this further.

474
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:13,983
But we're being told
that you're suicidal,

475
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,863
and now here you are
in a suicide vest.

476
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:19,143
No, no, no! That's not it,
that's not the point here!

477
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,663
Where's this pistol now, mate?
You got it with you?

478
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:23,983
No, Luke's men seized it
before they fitted the vest.

479
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,743
Look, forget the pistol, it's
the blank rounds that are proof.

480
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,823
I've still got them.
They're hidden in my flat.

481
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:30,223
Maybe you can pull DNA,

482
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:32,863
prints from them that are going
to link it back to Luke's men.

483
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:34,823
All this evidence
you've kept hidden.

484
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:38,223
We know you broke into
Julia Montague's flat.

485
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:41,503
Led me up the garden path
on that one, too.

486
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,623
I am sorry about that, Louise.
I had to.

487
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,103
I couldn't risk what I found
being common knowledge.

488
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:49,663
Why, David? Why couldn't you
trust your colleagues?

489
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:52,585
Because of the conspiracy.
Because of the Security Service.

490
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:56,783
I found where Julia
hid the kompromat.

491
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,263
<font color="lime">Phone.</font> The tablet.

492
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:00,705
Where is it, David?

493
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:06,105
My flat, downstairs,
in the bathroom, above a spotlight.

494
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,983
Budd's flat. Downstairs bathroom.
Above a spotlight.

495
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,303
Seconds away.

496
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,983
Budd's flat. Turn right.

497
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:17,623
Do you give consent to search?

498
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,383
Yes, sir.

499
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,343
Control, Silver,
I need a search team

500
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,425
<font color="cyan">to David Budd's address immediately.
</font><font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

501
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,065
They're changing radio channels.

502
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:47,183
Security Service
may be monitoring this,

503
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,063
so do not share via
any regular channels.

504
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:51,303
Advise search team not to tamper
with the spotlight,

505
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:53,145
to hold back from entering
the property.

506
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:57,503
Received.

507
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,103
What's the message? What's Budd say?

508
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:01,105
Sorry, sir,
they're too quick for us.

509
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,263
Aaah! Aah!

510
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:22,583
Armed police!

511
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:24,823
<font color="lime">Get down on the ground!
</font><font color="yellow">Hands where I can see them.</font>

512
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,303
<font color="lime">Down on the ground!</font> Search him!

513
00:30:26,305 --> 00:30:27,625
Don't move!

514
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,263
One in custody.

515
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,625
Matching e-fit of Richard Longcross.

516
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,065
Fuck.

517
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,665
Hold Expo.

518
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,105
They need to get this thing off me!

519
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:55,023
I would if I could, mate,
but you know the drill.

520
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:57,823
There's a risk you'll trigger
the device to take them with you.

521
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:00,383
I don't want anyone here
getting hurt.

522
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:03,265
My hand's aching on this DMS!

523
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,665
I want to talk to my wife.

524
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:11,383
It might be the last chance I get.

525
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:12,785
Please.

526
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,145
Go set to set on 3.

527
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,945
Press here when you want to talk.

528
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,303
I've let you down, Vic, I know that.

529
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,663
But on our children's lives,
I'm not a traitor

530
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:35,945
and I had nothing to do
with Julia's murder.

531
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,505
I'm sorry for
what I've put you through.

532
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:44,585
I'm sorry I've stopped being
the man you married.

533
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:48,903
I've tried to explain,

534
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:52,025
but part of me never wants to
explain what the war did to me.

535
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,383
I never wanted it to touch you,
or us,

536
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:58,703
but it has.

537
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,945
I tried to stop it, but I couldn't.

538
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:08,463
I've failed as a husband,
and as a father,

539
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:10,183
and that's the worst thing.

540
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:11,865
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:16,145
Help him! Why won't you help him?

542
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,105
Please.

543
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,545
Let me examine the device, sir.

544
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:32,623
OK.

545
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,903
Thank you, thank you!

546
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:35,625
Ballistic shields.

547
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:46,265
With me.

548
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:55,705
Any sudden moves,
any shout from me, take him out.

549
00:32:57,545 --> 00:32:58,825
Hold.

550
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:12,943
My name's Daniel Chung.

551
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:16,903
I'm going to begin by
examining this device. Thank you.

552
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:18,423
I'm David.

553
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:19,983
David...

554
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:23,105
..remain perfectly still
with your hands facing me.

555
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,383
Apart from the dead man's switch,

556
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:28,743
are there any other
initiation devices?

557
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:31,103
To the best of my knowledge, no.

558
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:33,545
David, keep pressure on the DMS.

559
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:38,583
I need you to turn very slowly
through 360 degrees

560
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,905
so I can inspect the whole device.

561
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,263
Thank you.

562
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:17,745
I don't see any
hidden initiation devices.

563
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:21,465
Now I'm going to carry out
a closer examination.

564
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:25,503
Please remain completely still,
maintaining pressure on the DMS.

565
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:26,905
I will.

566
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:36,303
The co-ax wires across the clasps
are wired into the control unit.

567
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:39,183
I'm going to examine
the control unit now.

568
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:41,263
Please remain perfectly still
for me, David,

569
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:43,065
maintaining pressure on the DMS.

570
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:21,503
David, I've completed
my examination,

571
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:23,743
and now I need to confer with
my colleagues.

572
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,303
Stay here,
remaining perfectly still,

573
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,865
and keep maintaining pressure
on the DMS.

574
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,745
No. Come back.

575
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:36,343
Come back!

576
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:47,103
<font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font> Ma'am.

577
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,183
Great work on getting Longcross
into custody. <font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font> Well done.

578
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:53,025
Budd's device appears to be the work
of the original bomb-maker.

579
00:35:56,945 --> 00:36:01,743
It's impossible to tell if he put it
on himself or someone did it to him.

580
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,143
I read the report on
the 1/10 device.

581
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:06,023
This is equally sophisticated.

582
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,023
Can it be defused?

583
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:11,665
I can try, but there's an extremely
high risk of detonation.

584
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:14,825
What's happening?

585
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:19,463
This is Anne Sampson, David.

586
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:22,783
Tell us, are there other bombers
at large?

587
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:24,863
Not that I know of.

588
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:26,905
Are further attacks planned?

589
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,223
I don't know.

590
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,903
Who built the device you're wearing?

591
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:34,943
Ma'am, this wasn't my doing.

592
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,705
I don't know who built it.

593
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:44,663
We've got no idea of the power
of the device

594
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,543
or how long he can hold the DMS.

595
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:48,823
Added to which, Budd's got a history
of deception

596
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:51,063
and is highly likely to be
the inside man

597
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,905
who's enabled this conspiracy.

598
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:00,623
Get everyone to pull back
outside the cordons

599
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,145
and then we'll re-spin the wheel.

600
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:07,183
Deepak.

601
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:08,343
Ma'am.

602
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:09,903
Everyone pull back!

603
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,145
Pull back.

604
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:15,583
David.

605
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,543
Please!

606
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,023
Mrs Budd.

607
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:20,903
I'm innocent! Please!

608
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,623
You're killing me!

609
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,663
Pull back to a safe distance,
please.

610
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,185
I love you.

611
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:29,943
See what she's up to?

612
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:32,943
All the easier to pin everything
on David when he's dead.

613
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:35,105
She's the one with links
to Luke Aikens.

614
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,145
Quick as you can.

615
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,383
If I stay put,
she'll order the shot.

616
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:49,025
If I run, she'll do the same.

617
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:53,705
No! Stop! Stop her!

618
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,943
Vicky, no! <font color="lime">Hold fire! Hold fire!
</font>Vic, it's too dangerous.

619
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,383
That's Charlie and Ella
losing the both of us.

620
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:02,863
I believe you, Dave,
I believe that you're innocent.

621
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,783
This gives you a chance to prove it.

622
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:08,585
Trojan to TFC, subject's wife now
in close proximity to device.

623
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:15,703
Trojan, TFC.
SFC rescinds critical shot.

624
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:17,305
Off aim!

625
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,745
Budd to Sampson.

626
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,263
Sampson.

627
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,463
I'll lead you to the evidence
that proves I'm telling the truth.

628
00:38:31,465 --> 00:38:33,823
Stay where you are.

629
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:35,025
What now?

630
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:37,983
Stay close.

631
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,265
We walk.

632
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:42,265
David!

633
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:45,663
David!

634
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:47,425
DAVID!

635
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:55,303
Mobile containment -
100 metres rolling cordon.

636
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:58,063
Red team with me.
Get traffic control in place

637
00:38:58,065 --> 00:39:00,825
<font color="lime">to create a safety corridor.
</font><font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font>

638
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:05,823
Help us out here, mate.
Where are you going?

639
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:07,223
My flat.

640
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:08,625
Long walk ahead.

641
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,343
The incident began
earlier this morning

642
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:19,343
with reports of a man wearing
a suicide vest

643
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:22,063
causing a disturbance
in Saltmarsh Street.

644
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:24,223
Specialist Firearms Officers

645
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:28,223
of the Metropolitan Police's
counter-terrorism unit, SCO19,

646
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,063
attended the incident
within a few minutes

647
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:32,703
and the area was closed
to the public.

648
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,383
The incident moved to Pope Square...

649
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:37,223
You had the whole situation
locked down.

650
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,663
We've got an innocent civilian
in harm's way

651
00:39:39,665 --> 00:39:42,903
and Budd claims to be leading us
to crucial evidence.

652
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:45,023
He's making for his home address.

653
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:48,263
Armed units are in situ
and residents are being evacuated.

654
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:51,303
Air Ops are also conducting
neighbourhood surveillance

655
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,103
for possible associates.
So far, none detected.

656
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,543
Then who's he working with?

657
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:59,983
We've established a link to Andrew
Apsted, the Thornton Circus sniper.

658
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:01,745
I see.

659
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:04,425
Ah.

660
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,943
You never said you were including
the Security Service.

661
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:14,065
Anne, Anne,
we're all in this together.

662
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,623
Stephen?

663
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,463
You may be interested to hear my
officers have taken into custody

664
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,383
a male suspect matching
the e-fit of Richard Longcross.

665
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,383
And we're currently exploring
a number of lines of inquiry

666
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:34,063
in association with the suspect,

667
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:39,863
such as places of work and seizure
of communications devices.

668
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:43,703
I can neither confirm nor deny
the suspect's identity,

669
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:47,463
but what I can confirm is that
the requisite authorities apply

670
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,583
which render his actions lawful.

671
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,863
He should be released immediately.

672
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:54,943
There are certain actions for which
there are no lawful authorities,

673
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,623
one being the assassination of

674
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,143
a democratically elected
secretary of state.

675
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:02,505
Anne, please.
Cool heads and cooperation.

676
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:10,183
This "cooperation" - is it due
to Budd's compromising material

677
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:12,183
giving you both so much to lose

678
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:15,263
that you never want its existence
revealed?

679
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,863
Because it would show the hand
of the Security Service

680
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:21,663
in a failed coup, and despite
your convincing assurances

681
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,383
that the Home Office's role
in Julia Montague's death

682
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,543
was purely accidental,

683
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:29,223
I wonder if the public
will be equally convinced?

684
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,545
OK, Anne, I think it's best if
Stephen and I continue without you.

685
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,945
A woman was murdered.

686
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:39,543
A crime was committed.

687
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:41,505
My officers will investigate.

688
00:41:45,025 --> 00:41:46,545
Thanks.

689
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:56,303
I've sought a court order
for my officer's release.

690
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,745
Good.

691
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:01,543
Budd claims to hold
crucial evidence.

692
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:04,343
He was working with
the Thornton Circus sniper.

693
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:08,863
Andrew Apsted was a disturbed,
embittered war veteran.

694
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:12,023
Not only does Budd
fit the same profile,

695
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:16,503
he possessed all the inside know-how
to overcome Julia's security.

696
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:19,505
No wider conspiracy involved.

697
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:25,263
Look no further
for Julia's assassin.

698
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:27,825
..an evacuation is taking place.

699
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:00,625
How are you doing?

700
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,785
My hand's in spasm.

701
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:33,985
You need to go inside.

702
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:36,825
It's OK. It's completely safe.

703
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:40,183
Cupboard in the kitchen.
There's some rope.

704
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:41,583
Rope? What for?

705
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,265
And a spade.

706
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:17,223
There's something down here -
like a black plastic bag.

707
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:18,785
That's it, Vic.

708
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:28,183
This is the evidence.

709
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:30,463
The original tablet
containing the kompromat.

710
00:44:30,465 --> 00:44:32,983
It'll prove the Security Service
was involved.

711
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:35,463
The blank rounds that were
smuggled into my pistol,

712
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,625
they'll prove Organised Crime were,
too.

713
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:45,383
Send Vicky to us with the evidence.

714
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:47,145
If I go, they can shoot you.

715
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:53,385
I don't know how much longer
I can hold the DMS.

716
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,423
This vest is crucial evidence.
The others all got blown up.

717
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:00,223
If forensics got a chance
to examine this,

718
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:02,703
it might lead us back to
the bomb-maker.

719
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,583
Prevent further attacks.

720
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:06,503
He's bargaining, boss,
he's playing you.

721
00:45:06,505 --> 00:45:08,983
Or he's giving us the chance
to crack this case.

722
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:12,143
I'll send Vicky to you
with the evidence.

723
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:14,463
No, Dave, don't fall for it.

724
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:17,545
If you give me a chance
to defuse this.

725
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:21,825
How do you know I'll keep my side?

726
00:45:24,265 --> 00:45:27,065
I've been a soldier,
I've been a copper.

727
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,705
You get to spot a bloke
whose word's his bond.

728
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,183
You happy to let him try?

729
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:37,905
I wouldn't say "happy".

730
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:40,905
Robot.

731
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:52,545
Vicky.

732
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:57,025
How are things with your boyfriend?

733
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:01,585
All right.

734
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:04,825
You deserve to be happy.

735
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:23,903
I've laid out what you'll need.

736
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:27,625
The robot's coming up to you,
so I can talk you through it.

737
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:29,665
Thank you.

738
00:46:32,385 --> 00:46:33,425
Go.

739
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,625
RADIO: Question for DCI Sharma.

740
00:46:56,985 --> 00:46:58,225
Go ahead.

741
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:01,985
Is Longcross talking yet?

742
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:05,145
I don't know.

743
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:09,865
It'd help, sir, if I knew
this hadn't all been in vain.

744
00:47:12,785 --> 00:47:15,583
We'll get back to you on that.
To me, Vicky.

745
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:16,625
Thanks.

746
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:22,985
I'll get an update on Longcross.

747
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,503
We've got picture.

748
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,985
Can you hear me?
Receiving.

749
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,063
Get Vicky away.

750
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:43,545
She shouldn't have to watch.

751
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:49,705
Mrs Budd...

752
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,503
I'm not going to manage
with one hand.

753
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:18,663
We'll start by freeing
your left hand.

754
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:20,145
You'll see a set of scissors.

755
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:28,105
Use it to divide the tape over your
thumb, creating two loose ends.

756
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,065
Next you'll see
a non-ferrous spacer.

757
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:58,345
It looks like one of the pieces
in a game of draughts.

758
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:07,423
Slip the spacer under your thumb,

759
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:10,025
being sure to maintain pressure
on the DMS trigger.

760
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:24,983
Being sure to maintain pressure,
roll your thumb through 90 degrees

761
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:28,705
so you can fold one of the free ends
of tape down onto the spacer.

762
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:39,143
The next stage is to roll your thumb
in the opposite direction,

763
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:43,825
over the piece of tape you've just
secured, maintaining pressure...

764
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:52,105
..so that you can fold the other
free end of tape to the spacer.

765
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:02,623
If you're sure the tape is secure,

766
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,705
you'll be able to remove your thumb.

767
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:19,825
Well done, David.

768
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:24,223
I'd suggest applying another
couple of loops of tape to get

769
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:25,945
the spacer 100% secure.

770
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:40,425
David, normally the best approach
is to neutralise the power source.

771
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,983
But remember, with the 1/10 device,

772
00:50:43,985 --> 00:50:47,065
Fort Halstead found it was rigged
with multiple booby traps.

773
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,945
When the power was cut, the control
unit triggered the detonators.

774
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:55,505
I'm convinced this is
the same kind of device.

775
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:01,745
Then you're going to have to
neutralise the control unit itself.

776
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,943
I've already removed
the cover successfully,

777
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:07,785
but there may be hidden trip wires.

778
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,585
Thanks, mate,
that's giving us a good view.

779
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,663
Now, what do you suggest?

780
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:21,865
I doubt a device like this will be
neutralised by cutting a wire.

781
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,623
A shunt might work.

782
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,423
Hence the croc clips and cable?

783
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:30,465
Yeah.

784
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:41,985
I can see a pair of relay blocks
serving the detonators.

785
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,905
I'm going to shunt between the two.

786
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:20,385
Right, I'm going to disconnect
the power supply.

787
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:27,465
I'm cutting the first wire.

788
00:52:51,265 --> 00:52:52,425
Oh...

789
00:52:58,985 --> 00:53:00,425
Put some tape over the ends.

790
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,263
Question for DCI Sharma.

791
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:08,623
Go ahead.

792
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,145
Any news on Longcross?

793
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:20,143
Sir?

794
00:53:20,145 --> 00:53:21,623
I'm very sorry, David.

795
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,145
He had to be released.

796
00:53:24,425 --> 00:53:25,465
Is that it?

797
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:29,065
They just get away with it
scot-free?

798
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:39,823
I'm going to cut the second wire.

799
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:42,743
Everyone should get
as far back as possible.

800
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:44,705
<font color="cyan">Everyone back.
Take cover.</font> Fall back.

801
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:55,663
<font color="yellow">Get everyone right back!
</font><font color="lime">Move back! Move back!</font>

802
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,305
<font color="yellow">Get right back!
</font><font color="lime">All of you, move.</font>

803
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:05,185
OK.

804
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:33,065
After him!
Go! Go! Go!!

805
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,983
No obs on Budd in the graveyard.

806
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:56,263
Widen the search.
Lock off all surrounding roads.

807
00:54:56,265 --> 00:54:58,183
Negative, no obs.

808
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,145
Negative. We lost him.

809
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:04,063
Minister.

810
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,105
Where's Budd?

811
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:09,623
I'm afraid I don't have that
information at this time.

812
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:10,905
What's he up to?

813
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:15,903
In all probability,
he's fleeing from justice.

814
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:17,305
And what if he's not?

815
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:54,343
That'll kill you.

816
00:55:54,345 --> 00:55:55,385
Oh, my God!

817
00:55:57,545 --> 00:55:59,823
So would a suicide vest.

818
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:01,383
Oh, my God. You're OK.

819
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:02,785
Like you give a shit.

820
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:07,423
I don't... I don't even know what
to say to you. I'm so sorry.

821
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:10,543
Co-operate, you'll get immunity,
witness protection.

822
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:14,063
You'll be out. <font color="lime">I can't do that.
</font>You're going to phone Luke.

823
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:16,303
You're going to tell him the Inside
Man's going to talk.

824
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:17,703
He's going to want to silence him.

825
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,383
He's going to lead me straight
to him.

826
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:21,663
Isn't Luke going to find that
a bit suspicious?

827
00:56:21,665 --> 00:56:23,185
It's what you did to me.

828
00:56:26,265 --> 00:56:28,305
It's the only way to prove
I'm innocent.

829
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:40,945
I'll drive.

830
00:57:31,465 --> 00:57:32,505
Stay put.

831
00:57:57,825 --> 00:57:59,345
Are you off somewhere?

832
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:06,183
None of your business.

833
00:58:06,185 --> 00:58:08,705
<font color="lime">Talking of which...
</font>I pay for results.

834
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:12,183
Budd is still out there.

835
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,503
It's a basic rule, Lorraine -

836
00:58:13,505 --> 00:58:16,143
if you're going to frame someone,
you make it the dead bloke.

837
00:58:16,145 --> 00:58:17,783
That's hardly my fault.

838
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,865
No, but it's made you nervous.

839
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:30,503
On your knees, hands on your head.

840
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:32,185
Are you fucking joking?

841
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:36,063
Stand down, Sarge, that's an order.

842
00:58:36,065 --> 00:58:37,425
I know about you, too.

843
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,825
On your knees!

844
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:45,785
Hands.

845
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:48,585
Hands.

846
00:58:55,585 --> 00:58:56,705
Did you kill her?

847
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,385
Did you kill Julia?

848
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,943
David, don't do this.

849
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:06,985
Tell me.

850
00:59:09,905 --> 00:59:11,065
It was business.

851
00:59:12,705 --> 00:59:13,983
David, don't!

852
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,025
Why?

853
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:18,463
Just good for business.

854
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:20,105
It's nothing personal.

855
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:22,745
Nothing personal.

856
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:25,025
David, don't.

857
00:59:27,745 --> 00:59:30,023
Argh!

858
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:34,505
Don't look at me.

859
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:45,065
Call this in
before I change my mind.

860
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,505
It's over.

861
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:05,263
Chief Superintendent Craddock.

862
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:08,465
I need a firearms unit to my home
address right away, please.

863
01:00:18,905 --> 01:00:21,825
We've got prints back on
your blank rounds.

864
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,745
They match known associates
of Luke Aikens.

865
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:33,185
Why didn't they just steal your gun?

866
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:37,863
Straightaway I'd have known
they'd been in my flat.

867
01:00:37,865 --> 01:00:40,863
They were trying to frame me.

868
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:42,783
Suppose they couldn't take the
chance

869
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:44,385
of leaving me with live rounds.

870
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:51,345
Cheers.

871
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:00,065
Great work, mate.

872
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:10,745
SO15 recorded interview with Chief
Superintendent Lorraine Craddock
by DCI Sharma.

873
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:17,145
Describe the nature of your
relationship with Luke Aikens.

874
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,785
For some years I've...

875
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:32,545
..disclosed sensitive
information on...

876
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:39,705
..on police operations that might
threaten his criminal activities.

877
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:44,745
What information did you disclose
regarding the Home Secretary?

878
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:57,465
Her itinerary the day of the
Thornton Circus attempt on her life.

879
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:01,665
Which Aikens passed
to Andrew Apsted?

880
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:09,105
Luke recruited Apsted.

881
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:15,945
He armed him and...

882
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,665
..used one of his
captive businesses to...

883
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,943
..enable Apsted to access
Pascoe House as a tradesman.

884
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,625
And the St Matthew's attack that
resulted in the Home Secretary's
death?

885
01:02:42,985 --> 01:02:44,025
Erm...

886
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:46,865
Her itinerary.

887
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,545
Her security plans and procedures.

888
01:02:56,385 --> 01:02:57,985
Luke was able to...

889
01:03:00,185 --> 01:03:03,145
..plan steps to overcome
all of them.

890
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:09,905
What motivated Aikens to induce you
to disclose this information?

891
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:23,743
Luke found out Julia Montague was
planning to transfer powers

892
01:03:23,745 --> 01:03:26,745
to the Security Service
which would give them...

893
01:03:29,465 --> 01:03:30,823
..an upper hand,

894
01:03:30,825 --> 01:03:33,185
more of an upper hand
against organised crime.

895
01:03:35,785 --> 01:03:38,625
They're harder to contact,
more shadowy, therefore...

896
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:49,503
..harder to bribe and blackmail.

897
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:52,225
Unlike corrupt officers
such as yourself.

898
01:03:56,185 --> 01:04:01,663
Aikens needed policing to stay with
an organisation he could manipulate.

899
01:04:01,665 --> 01:04:05,143
Is there any connection with you
appointing David Budd as the

900
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,825
Home Secretary's PPO?

901
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:12,223
Yes.

902
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:14,385
So he'd make the perfect fall guy.

903
01:04:16,505 --> 01:04:18,703
And the Heath Bank attack.

904
01:04:18,705 --> 01:04:22,783
Did you provide the confidential
information on PS Budd's family?

905
01:04:22,785 --> 01:04:27,545
No, never, I'd never do anything
like that to one of my team.

906
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:31,703
If she didn't do it, who did?

907
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:35,703
Lorraine Craddock, I will now be
seeking the authority of the
Crown Prosecutor to charge you...

908
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,863
There's one other person in this
whole conspiracy

909
01:04:37,865 --> 01:04:39,103
that knew about my kids.

910
01:04:39,105 --> 01:04:41,103
..malfeasance in a public office

911
01:04:41,105 --> 01:04:42,745
and conspiracy to murder.

912
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:46,345
Interview terminated.

913
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,743
NEWS: Ten days since the
assassination of Julia Montague,

914
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:01,623
the Metropolitan Police
have announced...

915
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,103
The Metropolitan Police
Counter Terrorism Branch, SO15,

916
01:05:04,105 --> 01:05:05,503
have made a number of arrests...

917
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:08,143
Arrests include a man in his 30s
who is said to be known to police,

918
01:05:08,145 --> 01:05:09,343
and a woman in her 50s also...

919
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:11,903
Downing Street and the Home Office
have welcomed the police

920
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:15,623
breakthrough in investigating the
Home Secretary's assassination.

921
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:19,305
A Home Office spokesman said it was
too early to make any further
comment.

922
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:26,463
David.

923
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:27,505
Good to go.

924
01:05:32,585 --> 01:05:34,065
The DIR is recording.

925
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:42,505
Nadia.

926
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,505
I'd like to start by asking
you about David Budd.

927
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:53,105
Did you have any information
regarding his children?

928
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:55,705
No.

929
01:05:57,065 --> 01:05:58,423
Why are you asking me this?

930
01:05:58,425 --> 01:06:01,545
Nadia, we've had significant
breakthroughs in our inquiry.

931
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:06,503
There's only one piece of
the puzzle left.

932
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:07,825
And that's you.

933
01:06:09,905 --> 01:06:12,705
And maybe you're just an innocent
victim in all of this.

934
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:17,665
The pawn controlled
by the real masterminds.

935
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:20,745
You can say, "No comment."

936
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:34,785
Is that true? Are you just a victim?

937
01:06:52,865 --> 01:06:55,145
David Budd made the same mistake.

938
01:06:56,705 --> 01:06:59,663
He thought so little of me,
he showed me pictures.

939
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:03,023
What do you mean,
"Thought so little of you"?

940
01:07:03,025 --> 01:07:04,705
To him, I was a weak woman.

941
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:10,343
I remembered everything he told me
about his children.

942
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:11,463
Their names.

943
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,983
Their ages.

944
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,663
From prison, I was able to
inform my organisation.

945
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,663
So they could launch an attack on
his children's school?

946
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:19,705
Yes.

947
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:25,105
There's another finding
I'd like to put to you.

948
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:29,383
We've been able to examine the
Person-Borne Improvised

949
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:32,105
Explosive Device David Budd
was forced to wear.

950
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:36,663
Forensic examination of the control
unit circuitry detected

951
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:40,145
deposits of your DNA
and your fingerprints.

952
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:43,905
Why would that be?

953
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:50,665
Because I built the device.

954
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:57,025
I built all the bombs.

955
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:02,185
You all saw me as a poor,
oppressed Muslim woman.

956
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,985
I am an engineer.

957
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:07,305
I am a Jihadi.

958
01:08:08,745 --> 01:08:09,785
Which bombs?

959
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:15,943
The one used to kill
the Home Secretary,

960
01:08:15,945 --> 01:08:20,183
the one used to kill police officers
at Heath Bank School,

961
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:22,345
the one I wore on
the 1st of October.

962
01:08:24,345 --> 01:08:28,945
So you're telling us this man didn't
supply the bomb to your husband?

963
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:37,063
I invented that story because
Police Sergeant Budd was so eager to

964
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:38,743
believe it.

965
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:41,223
And so stupidly eager to believe me.

966
01:08:41,225 --> 01:08:43,983
You made that up to
mislead our inquiry?

967
01:08:43,985 --> 01:08:47,583
How easy that was.
You are all so easy...

968
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:51,025
It wasn't just you, mate,
we all fell for it.

969
01:08:54,105 --> 01:08:57,465
Who planted the device
at St Matthew's College?

970
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,705
The one that killed
the Home Secretary.

971
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:04,905
Non-believers.

972
01:09:05,905 --> 01:09:06,945
Criminals.

973
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:09,585
Luke Aikens?

974
01:09:10,665 --> 01:09:11,705
Yes.

975
01:09:13,425 --> 01:09:16,383
Why did you conspire
with non-believers?

976
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,103
For money.

977
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:21,863
Money to build more bombs and buy
more guns and spread the

978
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,423
truth to our brothers and sisters
throughout the world.

979
01:09:24,425 --> 01:09:26,783
So that the world could be convinced
that we had put a sword

980
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:28,703
through the heart of the
British Government.

981
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:32,985
You failed to detonate your own
PBIED on the October 1st rail
attack.

982
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:36,903
You couldn't go through with it.

983
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:38,585
But look how I have atoned.

984
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:42,785
I have helped the cause
a thousand times more.

985
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,663
Sophie, we are being told
that a statement by the

986
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:52,543
Prime Minister is imminent.

987
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:55,463
Meanwhile, all day, ministers have
been giving their reactions

988
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:58,143
to this morning's news that the
Prime Minister cancelled

989
01:09:58,145 --> 01:09:59,583
today's engagements.

990
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:02,103
Home Secretary,
any reaction on the breaking news?

991
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:05,343
Really, please, we should avoid
speculation until the

992
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:08,583
Prime Minister's had the opportunity
to address the allegations himself.

993
01:10:08,585 --> 01:10:11,143
Yes. Come in.

994
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:14,063
Just to remind you, today's events
follow unconfirmed reports of a leak

995
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:18,223
of compromising material relating to
the Prime Minister's past.

996
01:10:18,225 --> 01:10:21,023
Is the Prime Minister going
to resign?

997
01:10:21,025 --> 01:10:24,985
I'm just getting on with the job
of protecting our country.

998
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:29,663
Thank you.
Home Secretary? Home Secretary?

999
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:32,303
It's also being reported that the
leak implicates the

1000
01:10:32,305 --> 01:10:37,463
Director General of the Security
Service, Stephen Hunter-Dunn...

1001
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:40,943
The Prime Minister will resign
before the day is out.

1002
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,183
Hunter-Dunn the same.

1003
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:47,263
Mike Travis, he stays on to make
sure RIPA-18 gets kicked into

1004
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:48,345
the long grass.

1005
01:10:49,305 --> 01:10:51,543
Leaking the kompromat.

1006
01:10:51,545 --> 01:10:53,265
Whose decision was that?

1007
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:59,545
I couldn't possibly say.

1008
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:08,943
Thanks to you, David, the CPS have
charged Nadia Ali, Luke Aikens

1009
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:13,903
and Lorraine Craddock in the
Conspiracy to Murder Julia Montague.

1010
01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:16,663
Some say you should get a medal.

1011
01:11:16,665 --> 01:11:20,103
Others reckon you should be
kicked off the Force.

1012
01:11:20,105 --> 01:11:22,103
We'll see.

1013
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:26,223
There'll need to be a thorough
investigation into your conduct.

1014
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:30,665
But first, David, there's something
you need more than all of that.

1015
01:11:34,985 --> 01:11:36,025
Come in.

1016
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:41,465
<font color="lime">Hello.</font> Hello.

1017
01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:49,985
I am David.

1018
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:55,505
And I...

1019
01:11:59,305 --> 01:12:00,745
I need some help.

1020
01:12:24,825 --> 01:12:26,145
Hi. Hey.

1021
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:28,905
Come in.

1022
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,383
How are you doing?

1023
01:12:34,385 --> 01:12:36,223
I'm good.

1024
01:12:36,225 --> 01:12:37,265
How are you?

1025
01:12:39,185 --> 01:12:41,303
I'm getting there.

1026
01:12:41,305 --> 01:12:43,585
Well, you've taken the first step.

1027
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,225
I'm really proud of you.

1028
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,703
Yeah. The kids are looking forward
to sleeping in their own beds again.

1029
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:54,543
I bet.

1030
01:12:54,545 --> 01:12:56,543
I was thinking,

1031
01:12:56,545 --> 01:12:59,945
it's actually my turn for them again
but only if that's OK with you.

1032
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:02,265
Yeah.

1033
01:13:03,465 --> 01:13:05,303
Kids, your dad's here.

1034
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:06,383
Dad.

1035
01:13:06,385 --> 01:13:08,423
No train journeys this time.

1036
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,745
<font color="yellow">Dad.
</font><font color="lime">Hello, princess.</font>

1037
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,943
There's a monster on my back.
Get him off, get him off!

1038
01:13:15,945 --> 01:13:18,225
OK. You behave.
You have fun.

1039
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:28,705
D'you...

1040
01:13:30,905 --> 01:13:32,583
What?

1041
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:33,625
Nothing.

1042
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:36,865
There's...

1043
01:13:38,425 --> 01:13:39,785
There's room for one more.

1044
01:13:42,265 --> 01:13:43,943
Yeah?

1045
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:44,985
Yeah.

1046
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:48,983
OK.

1047
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:50,145
I'll get my bag.

1048
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,623
Mummy's going to come, too.

1049
01:13:58,625 --> 01:13:59,985
Yeah!

1050
01:14:09,025 --> 01:14:10,145
Ease up.

1051
01:14:12,025 --> 01:14:13,223
OK.

1052
01:14:13,225 --> 01:14:15,225
Everyone in? Good, let's go.
