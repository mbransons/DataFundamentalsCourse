1
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,323
Look at the birdie---look at the tree

2
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:27,222
My girls are the prettiest
known to the county

3
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:28,686
That's all

4
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,787
Mr. Durin, you've made us all immortal

5
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,496
Young ladies and gentlemen---

6
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,632
Now, young ladies and gentlemen---
alright, you cloud-headed

7
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,339
You've still 2 weeks before graduation

8
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,045
Let me remind you

9
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,139
Mr. Durin's picture taking is completed

10
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,812
You prepare yourself to Mr. Durin here
some time this week

11
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,354
an individual photograph

12
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,219
to appear in the Academy Album

13
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:03,887
Miss Kader---why are you standing there
as if transfixed?

14
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:08,094
ls it because you've left your books
in the study at the expense of

15
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,726
your splendid youth and innocence

16
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,863
or is it because you've already entered
into the miserable Harvard womanhood

17
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,429
and beat with them?

18
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,171
Alright, stop all of that
or stop blushing

19
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,789
Johnny.

20
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,490
He's not here

21
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,936
0h, you mustn't see me hiding

22
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,729
Hide what?

23
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,375
Happy graduation,Johnny.

24
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,314
Thank you

25
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,317
Happy graduation to you

26
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,721
Thank you

27
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,822
l guess we had the same idea

28
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,592
lsn't that nice?

29
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,067
We think the same thing

30
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,802
lsn't that crazy?

31
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,839
0pen your present, Johnny

32
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,211
lt's all about Raintree County

33
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:36,845
lt's illustrated with colored maps---
statistics and history---

34
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,822
and place adventures

35
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,361
lt's wonderful---just wonderful

36
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:48,299
Look---prominent citizens of
Raintree County

37
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,897
There're over hundred of them

38
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,742
Johnny, someday your name will be
the first on that list

39
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,309
Naturally

40
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,510
0pen yours, come on

41
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:13,782
Well, l think you'll like it---
it weighs 6 lbs

42
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:24,493
0h, l think Lord Byron was the most 
fascinating man ever lived

43
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,673
He seemed so much in need of

44
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,399
a good woman to love and love him

45
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,374
He never really found one

46
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,342
Yes---

47
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:36,314
There's a photograph inside---
l wrote something on the back of it

48
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,654
Johnny, it's beautiful

49
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,527
You know what l think?

50
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,654
l think someday you're going to be
a great writer

51
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,398
lt's just beautiful

52
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,518
l've never heard such nonsense

53
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,785
wasting 3 days write this

54
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,120
What's this---a speech?

55
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,162
lt's not nonsense

56
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,823
lt's an honor to be valid  Victoria

57
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,335
lt goes to the student ranking first 
in scholarship

58
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,334
You know so much about it

59
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,567
What did you ever valid---validate---
whatever it's called?

60
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:38,043
Pap is valid Victoria for the whole
Raintree County

61
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,008
Did you know that, Mom?

62
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,569
Your father?

63
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,345
Preaching a  sermon to the most
undesirable element

64
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:51,687
Waste the elegance there is in 
a lot of ground

65
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:55,885
It's the undesirable element which we desire---

66
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,554
You object the Pap's  elevating spiritual
 welfare the people?

67
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,993
What about my spiritual welfare?

68
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,864
Why can't we get an inside pump?

69
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,903
Yeah, Pap---what about an inside pump?

70
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,769
That's not a joke

71
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,308
What ever did learned you
 at that school?

72
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,470
You learn a cup of beer?

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,208
Your mother has beaty confused
with Heidelberg

74
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,681
You learn to smoke  tobacco?

75
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,615
Like a chimney

76
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:24,054
Huh, your father like that .....ever here
his sermon on the evils of tobacco

77
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,524
and with the regular pond some do it chew
and some do it smoke

78
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,290
But some end up their nose do poke

79
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,824
l do all three the same time

80
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,331
You learned anything else?

81
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,531
l learn my mother is a fraud and
what she says is hateful

82
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,766
that the way she says it

83
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,841
You never amount anything like that

84
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,608
Well, he ought to amount to something

85
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,947
He's related to one of the greatest
writers in the English language

86
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,111
Who's that?

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,188
Thomas Carlyle, that's who.

88
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,422
l think you're old enough to know that....

89
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,652
Joe, stop that foolishness

90
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,186
Well, l always thought that one day

91
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,525
 be a great man in the family

92
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,859
Great man?

93
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,095
ls a great man more good to get a job
of farm this land

94
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,697
Why ever was l cursed with such a burden?

95
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,172
0h---which reminds me

96
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,106
How are you and Nell getting along?

97
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,014
Nell is a fine girl and she is---

98
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,413
Well, she's Raintree County

99
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:28,146
That means a lot of people like us,
people with roots

100
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,518
A man should not only marry his beloved

101
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,454
He should marry his region

102
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,687
A good wife is a good start,
taught greatness

103
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:41,255
Pap, define greatness

104
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,267
Greatness?

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,064
Well, a great man is one
who does good for others and

106
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,969
I guess in that way your father qualifies.

107
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,006
Greatness?

108
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:53,669
Ha!

109
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,374
lf that great philosopher Socrates
used living today,

110
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,213
lf he were used to sit on a crack
chewing tobacco---

111
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,412
that was America,that's the greatness

112
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:03,315
Do l shock you?

113
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,290
How can l shock such unenlightened
cloud heads?

114
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,829
Are you stunned, Mrs. Lydia Gray?

115
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,967
0h, stop looking at me, child

116
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:20,495
With those big brown cow eyes round milk
like wax in the flame

117
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,539
Yeah

118
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,077
Do l shock you, Miss Nell Kader?

119
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,113
Not as much as you like to

120
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,206
0h, there must be somebody  l shoked

121
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,947
How about you, Johnny Seanacy?

122
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,610
l....relish it

123
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,053
You don't shock me
if you don't want shocking

124
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,657
Thanks, my boy

125
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,828
Now, about greatness.

126
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,696
We Americans measure greatness
in simple terms---in terms of money

127
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,166
We're always hunting with a tree of life

128
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,135
whose root is pure gold---

129
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,640
You have beautiful chest-light color
hair, my dear

130
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,976
But, there's another tree

131
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:02,604
not of gold, but of fulfillment---

132
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:06,446
whose flower is accomplishment
and its fruit is love

133
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,180
Most ways,
the ways of pleasantness

134
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,088
and most paths all lead to peace

135
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,960
Find that tree and
you'll find greatness

136
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,994
ln every land, every language poems of
some of this tree

137
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,831
And we in lndiana have our 
own mythe about it

138
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,702
It's the tree from which our county
takes its name

139
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,602
0ne day a ragged preacher ,was
wandering on the shore of the lake

140
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,575
in the middle of the county

141
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,705
That preacher was a man you all know,

142
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,080
Johnny Appleseed who spent his life

143
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,549
traveling to the pioneer West

144
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,951
planting apple seeds in the wilderness

145
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:47,626
Among these thousands of seeds
there was one that ragged preacher cherised

146
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,493
Not an appleseed, an exotic seed from China,

147
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,065
the seed of a golden raintree.

148
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,967
The preacher searched the tiny earth place,
the one place 

149
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,370
Well, this one seed by taking root,
blandished

150
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,570
Someone in this county found
that place

151
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,503
But where that raintree was planting?

152
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:09,777
Nobody knows

153
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,878
Professor, how could such a tree grow on

154
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,046
seeing in the county?

155
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,682
There's a great swamp by the Paradise Lake

156
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,588
There perhaps stands the tree

157
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:24,388
lts sacred tonic trunk towering up
in the  drawning silence

158
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:27,092
smacks deep in the middle of the county

159
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,734
Find that tree, boy,

160
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,396
and you'll learn
the secret of life itself

161
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,567
Find it and become the hero of
Raintree County

162
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,169
Do you really think it there?

163
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,810
Why don't you have a real good see
for yourself?

164
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,008
Professor, you still haven't answered
the question

165
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,018
Do you really think it there?

166
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,613
lt's there ,alright

167
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,427
lt's there....

168
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,026
But the sacred fire ready to be blacked

169
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,863
But if you look for it

170
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,028
Be sure you'll find it

171
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,971
What happens if you pursued
the raintree and don't find it?

172
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:13,636
You see before you a seeker
who didn't find

173
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:20,143
None of the human creature as the pitiable and
harmless creature you'll be hold in vain

174
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,514
Alright, human.....the show is over

175
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,116
Now, disappear...all of you, like phantoms

176
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:31,560
Attention, now easily slip away

177
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,026
Mrs. Gray, it's my time with you, huh?

178
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,275
Nell, let's you and l go to find
the raintree.

179
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:46,272
Professor said looking for the raintree
is appearless business.

180
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,437
It can't be  so 

181
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,947
So even dressed for it?

182
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,981
Are you serious?

183
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,313
Certainly l am ---come on

184
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,511
We mind it---find it

185
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,179
Johnny, not now

186
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:57,051
Why?

187
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:57,884
You scared?

188
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,322
Ah---is he fooling?

189
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:00,222
Look at him

190
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:03,285
What's up because of the tale
told by that idiot---

191
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,557
that expert in that calculated sanity?

192
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:06,495
Are you coming?

193
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:09,796
In the bad swamp,just because
the Professor put a barge on you about going

194
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,403
about the raintree?

195
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,803
Would you take care of this for me?

196
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,703
lf you mind l take care this for you?

197
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,367
You can go right ahead, sprout 

198
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,068
Sure, Johnny,go right ahead

199
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:22,045
Huh, don't hurry back, sprout

200
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,547
l hate when a thing like this happens

201
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,389
l never know how it happens

202
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:34,290
Yeah,it's a whip of shame

203
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,229
Well, Sir, but is it Johnny Seanacy?

204
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,998
More like Johnny Appleseed

205
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,969
Ha,where have you been, sprout?

206
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,400
l'm walking

207
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,069
Get in, Johnny,we'll take you home

208
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,371
Come on, Johnny,get in back

209
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,284
Poor boy, you look half drowned

210
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,121
Was nearly all drowned

211
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,925
You mean you look for that....
what's  you call ?

212
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,263
Yes, looking for the what'is you call.

213
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,801
Did you find it?

214
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:05,926
No

215
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:08,734
0h, what a whip of shame,sprout.

216
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,809
Poor pitiable harmless creature.

217
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,370
Johnny, tell me what happened

218
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,109
Yes, sprout,tell us all about it, huh?

219
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,182
Well

220
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,821
Boy, we'd like to tell us all about this

221
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,381
I Doubt, when you tell our fellows
about it

222
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,323
Huh?

223
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,852
l mean, say, you got the story straight

224
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,497
l entered the swamp like around here,

225
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,158
see ... around that way

226
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,065
What are you...

227
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,899
0h, excuse me, you're quite right

228
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:44,466
l entered the swamp this way and the so flows
kind of a line that way

229
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,484
That's how he came over the swamp

230
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,045
‘You find that raintree?' l said

231
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,320
‘No' he said, ‘l nearly drowned'

232
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,020
l figure that tried to cool his head,

233
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:04,995
But then she says...she says

234
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,019
What did she say?

235
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:10,024
She said" what a poor pitiable 
harmless creature"

236
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,196
What's going on, boys?

237
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,465
0h, hello, Dr. Seanacy.

238
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,973
We were just talking about
your son Johnny

239
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,167
Flash purple

240
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,474
Don't you know that your body is a temple
of the spirit?

241
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:24,414
And you defile and polluted with
that devil's brew you've there

242
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:25,848
Why you say so, but---

243
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,045
Why don't you come around to our
next tempest rally,

244
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,622
Come around to take a total afternoon
to pledge

245
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,714
l'll take that pledge right now

246
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:36,751
0h, no---we want men to take pledge
only when they're sober

247
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,463
But if they're sober, what's the sense
having the pledge taken place?

248
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:44,400
Wait, man---l want to testify that
l hanen't been drunk for 2 weeks

249
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,303
l drunk beer, wine and most of them
with all friends

250
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,204
l'm drunk here now this minute

251
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,640
l can't find a man who can drink

252
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,873
as much as l have walked straight and
l can still foot any man in this county

253
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:58,246
Thank you now if you just.....
mark a day and a hit town

254
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,012
Stand at any corner and listen to the
jumper, the local anthropoid

255
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,179
Steady...

256
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:08,022
l had hoped that this subject under discussion
was sufficiently elevated to engage my interest

257
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:08,989
However---

258
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,459
Professor, we were just talking about

259
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,554
your most promising student,

260
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:16,398
Speak of angels and hear their wings

261
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,102
Hm ,not that promising  student

262
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,110
Ah, Mr. Gray and his charming wife

263
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:34,583
How in the entire world of cross ability
did that chilly January win

264
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,247
such a blithesome May?

265
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:38,454
That reminds me....

266
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,322
Do you know the story about the old
judge who married a girl 18 ?

267
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,556
Sure, will yoy excuse me

268
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,621
Ha---

269
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:51,566
0h, Pap---

270
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,730
Ha---

271
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:01,206
Wow, here comes the hero of
Raintree County

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,272
l guess he'll go again for the gold raintree

273
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,339
Ha---

274
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,681
Bob has been shooting his big fat mouth
again

275
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,584
Yes,if you really want to be the hero

276
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,145
in Raintree County, all you gonna do

277
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,182
ls play the Flash Burgins
for the bare-foot race

278
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,227
Flash Burgins?

279
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:18,195
So you're Johnny Seanacy

280
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,260
Could be, who wants to know?

281
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you hear that boys?

282
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,668
Should l tell this child here who l am?

283
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,466
Why don't you tell him, Flash?

284
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,739
Son, it gives me great peculiar satisfaction
and relegation to introduce to you and

285
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,405
these handsome and intelligent dummy that

286
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:39,611
l'm a gentleman
who's better known as Flash Burgins,

287
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,653
fastest runner in Raintree County

288
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,449
Never heard of who is he.

289
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,023
Listen, child, it's me

290
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,082

north and the south

291
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,594
before they're qualified for the
Games

292
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:54,190
l'm half  horse and half the asshole
in their spare time

293
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,997
l buzz the more skulls and rag more campus
and chase more ladies---

294
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,502
That's the true

295
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,631
And there's a fine jump this year

296
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,666
Now little boy like
stand by and stone watch

297
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:07,538
Now who are you?

298
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,078
l'm Johnny Seanacy and

299
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:16,514
l can outrun any mule in the county

300
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:23,557
Come on, lad---what are you waiting for?

301
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,221
l race you right now

302
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,355
Alright

303
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,363
Race,

304
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:30,093
Race,

305
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,966
Race,

306
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,126
How about the church over there,
alright?

307
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,723
Right, any place you say

308
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:13,308
0n your march---1 ---2---

309
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,910
Stop it

310
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:15,739
What's wrong?

311
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,406
Put your coat on, Johnny

312
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:18,312
What for?

313
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,976
They're not racing

314
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:23,613
This man Burgins here is afraid to run
you in regular official

315
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:26,122
because he's frightened of
losing money.

316
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,726
Here's the hat on somebody

317
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,594
l give you 2 to 1

318
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:35,122
You're just talking,
you know no one here will met you

319
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,500
lf someone came up here with hard coin
you'll try to..... loud 

320
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,539
Try me and see

321
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,036
There is gold?

322
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:50,980
My yarn is type as a teacher---
a molder for the young mind

323
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,017
15 dollars!

324
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,644
This is not much, but it's the mind
l mold

325
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,244
l'll cover, me and the side kick

326
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,253
l'll postpone it to July 4

327
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:58,448
l'll take a bite of that myself

328
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,718
Strange, Johnny, but this is a sure win

329
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,090
See you in the race time, Johnny,

330
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,755
and l promise not to beat you for a while

331
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:08,091
Until then we'll see

332
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,338
Why did you do a thing like that?

333
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,333
Well.

334
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,408
Excuse me

335
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,613
lt's been 5 years since anyone laid

336
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,282
a bet against Flash Burgins

337
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:36,521
Now, if you could beat Flash, we'd clear
the biggest part of money

338
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,425
ever waged in Raintree County

339
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,724
Fine.

340
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,164
What happens if l don't win and you
lose all your money?

341
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:47,628
My dear boy, l've certain well-laid plans for 
the summer which at the moment l'm  limited

342
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,334
to spread, not even to you,
dear boy

343
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:55,238
My plans called for a certain....
concentration of capital

344
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:58,172
l don't know, Professor,
sometimes you worry me

345
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,241
What are you up to?

346
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,919
Not more than 20 ways of skating a cat,
l guess l can

347
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,355
Now, you relax for the athletic orgies
ahead

348
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,552
You're going to win a race

349
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,024
You're going to be the hero of
Raintree County

350
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,290
l 've got to go.

351
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:13,829
And the beautiful girl

352
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,164
with an ;olive wreath will put a  crown  
on your sun-colored lucks

353
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,047
Gonna be fine, don't move

354
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,451
Here we go

355
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,084
Look at the birdie---look at the tree

356
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,095
My girls are the prettiest
known to the county

357
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:45,357
Alright, you can relax

358
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,125
Thank you very much

359
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,328
0h

360
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,207
0h, it's you

361
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,138
Alright, you're next

362
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,549
0h, yeah, sure.

363
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,515
Stand over there please

364
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:25,163
Now stand properly still

365
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:27,566
Hurry, Siona

366
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:28,901
Sure

367
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,475
0h, put this gown on

368
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,044
Let me help you

369
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,277
Look at the camera please

370
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,008
Please look pleasant

371
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,210
Here we go

372
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:44,521
Look at the birdie---look at the tree

373
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,650
My girls are the prettiest
known to the county

374
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,221
That's it

375
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:51,059
That's all?

376
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,327
Huh, how long it's supposed before---

377
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,699
l mean l was just wondering
how many days before l can...

378
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,707
Maybe 2 or 3 days

379
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:05,209
2 or 3 days?

380
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,742
0h, that's fine---

381
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,280
Ah, l'll see you in 2 or 3 days

382
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:19,081
Wait for me

383
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,432
0h, l didn't mean to scream

384
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,729
l'm afraid you'll find me
very unlady obviously

385
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:35,001
l like unladies

386
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,874
l saw you down the street get ready to run,

387
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,410
what happened?

388
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,504
Well,postponed to 4th of July

389
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,008
You're a fast runner?

390
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,776
Pretty fast

391
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:52,419
l'm a pretty fast runner myself

392
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,224
Well, how about a race some time?

393
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,995
You don't believe me, do you?

394
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,559
You'll be surprised how fast l can run

395
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,935
l'm as good as you can

396
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,240
You're Johnny Seanacy?

397
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,042
Say that again

398
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:23,913
Johnny Seanacy,
l found out from the photographer

399
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:36,356
Professor

400
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,993
Boy,you're definitely ready to graduate

401
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,730
l was never so embarrassed

402
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,702
Why?

403
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:43,604
Because l screamed

404
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,664
l enjoyed it

405
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:45,971
This is where l live

406
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,010
You live here?

407
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,306
Hm ---

408
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,819
Come on, Siona,you slow as a swan

409
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,024
l'll be saying goodbye now

410
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:06,290
You live by yourself?

411
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,229
l have the 2 nigger girls to do the work

412
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,234
l love this house

413
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,065
l just opened it up again

414
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,197
My Dad loved it too

415
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:18,640
He was Senator Drake , Louisiana and
New 0rleans 

416
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,212
Some people thought he could be
president

417
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,679
l mean President of the United States

418
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,917
We had....that is we had before Daddy died,

419
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,544
The plantation in New 0rleans

420
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,816
We had another one outside Savannah.

421
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,223
When my aunt died last year,
l inherited this place

422
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,020
My name is Susana

423
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,663
Johnny, you want to say something?

424
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,697
0h, no.

425
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,802
You're cute....Johnny Seanacy

426
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,753
That 4th of July race, what happens
when you win?

427
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,024
Well, according to a friend of mine,

428
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:17,261
lf l win, a beautiful girl will place
a wreath of oak leaves

429
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,735
on my sun-colored lucks

430
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:22,863
l like to be that girl

431
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,278
Maybe it can be arranged

432
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:33,143
0h, it can be arranged alright---
l'll arrange it

433
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,994
You know l think l'm going to take
my picture too

434
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,996
There's always nice surprise.

435
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,462
Huh, what did l say?

436
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:52,533
Nothing, Galwood,
that was made for Johnny

437
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,313
0h

438
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,041
Johnny

439
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,769
Thank you, Ed

440
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:36,876
Nell

441
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,289
Ah, Johnny, there you're---

442
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,295
l'm looking all over for you

443
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,525
How are you feeling?

444
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,658
Nervous

445
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,635
What you need is calm your nerve 
over some acting juicy

446
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:00,329
Good luck, Johnny.

447
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:01,464
l got a payback on you

448
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,007
Thank you,l'll do my best

449
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,302
How about a little drink?

450
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,070
0h, l used to lemonade

451
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,110
Lemonade?

452
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,737
Lemonade is something
that gives you ulcer

453
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,214
What l mean was how about a little
drum  of Bourbon

454
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,273
Bourbon,me?

455
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:16,047
Now, don't get excited,
all l mean was just...

456
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,418
Even the present President would agree

457
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:20,685
the whole time l put it in, Jack

458
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:24,522
A draw.

459
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:25,458
God bless you

460
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,327
How about a little drink?

461
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:28,523
This old horse

462
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,601
he doesn't think
l should touch a draught

463
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,227
Just to be sociable

464
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,262
Well, l'll give if you both drink
alright

465
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,705
Splendid

466
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,469
l've never had a drink in my life

467
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,511
What's going to happen if l come out here..

468
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:44,709
Son, it'd be good for you to turn up
those muscles that's give you extra---

469
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:45,715
Forget about it, Professor

470
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,947
l forgot this boy can never being win yet---

471
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:54,784
Burgins, l'll match you drink for drink

472
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,688
0h, come on

473
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,224
Let's be sociable

474
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:12,836
What will  be, boy?

475
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,844
You name it and l ll drink.

476
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,574
Ah, what to be got?

477
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,514
How about a little Bourbon?

478
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,385
There's a couple of bottles right
out of the steer, a bottle for each boy

479
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:29,960
Ah, just a minute.

480
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,154
let's have those drinks
poured from the same bottle

481
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:32,787
Why?

482
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,764
l just don't want any trick monkey do
around here

483
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,926
What are you
we just have a bottle for each

484
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,832
They'll drink from the same bottle

485
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,268
Wow, you don't mean to say---

486
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,600
Kid me a fool, Professor

487
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,574
That's a new situation that you may do yourself

488
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:44,802
May l---?

489
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:49,175
Professor, l don't trust you---
you got sneaky eyes

490
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:57,685
lt's tea, cold tea

491
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,988
And you must've thought it
really a good thing

492
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,461
I'll fill it right up

493
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,891
Alright, man

494
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,091
New, let's get started

495
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,978
Johnny

496
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:32,016
There's nothing to it---nothing to it

497
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,828
Come on, just fill the glasses

498
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,991
Johnny, you're unable---

499
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:51,735
How do you feel now?

500
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:52,571
l feel fine

501
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,166
0h, that's enough

502
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,769
Gentlemen, this boy is not used to
strong alcohol

503
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,040
Just to be sociable

504
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,376
Professor, don't worry about me

505
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:59,349
There's nothing to it, really

506
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,212
Stand back, give the boy a chance

507
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:16,599
Good work to Jack,alright to youth

508
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,999
Now gentlemen, stand back, 
give me room

509
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,594
How you like that?

510
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,157
l tell you l've got another trick
l want to show you

511
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,064
Watch this---give me a hand

512
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:55,170
Alright, boys, watch this

513
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,172
That's enough,dry him off

514
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,004
That's only God would choose

515
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:34,507
He's out there now,
laughing to beat the kid

516
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:37,172
How dare you play a trick like this
on your best friends?

517
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,910
And poor Johnny here who never drinks
in his life

518
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,886
0h, he'd have been killed Flash

519
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,511
Flash is there hours ago

520
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,454
Yelling for action

521
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,151
You'd better get Johnny out there

522
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,923
Johnny, this is it---are you ready?

523
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:56,362
Yes, let's go, I am ready

524
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,028
0h, l'd better put on my pants

525
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:19,316
Hello, boys, help yourself

526
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:22,688
When l want a noice, you gonna be set
by hower like this

527
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,319
l wonder a cannon Johnny can hear it

528
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:29,261
lt'd be 1 , 2, 3 and bang

529
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,358
Now remember, Johnny

530
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:33,734
l got 100 dollars bet on you, 100 dollars---

531
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:35,739
Good luck

532
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,575
Where's it?

533
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,700
ls that we end up?

534
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:40,709
Yeah

535
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,443
How about the girls down there?

536
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,411
You think too close?

537
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,971
They'll kill themselves

538
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,778
0nce again, boys

539
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:50,049
Alright---quiet everybody

540
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:57,519
0n your march---1 ---2---3

541
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,113
Who won---?

542
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,220
We've done it---we won 250 dollars

543
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,820
To me is 150

544
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,860
Where's Flash?

545
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,465
The king is dead,long live the king

546
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,207
Johnny

547
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:55,650
Nice to see you around again.

548
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,179
Quiet voice

549
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,986
You've beautifully done it

550
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:06,993
Johnny Seanacy, allow me to present
to you on behalf of all these people

551
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:11,899
Present this wreath to the---
victory belongs to this boy

552
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:18,670
What about that race you and l
going to run?

553
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:22,043
l wouldn't have a chance

554
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,895
0h

555
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:44,862
You, dear boy, are a wishfully
pagan spirit

556
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,096
And you're poet of finance

557
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,464
Today is the day of high hopes and
fair promise

558
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:54,011
Ah, now wonder worker of the age

559
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,909
Professor, you've enough zidar

560
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:59,643
Hm, not enough, l gonna catch up with him

561
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,379
l've to protect my leagues

562
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:09,890
Why don't you run away and play with
this charming ambassador's

563
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,588
in the land of mints and magnolia?

564
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,064
Let's go swimming, come on

565
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:17,964
What?

566
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,400
You're sick of that think

567
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,631
But you can think anything

568
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:35,843
Ah, life...liberty and the pursuit
of happiness

569
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,432
0h, l gonna hate to leave here

570
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:32,208
Leave---when are you leaving?

571
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:36,911
Tomorrow, l'm going back to New 0rleans

572
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,176
You can't stay for a while?

573
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,249
0h, you're sweet

574
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,447
But you can come to visit me some time

575
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,547
You'd love this house.

576
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,286
You have to go?

577
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:52,624
Well, l only came up here to resettle
the house

578
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:57,861
l was going to sell it,
but l think l'll hold it for a while

579
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,833
When you'll be back?

580
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:06,206
l don't know,maybe never

581
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:10,276
Tell me about the raintree

582
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,173
Where did you hear about that?

583
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,115
Do you think you'll never find it?

584
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:17,384
You don't think it's a joke?

585
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:22,282
No, l believe it

586
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:27,295
l'll be looking for the raintree always

587
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,591
Supposing you do find it,

588
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,770
0h, it opens all locks,

589
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:39,138
It heals all wounds

590
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:52,349
Yes,maybe l'll never see you again

591
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:39,730
Nell

592
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:41,561
Nell

593
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,936
lt's silly,you've been running away
from me for weeks

594
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:52,909
Why don't you talk to me?

595
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:57,715
You weren't so anxious to talk to me
when that girl was in town

596
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:00,346
What do you mean?

597
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,291
Are you mad just because l saw her
a couple of times

598
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,989
A couple of times?

599
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:16,865
Huh, did you like that book of poetry
l gave you?

600
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:19,103
Yeah

601
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:25,910
No, Byron was immoral,
he was a libertine

602
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:27,379
He was a good writer

603
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:30,614
l think being a good man is
far more important

604
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:33,622
Maybe a writer has a lot of experience

605
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:38,695
0h, so that's it,so that's what you're
doing with Susana

606
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,591
Johnny Seanacy, the Byron 
of Raintree County

607
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,758
That's right, l'm a genius

608
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,205
Maybe someday l'll write

609
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,739
About what?

610
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,333
About the sudden baths l've known?

611
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:58,610
No, l think l'll write about 
Raintree County

612
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,978
About the lndians
when they first came here...

613
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:07,149
About Johnny Appleseed and the raintree

614
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,452
The raintree?

615
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,552
That's another thing, Johnny

616
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:14,097
That day you went chasing the raintree
l was waiting for you

617
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:17,498
l didn't know where you had gone,
but l knew that swamp

618
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,465
l'm sorry, l guess l didn't realize

619
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,871
You just didn't realize anything

620
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:33,607
Johnny, to some people you're a man
of great importance

621
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:39,384
Your exact location is of intense
concern to---to some people

622
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,734
l'd better go, Johnny

623
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:53,667
Not yet

624
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:54,898
Johnny

625
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:56,303
Please

626
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,434
Johnny, l'd better go

627
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,708
lt's getting late,we'd better go

628
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,541
0h, no,you don't

629
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:04,879
Who's that?

630
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,543
Why don't you move up here and
find out?

631
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,594
So it was you

632
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:19,593
Who did you think it was?

633
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,892
You know anything about this?

634
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,025
You got anything to do with this?

635
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,124
Doing with that?

636
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:28,433
With the Professor, he ran off with Lady Gray

637
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:32,374
lf he is still in the county, he'll get
a chance out of thousand to get not alive

638
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:34,103
We've got hundred men looking for her

639
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,701
Nobody can come to this county and

640
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,543
run off with another man's wife

641
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:40,607
lt occurs to me, young man, that you're
a friend of this

642
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,145
This man's

643
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:44,619
But a thing like this---
there're no nobbles

644
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:46,849
Whose side are you on?

645
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,984
l'm taking Nell home

646
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:54,060
No, l'll see you tomorrow

647
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,999
Alright, young man,l'm still waiting
for your answer

648
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:03,597
You'll get yourself a long wait,
l'm going home

649
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:19,981
Hello, Johnny

650
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,557
And what have you been up to?

651
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,098
Where's Lydia?

652
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:34,696
Wonderful woman---l did try cut her
away from her husband

653
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,000
That's the day you won your race

654
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:38,598
Where's she?

655
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,970
She had missed the train
at the 3-mile junction

656
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:44,514
0r we'd have been hundred miles away
by now

657
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:49,150
As we got back to the buggy, 3 men
with guns marched up to the platform

658
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,847
l grasped the situation once there

659
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:54,015
But that was only the beginning

660
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,859
0n the way back, the first man l met
asked if l heard about the man

661
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:59,896
who ran off with a man's wife

662
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:02,558
l'm a stranger here myself, l said

663
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:07,734
0n the road, l met a troop of camions
carrying for the station---

664
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,169
Where's Lydia?

665
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:13,910
She's home right now
waiting for Mr. Gray

666
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,539
l took her straight back 

667
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,882
As for myself, l took off
like a street beggar

668
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,153
l guess you think l'm a bit a scoundrel,
right, Johnny?

669
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:29,953
l don't know---l don't know what l think

670
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:33,253
Don't think too badly on me

671
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:37,326
l suppose the heroic thing to be done
would be to stick around and

672
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:41,098
let the outraged husband discharge
his fury with a shotgun

673
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,132
But l hate that Sanctimonious warthog

674
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,504
too much to give him the satisfaction

675
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,572
Besides, l am scared

676
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,210
One thing, Johnny

677
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,982
Nothing happened, absolutely nothing

678
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,611
And that's the end just for all

679
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:01,691
lf there's any phantom to be hanged---
the county would say

680
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:05,420
there might be me and some truth 
could be in it

681
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:06,655
Alright

682
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,198
l just managed the whole thing badly

683
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,794
Did you?

684
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,234
Come on

685
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,698
Where are we going?

686
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:17,798
You 've got to get out of the county

687
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:20,172
Well, good idea,it occurred to me

688
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,176
Johnny, why not both of us?

689
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,682
Study my example,
get out of Raintree County,

690
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:28,217
Someone would get you with a shotgun

691
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:29,946
Not me,you

692
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,184
l guess you're right

693
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:37,986
(ln French) Apres vous la delige

694
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,801
There he is

695
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:55,872
Come on

696
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,512
Get on the train

697
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:01,844
Goodbye, dear boy

698
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:03,544
Go on for great better things

699
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:05,349
Get on the train

700
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,962
We want him

701
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,805
Where you've been, Mr. Gray?

702
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:25,636
Your wife has been home
for the past 12 hours

703
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:28,177
Nothing happened,absolutely nothing

704
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:29,807
He's a liar

705
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,643
You want to shoot me and later find out
he was right?

706
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,217
What are you afraid of?

707
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,952
You want him ,you take him

708
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,129
l'm going home

709
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:49,796
You get out of my way, boy

710
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,232
or l'll cut your eyes out

711
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:00,942
Goodbye, dear friend

712
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:03,774
Remember me as a man who loves
Raintree County---

713
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:07,783
but just happens to lose
most of the people in it

714
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,671
Johnny

715
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:59,032
Johnny, l had to come back,
l'm going to have a baby

716
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:11,880
Johnny, this letter was left
on the door step, it's for you

717
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,347
0h, thank you

718
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,749
Johnny, this marriage you announced

719
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,212
Sit down

720
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:26,261
l can't honestly say l'm entirely
approved of the precipity

721
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:31,361
But, under the circumstances necessary
haste with which you've gone into it

722
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:34,198
l know,l certainly understand

723
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:42,041
Anyway, l think you're doing
the manly thing

724
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,606
l hope the young lady is all that she appears
what she appears to be

725
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,086
Judge not the ,beyond the judge.

726
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:53,817
l know, Sir

727
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:00,359
Marry her, son,and be happy

728
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,262
Thank you

729
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,822
You need any money?

730
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,600
l don't know...l don't think so right now

731
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,872
0h, there was a letter 
came for you

732
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,842
l.... have it here

733
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,936
0f course

734
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:49,772
Hello

735
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,507
Hello, Johnny

736
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,050
l got your letter

737
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:03,126
Johnny, as one for whom you want for perfection,

738
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,990
l just want to say good luck

739
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,759
and wish you all the happiness
in the world

740
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:14,702
And the poem you wrote for me and
the picture you gave me---

741
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:17,603
l just feel that l want to return it

742
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,700
l thought maybe you want it now

743
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:29,579
l really did not want to get that out

744
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,486
lt's just that, everything has changed

745
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,452
and l don't mean anything to you

746
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:40,361
We don't mean anything
to each other anymore

747
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:46,367
Nell---l'm sorry

748
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,035
lt's not your fault, Johnny---
everybody knows that

749
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,939
lt was the 4th of July

750
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,638
You drank all that whisky and
you went out to the lake

751
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:59,478
No, l am responsible,nobody else

752
00:54:00,884 --> 00:54:04,012
That's so much like you, Johnny

753
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:07,417
Why do you have so much conscience?

754
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,391
Maybe that's why l love you

755
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:15,028
Johnny, l love you so much

756
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:21,529
Did that l wish l didn't---l wish ...

757
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:41,483
The words of Lord Byron in that book
you gave me

758
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:49,465
‘Forever love and before ever..-'

759
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:54,228
Still forever---

760
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,140
l wish you well

761
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:24,692
You're right, Mrs. Seanacy

762
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:32,537
l like the river.....it even smells good

763
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:35,404
l really don't understand it

764
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:37,978
Would you smell mouse like it too?

765
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,981
Now, there's something l don't understand

766
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:43,918
All you've to do is go south once and
you'll love it

767
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:50,086
Well, a north Yanky to the south
is not too easy to understand

768
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,658
You ever read <Uncle Tom's Cabin>?

769
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:56,562
<Uncle Tom's Cabin>?

770
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,932
l've married an abolitionist, have l?

771
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:04,573
That's skeleton in my classic

772
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,435
Now, you mustn't joke about it

773
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,078
Are they friendly?

774
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:15,242
Anyway, the worst thing is to be
an abolitionist

775
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,649
Like what?

776
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:24,018
That cabin Negro blooded

777
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:28,195
Just one little tiny drop in the person
all Negro

778
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,461
They just can't tell either

779
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:39,103
ls it gonna be room for 2 of us?

780
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:44,269
lt's only sort of a hobby---
l'm taking with me wherever l go

781
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,974
This is Jimmy---l've had it the longest

782
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,244
Where did you get him?

783
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:49,785
He needs a bath

784
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:58,893
0h, Johnny, forgive my foolishness

785
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:26,186
0h, l do love you so

786
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:33,886
When l'm with you, l feel like nothing

787
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:37,057
Can happen to me as long as l have you

788
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,127
You won't have let anything happen to me

789
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,172
Will you, Johnny?

790
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,043
Enjoy yourself, Johnny?

791
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,281
Very much

792
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:36,485
Then what do you think about
the ever-glooming south?

793
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:38,185
As l said, l love it---l do

794
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,593
That sounds general, isn't it?

795
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,254
What you really think of it?

796
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:46,126
Well, Sir,l think so highly of it

797
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:48,764
l worry only by this talk
of sucession

798
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:49,702
Sucession?

799
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:50,797
Remember, young man

800
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:54,536
The Union belongs to those who keep
 breath in this cabinet

801
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:57,375
What cousin Sam means, Johnny,
if sucession comes---

802
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,607
It's the north that should suceed

803
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:00,774
Hear him say---

804
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:02,476
Sam, one thing you must understand

805
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:03,951
Johnny is a poet

806
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,817
It's taking him  2 months to discover

807
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:08,424
Therefore, he loves the south

808
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:10,516
l'm not so sure he proves it

809
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:12,424
That's because he's a moralist

810
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,292
You won't get straight answers from him

811
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:16,798
He'll draw up opinions for another day

812
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:18,266
He's also a dreamer

813
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:21,065
a seeker for the
meaning of life with capital letters

814
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,840
Sir, your search is in the end

815
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:28,138
Stay here with us and help us
build our dream

816
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:30,076
We , in the south, dream

817
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,240
Of a great republic on this soil of merit

818
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:39,050
with it's pretty homes and as well
as the most beautiful women

819
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:41,555
0h, Sam ,you're wonderful

820
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,389
You shelf like some golden pitfalls

821
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:49,898
Cousin Sam ,Johnny doesn't like slavery

822
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,603
Is Johnny like the wage to slavery
at the north?

823
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,672
Johnny doesn't like misery anywhere

824
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,764
North or south

825
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:59,775
Here comes misery now---my wife

826
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:01,834
We're talking about the north, my dear---

827
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:03,310
slaves in the north---

828
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,042
Sam, you're boring---

829
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:09,247
l'll borrow your husband for a while

830
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:11,377
Excuse me

831
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:42,150
Don't look so serious

832
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:46,912
Here old man can only play
his dream of glory

833
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,548
lt's not that, l'm counting

834
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:54,388
Cousin Johnny, you ever in love?

835
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:55,555
Huh?

836
01:00:55,632 --> 01:01:01,002
l mean---were you ever really---in love?

837
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:04,504
Cousin dear, l'm in love

838
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,269
You know l love the way you say that

839
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:12,610
You did such a noble sound
in your precious accent

840
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:24,891
Frankly, Johnny, cousin Susana just
isn't the right type for you

841
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:27,930
You're an attractive young man

842
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:34,201
0h, Susana, why disposed you
and didn't marry down here?

843
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:39,206
l guess supposing down here  know
too much about her

844
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,534
Don't you hear me?

845
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:47,407
You've borrowed my husband long enough,
cousin Barbara,

846
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:48,846
l reclaim him

847
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,476
0f course

848
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:33,695
lt must've been beautiful

849
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,024
0h, it was, Johnny

850
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,628
lt was all white when
l was a little girl

851
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:16,997
The marble room was right above over there

852
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:22,076
Johnny, our neggars made these bricks
 by hands

853
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:25,544
The furniture came from France

854
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:27,513
lt was so beautiful

855
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:32,283
These tower columns shed the veranda

856
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:35,186
l used to play there when it rained

857
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:42,191
The garden was so lovely cool
with roses and lilies

858
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:44,493
How this fire started?

859
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:49,037
No one knows

860
01:03:49,339 --> 01:03:50,829
Really?

861
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,410
That were my Daddy and Mama buried

862
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:58,241
l was lucky to get out alive

863
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,042
l slept next to Henrietta at this room

864
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:01,046
She was burnt too

865
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:02,709
Who was Henrietta?

866
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:08,156
She was my dearest friend,
she was a great lady

867
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,149
How old were you?

868
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:15,222
Three, maybe four.

869
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:17,025
And you could remember it all?

870
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,997
Yes.....no, l don't know

871
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:27,040
l can quite  remember what l exactly saw

872
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,770
l was told later on

873
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:44,686
0h

874
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:46,652
What's the matter?

875
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:50,931
There used to be a little cabin
right over there

876
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,064
l guess it's gone

877
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,874
This is where they buried her, Johnny

878
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:10,218
0h, you can't imagine
how lovely she was

879
01:05:10,386 --> 01:05:15,289
She took care of me,
she was a great lady

880
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:19,656
l'm not ashamed to say ,
cause she was a Negro

881
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:20,853
0ne of these slaves?

882
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,694
0h, no---she came from Cuba

883
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:25,563
That was where l was born...Havana

884
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:27,499
Daddy was there for several years

885
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:29,731
and then came back with us

886
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:34,305
lt's so funny to think of her now

887
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:41,145
Think of her lying down there, that is
if she's lying down there

888
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:44,013
What do you mean
‘if she's lying down there ?

889
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:47,881
lt's a short of family scandal

890
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:50,858
Some people say the graves were mixed

891
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:56,160
My aunt said she wasn't sure if it was
her Henrietta sleeping in Mama's grave

892
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:01,067
l---l don't understand

893
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:14,508
l love you, Henrietta---l love you

894
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:19,644
Dear

895
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:27,659
Johnny, l know you don't understand

896
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:33,930
She was everything to me

897
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:41,136
Because of her l was never alone

898
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:56,447
And now---do you feel that someone 
is watching us?

899
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,553
Just nobody here

900
01:07:01,431 --> 01:07:03,228
How do you know?

901
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:13,803
Johnny, about this....this negro girl

902
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,241
l....l lied to you about it

903
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:18,109
lt....it never happened

904
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:21,745
Why did you tell me this?

905
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:28,517
You asked me about it

906
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:32,387
Well, you don't think my Mama---

907
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:35,589
You don't think my Mama would ever
allow me to---

908
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:39,993
l---l was always with my Mama---

909
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,499
l was always by her side

910
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:48,240
Why---why she loved me so much

911
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:53,207
She never allowed me out of her sight

912
01:07:53,816 --> 01:07:57,946
l---l was always with her

913
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:04,458
Susana---should we go home?

914
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:52,104
Good evening, l'm looking for Mr. Drake

915
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,101
Come on in, dear

916
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:08,984
Right in here

917
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:10,388
Thank you

918
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:32,675
Bobbie

919
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:35,309
Johnny, how do you know l was here?

920
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:36,817
Barbara said you were with Sam ---

921
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:38,353
she said you were here

922
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:43,290
Listen---l'd  like to talk to you

923
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:44,790
Can you wait ?

924
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:46,055
We drive  home and
we could talk then

925
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:48,029
No

926
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,567
Let's go in here

927
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,403
Would you excuse us?

928
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,939
Johnny, how about a drink?

929
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:06,981
Bobbie, what's all about

930
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,016
Susana's family and the fire?

931
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:13,182
Well, it's just an old family scandal

932
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,315
Johnny---but it's pretty gluesome

933
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,916
You see the day they had trouble to
identify a man in the,

934
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:20,222
fire but a woman

935
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:25,028
And the woman was another matter and
one of them was a lady of color

936
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,962
Why you go after that?

937
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,799
l like to know

938
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:35,739
Well it all began when Susana's mother
....when...you know

939
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:37,776
l don't know

940
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,745
She went insane

941
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:43,182
Susana's father gave up everything
to take care of her

942
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:46,585
At last he gave up his business
to seek her sense

943
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:49,557
For all they tried she was too far gone

944
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,684
Finally she couldn't be cured at all

945
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,990
lt was in Cuba

946
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:56,595
That's where he met the other woman

947
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,364
What about the fire?

948
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:00,799
There had some gringos

949
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,962
2 of the bodies were found together

950
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:03,936
So?

951
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,974
So it looks like something funny
had been going on

952
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:08,373
They might've been killed
before the fire

953
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,378
l mean everybody else got up and away

954
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,913
Why didn't they?

955
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:16,610
That's one of the question of identification---
which woman was that woman?

956
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:17,750
Which?

957
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:19,878
There was talks of Susana's father with

958
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:22,550
the woman who was found being inside

959
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:24,758
The woman....the woman...
who was found with?

960
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,487
l exaggerated, Johnny

961
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:27,585
Anyway, the thing was her

962
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,961
it was better the way was as that

963
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,556
0f course, there was a lot of talks---

964
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:33,693
You know how women talk ,
in this families,

965
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:35,634
women are worse at most

966
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,270
l don't want to scare you, boy

967
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,238
You need a  quiet life

968
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:39,365
because you've a beautiful spouse

969
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:40,806
As you worth of it.

970
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,470
Alright, what happened after the fire?

971
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:45,570
Well, nothing much

972
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:50,618
All over the excitement Susana took it down
and disappeared for 2 or 3 days

973
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,812
l forget now

974
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,320
They found of her finally

975
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:56,449
She was in Henrietta's open cabin
all the time

976
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:57,992
And Susana had to go up

977
01:11:58,094 --> 01:12:00,358
to her aunt's place in Savvanah

978
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,989
That's all l know about it

979
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,464
Does anybody know?

980
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,330
There's just one person

981
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:07,096
Who?

982
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,694
You've to wait until she's ready
to tell you

983
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:11,403
Not Susana?

984
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:12,997
lt's Susana

985
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:15,100
Susana was 3 years old

986
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,941
0h, my boy---you think you marry a child
bothersome?

987
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:24,284
At the time of the fire, my cousin
Susana was 9 years old

988
01:12:31,494 --> 01:12:35,055
Dear, we 've got to get away from here

989
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:39,157
Alright, Johnny, where should we go?

990
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,296
Could we go to Europe?

991
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,736
No, l like to go back to
Raintree County

992
01:12:43,839 --> 01:12:44,965
But why?

993
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,338
We've plenty of money

994
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:48,001
Honey, l got to get a job

995
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,543
l got to work

996
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:51,710
That's why we should be back home

997
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,976
so the two of you could be resting

998
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:03,617
Johnny, l haven't been very honest
with you

999
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,620
You haven't?

1000
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:13,359
When l told you l was going to have
a baby, l lied

1001
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:17,698
l'm not going to have a baby

1002
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:24,813
l lied because l wanted you more than

1003
01:13:24,914 --> 01:13:27,849
anything l ever wanted in my life

1004
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:32,620
Because l---somehow l just---

1005
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:36,516
0h, l don't know

1006
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:42,660
Darling, one thing you must know

1007
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:45,666
l love you very much

1008
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,194
You'd never leave me, will you,
Johnny?

1009
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:52,236
l'll never leave you

1010
01:13:52,341 --> 01:14:01,181
l love you, let's go home

1011
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:05,347
0h, yes.... yes,Johnny

1012
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,096
Oh ,Miss Nell Kader,shame on you

1013
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:26,039
By here my husband and l have been
home settled you not be seeing this time

1014
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:30,409
And you have yet to call on us
where is  your preeding?

1015
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,746
l leave the breeding to you

1016
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,818
How do you like here in the booze of the
Raintree County?

1017
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:41,155
Well, l hardly feel this town
so small anymore

1018
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,725
Whatever you do for amusing?

1019
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:45,657
l take walks

1020
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:46,922
How really?

1021
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,725
You tell me who you walk with

1022
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:51,800
l'm interested in all aspects
of real life

1023
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:55,428
You won't be interested in me,
l walk alone

1024
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,596
l just don't understand that.

1025
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,572
You're still young, you know---

1026
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:03,305
and pretty as a swan

1027
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:05,710
Are you interested in a man, honey?

1028
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,175
Perhaps

1029
01:15:07,283 --> 01:15:10,912
Well, good, l just hoped is not
a school teacher,

1030
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,317
Like Johnny

1031
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:13,745
You know, Miss Kader

1032
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:16,690
a school teacher
has almost remote little habits

1033
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:21,219
like read and write and mess all around

1034
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:25,291
Anyway, l did want you to know
you're always welcome

1035
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:28,834
Any friend of my husband's is
a friend of mine

1036
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:33,272
And Johnny always did tell me
all his best friends in Raintree County

1037
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:37,243
You're the first,bye...bye

1038
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,734
Hello, Johnny

1039
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:12,946
0h, where you pop up from?

1040
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,843
No place special

1041
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,171
Galwood asked me to marry him

1042
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:44,144
Mr. Seanacy 

1043
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,270
Hello

1044
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:55,586
He's going to politics,
what do you think, Johnny?

1045
01:16:55,958 --> 01:17:00,395
l mean you're always
being my best friend

1046
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:05,357
l think Galwood will make
a fine politician

1047
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,435
You know that's not what l mean

1048
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:23,479
Mr. Seanacy, a few months in your class

1049
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:24,985
l learned more about poetry and

1050
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,117
politics and life and....
than l've all the time going to school

1051
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:38,365
The students seem to enjoy
creeping up on me

1052
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,568
They're all in love with you

1053
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:46,636
Teachers get falling in love with
it's an occupation hazard.

1054
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,741
Me was different,

1055
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:52,678
l fell in love with the student

1056
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:55,308
So did l

1057
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:02,882
All l thought was a hopeless mistake, 
wasn't it?

1058
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:08,023
She tricked you into marriage, Johnny---

1059
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,222
she wasn't pregnant

1060
01:18:09,331 --> 01:18:13,529
lt's one thing people around here
can't do without deny

1061
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:19,103
l'm sorry, Johnny---l'm so ugly

1062
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:25,975
No, Susana and l are going to have
a baby ,in April

1063
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:29,207
l want you to know you're my
best friend

1064
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:47,998
Well, l'm very happy for both of you,
until then, goodbye

1065
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:36,650
How do you feel?

1066
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,258
0h, l've a troubled sleeping  again....
that dream,

1067
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:48,192
Why you 're up so early?

1068
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:50,957
Wasn't school or election day?

1069
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:52,397
l 've got to vote

1070
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:59,398
You were out so late last night,
speechify....the Mr. Lincoln

1071
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:01,667
l wasn't the only one up there

1072
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,074
The speechify

1073
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:06,342
Thank God Jones delivered it
a little scum wider

1074
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:08,205
You want to read it?

1075
01:20:09,051 --> 01:20:10,279
Come in

1076
01:20:12,087 --> 01:20:14,351
Morning---Mr. and Mrs. Seanacy

1077
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:16,151
Good morning, Siona

1078
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,058
Galwood Vs Jones---

1079
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:24,532
l always wonder what's the beast for

1080
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,696
l give you one guess

1081
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:30,228
Galwood Vs Jones---

1082
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:34,901
Youngest candidate ever to seek office
in lndiana State Legislature last night

1083
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,070
rounded up his program campaign
in 3-mile junction

1084
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:43,742
With the enthusiastic denunciation of
teachers who used the schools as a platform

1085
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,287
to corrupt the youth of
Raintree County

1086
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:49,950
Those who stand on the slavery question
is most violent 

1087
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,493
Jones declared that the best look to

1088
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,256
their papacy is only the ship

1089
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:58,663
A certain young teacher who instructs
the young, in a flammatory and seditious doctrine

1090
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:04,034
about abolition includes a domestic
arrangement of his home to colored people

1091
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,600
The status with respect to those freedoms for 
whose protection the abolitionists claim 
a monopoly is

1092
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:11,168
Who said who's?

1093
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,077
Questionable

1094
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,412
Can you guess who's talking about?

1095
01:21:15,484 --> 01:21:17,349
But l think he's right

1096
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:20,910
l think politics like charity
should begin at home

1097
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,516
That's exactly what l intend to begin

1098
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,161
What about Daisy and Siona?

1099
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,786
What about them?

1100
01:21:28,897 --> 01:21:32,526
Honey, you lied after free those girls
and get rid of them

1101
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:35,570
But they've been with our family
since they were born

1102
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,202
They'd be unhappy any place else

1103
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:43,742
l just don't understand you, Johnny---
after beeing insulted me

1104
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:45,211
l just don't see how can you go on

1105
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,406
being an abolitionist

1106
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:48,847
Susana, you're not south now---

1107
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,942
you can't have your slaves here

1108
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,883
Johnny, l wish you wouldn't pick on me---

1109
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:56,616
l don't feel well

1110
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,683
Honey, l'm not picking on you

1111
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,695
l just don't want slaves in my house

1112
01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:05,497
Alright, l wish we could get away
from here

1113
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:07,728
l don't like this place

1114
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:10,168
l just assume limited as a goat
in the hole

1115
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:13,736
What anybody in the south ever do
to hurt you?

1116
01:22:13,842 --> 01:22:16,003
You know how nice and sweet they all were

1117
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:17,635
and how much they loved it

1118
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,840
l just don't see how you can

1119
01:22:19,915 --> 01:22:24,181
support a man like Lincoln.....Lincoln

1120
01:22:24,353 --> 01:22:26,548
Why you despised Lincoln so much?

1121
01:22:27,022 --> 01:22:30,321
l mean .....that's well-known fact

1122
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:32,586
You must've heard about it

1123
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,151
What's about the fact?

1124
01:22:34,696 --> 01:22:38,655
l mean the fact that Lincoln has
negro blood in him

1125
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:41,567
You don't believe it?

1126
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,069
As Galwood or Jones

1127
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:46,436
Dear, all l ask you get rid of the girls---

1128
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,441
pay them wages and do whatever you want

1129
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,412
You don't love me...

01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:55,041
You hate me because l'm southern

1131
01:23:02,457 --> 01:23:06,120
You've been asking questions about me

1132
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:09,624
Dear, do what you want

1133
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:12,199
But if those girls are not free by tonight,
