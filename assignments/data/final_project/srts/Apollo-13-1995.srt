1
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,677
We have the crew crossing gantry
for capsule ingress.

2
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,352
Roger that.

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,795
Inspired by the late President Kennedy,

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,595
in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,315
"the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,675
on which man has ever embarked."

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,833
After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program,

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,515
- We got a short!
- And after that sudden, horrible fire...

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,591
on the launchpad
during a routine test...

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,319
- that killed astronauts Gus Grissom...
- Fire in the cockpit!

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,391
- Ed White and Roger Chaffee...
- Get us outta here!

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,632
There were serious doubts that we
could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,837
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,913
the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,871
landed on the moon.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,076
The big news came
just a moment ago.

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,913
Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission...

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,838
to go for
the extravehicular activity...

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,757
that is, for the walk
on the moon...

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,391
far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,194
Important thing when you're penetrating
the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,117
and your relative speed.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,038
Let's say this is me in the command
module and this is you...

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,951
- All right.
- In the LEM.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,712
This thing sticks out.
That's called a probe.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,631
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,510
Tracey, when you feel that thing
slide in, everything's clickin'...

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,670
it's like no other
feeling in the world.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,998
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,951
How's it goin' at Mission Control?

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,600
It's a nervous time. They're pacin'
around, smokin' like chimneys.

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,949
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,712
- Hi.
- This is Tracey.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,631
- How do ya do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,076
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,513
This guy did ten laps.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,909
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,831
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,115
This is the last champagne
in Houston.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,031
- Very good. Very good.
- Everything else all right?

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,714
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,598
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice. Make sure it's cold.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,478
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- I'm on vacation.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,199
Oh, get a haircut.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,434
Well, hello there.

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,035
- I wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn't.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,918
Don't worry. Our day's comin'.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,838
They're not gonna cut
the program before number 14.

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,115
- You know, my cousin called.
- Uh-huh.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,430
Asked who we bribed
to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,714
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,070
I told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,310
Well, they got that right.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,552
- What network do we want?
- Come on! Walt! Hey! Put on Walter!

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,477
- Walter!
- Jules Bergman!

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,919
John, turn it up!

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,191
...has completed putting on
the spacesuits and the boots.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,070
I, uh... I really appreciate you all
coming to this dress rehearsal party...

59
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,197
for my Apollo 12 landing.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,633
Sit down, Conrad.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,075
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,829
the exemplary...
hell, damn near heroic...

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,914
effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's
backup for this historic moon walk...

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,155
and, of course, his crew.

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,033
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,188
There he is! There he is!
Everybody quiet down!

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,271
Hey! Kids!

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,999
We had a good touchdown.

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,200
We can verify the position of the
opening I ought to have on the camera.

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,352
What?

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,433
- Think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,074
He just needs somebody to wave him off.
Pull up, Neil!

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,232
Pull up! Pull up!

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,393
Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,431
Look at those pictures. Wow.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,119
I'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,716
The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about, uh...

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,756
one or two inches.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,951
- It's almost like a powder.
- Armstrong is on the moon.

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,430
Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American...

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,199
standing on the surface
of the moon...

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,637
on this July 20, 1969.

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,433
That's one small step for man...

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,833
one giant leap for mankind.

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,797
His quote was...

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,398
"That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,399
Somewhere

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,471
Beyond the sea

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,551
Somewhere waitin' for me

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,108
- You're drunk, Lovell.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,236
I'm not used to the champagne.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,157
Me neither.

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,877
I can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,349
All right, let's sell the house.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,711
They're back inside now
lookin' up at us.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,836
Isn't that somethin'?

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,118
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't
get a wink of sleep tonight.

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,909
When you were on the far side on 8,
I didn't sleep at all.

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,520
I just vacuumed
over and over again.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,594
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,718
Neil Armstrong.

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,671
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,555
It's not a miracle.

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,114
We just decided to go.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,510
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,791
just 60 nautical miles down and...

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,874
It was like I could just...

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,509
step out and walk
on the face of it.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,595
I want to go back there.

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,271
Where's my mountain?

111
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,790
Well, it... Up there.

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,035
It's, uh, right up by the...

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,714
It's... Okay, do you see
where the shadow crosses...

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,149
the white area there?

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,798
That's the Sea of Tranquility...

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,155
and your mountain's right there
on the edge of that.

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,794
It's your mountain.
Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

118
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,394
I don't see it.

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,988
Well, you gotta look harder.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,789
You... You... You look harder...

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,960
- Jim.
- While I...

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,871
Jim!

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,110
Groovin'

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,317
Down a crowded avenue

125
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,358
The astronaut is only
the most visible member...

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,951
of a very large team, and all of us
down to the guy sweeping the floor...

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,877
are honored to be a part of it.

128
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,117
What did the man say? "Give me a lever
long enough and I'll move the world"?

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,397
That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration.

130
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,190
It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,636
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

132
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,349
and hold millions of pieces
of information...

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,000
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,918
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,073
and his crew on the first leg
of the Apollo 13 mission.

136
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,953
When are you
going up again, Jim?

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,874
I'm slated to be the commander
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,036
If there is an Apollo 14.

139
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,598
Jim, people in my state have been
asking why we're continuing...

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,355
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,671
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the new world...

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,115
and no one returned
in his footsteps.

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,749
Attention, all personnel.
Clear level three.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,831
Are there any other questions?

145
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,076
How do you go
to the bathroom in space?

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,232
Well, I tell you,
it's a highly technical process...

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,472
of cranking down the window and
looking for a gas station, which, uh...

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,512
Oh, there's Deke Slayton.

149
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,438
Deke, you might be able
to answer this lady's question.

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,195
Deke is one of the original Mercury
seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,477
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

152
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,432
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

153
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,796
- How much this month?
- Can I have a minute?
Something's come up.

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,711
Sure, you b... Uh, Henry?

155
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,031
Hey!

156
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,189
- Anybody home?
- I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,231
You don't understand!
I worked so hard on this!

158
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,679
Maybe I don't understand...

159
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,917
but you are not wearing that
out in this neighborhood.

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,235
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,673
Shut up!

162
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,149
- Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.
- Jim.

163
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,909
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,353
Uh-oh.

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,238
I was thinkin' there might be
a slight change in destination.

166
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,675
Really?

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,712
Maybe, say... the moon.

168
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,953
Al Shepard's ear infection
has flared up...

169
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,033
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

170
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,193
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro highlands.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,879
Six months?
You're moving up six months?

172
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,276
- Dad, can I please wear this?
- Sure.

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,635
- Jim.
- No! No. Absolutely not.

174
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,433
- Don't you want somebody to love
- This stinks!

175
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,750
They're not rushing things, are they?

176
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,711
You're gonna be ready
in six months?

177
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,673
We'll be ready. Boy, I wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

178
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,280
I gotta get over there.
We're gonna have to get up to speed.

179
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,112
Go. Go.

180
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,350
I'm gonna walk
on the moon, Marilyn.

181
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,591
I know. I can't believe it.

182
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,996
Naturally, it's 13.
Why 13?

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,031
It comes after 12, hon.

184
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,075
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,834
All systems are nominal
and on the line.

186
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,595
Okay, S-4B is stable,
slot panels are drifting free.

187
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,997
The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.

188
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,914
Okay, I'm comin' up on that now.
Two... one... mark.

189
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,997
Seventy-five feet.
We're comin' up on docking.

190
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,914
Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.
We'll see what he does.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,116
Whoa. Wait a minute.

192
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,350
I lost something here.
I can't translate up.

193
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,637
Houston, we are drifting
down and away.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,518
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, I got it.

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,512
Let me just try
and get it stable here.

196
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,997
- I'm gonna reset the high gain.
- Got the target back in the reticle.

197
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,270
We're stable.
Go ahead and recycle the valves.

198
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,318
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

199
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,435
Twenty.

200
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,233
- Easy.
- Ten feet.

201
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,989
- Capture.
- That's it!

202
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,595
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

203
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,950
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,676
Apollo 13 backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.

205
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,877
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,951
followed by seven seconds
of sheer terror.

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,350
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

208
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,552
Nice try, Frank.
You really outfoxed 'em, brother.

209
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,393
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

210
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,317
You're above the curve.

211
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,875
Not by much. Listen, guys,
I wanna work it again.

212
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,795
Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?

213
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,717
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know...

214
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,354
but my rate of turn
is still a little slow.

215
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,034
I really think
we should work it again.

216
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,989
- Well, let's get it right.
- Okay, set it up again, Frank.

217
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,038
Okay, 13 backup crew.
It'll have to wait.

218
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,874
- Prime crew's up for another run.
- Yeah, baby.

219
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,237
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

220
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,231
and all systems are nominal.

221
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,515
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

222
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,199
and when you get
in the LEM, two forward.

223
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,875
Good shape over here.

224
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,272
Hey, we got a problem.

225
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,029
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can't get it locked!

226
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,791
Oh, God!

227
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,592
Jim!

228
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,760
I thought the stars
would fall down on you.

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,872
That's silly.
Stars can't fall on us.

230
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,791
You're a smarter kid than I was.

231
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,394
How long will it take
to get to the moon?

232
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,878
Four days.
But that's pretty fast.

233
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,150
See, this is
the Saturn 4B booster...

234
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,152
and it shoots us
away from the Earth...

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,119
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

236
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,551
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,758
into a circle around the moon...

238
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,711
which is called an orbit.

239
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,791
All right?

240
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,394
Fred and I float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,311
this spidery-Iookin' guy.

242
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,234
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landin' on the moon.

243
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,158
And I take the controls
and I steer it around...

244
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,236
and I fly it down...

245
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,829
adjustin' it here,
the attitude there, pitch, roll...

246
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,515
for a nice, soft landing
on the moon.

247
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,876
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

248
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,719
Dad... did you know
the astronauts in the fire?

249
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,153
Yeah. Yeah, I did. I knew the
astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.

250
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,236
Could that happen again?

251
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,830
Well, I'll tell ya
somethin' about that fire.

252
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,111
Um, a lot of things went wrong.

253
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,517
The, uh... The door.

254
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,951
It's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,037
That was one thing. And, uh...

256
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,470
Well, a lot of things
went wrong in that fire.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,550
Did they fix it?

258
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,916
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
We fixed it.

259
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,076
It's not a problem anymore.

260
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,916
I can't believe they still
have you doing public appearances.

261
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,834
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.

262
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,593
I know. But with a training
schedule this tight...

263
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,996
Well, it's... It's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,640
Hey! Hey, you're
Jim Lovell, aren't ya?

265
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,950
Hey! Lucky 13!

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,991
Right on!

267
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,716
That's the second time
it's done that.

268
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,275
I was looking at the kids'
school schedule coming up.

269
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,719
Yeah?

270
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,991
- It's a very busy week.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,675
I'm thinking about
not going to the launch.

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,437
Huh.

273
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,988
The kids need me at home, honey.

274
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,959
Marilyn, we've had
these kids for awhile now.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,878
They've never kept you from
comin' to the other launches.

276
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,150
But now we have your mother.
She's just had this stroke.

277
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,593
Mom's fine.

278
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,148
It's not like I've
never been to a launch.

279
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,549
The other wives
have not done three.

280
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,235
I just don't think
I can go through all that.

281
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,878
I'll just be glad
when this one's over.

282
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,993
Well, you're gonna miss
a hell of a show.

283
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,595
- Jim.
- Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.

284
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,752
Take care.
Bring us back a moon rock.

285
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,952
So the number 13
doesn't bother you.

286
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,911
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

287
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,198
Apollo 13, lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

288
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,437
and entering the moon's
gravity on April 13?

289
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,274
Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been
doing some scientific experiments...

290
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,191
regarding that very phenomenon,
haven't you?

291
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,115
Uh, yes. Well, I had a black cat,
uh, walk over a broken mirror...

292
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,957
under the lunar module ladder.

293
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,678
It didn't seem to be a problem.

294
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,950
We're considering a letter
we got from a fella...

295
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,828
who said we oughta take
a pig with us for good luck.

296
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,798
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

297
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,634
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

298
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,271
And, uh, I think that
an astronaut's last mission...

299
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,110
his final flight... that's always
going to be very special.

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,395
Why is this your last, Jim?

301
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,075
I'm in command
of the best ship...

302
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,038
with the best crew
that anybody could ask for...

303
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,749
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

304
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,752
between sunlight and shadow.

305
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,958
I can't imagine, uh,
ever topping that.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,434
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

307
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,476
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,354
Freddo and I are gonna be goin' over the
lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

309
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,749
and Ken's gonna be
back in the simulator.

310
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,756
We're gonna be goin' over
the flight plan tonight.

311
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,515
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down. Thanks.

312
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,994
Jim, we've got a problem.

313
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,029
We just got some blood work back from
the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

314
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,429
So we need a new backup.

315
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,234
- You've all been exposed to it.
- Oh, I've had the measles.

316
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

317
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,998
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

318
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,113
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

319
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,196
Ken Mattingly will be
getting seriously ill...

320
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,392
precisely when you and Haise will
be ascending from the lunar surface.

321
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,317
That's a lousy time for a fever.

322
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,033
Jack Swigert has been
out of the loop for weeks.

323
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,196
He's fully qualified
to fly this mission.

324
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,716
He's a fine pilot, but when was
the last time he was in a simulator?

325
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,951
I'm sorry, Jim.
I understand how you feel.

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,877
We can do one of two things.

327
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,117
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

328
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,277
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

329
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,151
I've trained
for the Fra Mauro highlands...

330
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,351
and this is flight surgeon
horseshit, Deke!

331
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,235
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on Apollo 13.

332
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,356
It's your decision.

333
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,511
Oh, let it ring.

334
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,273
Listen, I-I gotta take that.

335
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,476
- Oh, why?
- Because I'm on the backup crew...

336
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,235
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel room.

337
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,357
Swigert. Yeah.

338
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,709
I looked all around

339
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,390
Yes. Yes, sir.
Uh-uh, I understand.

340
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,716
- Thank you, sir.
- Why don't you come with me, little girl

341
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,352
On a magic carpet ride

342
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,353
Well, you don't know
what we can see

343
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,119
Why don't you tell
your dreams to me

344
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,116
Well, I, uh...

345
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,591
Damn.

346
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,234
Medical guys.

347
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,354
I had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that, uh...

348
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,030
I mean, I know it's their ass if I get
sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

349
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh, boy.

350
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,875
Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh...

351
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,916
He's strong.

352
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,029
It'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

353
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,952
You sure about this?
Why don't I talk to Deke?

354
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm sure we can work this out.

355
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,913
This was my call.

356
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,070
Must've been a tough one.

357
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,834
Look, I don't have the measles.

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,468
I'm not gonna get the measles.

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,878
Shit. Ken, wait up.

360
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,073
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

361
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,393
We're into program 64. We're in 05 Gs,
so we're feeling that gravity now.

362
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,359
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interphase.

363
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,277
About to lose signal.

364
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,757
Reentry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.

365
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,236
What's the story here?

366
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,154
I got a corridor light.
We're comin' in too shallow.

367
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,919
I'm goin' to manual.

368
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,997
- Houston, switching to S.C.S.
- Roger, Thirteen.

369
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,713
Okay, we're at three Gs.

370
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,593
Five Gs.

371
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,517
We're comin' in too steep.

372
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,155
I'm gonna stay in this roll,
see if I can pull us out.

373
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,350
We're at eight Gs.

374
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,908
Nine. Ten.

375
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,958
- We're at 12 Gs.
- Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,436
Damn it!

377
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,472
I gave 'em a false indicator light
at entry interphase.

378
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,431
Even Mattingly didn't
get it the first time.

379
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,516
How ya feelin', Freddo?

380
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,909
Char-broiled.

381
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,191
So what happened?

382
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,999
Came in too steep. We're dead.

383
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,473
- No shit.
- Yeah, we were into program 67 there.

384
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,913
Okay, we're gonna
do this again, obviously...

385
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,474
but give us a minute
to get our switches reset.

386
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,431
Jim, could we have a word?

387
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,431
Oh, sure, Deke.

388
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,630
We're going to drop off line
and debrief.

389
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,188
- So?
- Well...

390
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,835
if I had a dollar for every time
they killed me in this thing...

391
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,753
I wouldn't have
to work for you, Deke.

392
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,273
Well, we have two days.
We'll be ready.

393
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,276
Let's do it again.

394
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,357
Do it again.

395
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,349
Margaret, get them!
Fred, Stephen, come here!

396
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,749
- Daddy!
- Watch out! You'll fall!

397
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,354
We can't go across that road.

398
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,995
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space.

399
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,834
Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom
a hard time, are ya?

400
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,309
Princess, you look beautiful.

401
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,637
Jack!

402
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,759
Well, hey, that looks
like Marilyn Lovell.

403
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,718
But it can't be.
She's not coming to the launch.

404
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,631
I heard it was gonna be
a hell of a show.

405
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,312
Who told you that?

406
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,789
Some guy I know.

407
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,277
You can't live without me.

408
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,314
Okay, folks.
Let's say good night.

409
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,516
- We got a big day tomorrow.
- Good night!

410
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,319
You hear about Ken?

411
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,198
Yeah.

412
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,392
One, two.

413
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,510
Stand back, please.

414
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,877
Ah, Guenter Wendt.

415
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,155
I wonder where Guenter went?

416
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,270
Jim.

417
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,114
- You walk on ze moon, ja?
- Ja. Ja, we walk and...

418
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,794
and we talk on ze moon.

419
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,350
How do you feel? Pretty good?

420
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,836
Good. Might be a little
warmer in here, huh?

421
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,395
- How are you today? Ready?
- Good. Yeah.

422
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,475
Oh! Oh! Jeez! Oh!

423
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,678
Oh, God, no!

424
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,470
Oh, no.

425
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,190
- Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?
- Check.

426
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,238
- We have the helmet restraint ring?
- Check.

427
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,755
Communication umbilical on.

428
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,717
- Fred.
- What?

429
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,836
- Gum.
- Aw, sorry.

430
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,397
Thanks.

431
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,068
I'm gonna give these guys
a beautiful ride.

432
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,519
Sure you will, Jack.

433
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,351
You need more air?

434
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,675
You want some apple?

435
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,591
- Marilyn, hey!
- Mary.

436
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,830
Aw, I hate this already.

437
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,916
You're not just about to pop,
are you?

438
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,709
No. I got 30 days
'til this blast-off.

439
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,677
This is for Gene.

440
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,590
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

441
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,910
The last one looked like
he bought it off a gypsy.

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,355
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

443
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,271
Copy that.

444
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,271
This is from your wife, Gene.

445
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,197
Thank you, Tom.

446
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,276
I was startin' to get worried.

447
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,317
There we go.

448
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,399
- I like it. I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

449
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,869
Jim, you're all set.

450
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,871
Very sharp.

451
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,150
Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now.

452
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,714
Save it for splashdown, guys.

453
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,469
Apollo 13 flight controllers,
listen up.

454
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,994
Give me a go,
no go for launch.

455
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,235
- Booster.
- Go.
- RETRO.

456
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,998
- Go.
- FIDO.
- We're go, Flight.

457
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,951
- Guidance.
- Guidance go.
- Surgeon.

458
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,632
- Go, Flight.
- EECOM.

459
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,631
- We're go, Flight.
- GNC.
- We're go.

460
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,830
- TELMU. Control.
- Go.
- Go, Flight.

461
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,632
- Procedures.
- Go.
- INCO.

462
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,194
- Go.
- FAO.
- We are go.

463
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,435
- Network. Recovery.
- Go.
- Go.

464
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,630
- CAPCOM.
- We're go, Flight.

465
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,514
Launch Control, this is Houston.
We are go for launch.

466
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,233
Roger that, Houston.

467
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,629
Pad leader, what's your status?

468
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,671
We are go for launch.

469
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,109
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

470
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,277
- Stand by.
- Roger.

471
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,910
Fuel pumps.

472
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,270
This is it. A few bumps
and we're haulin' the mail.

473
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,833
Control, this is Guidance.
They're ready for takeoff.

474
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,712
We are go for launch.

475
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,669
- T minus...
- 15... 14...

476
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,508
13... 12... 11...

477
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,437
ten... nine...

478
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,789
eight... seven...

479
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,758
six... ignition sequence starts...

480
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,515
three... two... one...

481
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,431
ignition!

482
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,348
The clock is running!

483
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,154
We have lift-off!

484
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,270
Houston, we have cleared
the tower at 1313.

485
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,351
Okay, guys, we got it.

486
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,480
Come on, baby. Come on.

487
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,630
Altitude is on the line.

488
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,359
Velocity right on the line.

489
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,676
Roll complete. We are pitching.

490
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,713
Thirteen, stand by
for mode one Bravo.

491
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,989
FIDO, how we lookin'?

492
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,674
Looks good, Flight.
Right down the middle.

493
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,555
We see your B.P.C.
Is clear, Thirteen.

494
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,870
Roger. E.D.S. To manual.

495
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,599
Inboard.

496
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,752
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

497
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,114
That was some little jolt.

498
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,551
Tower jett.

499
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,036
Houston, we've got a center engine
cutoff. Go on the other four.

500
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,079
Roger that, Thirteen.
We show the same.

501
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,190
Booster, can you
confirm that cutoff?

502
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,397
- Roger. Looks like we lost it.
- FIDO, what's that going to do?

503
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,839
Stand by, Flight.

504
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,519
I need to know if the I.U.'s
correcting for the shutdown.

505
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,229
Houston, what's the story
on engine five?

506
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,314
We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

507
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,154
- Roger that.
- Thirteen, we're not sure
why the inboard was out...

508
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,192
but the other engines are go,
so we're gonna burn those engines...

509
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,111
a little bit longer.

510
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,839
Roger that.
Our gimbals are good.

511
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,519
Our trim is good.

512
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,152
Looks like we just had
our glitch for this mission.

513
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,077
- 13, stand by for staging.
- Roger that.

514
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,119
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

515
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,390
Thrust looks good, Flight.

516
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,035
Flight, S-4B cutoff
in ten seconds.

517
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,278
Thirteen, this is Houston.
Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.

518
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,956
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

519
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,833
- And...
- SECO!

520
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,394
Shutdown.

521
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,638
And that, gentlemen,
is how we do that.

522
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,309
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

523
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,351
Mom, that was loud.

524
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,960
Here, hold my hand.

525
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
I can't believe
you did this four times.

526
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,033
The worst part's over.

527
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,111
It is?

528
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,876
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

529
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,996
Well, you just look
so calm about it.

530
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,198
If the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, I'd be grounded.

531
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,959
Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
Can we speak to you?

532
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,116
Can we just have
a word with you?

533
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,555
Remember, you're proud,
happy and thrilled.

534
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,999
Mrs. Lovell!

535
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,713
- How're ya feeling?
- Well, very proud...

536
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,955
and very happy,
and we're thrilled.

537
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,352
Flight, Booster.
I show S-4B shutdown.

538
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,278
T.L.I. Is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.

539
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,675
Roger, FIDO.

540
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,396
Okay, guys.
We're goin' to the moon.

541
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

542
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,031
Flight, everything looks good.

543
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,839
Okay, Houston. C.M.P. Here.

544
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,031
I've exchanged couches with Jim.
I'm in the pilot's seat.

545
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,676
I'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

546
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,154
Roger that, Jack.

547
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,509
Freddo, you okay?

548
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,031
Okay, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.

549
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,675
Odyssey, you're go
for pyro arm and docking,

550
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,797
and we recommend you secure
cabin pressurization.

551
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,513
Roger that.

552
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,236
Okay, we're ready
for C.S.M. Separation.

553
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,757
Okay, S.M.R.C.S.
Isol valves are all gray.

554
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,950
Okay, Swigert,
command module pilot...

555
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,190
she's all yours.

556
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,314
Houston, we've got
a good separation.

557
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,999
- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.

558
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,436
- We confirm that, Thirteen.
- We're gonna start to pitch around...

559
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,351
to line up with the LEM.

560
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,351
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

561
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,273
was upchuckin' most of the way
to the moon on Apollo 8.

562
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,233
I'm all right. I just ate too much
breakfast. Let's go to work.

563
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,511
And pitching up.

564
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,876
Pitch rate,
2.5 degrees per second.

565
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,390
Roger, Jack.
We see you pitching around.

566
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,317
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

567
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,558
Roger that. If Swigert can't dock
this thing, we don't have a mission.

568
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,956
- How's the alignment?
- G.D.C. Align.

569
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,271
Thrusting forward.

570
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,515
One hundred feet.

571
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,954
Watch the alignment, now.

572
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,996
Ah, don't worry, guys.

573
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,395
I'm on top of it.

574
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,838
- FIDO, let me know when you're ready.
- Okay, let's uplink that.

575
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,798
- How we lookin'?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

576
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,635
Twenty.

577
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,750
Come on, rookie,
park that thing.

578
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,072
Ten feet.

579
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,268
- Capture.
- That's it.

580
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,636
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

581
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,275
Houston, we have hard dock.

582
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,312
Roger, understand.
That's a good deal, Jack.

583
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,828
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

584
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,350
Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.

585
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,351
We copy that, Thirteen.

586
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,550
Now you're off
to the Fra Mauro highlands.

587
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,309
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

588
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,436
for the beginning
of the P.T. C...

589
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,672
and I think once we're in that
barbecue roll, uh, Jack and I will eat.

590
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,188
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

591
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,676
I could eat the ass
out of a dead rhinoceros.

592
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,674
- We got a smooth one, huh?
- By the numbers so far.

593
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,316
We just ran a minimum load test on the
cooling system. Let me clean this up.

594
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,396
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

595
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,309
It's too bad we can't
demonstrate this on TV.

596
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,274
What a shame.

597
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,277
Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.

598
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,838
Here it comes...

599
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,791
the constellation Urion.

600
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,714
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

601
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,548
Barbara. Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

602
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,114
No! I'm never coming out!

603
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,153
I hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

604
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,471
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

605
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,273
- They're not stupid! You're stupid!
- Barbara!

606
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,713
I know you're in mourning.

607
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,075
I'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

608
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,517
The whole world is going to be watching
this broadcast, and so are we.

609
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,437
Excuse me while I...

610
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,672
Okay, uh, good evening, America...

611
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,433
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

612
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,274
I'm Jim Lovell, and we're
broadcasting to you tonight...

613
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,035
from an altitude of almost
200,000 miles...

614
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,873
away from the face
of the earth...

615
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,718
and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.

616
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,870
We are going
to show you just what...

617
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,555
- Susan. Barbara.
- Our life is like for the three of us...

618
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,279
- in the vast expanse of outer space.
- Double!

619
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,794
One of the first things
we'd like to do...

620
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,991
is provide you with the
appropriate background music.

621
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,560
So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.

622
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,751
Hello, world!

623
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,192
That, uh, was supposed
to be the theme to 2001...

624
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,669
in honor of
our command module Odyssey...

625
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,355
but there seems to have been
a change in the program.

626
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,951
When I go up on 19, I'm gonna take my
entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

627
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,957
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

628
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,116
All the networks dumped us.

629
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,230
One of them said we made
goin' to the moon...

630
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,880
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

631
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,314
My son's supposed to be on.

632
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,834
He's in outer space.

633
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,550
This is all the channels
we get, Mrs. Lovell.

634
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,638
It's that damn TV Guide again.

635
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,148
Ruthless porters.

636
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,111
Savage baggage masters...

637
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,078
When I was just a lad of ten

638
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,237
My father said to me

639
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,676
- Come here and take...
- Do they know they're not on the air?

640
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,228
We'll tell them
when they get back.

641
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,236
Don't put your faith
in love, my boy

642
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,880
My father said to me

643
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,708
Uh, well, if anyone from the,
uh, I.R.S. Is watching...

644
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,758
I forgot to file my 1040 return.

645
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,308
I meant to do it today, but, uh...

646
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,630
That's no joke.
They'll jump on him.

647
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,235
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

648
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,673
Follow me.

649
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,320
Now, when we get ready
to land on the moon...

650
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,194
Fred Haise and I will float
through this access tunnel...

651
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,157
into the lunar module, leaving...

652
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,198
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

653
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,716
on both H2 and both O2 tanks,
is that correct?

654
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,870
...the spacecraft
will remain connected.

655
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,718
Well, folks, as you can
probably tell...

656
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,872
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

657
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,309
The skin of the LEM
in some places...

658
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,516
is only as...

659
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,028
as thick as a couple of layers...

660
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,436
of tinfoil, and that's all that
protects us from the vacuum of space.

661
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,235
We get away with this because the LEM is
designed only for flight in outer space.

662
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,233
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

663
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,796
Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

664
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,313
When you and your baby
have a fallin' out

665
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,278
All right, we've returned to the...

666
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,238
Stand by one, Houston.

667
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,595
Gotcha!

668
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,474
Houston, that bang you heard was
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

669
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,074
He gets our hearts goin'
every time with that one.

670
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,549
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

671
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,435
Okay, we're, uh, about
to close out the Aquarius...

672
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,114
and, uh, return to the Odyssey.

673
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,915
Our next broadcast will be from
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

674
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,154
So, uh, this is the crew
of the Apollo 13...

675
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,476
wishing everyone
back on Earth a...

676
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,755
a pleasant evening.

677
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,958
All right.

678
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,911
Daddy was funny.

679
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,315
They might air a few minutes
of it on the news tonight.

680
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,272
You'd think so.

681
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,396
- Bye.
- Bye.

682
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,719
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise Show...

683
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,076
I'd say that was a pretty
successful broadcast.

684
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,596
- That was an excellent show.
- Thank you very much, Houston.

685
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,830
We've got a couple of
housekeeping procedures.

686
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,471
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

687
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,235
Roger that.
Rolling right, 0-6-0.

688
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,869
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

689
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,712
Roger that.

690
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,714
Hey, we've got a problem here.

691
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,320
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

692
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,749
- Whoa!
- Hey!

693
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,479
Uh, this is Houston.
Say again please.

694
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,429
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a main bus B undervolt.

695
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,637
- We've got a lot
of thruster activity here.
- What's with the computer now?

696
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,673
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

697
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,671
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

698
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,439
- Maybe it's in quad C.
I'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.
- We've got a computer restart.

699
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,556
- We've got a ping light.
- The way these are firing
doesn't make sense.

700
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,030
We've got multiple caution and warning,
Houston. We've got to reset and restart.

701
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,315
I'm going to S.C.S.

702
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,073
Jesus. Flight, their
heart rates are skyrocketing.

703
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,675
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

704
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,230
Tank one is at 725 psi
and falling.

705
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,716
Fuel cells one and three
are, uh...

706
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,314
Oh, boy, what's going on here?
Flight, let me get back to you.

707
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,318
Flight, GNC.
They're all over the place.

708
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,039
- They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.

709
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,951
Flight, their antennae
must be flipped around.

710
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,235
They're gonna have to do it
manually if they do it at all.

711
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,793
One at a time, people.

712
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,714
Is this an instrumentation problem
or are we looking at real power loss?

713
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,109
It's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

714
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,037
It's got to be
instrumentation.

715
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,799
Let's get the hatch buttoned.
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.

716
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,713
The tunnel's really torquin'
with all this movement.

717
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,110
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
there associated with a master alarm.

718
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,628
Shit, it's main bus A.

719
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,430
- Main bus A undervolt?
- Main bus A undervolt down to...

720
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,229
It's reading 25 and a half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

721
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,390
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

722
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,034
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

723
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,951
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

724
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,634
- You are breaking up, 13.
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

725
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,952
Just stow it. If we'd been hit
by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

726
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,996
I'm gonna try to get us
out of this lurch.

727
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,600
Houston, did you say
switch to omni Bravo?

728
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,797
- Roger that, Thirteen.
- The signal strength went way down.

729
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,673
It's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

730
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,475
We need a confirmation.
What systems do you have down?

731
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,518
- I'm having a hard time, Rick.
- S.M.R.C.S. Helium one.

732
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,353
- Did you say switch to omni Charlie?
- A and C are barber pole.

733
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,153
Houston, I'm switching over
quad C to main A.

734
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,593
Roger that, Thirteen.

735
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,752
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one,
fuel cell three.

736
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,634
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

737
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,714
What don't we have?
A.C. Bus one, A.C. Bus two...

738
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,917
command module computer
and O2 flow high.

739
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,468
I don't know. Maybe this is
a caution and warning failure.

740
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,475
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

741
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,839
I can see it outside
of window one right now.

742
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,590
It's definitely, uh...
a gas of some sort.

743
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,438
It's got to be the oxygen.

744
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,029
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.

745
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,552
- Give me an alignment.
- Let's think about the kind
of things we can connect.

746
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,313
- Let's start back at the beginning.
- Anything look abnormal?

747
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,398
Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.

748
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,156
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Let's stay cool, people.

749
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,198
Procedures, I need another
computer up in the R.T.C.C.

750
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,919
I want everybody to alert
your support teams.

751
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,639
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

752
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,870
Let's work the problem, people.

753
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,315
Let's not make things worse
by guessin'.

754
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,439
13, this is Houston. We are going around
the room. We're gonna get you answers.

755
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,115
We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.

756
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,430
Take a look at the O2
on number one.

757
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,838
200 pounds and falling.

758
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,956
O2 tank two still zero.

759
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,476
- Tank one: 218 psi and falling.
- Is that what you're gettin'? Confirm.

760
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,792
- We're seeing the same, 13.
- Can we review our status, Sy?

761
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,351
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

762
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,471
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

763
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,111
I'll get back to you, Gene.

764
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,435
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

765
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,677
The ship's bleedin' to death.

766
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,913
- Flight?
- Yeah. Go, EECOM.

767
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,873
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

768
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,556
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

769
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,471
If that's where the leak is,
we can isolate it.

770
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,996
We can isolate it there,
save what's left in the tanks,
and we can run on the good cell.

771
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,911
You close 'em,
you can't open 'em again.

772
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,468
You can't land on the moon
with one healthy fuel cell.

773
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,671
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

774
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,439
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

775
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,590
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.

776
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,311
CAPCOM, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

777
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,233
Thirteen, this is Houston.

778
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,713
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

779
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,833
Are you saying you want
the whole smash?

780
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,833
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shut down?

781
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,435
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?

782
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,239
Yeah, they heard me right.

783
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,869
Tell them we think that's
the only way they can stop the leak.

784
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,397
Yeah, Jim. We think that closing
the react valves may stop the leak.

785
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,357
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

786
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,268
Yes, Houston, we copy.

787
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,233
We just lost the moon.

788
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,430
Okay, Freddo,
shut those down.

789
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,191
Let's see what this does.

790
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,590
If this doesn't work...

791
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,353
we're not gonna have enough
power left to get home.

792
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,154
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

793
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,317
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

794
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,437
Freddo, how long does it take
to power up the LEM?

795
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,550
Three hours by the checklist.

796
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,989
We don't have that much time.

797
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,036
Shit!

798
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,955
Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

799
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,755
let's power down everything so we can
save as much as we can for reentry.

800
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,270
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.
The command module will be dead.

801
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,312
Okay. Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

802
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,715
We're moving the astronauts
over to the LEM.

803
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,637
We've got to get some oxygen up there.

804
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,990
TELMU, Control, I want emergency power
procedure; essential hardware only.

805
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,158
GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

806
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,714
We'll have to transfer the guidance
system from one computer to the other...

807
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,513
so I want those numbers up and ready
when our guys are in position.

808
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,830
We've gotta transfer all control
data over the LEM computer...

809
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,757
before the command module dies.

810
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,711
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

811
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,994
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

812
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,237
You're gonna have to power up
the LEM at the same time, so you
better get somebody over there.

813
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,073
We already have Freddo
in the LEM, Houston.

814
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,475
We've got serious time pressure.

815
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,875
You've got to get
the guidance program transferred,

816
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,434
and you've got to do it before you're
out of power in the command module...

817
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,835
or you're not gonna be able
to navigate up there.

818
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,791
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

819
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,793
Well, we're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

820
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,432
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

821
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,359
Houston, be aware I've moved
from the command module into the LEM.

822
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,716
If Jack can't get that guidance computer
data transferred before they go dead...

823
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,115
- They won't even know
which way they're pointed.
- That's right.

824
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,754
- That's a bad way to fly.
- I'll be in 210 if you need me.

825
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,469
Houston, this is Thirteen.
Are you back with me now?

826
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,071
Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have
about 12 minutes to power up.

827
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,159
I can't see any stars. Man, there's a
lot of debris floatin' around out there.

828
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,153
Okay, Houston, I have completed
the steps on page 15.

829
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,071
Now I'm ready
to power down the computer.

830
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,391
I'm gonna need
your gimbal angles, Jack...

831
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,553
- before you shut down the computer!
- Okay, Jim.

832
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,670
I need this back to me
before they power down.

833
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,671
All right, all right.
I got it. Hold on.

834
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,396
- Houston, our computer is up.
- Roger. Stand by.

835
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,871
Jack, we need to proceed with
steps 12 through 17 quickly.

836
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,317
You're down to about
eight minutes remaining.

837
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,590
Fuel cell pump's off.
O2 fans, tank two off.

838
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,434
Okay, Houston, check me. I have
completed these gimbal conversions...

839
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,956
but I need a double check
of the arithmetic.

840
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,238
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

841
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,636
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

842
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,317
Pitch: 1678... Correction.
Pitch: 167.78.

843
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,150
- Yaw is 351.87.
- Stand by. We're checking it.

844
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,555
We've got negative visibility
in our star field,

845
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,515
and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here?

846
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,357
Looks good, Flight.

847
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,391
- It's all right.
- Good here.

848
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,795
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

849
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,751
- You're good.
- Log them in, Freddo.

850
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,155
Jack, turn off the I.M.U.
Switch to S.C.S.

851
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,555
Stand by to turn off
the thrusters. Over.

852
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,072
It's a great day in New York.
It's girl watchers' weather.

853
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,628
I like those ingenious girl watchers
who put on Con Edison helmets...

854
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,593
and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.

855
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,875
But I... Hey, speaking
of girl watching,

856
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,754
did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?

857
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,796
Is it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.

858
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,958
He's the kind, they say, has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.

859
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,198
He's sort of foolishly optimistic,
taking nylons, Hershey bars to the moon.

860
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,751
Did you read
that three million...

861
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,957
What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?

862
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,835
Three million fewer viewers, uh, watched
the space shot than did the last one.

863
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,559
Uh, I...
Colonel Borman is h...

864
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,029
An ABC New...

865
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,635
Here is ABC science editor
Jules Bergman.

866
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,156
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,

867
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,708
and astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

868
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,155
are making their way through
the tunnel to the lunar module,

869
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,713
using it as a lifeboat,

870
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,758
so they'll have electrical power
for their radios on the command module.

871
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,991
Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...

872
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,032
Slow down. An electrical failure.
What exactly does that mean?

873
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,958
The emergency has ruled out
any chance of a lunar landing...

874
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,600
and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts themselves...

875
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,593
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen,

876
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
can't last them until
they can get back to Earth.

877
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,231
What do you mean there's
no immediate danger?

878
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,675
I just heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

879
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,349
The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...

880
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,470
and getting the astronauts
safely back to Earth.

881
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,111
Recapping what has happened: The Apollo
13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

882
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,037
No, don't give me
that NASA bullshit!

883
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,150
I want to know what's
happening with my husband!

884
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,470
We want to switch control
to the Aquarius now.

885
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,158
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

886
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,993
You're down to
about five minutes now, Jack.

887
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,108
Be aware our R.C.S. Isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

888
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,311
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

889
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,198
- Control, what the hell happened?
- What? I don't know.

890
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,798
We're out of whack. I'm trying to pitch
down, but we're yawing to the left.

891
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,717
Why can't I null this out?

892
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,479
She wasn't designed to fly
attached like this.

893
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,195
It's like flying with
a dead elephant on our back.

894
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,033
Flight, Guidance. We're getting
awfully close to center here.

895
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,715
Watch that middle gimbal. We don't
want you tumbling off into space.

896
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,399
Freddo, inform Houston I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

897
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,351
Roger that, Houston.

898
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,277
I don't need to hear the obvious.

899
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,311
- I've got the frappin' eight-ball
in front of me!
- Andy, we're on VOX.

900
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,193
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

901
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,674
You want what?
You want us to go to VOX?

902
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,718
You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.

903
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,631
Sorry, Jim.

904
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,072
It's only
by a very narrow margin...

905
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,113
that we're going to get Lovell,
Haise and Swigert back alive.

906
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,799
Marilyn?

907
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,593
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey's calling for you.

908
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,514
...the terseness of Kraft and
the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

909
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,076
This has been a very close call.
We're not out of the woods yet.

910
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,075
Jeffrey?

911
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,351
Why are so many people here?

912
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,037
Oh, well, you know...
your dad's flying his mission.

913
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,992
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

914
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,793
Right.

915
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,156
Well...

916
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,268
something broke
on your daddy's spaceship,

917
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,718
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

918
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,956
Was it the door?

919
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,839
Thirteen, Houston. We still show
that venting pushing you around.

920
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,832
- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.

921
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,630
We've had to learn how to fly all over
again, but we are doing better now.

922
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,593
- Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

923
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,030
Jack, we can close out
your procedure now.

924
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,989
Do we know for sure that we can
power this thing back up?

925
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,799
It's gonna get
awfully cold in here.

926
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,516
Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.

927
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,633
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

928
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,676
We're going to the LEM.

929
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,148
We confirm shutdown, Jack.
Lunar module now in control.

930
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,759
Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.

931
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,872
Freddo, we're gonna have
to execute some sort of burn.

932
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,394
It's just a matter of when.

933
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,228
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

934
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,511
Didn't think we'd
be back in here so soon.

935
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,513
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are?

936
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,431
Over.

937
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,631
Okay, people, listen up!

938
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,429
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

939
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,308
From this moment on, we are
improvising a new mission.

940
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,109
Sorry about that.

941
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,191
- We'll get somebody to look at that.
- Find a bulb around here.

942
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,909
How do we get our people home?

943
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,831
They are here.

944
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,229
- Do we turn 'em around,
straight back, direct abort?
- Yes!

945
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,197
- Gene...
- I can't guarantee the burn yet.

946
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,357
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!

947
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,431
We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

948
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,954
It's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

949
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,079
I agree with Jerry. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

950
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,277
- The LEM will not support three
guys for that amount of time.
- It barely holds two.

951
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,069
We've got to do a direct abort. We do an
about-face, bring the guys right home.

952
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,190
Get 'em back soon.
Absolutely.

953
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,117
We don't even know if
the Odyssey's engine's working.

954
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,031
If there's been serious damage
to this spacecraft...

955
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,951
They blow up and they die!

956
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,951
- That is not the argument!
We are talking about time!
- Jesus! Come on!

957
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,032
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

958
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,833
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

959
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,992
Let's hold it down. The only engine
with enough power for a direct abort...

960
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,389
is the S.P.S.
On the service module.

961
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,630
From what Lovell has told us, it could
have been damaged in an explosion,

962
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,551
so let's consider
that engine dead.

963
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,471
We light that thing up,
could blow the whole works.

964
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,994
It's just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

965
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,395
About the only thing the command
module is good for is reentry.

966
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,989
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

967
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,753
Once we get
the guys around the moon,

968
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,070
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn,

969
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,515
pick up some speed
and get 'em home as quick as we can.

970
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,149
Gene, I'm wondering what
the Grumman guys think about this.

971
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,438
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon,

972
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,710
not fire the engine out there
for course corrections.

973
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,679
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

974
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,555
I don't care what anything was designed
to do. I care about what it can do.

975
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,675
Let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

976
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,198
CAPCOM. Flight, he says
it will be ready in time.

977
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,193
After this burn, we've got to build
some time in the flight plan for sleep.

978
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,556
- Run it by the F.A.O.
- I've run it by the F.A.O.

979
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,471
Do we know how long
we're gonna fire that burn?

980
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,677
- He specifically wanted
a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

981
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,751
- The President.
- The President?

982
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,308
Nixon. He wants odds.

983
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,550
We are not losing the crew.

984
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,438
I gotta give him odds.
Five to one against?

985
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,351
- Three to one?
- I don't think they're that good.

986
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,352
We are not
losing those men!

987
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,952
How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine?

988
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,396
Look, tell him...
three to one.

989
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,598
Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.

990
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,116
When we pick you back up we will
have your P.C. Plus two burn data.

991
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,910
Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

992
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,431
You wanna look?

993
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,838
Oh, look at that.

994
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,757
Wow.

995
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,714
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.

996
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,834
Mare Tranquillitatis.

997
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,997
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

998
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,235
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

999
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,068
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1000
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,350
I've seen it.

1001
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,517
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1002
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:15,315
We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.

1003
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,397
So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.

1004
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,111
When you go
into the shadow of the moon...

1005
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,515
and the moon is
between you and the sun,

1006
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,109
you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...

1007
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,191
on the clearest nights
here on Earth.

1008
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:41,638
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.

1009
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,870
It must be an awe-inspiring sight.

1010
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,554
I-I-I can't wait to see it myself.

1011
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,758
The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,

1012
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,751
but it is the rate
of consumption of water,

1013
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,872
which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...

1014
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,315
to maintain the electronic systems
and so forth.

1015
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,911
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1016
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,599
I can see our landing site.

1017
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,191
Wow.

1018
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,353
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.

1019
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,638
I can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1020
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,150
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

1021
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,237
That's Mare Imbrium to the north.

1022
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,717
Thirteen, this is Houston.

1023
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,594
We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.

1024
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,035
Good to see you too, Houston.

1025
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,556
We are picking you up at a velocity
of 7,062 feet per second...

1026
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,758
at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.

1027
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,912
Stand by for your
P.C. Plus two burn data.

1028
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,199
I had an itch to take this baby down,
do some prospectin'.

1029
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,511
Damn, we were close.

1030
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,158
Gentlemen,
what are your intentions?

1031
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,749
I'd like to go home.

1032
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,069
We got a burn coming up.

1033
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,958
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1034
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,397
Freddo, let's get an idea where
we stand on the consumables.

1035
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,317
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1036
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,477
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1037
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,391
Let's go home.

1038
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,597
Aquarius, we got some P.C.
Plus two burn data for you fellas.

1039
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,830
So you're telling me you can
only give our guys 45 hours?

1040
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,668
That brings them to about there.

1041
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,311
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1042
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,670
Gene, Gene, we've got
to talk about power.

1043
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,672
Whoa, whoa, guys!
Power is everything!

1044
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,075
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1045
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,112
Without it, they don't talk to us,
they don't correct their trajectory,

1046
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,037
they don't turn
the heat shield around.

1047
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,710
We gotta turn everything off, now.
They're not gonna make it to reentry.

1048
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,070
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- With everything on,
the LEM draws 60 amps.

1049
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,358
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1050
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,789
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1051
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,757
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1052
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,070
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 12 amps, John.

1053
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,590
We gotta turn off... We have to
turn off the radars, cabin heater,

1054
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,835
instrument displays,
the guidance computer, the whole smash.

1055
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,553
Whoa! Guidance computer.
What if they need to do another burn?

1056
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,114
They won't even know
which way they're pointed.

1057
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,833
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1058
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,553
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1059
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,710
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1060
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,756
All right.

1061
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,998
Now in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1062
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,197
We're gonna have to power it up using
nothing but the reentry batteries.

1063
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,955
- That's never been tried.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1064
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,116
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1065
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,749
I want people in our simulators
working reentry scenarios.

1066
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,469
I want you to find every engineer who
designed every switch, every circuit,

1067
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,357
and every light bulb
that's up there.

1068
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,671
Then talk to the guy in the assembly
line who actually built the thing.

1069
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,269
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1070
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,388
I want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1071
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,311
We never lost
an American in space.

1072
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,709
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1073
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,631
Failure is not an option.

1074
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,991
Ken?

1075
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,229
Ken?

1076
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,118
- What? Huh?
- Good, you're not dead.

1077
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,873
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for 45 minutes.

1078
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,871
Jesus, John,
what are you doing here?

1079
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,791
I gotta get you in the simulators.
We got a ship to land.

1080
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,030
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1081
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,231
Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells
gone. Command module shut down.

1082
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,118
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1083
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,191
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1084
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,078
We're gonna have to shut
that down pretty soon too.

1085
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,118
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one, Ken.

1086
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,839
Nobody's too sure how much power
we're gonna have when we hit reentry.

1087
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,718
The command module's gonna be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1088
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,351
You see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1089
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,590
We see it spike, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1090
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,671
Our guys can't reenter. Okay?

1091
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,591
How much power do we have
to play with?

1092
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,830
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1093
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,070
- Go.
- Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.

1094
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,720
Copy. He's here.

1095
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,870
They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1096
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,599
They're gonna start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1097
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,791
- Ken, glad you're here.
You know what's going on?
- John's brought me up to speed.

1098
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,030
- What do we have left in the batteries?
- We don't really know.

1099
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,270
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1100
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,713
You know how short?

1101
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,395
It's all in the sequencing. If we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1102
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,233
- turn things on in the right order...
- I agree.

1103
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,590
- You started on a procedure?
- The engineers have tried,
but it's your ship.

1104
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,393
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1105
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,040
Frank, I need the sim
cold and dark.

1106
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,435
Give me the exact same conditions
they've got in there now.

1107
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,994
- I need present status
of every instrument.
- You got it.

1108
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,191
I need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1109
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,276
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1110
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,550
Let's get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1111
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,473
Okay, Houston, the quad heater
circuit breakers are open.

1112
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,397
Copy that.

1113
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,113
We're using the forward omni
when the earth's in the window,

1114
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,833
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1115
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,757
We copy that, Thirteen.

1116
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,314
Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.

1117
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,033
The venting may
push you off course.

1118
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,072
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1119
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,238
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1120
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,191
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1121
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,677
Okay, Houston, that leaves us
with just the computer,

1122
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:15,350
which I'm shutting down now.

1123
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,837
And that's it.

1124
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,952
We just put Sir Isaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1125
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,235
Is it A.M. Or P.M.?

1126
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,590
A.M. Very, very A.M.

1127
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,154
Haise is running a temperature,
and none of them has slept.

1128
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,476
I can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1129
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,676
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1130
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,519
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1131
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,835
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1132
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,276
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.

1133
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,675
- I told the doc...
- They're already up to 8 on the gauges.

1134
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,792
Anything over 15 and you get
impaired judgment, blackouts,

1135
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,190
- beginnings of brain asphyxia.
- What about the scrubbers
on the command module?

1136
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,510
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1137
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,239
Tell me this isn't
a government operation.

1138
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,880
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1139
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,990
Those CO2 levels
are gonna be getting toxic.

1140
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,108
I suggest you invent a way to put
a square peg in a round hole rapidly.

1141
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,877
Okay, people, listen up.

1142
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,873
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1143
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,873
We gotta find a way
to make this...

1144
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,599
fit into the hole for this...

1145
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,148
using nothing but that.

1146
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,154
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1147
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,152
Better get some coffee
going too, someone.

1148
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,910
The Haise family
lives in El Lago, Texas.

1149
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,639
His wife, Mary,
is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1150
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,551
When Fred Haise
was growing up in Biloxi,

1151
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,631
he may have looked
ahead to a fine family,

1152
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,551
but he never dreamt of flying.

1153
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,949
I'd never flown really
before I went into the service,

1154
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,158
and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission.

1155
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,118
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1156
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,119
- I have a request from the news people.
- Uh-huh.

1157
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,668
They want to put
a transmitter up on the lawn.

1158
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,517
Transmitter?

1159
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,074
It's kind of a tower
for a live broadcast.

1160
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,276
They didn't care about this mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1161
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,592
Well... it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are...

1162
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,036
Landing on the moon
wasn't dramatic enough for them.
Why should not landing be?

1163
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,198
Look, I, um, realize
how hard this is, Marilyn,

1164
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,276
but the whole world
is caught up in it.

1165
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,914
- It's the biggest story since...
- No, Henry.

1166
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,630
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1167
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,309
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1168
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,715
He'll be home on Friday.

1169
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,356
When you are sad and Ionely

1170
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,876
And have no place to go

1171
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,159
Come to see me, baby
and bring along some dough

1172
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:22,553
And we'll go honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin'

1173
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,758
Honky tonkin', honey baby

1174
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,868
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

1175
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,471
Hey, Freddo.

1176
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,439
It's too cold in there.

1177
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,512
Yeah.

1178
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,354
That's a nice one of Mary.

1179
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,231
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- I'll survive.

1180
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,073
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.

1181
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,310
Jim, I'm all right.

1182
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,633
It was an accident,
Mary gettin' pregnant.

1183
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,589
You should have seen the look
on my face when she told me.

1184
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,638
Well, that has
a tendency to happen.

1185
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,672
Yeah.

1186
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,116
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

1187
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,997
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1188
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,799
Sure.

1189
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,877
I never dreamed I'd ever get
to do something like this:

1190
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,354
Come up here on a real mission.

1191
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,955
Most of the guys
I graduated high school with...

1192
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,429
never even left home,
and here I am.

1193
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:03,514
Oh, yeah... here you are.

1194
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,240
It hurts when I urinate.

1195
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,278
Well, you're not
gettin' enough water.

1196
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,036
I'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1197
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,198
I think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1198
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,995
He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

1199
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,795
Well... that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1200
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:36,392
That's another first
for America's space program.

1201
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,998
Listen, um... I've been
going... over some stuff,

1202
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:47,472
and I'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1203
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,599
We quit heatin' the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1204
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,517
It could cost us
amp hours on the back end?

1205
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,279
- That's a possibility.
- I've been goin' over the numbers again.

1206
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,318
Have they called up
with a reentry plan yet?

1207
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,920
- We're comin' in too shallow and fast.
- We're workin' on something. Hold on.

1208
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,831
I can't remember
the ratio to temperature.

1209
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,751
We got no references on board.

1210
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,671
Let's see if Houston
can pull up the mill specs.

1211
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,548
Listen, listen! They gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1212
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,712
At this rate we're gonna skip
right out of the atmosphere,
and we're never gonna get back.

1213
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,031
What are you talkin' about?
How'd you figure that?

1214
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,792
I can add.

1215
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,230
- They've got half the Ph.D. S
on the planet working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1216
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,356
What if they made a mistake and
there was no way to reverse it?

1217
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,237
Do you think they would tell us?

1218
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,590
- There's no reason to tell us.
- What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1219
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,029
There's a thousand things
that have to happen in order.

1220
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,989
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1221
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,038
In the meantime, I'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1222
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,078
I think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a goddamn reentry plan.

1223
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,116
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1224
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,668
Ow!

1225
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,597
- Goddamn this piece of shit!
- Hey!

1226
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,835
- This piece of shit's
gonna get you home.
- All right.

1227
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,429
That's because that's
the only thing we got left, Jack!

1228
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,832
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1229
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,429
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.

1230
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,351
What was that gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1231
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,351
- Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M.!
- You don't know, do you?

1232
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,799
They brought me in to do a job!

1233
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,195
They asked me to stir the tanks,
and I stirred the tanks!

1234
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,034
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1235
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,957
No one is saying it is.

1236
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,992
If I'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1237
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,513
Yeah, well, tell him that.

1238
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,672
I just asked you what the gauge
was readin', and you don't know!

1239
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,671
Look, we're not doing this.
We are not gonna do this.

1240
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,109
We're not gonna go bouncing
off the walls for ten minutes...

1241
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,993
because we're just gonna end up right
back here with the same problems!

1242
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,032
Try to figure out
how to stay alive!

1243
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,471
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1244
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,233
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1245
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,754
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius.
Go ahead.

1246
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:51,312
Yeah, Jim, could you check
your CO2 gauge for us?

1247
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,348
Yeah, Houston,
we were just looking at that.

1248
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,194
Our CO2 measurement has jumped
four notches in the last hour.

1249
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,033
That can't be right.
I went over those numbers three times.

1250
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,795
Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.

1251
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,997
That's very comforting, Houston.
What do we do about it?

1252
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:13,471
We're working on a procedure
down here for you.

1253
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,869
- Do you copy?
- Oh, Christ.

1254
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,951
All right, Houston, we're
standing by for those procedures.

1255
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,157
Christ, I know why
my numbers are wrong.

1256
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,879
I only figured it
for two people.

1257
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,755
Maybe I should just
hold my breath.

1258
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,391
The deadly CO2 gas is poisoning the
astronauts with every breath in and out.

1259
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,358
Heads up. Heads up.

1260
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,796
- Oh! Go, go, go, go!
- Someone get that. Damn.

1261
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,757
Heads up, people.
Look out now.

1262
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,196
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1263
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,556
- I hope you got the procedures for me.
- Right here.

1264
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,471
That's it?

1265
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,151
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1266
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,071
Do you have a flight plan?

1267
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,118
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack's got one right here.

1268
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,954
Okay, we have an unusual
procedure for you here.

1269
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,877
We need you
to rip the cover off.

1270
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,275
He wants you to rip the cover
off the flight plan.

1271
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,352
With pleasure.

1272
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,635
The other materials
you're gonna need here are...

1273
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,551
- a lithium hydroxide canister...
- Two, two.

1274
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,710
Two lithium hydroxide canisters.
I'm sorry.

1275
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,155
- A roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1276
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:29,109
Duct tape. You need an L.C.G. Bag...
Two L.C.G. Bags.

1277
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,590
The red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.

1278
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,398
- Can you give me a timetable?
- Henry! Henry!

1279
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,510
What about their level
of carbon dioxide?

1280
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,716
It's, uh, climbing.

1281
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,270
You're saying that they're
almost out of breathable air?

1282
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,876
Wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1283
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,435
You want to cut
the duct tape three feet long.

1284
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,556
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1285
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,359
- It's a good arm length.
- I see what you're getting at. Hold on.

1286
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,398
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1287
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,789
- All right?
- Hold on, Houston.

1288
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,432
While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive,

1289
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,637
one thing they have too much of
is carbon dioxide.

1290
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,551
With each breath,
the three men expel...

1291
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,757
more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit,

1292
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,559
and the scrubbers intended to
keep the atmosphere breathable...

1293
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,471
are quickly becoming saturated.

1294
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,710
Oh, shit. I tore it.

1295
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,957
Shit!

1296
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,272
Houston, what do we do if we
ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1297
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,316
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1298
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,391
Uh, stand by.
What should I tell 'em to do?

1299
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,232
They should have one more.

1300
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,880
But they've still got
a long way to come.

1301
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:46,476
They are now working on their backup
facilities, their emergency facilities.

1302
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,718
The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1303
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,319
As most of you are aware, there is
no rescue possible in space flight.

1304
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,193
A-Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated...

1305
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,117
Hold this a minute.

1306
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,311
Since any rescue system
the space agency calculated...

1307
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,519
- One sock.
- Once you have the sock in place,

1308
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,120
- we're gonna want you to bungee...
- Work it in.

1309
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,395
The entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead,

1310
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,916
- right above the LEM canister.
- We're getting close to 15.

1311
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,551
So how does this flight compare to other
emergency situations you've faced?

1312
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,031
I'd have to say that this is
the most serious situation...

1313
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,793
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1314
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,759
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1315
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,990
Suit circuit relief to close.

1316
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:08,312
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1317
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,358
Here goes.

1318
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,273
I can hear air moving.

1319
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,554
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1320
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,269
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

1321
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,238
Yeah, Houston, we're taking
a look at those numbers now.

1322
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,031
We're still holding
close to 15, Houston.

1323
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,350
Roger that. Standing by.

1324
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,477
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine...

1325
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,149
and it is still falling.

1326
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,038
- Yes!
- Great. Good job, you guys.

1327
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,594
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1328
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,269
And you, sir,
are a steely-eyed missile man.

1329
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,710
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1330
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,320
Damn!

1331
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,237
Damn.

1332
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,396
We overloaded.

1333
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,311
We used way too much power.

1334
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,075
There must be a sneak circuit
between step seven and ten.

1335
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:38,433
- Which one has the leak?
- Don't know that yet, John.

1336
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,398
The sequence was wrong. We just have to
go back and try 'em one at a time.

1337
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,517
You need a break, Ken?

1338
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,478
If they don't get one,
I don't get one.

1339
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,948
Well, if it won't work,
get me another one.

1340
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,157
- My son's supposed to be on.
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1341
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:02,109
- Hi, Blanch.
- They can't fix a thing in this place.

1342
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,998
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1343
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,071
Hi, Grandma.

1344
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:12,109
- I was gonna see Jimmy.
- I know. I know.

1345
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,039
We came to tell you something.

1346
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:20,830
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay. He's all right.

1347
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:25,072
But he's not gonna get
to walk on the moon.

1348
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,311
Well, they said he was.

1349
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,277
I know. I know.

1350
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:34,353
Um... that was before.

1351
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,035
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay.

1352
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,119
They're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1353
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,636
try to figure out
a way to get them home.

1354
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,999
And...

1355
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,834
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1356
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:58,117
Oh, sweetie.

1357
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,190
Are you scared?

1358
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,750
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1359
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,231
If they could get
a washing machine to fly,

1360
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,437
my Jimmy could land it.

1361
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,472
You saw me standing alone

1362
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:32,552
Without a dream in my heart

1363
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:41,155
Without a love of my own

1364
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,198
Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon,

1365
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:00,710
and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...

1366
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:05,515
since you are most decidedly
out of the country.

1367
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,074
Roger that, Houston.

1368
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,839
That's wonderful news.

1369
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,075
Tell them they have to sleep.

1370
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,315
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1371
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,870
Thirteen, we've had another
request from the flight surgeon...

1372
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,791
that you fellas get more sleep.

1373
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,917
He doesn't like
his readings down here.

1374
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,996
Let's see how
he feels about this.

1375
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,157
I am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1376
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,360
knowing how my kidneys
are functioning!

1377
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,552
Flight, I just lost Lovell!

1378
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,560
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.

1379
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:49,076
Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.

1380
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:53,113
I'm not wearing
my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1381
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,435
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1382
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,679
Now I'm losing all three of 'em!

1383
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,274
It's just a little
medical mutiny, Doc.

1384
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,396
I'm sure the guys
are still with us.

1385
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:30,517
Let's cut 'em
some slack, okay?

1386
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,719
It's not the velocity,
it's the angle.

1387
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,230
Maybe they're still venting something
that's throwing off the trajectory,

1388
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,157
but we are definitely
shallowing again.

1389
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,670
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1390
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,439
At this rate, they nick the earth's
atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1391
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,795
- We need another burn
to get them back in the corridor.
- Definitely another burn.

1392
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,276
- Another burn. Copy that.
- Fire the engines and get 'em on course.

1393
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,115
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1394
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,550
Houston, Aquarius.

1395
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:30,712
Jim, we've got another
course correction for you.

1396
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,791
What's up?

1397
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,519
Something about another
course correction.

1398
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,433
Uh, we copy, Houston.

1399
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,672
Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I
a while to power up the computer...

1400
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,797
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1401
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,711
Negative on that, Jim.

1402
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,917
We can't spare power
for the computer.

1403
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,991
We gotta do this blind?

1404
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,993
Without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1405
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,674
We've got to be able
to give these guys something.

1406
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,955
Without the power,
we can't give them a reading.

1407
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,871
I'm not talking about power,
I'm talking about reference.

1408
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,599
No, there's no references.
We have debris up there.

1409
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,952
Houston, what's the story
with this burn?

1410
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,838
We're trying to hash something out
down here, Aquarius.

1411
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,751
Stand by.

1412
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,868
Look, Houston. All we need to hold
attitude is one fixed point in space.

1413
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,033
- Is that not correct?
- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1414
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,118
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1415
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,954
If we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually,

1416
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,871
the co-ax cross hairs
right on its terminator,

1417
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,475
all I have to know is: How long
do we need to burn the engine?

1418
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,751
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1419
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,990
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down...

1420
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,548
on time without the computer?

1421
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,555
I guess that's the best we can do.

1422
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,551
We're out of time.

1423
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,477
In order to enter
the atmosphere safely,

1424
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,751
the crew must aim for a corridor
just two and a half degrees wide.

1425
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,116
If they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.

1426
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,031
If they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet...

1427
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,429
off the atmosphere like
a rock skipping off a pond.

1428
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,670
The reentry corridor is,
in fact, so narrow...

1429
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,751
that if this basketball
were the Earth...

1430
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,671
and this softball
were the moon,

1431
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,069
and the two were placed
14 feet apart,

1432
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:19,199
the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.

1433
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,555
Okay, people, on your toes.
We're doing this one blind.

1434
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,108
Gene, I want you to understand
we've never tried this before:

1435
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,954
Burn, cold soak, burn,
cold soak, burn, manual control.

1436
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,031
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1437
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,396
I just want you to know the engine's
never been tried like this.

1438
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,789
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1439
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,711
I know what you're trying to do.

1440
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,950
I guarantee you, I won't hold you
personally responsible.

1441
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,828
If it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.

1442
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,751
Okay.

1443
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,956
They're gonna burn the engines
and steer it manually,

1444
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,793
attempting to keep
the Earth in the window.

1445
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,277
Okay, this is gonna take
all three of us.

1446
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,590
Freddo...

1447
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,511
you handle the pitch.

1448
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,909
Put on the translation
controllers, all backwards.

1449
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,560
So if the Earth starts drifting down,

1450
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,388
you need to thrust aft,
not forward.

1451
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,357
I'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1452
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,193
We're going to burn at ten percent
thrust for 39 seconds.

1453
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,879
- Jack, you time us.
- Got it.

1454
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,117
Give us a count of
the last ten seconds up to 39.

1455
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,555
Let's not miss this.

1456
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,510
You up to this, Freddo?

1457
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,431
I'm with you.

1458
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,956
Standing by
for corridor control burn.

1459
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,679
Okay, Jim,
you can fire when ready.

1460
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,035
You are go
for the manual burn.

1461
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,595
Okay, X plus button
at ten seconds. Mark.

1462
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,274
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight,

1463
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,834
seven, six, five,

1464
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,070
- four, three,
- Ullage is go.

1465
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,118
Two, one, ignition!

1466
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,952
- She's burnin'!
- Oh, yeah.

1467
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,753
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1468
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:05,594
- Helium regulator on.
- R.C.S. Is go, 10% thrust.

1469
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,036
- Bring her around, Freddo.
- I'm tryin', but it's draggin'.

1470
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,958
- Ten seconds.
- Drop it down, Freddo.

1471
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,036
- We're driftin'!
- No, hold what you got.

1472
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,156
- I'll roll it. Back off.
- I can't get it stable.

1473
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,629
She's dancin' all over the place!

1474
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,035
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1475
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,435
She's driftin'.
I'm losin' attitude.

1476
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,040
Hold it right there.
That's it. No, Freddo, back!

1477
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,594
- Shit! I'm losin' it!
- Bring the Earth up.

1478
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,956
Forward, Fred.
Come on. Forward.

1479
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,600
Shit, I lost it!
Where is it? Where is it?

1480
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,511
7:00. Helium regulator's closed.

1481
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,830
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.

1482
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,592
- Okay, uh, okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1483
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,313
Little farther.
Ease your touch!

1484
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:48,434
Damn it! Damn it, that's mine.
That's me. Around.

1485
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,438
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it!

1486
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:54,392
- Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
...seven, eight, nine!

1487
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,074
Shutdown!

1488
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,797
Houston, we have shutdown.

1489
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,469
That's close enough, Jim. Good work.

1490
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,398
I knew it! I knew it!
How about that LEM, huh?

1491
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,755
How about it?

1492
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,434
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1493
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,917
Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.

1494
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,748
Well, let's hope we don't
have to do that again.

1495
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,710
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive 'til reentry.

1496
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,637
Well done.

1497
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:53,998
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me
about the power-up procedures.

1498
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,429
Here's the order
of what I want to do.

1499
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:01,036
I want to power up Guidance,
E.C.S., Communications,

1500
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:04,959
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1501
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,349
The thrusters are gonna
put you over budget on amps.

1502
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,672
They've been sitting at 200 below for
four days, John. They gotta be heated.

1503
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,716
Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes, something.

1504
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,593
Well, if the chutes
don't open, what's the point?

1505
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,638
You're telling me what you need.
I'm telling you what we have
to work with at this point.

1506
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,557
I'm not making this stuff up.

1507
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,750
They're going to need
all these systems, John.

1508
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,952
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1509
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,911
Okay, I'm gonna go back
and reorganize the sequencing again...

1510
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,036
and find more power.

1511
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,033
Let's start from scratch.
Clear the board.

1512
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,673
I don't know where the hell
we're gonna find it.

1513
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,197
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space,

1514
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,033
almost 24 days already,
than any other man,

1515
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,634
and I asked him recently
if he ever was scared.

1516
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,792
I've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...

1517
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:59,316
and was curious as to whether it
was going to light up again,

1518
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,511
but, uh, they seem to work out.

1519
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,711
Is there an instance
in an airplane emergency...

1520
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,637
when you can recall fear?

1521
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,958
Uh, well, I remember this one time,

1522
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,515
I'm in a Banshee at night in
combat conditions, so there's no
running lights on the carrier.

1523
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,956
It was the Shangri-la,
and we were in the Sea of Japan.

1524
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,788
My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...

1525
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,115
because somebody in Japan
was actually using the same frequency,

1526
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,397
and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.

1527
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:33,912
I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so I flip on my map light.

1528
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,709
Then, suddenly, zap, everything
shorts out right there in my cockpit.

1529
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,389
All my instruments are gone.
My lights are gone and I can't
even tell what my altitude is.

1530
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:46,468
I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm
thinking about ditching into the ocean.

1531
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,876
I look down there
and then, in the darkness,

1532
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,912
there's this, uh,
there's this green trail.

1533
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,431
It's like a long carpet that's just laid
out right beneath me. It was the algae.

1534
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,351
It was that phosphorescent stuff...

1535
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,715
that gets churned up
in the wake of a big ship.

1536
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,758
It was, it was, it was
just leading me home.

1537
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,677
If my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out,

1538
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,951
there's no way I'd have ever
been able to see that.

1539
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,429
So, uh, you, uh,
you never know...

1540
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,109
what, what events are going
to transpire to get you home.

1541
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:24,719
Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,
no stranger to emergencies.

1542
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,950
- How's it going, Fred?
- I'm okay.

1543
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,715
What the hell was that?

1544
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,593
Let's hope it was
just the burst disk.

1545
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:48,719
- Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
- We confirm that.

1546
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,753
Houston, is that going to
affect our, uh, entry angle at all?

1547
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,957
Uh, negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1548
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,554
Houston, uh...

1549
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:01,871
we, we sure could use...

1550
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,115
the reentry procedure up here.

1551
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,236
When can we expect that?

1552
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,994
Uh, that's coming
real soon, Aquarius.

1553
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,640
Uh, Houston, we, we...

1554
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:16,712
We just can't throw this
together at the last minute.

1555
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,320
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1556
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,995
You're gonna get the procedure
up to us, whatever it is,

1557
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:27,511
and we're gonna go over it
step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1558
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,990
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1559
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,719
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1560
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,149
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It's Deke.

1561
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,390
They don't know how to do it.

1562
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:43,952
- Maybe Jack's right.
- Hello there, Deke. What's the story?

1563
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,956
We're gonna get that
power-up procedure to you.

1564
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,917
We're gonna get it
as soon as we possibly can.

1565
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,078
Ken Mattingly's
in the simulator right now.

1566
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,395
Ken's working on it?

1567
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,678
Look...

1568
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,591
I know this sequence works, John.

1569
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,399
The sequence looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1570
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,755
- By how much?
- Three or four amps.

1571
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,910
Goddamn it, John!
Is it three or four?

1572
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,757
- Four.
- Four!

1573
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,389
Four more amps.

1574
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,559
We know they have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1575
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,795
Yeah.

1576
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,793
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1577
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,196
- It's backup for the LEM power supply.
- I'm listening.

1578
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,396
So... reverse it.

1579
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,630
Reverse the flow and see if
we can draw these four amps...

1580
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,551
from the LEM batteries
before we cut it lose.

1581
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,713
- Why can't we do that?
- We don't have a procedure for that?

1582
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,791
You're gonna lose a lot
in the transfer, Ken.

1583
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,628
Yeah, yeah, but all we're
talking about here is four amps.

1584
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,672
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1585
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,036
- Gene, they're already...
- I don't want the whole bible,
just a couple of chapters.

1586
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,270
- We've got to get something
up to these guys.
- They're working on it.

1587
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,669
- I'll call the simulator
and get an estimate.
- Goddamn it!

1588
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,788
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures... now!

1589
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,596
I.M.U. Is up.

1590
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,639
- How am I reading?
- Fine, so far.

1591
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:26,029
- Say again.
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1592
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,197
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1593
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,678
Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.

1594
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,188
Here we go.

1595
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,196
C.M.C. Attitude I.M.U.

1596
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:44,073
C.M.C. Source.

1597
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:48,318
C.M.C. Mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1598
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,354
Ken?

1599
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:00,437
- Go ahead.
- Is your computer on now?

1600
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:04,672
Up and running.
How do we look?

1601
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,316
John?

1602
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,636
I think we got it, buddy.

1603
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,915
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1604
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,359
Yeah.

1605
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,311
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- I was getting a little blurry there.

1606
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,515
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1607
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,596
It's good to see you, Ken.

1608
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,676
This is the sequence.

1609
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:44,075
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1610
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,713
Aquarius, Houston.
Do you read?

1611
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:52,719
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1612
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,513
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1613
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:00,276
Uh, that's a negative, Jim.
I don't have the measles.

1614
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,999
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1615
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:09,350
Uh, yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1616
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,233
- Put those on the table.
- Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1617
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,475
I think it would
really help if you could...

1618
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,957
just distract her when
the heavy predictions come in.

1619
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,673
- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1620
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,597
Blanch.

1621
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:27,030
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch the television with you.

1622
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,270
This is Neil Armstrong,
and this is Buzz Aldrin.

1623
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,713
Nice to meet you.

1624
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:35,828
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program too?

1625
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,913
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1626
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:44,636
Uh, stand by, Ken.

1627
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:49,271
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1628
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,796
I guess I was a little
more tired than I thought.

1629
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,034
Uh, don't worry, Jack.
I'll talk you through it.

1630
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,472
Okay, find the main
bus breakers on panel 11.

1631
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,751
Yeah, main bus breakers.

1632
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,831
- Got it.
- Close main bus B.

1633
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:22,199
Ken, there's an awful lot
of condensation on these panels.

1634
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,595
What's the word on these
things shorting out?

1635
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:32,271
Uh, we'll just take that
one at a time, Jack.

1636
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,869
It's like tryin' to drive
a toaster through a car wash.

1637
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,074
Main bus B is closed.

1638
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,833
Okay, Thirteen, we're coming up
on entry interface.

1639
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:53,509
Flight, we're still shallowing up
a bit in the reentry corridor.

1640
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,630
It's almost like
they're underweight.

1641
01:48:55,720 --> 01:49:00,555
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1642
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,034
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1643
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,951
Uh, one more thing, Jim.

1644
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,395
While Jack's working on the power-up,
we'd like you and Freddo...

1645
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:10,040
to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.

1646
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,957
Uh, say again, Houston.
Ballast?

1647
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:15,157
Um, that's affirm.
We got to get the weight right.

1648
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,789
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1649
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,717
Right, Houston.

1650
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,830
- Now, Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1651
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:25,878
Okay, now, uh, panel five.

1652
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:30,670
Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.

1653
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,109
Main B closed.

1654
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,668
Master alarm off.

1655
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,673
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.

1656
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,228
B-MAG number two,
power to warm-up done.

1657
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,198
Sequential logic one and two on.

1658
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:47,800
Sequential logic... two on.

1659
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,150
C.M.R.C.S. Pressure on.

1660
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,037
C.M.R.C.S. Pressurization.

1661
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,398
As her husband prepares to jettison
his lunar module lifeboat,

1662
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,193
Marilyn Lovell waits with her
children, her neighbors...

1663
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:03,796
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1664
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,440
Only the Lovell's eldest son,
Jay, is absent...

1665
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,351
as he holds vigil
with his classmates...

1666
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,910
at the St. Johns Military Academy
in Wisconsin.

1667
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:15,111
ABC News science editor
Jules Bergman.

1668
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:18,232
With a crippled command module, and
surviving by using the LEM's systems,

1669
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,151
there can be no easy maneuver.

1670
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:23,277
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things
and working longer...

1671
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,197
than it was ever intended to.

1672
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,595
It's a race against time
until splashdown.

1673
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,870
Okay, Jack, we're ready to see
if the computer will accept...

1674
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,159
- uplink of the reentry data now.
- Okay, the I.M.U. Is up.

1675
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:39,318
- We got our eight-balls back.
- Copy that.

1676
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,670
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1677
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,151
That's affirm.
Go ahead and try it.

1678
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,156
Come on.

1679
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,351
Uplink completed.

1680
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,556
- Yeah. That's more like it.
- We're back in business.

1681
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,999
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1682
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,036
Look at your amps. How we doin'?

1683
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,911
We got her back up, Ken.

1684
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,116
Boy, I wish
you were here to see it.

1685
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,510
I'll bet you do.

1686
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,910
Way to go, Jack.

1687
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,516
- Flight, this is RETRO.
- Go, RETRO.

1688
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,949
Flight, we are looking
at a typhoon warning...

1689
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,112
- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
- Say again, RETRO.

1690
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:46,948
We are looking at a typhoon warning
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1691
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,594
This is just a warning.
It could miss them.

1692
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,114
Only if their luck changes.

1693
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,630
Jim, we're ready
for S.M. Jettison!

1694
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:58,070
All right, Jack, on three!

1695
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:01,232
One... two...

1696
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,272
- upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1697
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,316
Reverse thrust!

1698
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,396
We have service module jettison.

1699
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,273
Okay, Houston,
service module is free.

1700
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:13,356
We're gonna take a look
at what we have here.

1701
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:15,356
Copy that.

1702
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,190
There it is. I see it!

1703
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,993
Oh.

1704
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:27,516
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1705
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,195
One whole side
of the spacecraft is missing.

1706
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:35,034
Right by the high gain antennae
a whole panel is blown out,

1707
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:39,033
right up, right up
to our heat shield.

1708
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,588
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

1709
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,353
It looked like it got
the engine bell too. Can you see that?

1710
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:50,840
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1711
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,312
The heat shield.

1712
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,960
The heat will build up to as much
as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1713
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,190
On a lunar reentry flight,
the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.

1714
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,918
So, uh, Blanch?

1715
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:08,794
Blanch? Did Jim make
Eagle Scout or not?

1716
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,836
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1717
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:13,070
If the heat shield
is even slightly cracked,

1718
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,634
the extreme cold
could have split it wide open.

1719
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:18,831
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...

1720
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:21,553
have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all,

1721
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,275
causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour,

1722
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,669
but at a suicidal 300.

1723
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,591
Perhaps never in human history...

1724
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,717
has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.

1725
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,797
In New York City, thousands
of people have gathered...

1726
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,559
to watch updates of the mission
in Times Square.

1727
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:41,234
Many countries offered help,
and the State Department said...

1728
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,470
it would ask for it
if it were needed.

1729
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,432
The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the American people...

1730
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,750
to pray tonight
for the astronauts.

1731
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,991
In Rome, Pope Paul
led 50,000 people...

1732
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,719
in prayers for the safe
return of the astronauts.

1733
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,075
In Jerusalem,
prayers at the Wailing Wall.

1734
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,877
Uh, it's about time to bail
out of this ship, Freddo.

1735
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,477
Freddo?

1736
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,716
You okay?

1737
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,917
I'm, uh... I'm freezing.

1738
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,479
Can you hold out
just a little longer?

1739
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,637
- Long as I have to.
- Aw, come on.

1740
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:29,474
It won't be long.
Just a little while longer, Freddo.

1741
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:36,116
Just a little while longer. We're gonna
hit that water in the South Pacific.

1742
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,476
Open up that hatch.

1743
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,832
- It's 80 degrees out there.
- Eighty degrees.

1744
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:49,438
- You are a mess.
- Y-Yeah.

1745
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,830
Odyssey, Houston.
Uh, how we doin', guys?

1746
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:55,115
We're closing in
on lunar module jettison.

1747
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,116
As you know,
that is time critical.

1748
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,873
We should be making our move
into the command module.

1749
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,791
Let's get that hatch
buttoned up,

1750
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,395
and, when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.

1751
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,833
Roger that.

1752
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:10,993
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1753
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,599
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1754
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,029
Is everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1755
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,631
Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, 13, Houston.
Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.

1756
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:56,750
Stand by.

1757
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,479
Have you got everybody
in the Odyssey?

1758
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,671
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those
pyro batteries one more time here.

1759
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,228
Okay, the pyro batts look good.

1760
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,352
I don't think we're gonna
have to tie the other batteries.

1761
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,515
Sorry, Jack,
this is an old habit.

1762
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:25,672
I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1763
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:34,358
Okay, Odyssey, I want to double check
some reentry procedures...

1764
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:38,837
right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1765
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:41,036
What is that?

1766
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,310
Oh, I was getting
a little punchy,

1767
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:46,995
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1768
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,150
That's good thinking.

1769
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,431
Stand by, Houston.

1770
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,593
We have lunar module jettison.

1771
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,993
She sure was a good ship.

1772
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:13,233
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

1773
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:22,435
Mary?

1774
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,876
It's almost time, honey.

1775
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,756
Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.

1776
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,272
Let me put it this way.

1777
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,595
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1778
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,671
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1779
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,591
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1780
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:00,797
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1781
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,836
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1782
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,111
Yeah, okay, but now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

1783
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,191
Well, blackout lasts
for three minutes.

1784
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:12,751
If they're not back
in four, we'll know.

1785
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:17,112
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

1786
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,668
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1787
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:22,752
Okay, Ken,
we are aligned for reentry.

1788
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,149
Jim, we're going to need
that computer reentry program.

1789
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:29,631
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay. Batt A looks good.

1790
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,711
Reentry interface in one minute...

1791
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,793
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
- And 30 seconds.

1792
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,075
Batt C...

1793
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:41,436
shit, no volts, only two amps.

1794
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,988
It may die before
the main chutes open.

1795
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,072
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1796
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:50,550
Flight, they're still shallowing a bit
up there. Do you want to tell 'em?

1797
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:54,269
- Is there anything we can do about it?
- Not now, Flight.

1798
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,635
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
- Copy that.

1799
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:59,029
RETRO says the typhoon is still
a presence in the splashdown area?

1800
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:03,159
- Yeah.
- We got the parachute situation,

1801
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,475
the heat shield, the angle
of trajectory and the typhoon.

1802
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,710
There's so many variables,
I'm a little at a loss...

1803
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,313
I know what the problems are.

1804
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,675
This could be the worst disaster
NASA's ever experienced.

1805
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,073
With all due respect, sir, I believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

1806
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,799
Okay.

1807
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:32,433
Expect entry interface
in 45 seconds.

1808
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,636
And on my mark, your velocity...

1809
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:39,231
will be 35,245 feet per second.

1810
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:42,630
Mark 35 seconds
to entry interface.

1811
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,674
Gentlemen...

1812
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,354
it's been a privilege
flying with you.

1813
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,353
Flight, we have loss
of radio contact.

1814
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:34,674
Roger that.

1815
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:37,194
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

1816
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,515
It all depends
on the heat shield.

1817
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,274
Back to the Iwo Jima
and our live cameras there.

1818
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,438
The Navy recovery and rescue
helicopters already airborne,

1819
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,954
circling, waiting
for first radar contact.

1820
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,912
Coming up now on three minutes
until time of drogue deployment.

1821
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,831
Bill, what time you got?

1822
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:31,629
Standing by for any reports
of acquisition.

1823
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,834
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1824
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,591
No reentering ship
has ever taken longer...

1825
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:49,229
than three minutes
to emerge from blackout.

1826
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,078
This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?

1827
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:55,908
Will the command module survive
the intense heat of reentry?

1828
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,793
If it doesn't,
there'll only be silence.

1829
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,150
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Oops, sorry, sweetie.

1830
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,156
It's okay.

1831
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,354
Okay, Flight,
that's three minutes.

1832
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:24,710
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1833
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:29,032
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1834
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:30,991
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read?

1835
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,878
Expected time of reacquisition,

1836
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,753
the time when the astronauts were
expected to come out of blackout,

1837
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,237
has come and gone.

1838
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:44,756
About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.

1839
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:48,230
We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield,

1840
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:50,555
which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago,

1841
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:53,200
has withstood
the inferno of reentry.

1842
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,870
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1843
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,748
Odyssey, Houston.
Do you read?

1844
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,634
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1845
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:12,474
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1846
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,916
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1847
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,473
That's four minutes.
Standing by.

1848
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:52,113
Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?

1849
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:02,314
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

1850
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:05,591
It's good to see you again.

1851
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,393
Odyssey, Houston.
Welcome home.

1852
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,635
We're glad to see you.

1853
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:34,513
- Good job, Ken. Good job.
- Thank you.

1854
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,471
They made it. They made it.

1855
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:33,759
- Yeah!
- Lunney.

1856
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,594
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1857
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:05,274
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1858
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:08,397
Good job.

1859
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,313
Our mission was called
a successful failure,

1860
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:01,909
in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.

1861
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,231
In the following months,
it was determined...

1862
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:08,118
that a damaged coil built
inside the oxygen tank...

1863
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:12,591
sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.

1864
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,989
It was a minor defect
that occurred two years...

1865
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:18,038
before I was named
the flight's commander.

1866
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:21,556
Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on Apollo 18,

1867
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:23,790
but his mission was canceled
because of budget cuts.

1868
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,757
He never flew in space again.

1869
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,912
Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the astronaut corps...

1870
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,958
and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.

1871
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:35,794
But he died of cancer before
he was able to take office.

1872
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,913
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

1873
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:43,635
and flew the space shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.

1874
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:48,913
Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.

1875
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,753
And many other members of Mission
Control have gone on to other things,

1876
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,711
but some are still there.

1877
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:56,394
And as for me...

1878
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:01,195
the seven extraordinary days
of Apollo 13 were my last in space.

1879
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:05,677
I watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely,

1880
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:10,191
all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.

1881
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:13,352
I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon,

1882
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:16,710
remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage,

1883
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:21,993
thinking of the thousands of people who
worked to bring the three of us home.

1884
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:25,032
I look up at the moon
and wonder...

1885
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,594
when will we be going back...

1886
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:31,110
and who will that be?
