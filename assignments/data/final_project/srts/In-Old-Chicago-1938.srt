1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,498
Isn't it time to stop this travelin',
for it dark and the child shiverin'?

3
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,438
We will not. And us not two hours,
or maybe three, from Chicago itself?

4
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,169
"Ha, ha," says I.

5
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,304
Get along with ya, ya lazy devils.
I'll be layin' me whip on your backs.

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,507
Chicago will not be movin'...

7
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,108
and us living there for the rest
of our days, God willin'.

8
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,915
I'll not be held back
by your tongue.

9
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,582
A fine city waiting there
just over the rim of the land.

10
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,024
"I'll rest there tonight,"
I said to myself.

11
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,428
And so I will.
'Tis a mighty city will be built here.

12
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,491
The hub. Yes, the hub
of the country...

13
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,332
fillin' all
this prairie land...

14
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,032
and you boys
living to see it.

15
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,167
<i>Huh, indeed.</i>

16
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,678
Come on.
Get along with ya.

17
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,077
Look, Pa.
It's a train.

18
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,483
Come on, Pa.
Let's race her.

19
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,850
By the twinklin' stars
of heaven, I will.

20
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,193
- Come on, boys.
- You'll do no such.

21
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,462
Go on, Pa!
You can lick it!

22
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,567
We're licking it!
We're licking it!

23
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:18,563
Whoa! Whoa there!

24
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,896
Hold on, boys!
Whoa, boy. Whoa there.

25
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,959
Whoa!

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,631
Whoa, boy.

27
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,268
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,178
- Pat. Pat!
- Pa.

29
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:55,797
Pat. Jack,
fix the water, quick.

30
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,873
Dion, my petticoat,
tear it.

31
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,973
- Ma.
- Shh!

32
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:19,855
Dion, take off your coat
and put it under his head.

33
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,057
- Is he hurt bad?
- How should I be knowin'?

34
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,694
Pour a little water over his head.

35
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,365
That's enough.
Dion, get the whiskey.

36
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,740
Never mind me.
Are the rest unharmed?

37
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:43,009
- Not a scratch.
- Heaven be praised for that.

38
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,074
'Twas me own fault
and no other.

39
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,727
Ain't it the devil's
own doin', though...

40
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,258
to be draggin' me down and then
bumping the life out of me?

41
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,500
Just when the smell
of Chicago's in me nose.

42
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,766
<i>Jack.</i>

43
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,902
<i>Dion.</i>

44
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,176
<i>Bob.</i>

45
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,583
Come closer here,
the three of ya...

46
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,350
and mind what
I have to say.

47
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,451
'Tis a grand new place,
this Chicago.

48
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:33,261
And them that grow with it
will be rich and strong...

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,894
like I was always
minded to be.

50
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,065
'Tis a boom,
and you'll boom with it.

51
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,973
Someday you'll be
fine, big men...

52
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,204
a credit to me name...

53
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,612
and everybody speakin'
with respect of the O'Learys...

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,448
and how they grew up with the city
and put their mark on it.

55
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,579
You're wastin' yourself, Patrick.
You with your fine talk.

56
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,386
It's me last breath I'm usin',
and I'll have me say.

57
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,259
- Help me put him in the wagon. We've got to find a doctor.
- No.

58
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,298
No, it's no use.

59
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,800
Just bury me here...

60
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,828
and let Chicago
come to me...

61
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,397
that couldn't come to it.

62
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,407
Molly...

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,643
<i>Patrick.</i>

64
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,015
- Patrick.
- Ma!

65
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,962
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
help my Pat rest in peace...

66
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,467
him that was so restless on Earth,
for he was a good man...

67
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,833
for all his fine
ambitions.

68
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,395
And if there ever was to be food
to be got or shelter...

69
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,840
or you wanted someone to laugh with
or have a bit of a good time...

70
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,743
you didn't have to look
any further than Patrick O'Leary.

71
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,384
But I need not
be tellin' you all this...

72
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,546
who know it better
than I do.

73
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,651
Amen.

74
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,392
Get the horses ready,
boys.

75
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,338
Good-bye, Pat.

76
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,280
Someday, I'll be
sendin' the priest...

77
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,647
to speak
the proper words.

78
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,942
Ma, I'll
take care of ya.

79
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:06,178
I'll do what he said.
You know, about Chicago and...

80
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,653
Sure, Ma, we'll
take care of ya.

81
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,589
I'm gonna make a lot of money
and get ya things and...

82
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,456
Hush it,
the both of you.

83
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,860
Get in the wagon.

84
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,147
Giddap.

85
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,682
Ho!

86
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,693
Ma, we've gotta find
someplace to stay.

87
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,534
- We can't keep on living in a wagon.
- Time enough for that.

88
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,972
- It's a job I'm looking for first.
- Look!

89
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,533
<i>There's a theater.</i>

90
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,636
Maybe I could get
to be an actor.

91
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,045
You an actor, and your father
not cold in his grave.

92
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,881
- But we've gotta do something.
- It's school you'll be going to, the three of ya.

93
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,513
School, at my age.

94
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,682
<i>Whoa.</i>

95
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,623
Look. Right under
my very eyes.

96
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,896
Wait here.

97
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,907
I won't be a minute away.

98
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,476
And keep your eyes
off this picture...

99
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,881
<i>- and her in tights or worse.
- All right, Ma.</i>

100
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,054
Gee! Look at them horses.

101
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,647
<i>Ain't they beauts?</i>

102
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,406
- Look. They're stuck.
- Yeah, in the mud.

103
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,777
Young man.
I mean you.

104
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,286
Could I bother you to assist
us ladies to the sidewalk?

105
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,948
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I got on
my new store-bought pants.

106
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,222
Whoa, boy! Whoa, whoa!

107
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:09,859
Ladies, if me and my brother here can
make a saddle, maybe we could get you out.

108
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,768
- Saddle?
- Yes'm, like this.

109
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,634
All you gotta do
is hold on.

110
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,805
Why, that's marvelous.
Ada, you try it.

111
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,338
That's gonna be grand.
Now mind your dress.

112
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,838
<i>Dion.! Jack.!</i>

113
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,809
- Up to The Hub.
- We just slipped.

114
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,438
<i>You little brats!</i>

115
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,608
- I'll... I'll...
- And who will you be hittin'?

116
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,812
- Look at me!
- A bit of mud, and it behind.

117
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,754
A pair of tender hands and plenty of soap,
it'll be as good as new.

118
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,520
You don't know what
you're talking about!

119
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,585
There's not a washerwoman
in this town that could save this dress.

120
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,496
Is that so now? And what
would you say if I told you...

121
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,433
that I could do it myself,
if it was worth me time?

122
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,960
All right. You're so smart.
You save this dress, and I'll give you...

123
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,703
I'll be namin' the price, and you
providin' the soap and the tub.

124
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,845
<i>Hey, Ma.! Ma, I'm back.!</i>

125
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,976
I got three from Gil Warren
and two from Mrs. Palmer.

126
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,078
- She says a pair of her whatchamacallems are missing.
- Oh, she did?

127
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,853
You can tell the fine lady she'll get 'em
back when she pays for the soap she owes.

128
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,019
<i>- Yes'm.
- And put up the horse.</i>

129
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,223
Give her some oats. And be sure
the barn door's fastened.

130
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,233
And then get your hands and face
washed before it's supper.

131
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,825
Yes'm.

132
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,572
Gretchen.

133
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,573
<i>Ja?</i>

134
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,117
- Look out!
- The milk!

135
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,086
- It's gone!
- Oh, it's all right.

136
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,282
No use crying over it now.
It's spilt.

137
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,848
She might've kicked you.

138
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,192
I told you never to milk her without
putting that bar between her legs.

139
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,528
That's what it's for.
Daisy, you hussy!

140
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Mrs. O'Leary!
What will she say?

141
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,066
<i>- Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it with Ma.
- Ja?</i>

142
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,372
<i>Ja.</i>

143
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,615
Aw, gee.

144
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,719
<i>Ja. Gut.</i>

145
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:28,310
<i>- Thank you, Daisy.
- Ma.! Ma.!</i>

146
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:32,846
- Out here, Jack.
- I thought you were coming down to court to hear me.

147
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,884
With all Chicago waitin' to be washed?
Get along with ya.

148
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,818
- Where'd I get the time?
- I sure made 'em sit up and take notice.

149
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:41,720
- Did you now?
- I told 'em just what I thought about 'em.

150
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,224
"My client is right,"
I said, " and you know it.

151
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,921
But what do you care about people,
as long as you can fill your pockets?"

152
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:51,329
No wonder they say this is the worst city,
with politicians like Gil Warren running things.

153
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,767
- And how did the fine gentleman like that?
- Oh, he was sweatin' plenty.

154
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:58,237
- " Sure," I said. " What do you care about Chicago being bad...
- Take the handle.

155
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:01,504
"as long as business is good and you've
got all the beef and pork in the world?

156
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:04,568
"But I'll tell you this. It takes more than
those things to make this a great city.

157
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:07,114
"It takes people with
some sense of decency...

158
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,946
to make this not only the biggest city
in the world, but the best. "

159
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:12,418
It's a fine silver
tongue you ha'...

160
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:15,081
and your father would be
that proud of you.

161
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:18,524
And I told him...

162
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:21,255
<i>Here you are!</i>

163
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,128
Well, good-bye, boys.
Don't let 'em keep you too long.

164
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,932
If you see my old lady, tell her I'm sitting
up with a friend that was took sick.

165
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:31,905
Have a cigar, Jim. Thanks for the ride.
I'll do the same for you.

166
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,442
Thanks, lad. Anytime you're
coming our way, let us know.

167
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,603
- We'll be glad to have you with us.
- I'll remember that.

168
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,375
Watch the mud on your shoes,
Pickle. You know Ma.

169
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:43,441
Hey, Ma! It's me!

170
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,255
- Hello, Ma!
- Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary.

171
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,314
- Hi, Jack.
- Hello, Pickle.

172
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:53,452
- Sorry you lost your case, Jack.
- Lost?

173
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:57,430
Sure. I, uh... I forgot to tell you.
The judge dismissed it.

174
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,127
Heaven help me. And all the time
I thought he'd won it.

175
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:03,262
Don't worry. Warren won't
hold it against you, as long as you lost.

176
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,171
I heard about it. A fella said Jack
had the courtroom hypnotized.

177
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,266
Yeah, everybody
but the judge.

178
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:12,245
Had him too, only Gil Warren
put him on the bench.

179
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:14,407
Keep your hand
away from that.

180
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,951
But, Ma, it's just
the right size.

181
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,785
- Ma, for the last time, will you quit this laundry business?
- Why should I be quittin'?

182
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,916
'Cause I don't want my best girl
bending over a washtub all her life.

183
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,018
- Go along with you now.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

184
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:31,691
I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch,
set you up like the finest hussy in town.

185
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:34,930
Huh? Look. Look, Ma.

186
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,369
- Where did you get that money?
- A fellow paid me.

187
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:40,499
You're lyin'. You've been gambling
at that racetrack again.

188
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:42,805
There wasn't
any gambling to it, Ma.

189
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,176
There are only eight horses in the race...
mine and seven others.

190
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,977
- All we had to do was shoot the other seven.
- Hmph!

191
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,383
Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma.
How about it, hmm?

192
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:54,854
- I'll not be livin' on money that isn't honestly got.
- Give us a kiss then, huh?

193
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:59,724
- Now, Dion, get along with ya. I've got my work. Dion!
- Aw, come on.

194
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:02,223
Won't wash out.

195
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:08,162
Look at it.
I told that Gil Warren...

196
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,069
I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths
they'd been drawing pictures on.

197
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,006
- Send it back.
- Wait a minute. This looks like a map.

198
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,170
Maybe Warren's gonna hunt
for a buried treasure.

199
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,078
Hunt for it? He's already found it
in the city treasury.

200
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,309
Something about
Randolph Street...

201
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,409
<i>and... and Madison.</i>

202
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,478
This looks like the tracks
for the horse car line.

203
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,649
I know what it is.

204
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:32,716
This means they're gonna run
the car line along Randolph Street.

205
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,661
You're crazy. They've already surveyed
Madison for the tracks.

206
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,666
Sure, they have. That's exactly what makes
me think they're gonna run along Randolph.

207
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,998
- By golly, maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right!

208
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,437
That's the way they cheat the people...
get them to invest on Madison Street...

209
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,203
and then switch the line
by their own property.

210
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:52,007
- What an idea.
- You're right. This information is worth a fortune.

211
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,878
- Ha! Listen to him.
- And I'm gonna get part of it.

212
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,111
You with your fine talk
and your grand plans...

213
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,449
not a penny ever honestly
earned to your name.

214
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,115
Maybe so. But if I had
this corner here...

215
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,023
where all the traffic meets,
I'd put up the biggest saloon in town.

216
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:09,189
- Saloon?
- And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary.

217
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,232
I wouldn't be stepping
my foot inside.

218
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,735
Then I guess we'll have to keep on
rushing the growler for you.

219
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,930
Oh, but look.

220
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:19,701
There's a name already scribbled
in right on my corner.

221
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:24,234
B- F-A-W-C-E-double "T."

222
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,212
- B. Fawcett.
- Ever heard of him?

223
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:28,806
No. It's a new one on me.

224
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:36,949
- Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind?
- I've gotta have this name.

225
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,392
We'll go down to Gil Warren's and see what
we can find out about this Fawcett fellow.

226
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:44,159
- You've ruined it!
- There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary.

227
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,325
The scamp.

228
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,745
Hello, Rondo.

229
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:03,181
- Where's Mr. Warren?
- The other end of the bar.

230
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:14,454
<i>- Hello, Mr. Warren.
- Oh, hello, son.</i>

231
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,259
- Howdy, Mr. Warren.
- What can I do for you?

232
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,960
- I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
- Sure. Go ahead.

233
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,765
<i>It's kind of private, and I thought that, uh...</i>

234
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:25,533
<i>Not now. Not now. Little later, perhaps.</i>

235
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:28,337
Stick around.
Glad to have seen you.

236
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,845
<i>Whew!</i>

237
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:42,872
- What a woman.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

238
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,581
- Is she new?
- Yeah, she's new, new as far as Chicago's concerned.

239
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:51,057
She was the biggest hit Niblo's Garden
in New York ever had.

240
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,186
A sensation.
And I'm paying her a bigger price...

241
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:57,197
than any entertainer
in this town ever got.

242
00:20:57,265 --> 00:21:00,530
- That's Belle Fawcett.
- Oh, Belle Fawcett.

243
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:02,695
B. Fawcett?

244
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:24,813
Ladies and gentlemen,
as an added treat tonight...

245
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,514
the proceeds to go
to the widow and orphans...

246
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:30,183
or our late bartender,
Aloysius O'Malley...

247
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:32,852
who was shot in front
of this very door...

248
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:36,488
<i>my little girls are going to give a special
performance of our famous classic...</i>

249
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,498
<i>Living Statues...</i>

250
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,366
an artistic divertissement straight
from New York and Paris, France.

251
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,408
And remember, gentlemen...

252
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:51,536
it's all for sweet charity,
and no tights.

253
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,744
What am I bid?

254
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:01,414
<i>- One dollar.
- One dollar? Do I hear two?</i>

255
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:04,424
- Four dollars.
- Four, the gentleman says.

256
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:07,928
<i>- Who'll make it five?
- I'll pay five.</i>

257
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:10,692
<i>Five. Now we're getting somewhere.
Who'll make it six?</i>

258
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,733
Speak right up, handsome.
What is it? Six?

259
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:16,669
I'll pay $100 to charity
if Belle Fawcett plays Venus.

260
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,575
We have a comedian
in the house.

261
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:27,343
- Go ahead. Take his offer.
- Sold to handsome for $100.

262
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,883
<i>Come on. Let's see the color
of your money.</i>

263
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:34,320
Fifty, 70, 90, 100.

264
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:41,018
Whiskey!

265
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,531
Right through that door. I'll be
with you in a moment. Thank you.

266
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:58,104
Hey, what's this? Wait a minute!

267
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,897
Yes, Miss Fawcett.
Your carriage is here.

268
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,905
Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him
for lunch tomorrow at the Palmer House?

269
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:27,441
- Yes, Miss Fawcett.
- Thank you.

270
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,948
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

271
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,575
<i>- Oh!
- Get in.!</i>

272
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:39,279
Let me go!

273
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,845
- Shut up!
- I won't! Let me out of here!

274
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:44,255
- Shut up.
- Let me out of here, or I'll jump!

275
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,316
Go ahead. Jump.

276
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:49,659
Oh, it's you.
Driver! Driver!

277
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:52,859
- No use yelling at him. I fixed him.
- Oh, you're crazy!

278
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:56,199
Maybe. But I was sane
enough until tonight.

279
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,002
Then I heard you sing,
and something happened to me.

280
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:04,670
Something swept over me I've never
felt before or ever expect to feel again.

281
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:11,213
- What are you talking about?
- I'm in love with you, Belle.

282
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:15,188
- Get out, or I'll call the police!
- They can't stop me from loving you.

283
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:18,521
Maybe not, but they can sure
cool you off, brother.

284
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:22,029
I know it sounds crazy...
and I apologize... but it's true.

285
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,690
Right now, my heart's pounding so.

286
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,496
- Listen to it. Ow!
- Oh, you fool.

287
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm trembling all over.

288
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:33,403
And I wanna be calm and cool
so I can make you understand.

289
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:37,240
Say, are you
on the level?

290
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:40,304
Absolutely.

291
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,350
- But I don't even know who you are.
- Does that matter?

292
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,353
It does to me.
And I'll tell you another thing.

293
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,415
- I didn't like that cheap trick you pulled on me.
- I had to talk to you alone.

294
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,586
What gave you the idea you could
make love to me like this?

295
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:59,759
Just give me a chance.
I'll tell you the whole story.

296
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:03,736
All right. You can stop here
and buy me a drink.

297
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:06,239
No, not here.
It's too crowded.

298
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,400
Since you've
taken me by storm...

299
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:13,038
the least you might do is to take me
to your place so we can really talk.

300
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,574
Very well, but your story
had better be good.

301
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:23,188
All right, George. You can drive
to Miss Fawcett's home.

302
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,054
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

303
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,392
- So this is where you live?
- Yes.

304
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,460
<i>Way up there
on the second floor.</i>

305
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:38,801
I think I can make it.

306
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:41,501
Back to The Hub quick!

307
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:51,014
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

308
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:57,157
Whew! What a woman.

309
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:08,469
<i>- Let's tell Ma.
- Ja. You want to?</i>

310
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,527
Do you reckon
she suspects?

311
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,664
<i>I was never that surprised
in all me life.</i>

312
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,006
All this hand-holdin' and goo-goo eyein'
and sighin' and gigglin'.

313
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,137
I'm all wore out tryin'
to look the other way.

314
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,182
- Aw, Ma.
- Now, I suppose you'll be tellin' me...

315
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,241
you want
to get married.

316
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:27,719
- Why, sure.
- You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had.

317
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,780
Well, if it's love
you're after...

318
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,950
I guess a few shirts and tablecloths
can't stand in the way...

319
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,756
but I won't have you sittin' around
and waitin' and not eatin'.

320
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:38,629
You'll be gettin' married right away
and I want no back talk about it.

321
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,964
Now, give me that pail.

322
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,838
And I'd be ashamed,
with a fine spring moon outside...

323
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:48,398
and you in a barn puttin' ideas
in the head of a temperamental cow.

324
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:01,721
- So, you're in love at last.
- Sure, Mike... with you.

325
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:06,385
And are you now? And I suppose it's
for me that you're slickin' your hair...

326
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:09,867
anticipatin' yourself in front of a mirror
until it's half wore out.

327
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,161
Well, you want me
to look nice, don't you?

328
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:15,262
And I suppose you'll be holdin'
her hands, maybe stealin' a kiss...

329
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:18,467
and her tellin' ya how grand ya are
and callin' ya pretty names.

330
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,909
Here, let Ma do it. And you believin' her.

331
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:25,005
That shirt! I thought so. Take it off.

332
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,642
Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut.
Look. "D.V.S."... Who's that?

333
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,278
His name is Swift and he sells pigs.
Now take it off.

334
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:32,948
- It needs to go back in the morning.
- Oh, come on, Ma!

335
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,991
Take it off.
Take it off.

336
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:40,122
Oh! Who's the best darn washer woman
in the whole bloomin' city of Chicago?

337
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:47,629
Ma! Say, Ma!
I won my first case!

338
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,731
- I knew you would!
- Congratulations.

339
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:53,038
The jury wasn't out
more than 15 minutes...

340
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,738
and the judge said it was the finest
speech he's heard all session.

341
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:59,840
So did the lawyer from
the other side. And... yippee!

342
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,351
Congratulations. I always
knew you had it in your tongue.

343
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,410
<i>A fellow from the Tribune
said he's gonna write it up.</i>

344
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:06,513
- You're gonna get your name in the paper?
- Yes!

345
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,581
- How much did you get?
- Huh?

346
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,924
- How much did you get?
- You did get paid for it, didn't you?

347
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,762
The fellow only makes $10 a week,
and he's got a wife and a family.

348
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,893
Ten dollars a week?
That's just $10 more than you make.

349
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,427
- I couldn't take his money, could I?
- I give up.

350
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:25,998
I've got one son that steals my laundry
and spends his money heaven knows where...

351
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:29,102
another a lawyer and wins cases
and don't get paid for them.

352
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,207
I should have brought the two of you up as
Irish bricklayers, and every Saturday payday.

353
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,718
Don't mind her, as long as
she can keep her job.

354
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,846
- Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me. I may be late.
- Hmm.

355
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,185
Huh, indeed.

356
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:43,886
Where's he going
all dressed up?

357
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:49,024
Where is any of us going?
And where is it all going to end?

358
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,125
For one thing, we can
be going in to supper.

359
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:55,297
I wish you could have heard
what that judge said.

360
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:08,115
<i>- That you, Miss Belle?
- Yes.</i>

361
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,312
- Any messages for me?
- No.

362
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:14,585
Nothing except a heap more flowers and
some champagne from that same gentleman.

363
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:18,253
Lord, honey, you sure got
him snortin' in his sleep.

364
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:20,320
I hope you threw them out.

365
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:23,491
I throwed out the roses, but you knows
what a mess broken bottles make.

366
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,229
Did you tell him not to come
around here anymore?

367
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,238
I done told him that
till I'm black in the face.

368
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:33,333
These corsets are so tight,
I can hardly breathe.

369
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,972
As long as the men folks likes a small waist,
us gals has got to suffer.

370
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:45,144
- You want anything else, Miss Belle?
- No, thank you, Hattie.

371
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:47,247
- Good night.
- Good night.

372
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:50,657
- You can call me early tomorrow afternoon.
- Yes'm.

373
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,763
Get out of here.

374
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,934
<i>- Get out.!
- But listen...</i>

375
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,308
<i>- Get out.!
- I'll tell you, I wanna...</i>

376
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,973
- Get out of here!
- Belle, I wanna talk to...

377
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:15,314
<i>- Get out.!
- Listen, Belle. Don't act like that.</i>

378
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:18,719
- What do you mean by breaking into my place?
- Don't be like that.

379
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:22,520
- Don't act like that. I want to speak to you.
- Get out of here!

380
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:26,290
- Get out of here! Hey! Help! Help!
- I want to speak to you.

381
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:29,855
Hattie! Hattie!

382
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,732
<i>- You calling me, Miss Belle?
- Hattie.!</i>

383
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:35,033
<i>Help! Let me...</i>

384
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:38,074
Police! Murder! Help!

385
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:40,542
Police! Police!

386
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:43,205
Hattie! Let me go!

387
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,593
Oh, you!

388
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:19,015
- Now, won't you tell me what this is all about?
- I love you, Belle.

389
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,449
I mean, really.

390
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:24,749
- Well...
- I want the truth.

391
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:28,280
- You have a piece of property on Randolph Street.
- Of all the...

392
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,522
I thought if you and I were
to put up a place like Warren's...

393
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:34,758
only better, more class...
we could make a lot of money.

394
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:38,393
But I really meant that
about being crazy about you.

395
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:42,599
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

396
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:45,733
I'm a businesswoman.
I'd have listened to any proposition...

397
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,868
without all
this foolishness.

398
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:51,938
- You would've?
- Of course I would.

399
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,507
What a woman.

400
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,050
<i>Right through this way,
Mr. Police.!</i>

401
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,917
Sorry, boss...

402
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,394
but it looks like
the fire's out.

403
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,431
Now, look, Senator.
Gil Warren controls...

404
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:17,565
the Patch with
all its votes.

405
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,166
You need votes. Now,
as long as Warren goes along...

406
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:23,907
with no opposition, he has you and
your interests just where he wants them.

407
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:26,040
<i>Who knows, but the day
may come when Warren...</i>

408
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:28,175
<i>gets other ideas
that'd be embarrassing.</i>

409
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,413
- We have an offer to make you.
- Now, I have the greatest...

410
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:34,355
attraction that ever came to Chicago...
Miss Fawcett.

411
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:36,450
<i>Now with your backing
and your money to get us started...</i>

412
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,995
we'll open the greatest saloon
Chicago's ever known...

413
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:41,190
on the busiest
corner in town...

414
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:44,063
and I'll control the Patch...
I'll tell 'em how to vote.

415
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:48,935
And what's more, Senator,
you see this floor?

416
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:53,534
You see those real silver dollars
that Potter Palmer put in there?

417
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,840
Well, every month
after we get started, Senator...

418
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:58,313
they'll be 1,000
of those for you.

419
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,142
What do you say?
Are you in?

420
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:07,156
I'm always in the market
for marketable goods.

421
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:09,454
Go ahead.

422
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:17,929
Full protection for me,
security for you and your family...

423
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:21,493
and a hundred dollars in cash
every Monday from now on.

424
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,737
Young man,
are you trying to bribe me?

425
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:34,511
Why, Commissioner,
how can you say such a word?

426
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:12,453
Mrs. Kelly, good evening. Welcome to
The Senate, and I hope you enjoy yourself.

427
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:14,821
Good evening, sir. Good evening,
Mr. O'Shaughnessy.

428
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:16,883
Welcome to The Senate.

429
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,726
Hey, you mugs, where do you think you are?
Take off your hats.

430
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:24,597
Keep on your coats
and shake hands with the boss.

431
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:33,138
- Where do you think you're going?
- Now listen, shorty.

432
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,508
You're taking
the wrong "altitude"...

433
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,345
'cause this is the only saloon
in town I ain't been thrown out of.

434
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,680
I'll give you
just five minutes.

435
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:45,415
I can do it in three.
That's tellin' him.

436
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,428
- Captain Jamison.
- Captain Jamison, welcome.

437
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,492
- And this is my daughter Ann.
- Miss Colby.

438
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,435
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

439
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:51,440
I've been begging Father
to bring me here for the opening.

440
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:53,669
- I'm glad he did.
- It's marvelous.

441
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:56,542
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Thank you.

442
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,844
- May I show you to your table?
- Please do.

443
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:03,875
Gentlemen, you give me The Senate,
I give you Chicago.

444
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:06,787
Father says you're the smartest
young man in Chicago.

445
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,690
That's because he knows
I'll deliver the Patch on Election Day.

446
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,628
He says you have a great future, as big
as Gil Warren's if you do as he says.

447
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:16,461
He's the boss, and one
of America's finest.

448
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:19,900
- And now... I must change my costume.
- Allow me.

449
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,633
<i>I want to talk to you, my boy.
I have some great plans in store.</i>

450
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:27,734
Surely not tonight, Senator, when you have
so beautiful a daughter to entertain us.

451
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:31,645
Father won't talk business
if I ask him not to. Will you, darling?

452
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,684
I can't imagine the senator doing
anything that you asked him not to.

453
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:38,847
That's right. She wraps me around
her finger all the time.

454
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,716
Uh, excuse me, please.

455
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:47,127
- I'll be right back.
- We'll expect you.

456
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:51,691
He's nice-looking, isn't he?
I mean, for someone from the Patch.

457
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:55,598
- Hello, Warren.
- Why, hello, son.

458
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:59,233
- Mr. O'Leary.
- Jim-dandy place you've got here.

459
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:03,075
- Thanks.
- Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you.

460
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:07,446
- You mean, you're not sore?
- Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet.

461
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:10,680
Live and let live...
that's my motto.

462
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:14,588
- Come on. Have a drink.
- Matter of fact, I wanted a word in private with you.

463
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:17,923
- Oh, sure. Come on in my office.
- See you in a minute, Rondo.

464
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:20,656
Rondo, step up to the bar.
Anything you want, on the house.

465
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,960
Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.

466
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:26,525
- How old are you, son?
- Old enough to vote. Why?

467
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:29,629
I was just thinking,
you've come along mighty fast.

468
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,834
When I was your age,
do you know what I was doing?

469
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,675
I was rounding up runaway slaves
and practically starving to death.

470
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:40,546
- Sit down, Gil.
- Take it from me, times have changed.

471
00:40:40,617 --> 00:40:44,713
- Everything's youth today.
- Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil.

472
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:49,589
I've managed, but you've got a great future
ahead of you. Mark my words.

473
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,923
Well, I hope you're right.

474
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:55,897
I don't blame you for taking Belle.
She's a great woman.

475
00:40:55,966 --> 00:41:00,494
I'd have married her if I'd had the chance,
but she never cared for me.

476
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,563
<i>- It was just a business deal, and you outbid me.
- What's on your mind?</i>

477
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:10,307
What would you say, son, if I told you
I was gonna close The Hub, quit?

478
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,848
I'd say you were up to something.
What is it?

479
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:16,010
I'm thinking of
running for mayor.

480
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,747
Mayor?

481
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,312
I've been electing them
long enough.

482
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,917
Now I'm going to elect myself,
if you'll ride along with me.

483
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:27,760
- How do I come in?
- You're a smart young fella.

484
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:31,323
If you watch your step, you're going
to be a big power in this town.

485
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:35,770
I could build a bigger place and give you
trouble, but I've had all I want of this.

486
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,434
- You say the word, and I'm through.
- You close The Hub?

487
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,740
Exactly, and give you
an open field.

488
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,838
Now, we either work together
politically or fight it out.

489
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,407
It's up to you.

490
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:52,353
It's a nice place you have here,
but, like a tinder box...

491
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:56,358
touch a match to it, and it'll go off
like a Roman candle.

492
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,953
But what the devil? Chicago is big enough
for both of us and more.

493
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,726
Together we could run
this town and run it right.

494
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:06,462
You, Belle and me pulling together,
it'd be a lead pipe cinch.

495
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:09,630
Yeah. Sounds all right.

496
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:13,039
But naturally there's a little expense
involved, and right now with the...

497
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:16,442
I took the liberty of bringing
my check for $10,000.

498
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:21,576
There'll be more between now
and election time.

499
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,950
I think we'll manage
very well, Your Honor.

500
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:28,388
Now I could use that drink
you were talking about.

501
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,449
Come on.

502
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,224
Now, Belle, you've got to come
to my table right now...

503
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:37,232
and have a bottle
of wine with me.

504
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,633
I'd love to, but you'll have to
excuse me for one minute.

505
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,664
Belle!

506
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:47,335
Hello. I thought I
saw you come in here.

507
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,504
I was just telling Dion
what a great place you've got.

508
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,481
I never saw you
looking so beautiful.

509
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,747
- I always did say she was the best looker Chicago ever saw.
- Thanks.

510
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,119
Better watch yourself, son.
I'll get her back if I can.

511
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,183
- But it looks like it won't be to The Hub.
- Gil's closing The Hub for good.

512
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,285
<i>Really? Why?</i>

513
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:09,628
There's the music for your song.
Better hurry.

514
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:12,862
Dion'll tell you
all about it later.

515
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:16,463
Whew! What a woman.

516
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:22,136
Yes, that's exactly what
I said the first time I saw her. Remember?

517
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:49,432
Oh, I'm... Miss Colby,
Miss Fawcett.

518
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,769
- How do you do?
- How do you do? So sorry.

519
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:55,436
You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary
another few minutes. I'll send him back.

520
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:58,674
- That'll be very sweet of you.
- Thank you.

521
00:46:01,117 --> 00:46:05,213
- Is that the woman?
- Why, yes, I believe so.

522
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:08,223
She's pretty... in a way.

523
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,886
- Women like her have all the advantage, don't they?
- All except one.

524
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:14,486
I wasn't thinking
of marriage.

525
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,533
- So you're taking his money?
- What's the matter with his money?

526
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,401
- The check's good, isn't it?
- You know how he feels about us, the threats he's made...

527
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,872
I wouldn't worry about
that if I were you.

528
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:28,468
Ever since I left his place,
he's schemed to get even.

529
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:31,377
Now he's trying to do it
with your own help.

530
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,610
- He knows that if he's mayor...
- What makes you think he's gonna be mayor?

531
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,482
- But you took his money.
- Sure.

532
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:40,488
Sure, and I'll vote for him
myself, if necessary...

533
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:43,218
but I didn't say
how the Patch'll vote.

534
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,283
- Why, that's...
- Politics.

535
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:49,525
He'd knife me if he could,
and I simply mean to beat him to it.

536
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:54,328
Why, you dirty dog.

537
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,604
- You love me?
- Certainly not.

538
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,609
Go on. Say it before
I break your back.

539
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:05,169
Who was that little doll-faced blonde
you were smiling all over yourself about?

540
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:08,217
Senator's daughter.
I have to be nice to him, don't I?

541
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,844
Why weren't you breathing
down his neck?

542
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,911
Stop it.

543
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:15,958
You and The Senate
and Warren on the run.

544
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,085
In other words, Mr. O'Leary
is rising in the world.

545
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:21,289
<i>Mr. O'Leary and present company.</i>

546
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,423
<i>Chief, Mitch is here.</i>

547
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,160
Come on in
and shut the door.

548
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:30,128
Is it true that you were caught
registering under a false name?

549
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:33,141
Gee, chief, how was I to know
that guy was already registered?

550
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:35,803
I told you this bozo
don't use his head.

551
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:38,574
Oh, have a brain, you. Getting caught
with an election coming up...

552
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,412
and that reform crowd
already yelling its head off.

553
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,146
It would serve you right
if I let them send you to jail for life...

554
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,348
but, no, I've got to sit through a trial
and figure a way to get you out.

555
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:49,948
I oughta...
Oh, get out.

556
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:52,426
Yeah! Come on out!

557
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:59,261
Now, where were we?

558
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,565
Oh, yes.

559
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:14,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

560
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,485
- Everything fixed?
- The district attorney said if you're worried...

561
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,852
he'll let us have witnesses to prove
Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years.

562
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:23,084
That's the kind
of prosecutor I like.

563
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:25,184
- What'd you give him?
- The usual.

564
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,991
Chief! It ain't fair!
It ain't fair!

565
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:30,123
- It ain't fair!
- What's the matter?

566
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,793
The district attorney...
and after we had him all fixed.

567
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,893
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he fell down...

568
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,962
and broke his ankle
and he ain't here!

569
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,031
- The fool doesn't know how to walk?
- And the judge appointed...

570
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:42,100
somebody to take his place
and I don't know who.

571
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:44,840
- What's this mean?
- It means it ain't fixed.

572
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,973
Oh, come on.

573
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:51,676
In view of the unavoidable
detention of the district attorney...

574
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,086
the court has appointed
a special counsel...

575
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:57,648
a representative
of the Election Reform Committee...

576
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,855
<i>in the case of The City
of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell.</i>

577
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,865
<i>Mr. O'Leary, are you
prepared to proceed?</i>

578
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,562
- We're ready, Your Honor.
- Oh, yes.

579
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:11,198
- Is the defense ready?
- Uh, Your Honor...

580
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:14,505
Your Honor, certain matters
have come up.

581
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:19,014
New evidence have been uncovered
that compels me to...

582
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,742
Go ahead with the trial.

583
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,841
- Go ahead?
- Proceed.

584
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,318
The defense is ready,
Your Honor.

585
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:28,380
You may proceed,
Mr. O'Leary.

586
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:35,157
Your Honor, it is no secret
that multiple voting...

587
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,222
for years has been
a common practice...

588
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,791
in that section of Chicago
known as the "Patch. "

589
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:45,239
So common, it has come to be regarded
as one of the minor evils...

590
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:47,299
in that district.

591
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:50,834
Men who occupy the highest
offices in this city...

592
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:53,677
openly and brazenly
bid against each other...

593
00:49:53,749 --> 00:49:55,683
for that very vote.

594
00:49:55,751 --> 00:50:01,053
Any mention of it is dismissed
with an indulgent smile...

595
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,854
as something that
should not be talked about.

596
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,896
There are men in this very courtroom,
Your Honor...

597
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,524
who control every election
in this city...

598
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,659
with such illegal votes.

599
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:16,830
Men who sit in their
fine saloons...

600
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:20,307
surrounded by every luxury
that money can buy...

601
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,867
or that they can steal...

602
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:28,508
while public officials bow and smile
before them and fight for their favor.

603
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:33,521
Until today, nobody has ever obtained
sufficient evidence to convict them.

604
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:37,047
Now, however, we have
an eyewitness...

605
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,959
who was actually present
when the defendant, Edward Mitchell...

606
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:43,692
<i>was caught attempting to register
under four different names...</i>

607
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:47,896
The last time, as the beloved
Bishop Cornwall himself.

608
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,565
<i>You know, he's really good.</i>

609
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,167
- Some day he'll be a great lawyer.
- I think he's all right now.

610
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,804
Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue
to the stand.

611
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,849
<i>Carrie Donohue
take the stand.</i>

612
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:07,845
- She can't do this to me.
- Shh! Quiet!

613
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,949
Stand up. Raise your
right hand.

614
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,119
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth...

615
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,220
- so help you God? What's your name?
- I do.

616
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:17,288
- Carrie Donohue.
- Sit down.

617
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:21,302
- Miss Donohue, you know this defendant?
- Do I know him?

618
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,430
- Hmph! That big squirt.
- None of that now.

619
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,600
- I'll haul off...
- Quiet!

620
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:30,543
<i>- Order in the court.
- Refrain from personal remarks.</i>

621
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:32,945
Tell the court what you know
about this man's registration.

622
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,176
- Well, my gentleman friend's...
- Face the judge.

623
00:51:35,251 --> 00:51:38,311
hired to watch the registration
and I'm keeping him company...

624
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,548
when this big squirt
walks in.

625
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:44,252
<i>- Well, he don't see me
and I don't say anything...</i>

626
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:47,318
but when he keeps comin' back,
I get suspicious...

627
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,662
and I'm just about to tell my friend
that something funny's going on...

628
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,532
when, sure enough,
back he comes again...

629
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:57,037
and, this time,
he says he's a bishop.

630
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:59,768
<i>Well, that's too much even for me.</i>

631
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,776
<i>Order in the court.</i>

632
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,971
- That's what you get for marrying 'em.
- You married to this woman?

633
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,037
- What?
- Can you imagine it?

634
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:08,811
- Ever divorce her?
- No! - Your Honor!

635
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,580
May it please the court,
we ask that this woman's testimony...

636
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:13,645
be stricken
from the records...

637
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:16,350
and this case dismissed
on the grounds that the law says...

638
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,950
a wife cannot testify
against her husband!

639
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:24,898
<i>- That woman is my client's lawful-wedded
spouse.! - Madam, is this true?</i>

640
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,629
<i>- Well, I married him once,
if that's what you mean...</i>

641
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:29,671
<i>- but I can tell you...
- That will do.</i>

642
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:32,764
- Well, I mean that he...
- That will do.

643
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,242
Well. Hmph.

644
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,274
Mr. O'Leary,
you distinctly told me...

645
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:43,114
that you had had time to familiarize
yourself with all the facts in the case...

646
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,643
and, yet, you take up this court's time
allowing your only witness...

647
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:49,418
to testify, although
she's clearly unqualified.

648
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:53,622
Your Honor, I assure you, this is
as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

649
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:56,130
I ask the court's pardon.

650
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:58,894
Case dismissed.

651
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,185
- Tough break, kid.
- Yeah.

652
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:08,693
- Congratulations.
- Aw, you can never tell about these women.

653
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,320
They'll put it over on you every time,
if they can...

654
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,524
but you were great yourself,
I was proud of you.

655
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,296
Wait'll I go after the big fish,
the higher-ups...

656
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,894
- then you'll really hear something.
- That's the way to talk.

657
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:23,408
- How about meeting Belle?
- It's about time.

658
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:25,943
Belle, this is brother Jack.
Jack, Miss Fawcett.

659
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,845
- How do you do?
- I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

660
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,349
- You have?
- Yes.

661
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,647
Dion isn't the only admirer
of beauty in the family.

662
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,711
Thank you.

663
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:38,847
- That was a very nice thing to say.
- I couldn't help...

664
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,949
but look at you
all through the trial.

665
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:44,621
Maybe that's why you lost your case.

666
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,324
- Uh, can we drop you someplace?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

667
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:50,664
I've, uh... I've got some things
to do here in the building.

668
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:58,572
You know, it seemed kind of funny,
you and Dion on one side...

669
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,578
and me on the other,
fighting each other.

670
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:02,910
When we were kids,
we were always fighting.

671
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:04,972
I bet if any other Irishers tried
to horn in...

672
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,041
it was the O'Learys
against the world.

673
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,247
- Oh, you said it.
- You two must've had fun when you were little.

674
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:12,882
- We still do. - Even though
we don't always see eye-to-eye.

675
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,153
Well, I've got
to leave you here...

676
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:17,024
but I'll tell ya what you do,
Miss Fawcett...

677
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:19,427
- or shall I call you "Belle"?
- Please do.

678
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:22,365
Let Dion bring you up the house
some time for dinner, meet Ma.

679
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:24,459
Well, I'd be
delighted.

680
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:26,561
I wanna show you
some pictures of Dion...

681
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,629
in his First Communion
suit at the age of nine.

682
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:31,198
And some of you without any suit
at all at the age of six months.

683
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,573
I wish you'd keep
an eye on this fellow for us.

684
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,210
He's getting up in the world so fast,
it might go to his head.

685
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:44,255
I'd kind of hate
to have to knock it off.

686
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,314
I'll try.

687
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:48,723
Good-bye.
See you soon.

688
00:54:48,794 --> 00:54:51,354
Good-bye, Jack.

689
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,660
- You know, I like him.
- They don't make 'em any better.

690
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:00,068
That was nice of him,
wanting me to meet your mother.

691
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,072
Well, yes. I've been thinking
about that myself.

692
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,904
Oh, don't. I understand how
she feels about me.

693
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:07,672
Oh, Ma's all right...
A little old-fashioned, perhaps.

694
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,737
Oh, please.

695
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,682
I had no idea he was so...
so human.

696
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,618
Oh, sure.
Takes after me.

697
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,678
You know, there's something
almost normal about him.

698
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:21,157
He just looks so real, you know
he believes everything he says.

699
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:24,423
Honestly, it just makes me sick
to think of a man like Gil Warren...

700
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:27,863
trying to run Chicago when there
are men here like your brother.

701
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:30,766
Can you imagine the mayor
he'd make if he had the chance?

702
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:34,033
Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up
with that reform crowd...

703
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:36,131
Wait a minute.

704
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,608
- I've got an idea.
- What?

705
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:41,111
I just thought what do with that check
Gil Warren gave me.

706
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:43,238
Back to The Senate.

707
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,709
In brief, we've come here
to ask you to run for mayor.

708
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:52,985
- What?
- We have canvassed the field, and you're the man we want.

709
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,755
Well, this is all
very flattering, gentlemen.

710
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,160
May I... May I ask
whom you represent?

711
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,358
The respectable
people of Chicago...

712
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,163
citizens who want a new deal
in our city administration.

713
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,363
We're organizing
a reform party.

714
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,999
- I'm not sure I'm the man.
- We're willing to take that chance.

715
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,444
- It's a great opportunity.
- Decent people are waiting for an honest program.

716
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:18,210
You'll carry every district, except,
perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch.

717
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:20,251
I'm not so sure
he won't get that too.

718
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,185
Your brother's influential there.
Surely he'll support you.

719
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,951
I'm afraid you can't
count on my brother.

720
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:28,788
You see, we O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

721
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,226
- Then we'll win without the Patch.
- Chicago needs you.

722
00:56:31,296 --> 00:56:34,390
- Yes, Mr. O'Leary.
- Will you do it, sir?

723
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,962
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'll run.

724
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,677
What did he say when you suggested
that I would support him?

725
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:51,011
He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you.

726
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,983
Well, at least he's agreed to run.
That's the first step.

727
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:57,385
What worries me is,
can you control him once he's in?

728
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,653
He's a pretty stubborn
young fellow.

729
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:04,456
You leave that to me.
We O'Learys are a strange tribe.

730
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,932
- How's that?
- Not bad.

731
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,063
Of course, it doesn't
look much like you.

732
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,338
"Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor.
Reform ticket. "

733
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:23,575
That's a great thing for Chicago.
I'd like to help.

734
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,708
- You help me?
- Sure. Why not?

735
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:30,050
If other people say you're good enough
to be mayor, I'm not going to say no.

736
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:32,919
Of course, I couldn't
support you openly.

737
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,118
You know how I feel
about the Patch.

738
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:37,354
Oh, of course.
No strings attached.

739
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:41,695
- The fact you're my brother wouldn't mean a thing.
- Stop arguing, will you?

740
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:44,030
If you stood in the way of something
I felt oughta be done...

741
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,731
I'd go after you as fast as I would
after anybody else, maybe faster.

742
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:52,937
Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago
as a great city people can be proud of.

743
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,138
I'd wipe out
all this mushroom growth...

744
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:58,273
start all over on a sound basis,
with steel and stone.

745
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,818
You don't have to make
speeches to me, Jack.

746
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:03,446
I just wanted you
to know where I stand.

747
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:08,719
- Well, how much do I owe you?
- I'm two games up on you.

748
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:12,786
Ah. Twenty cents.
What a gambler.

749
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,532
It's in the blood.

750
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:16,158
It's in the blood.

751
00:58:16,234 --> 00:58:21,001
Say, why don't you get Belle and come to the
house tonight and take her and Ma for a drive?

752
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:24,735
- Ha! You know Ma.
- We'll get a couple of beers under her belt.

753
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,369
Well, heaven help us
if it doesn't work out.

754
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,975
- To His Honor, the future mayor.
- To Chicago!

755
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,915
And to herself,
the first lady of the city!

756
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:07,975
Oh, to the lot of you!

757
00:59:08,053 --> 00:59:12,956
- The compliments of the season to you, ma'am.
- Oh, go on. More presents.

758
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:16,118
You should see the grand house
we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing.

759
00:59:16,194 --> 00:59:20,130
- And a butler in short pants.
- Heaven help me.

760
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,189
<i>It's himself.</i>

761
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,258
<i>- Pa.!
- It looks just like him.</i>

762
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:26,804
Sure got my nose.

763
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,931
I can remember the day we took it
like it was yesterday...

764
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:32,272
and the trouble we had
puttin' the collar on him.

765
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:35,245
- Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him?
- Hang him?

766
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:39,215
You'll do no such. He's gonna spend
the rest of his days on this organ.

767
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,050
If he only could have seen it himself.

768
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,648
Isn't he beautiful?
I want the baby to see it.

769
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:53,163
Look, that's
your grandpa.

770
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:56,792
Aw, Pat,
would you believe it?

771
00:59:56,868 --> 01:00:00,167
And Bob
just a baby himself.

772
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:04,800
If you turn out half as good as the blood
that's in you, I'll not complain.

773
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:07,606
You know, Ma,
it looks like Pa had...

774
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,874
sort of a roving eye
for the ladies.

775
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,746
I'll thank you to keep
a civil tongue in your head.

776
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,308
Roving eye, ha!
I'd like to catch him.

777
01:00:15,387 --> 01:00:19,551
Look.

778
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,991
You're so good to me, the lot of you.
You'll have me in tears.

779
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,690
- Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry.
- Listen to him.

780
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:29,563
We'll play him a tune,
his favorite one.

781
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:32,102
- Come on, Ma, and play it.
- Come on, the four of you.

782
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,662
We'll show him a thing or two.
The O'Learys against the world.

783
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,800
The O'Learys against the world!
- We will. Come on, Ma.

784
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,836
You should've seen your father dance,
as light as a canary...

785
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:15,345
and stealing a kiss
before you could shut your eyes.

786
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,938
And the fair Molly Callahan
loving it, I'm thinking.

787
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,950
And why shouldn't I
be loving it?

788
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:23,784
Himself as fine a man as ever stood up
with a girl in front of an altar.

789
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,948
And that's what
you should be doin'.

790
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:29,084
- That's what I was telling him today.
- Is it herself, you mean?

791
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,596
I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman.
You oughta know her.

792
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:35,929
Hmm. I will not. And her workin'
in a saloon like any hussy.

793
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,197
- Oh, that's not fair, Ma. We're living in modern times.
- That's right.

794
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,933
Don't forget, things have changed
since you were a girl. This is 1870.

795
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,532
Times may have changed,
but I haven't changed.

796
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,738
And I don't want any daughter-in-law
that's the talk of the town...

797
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:52,214
and kickin' her heels
in the air for anyone to see.

798
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:59,955
When you were a little one, no bigger
than that, and me over a tub...

799
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:03,824
I used to dream of the day when you'd
bring me home a sweet one...

800
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:07,888
and her all blushes,
and present me with fine grandsons...

801
01:02:07,966 --> 01:02:11,299
as would be like sons
of my own, only sweeter.

802
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:13,701
It's my own life, Ma.

803
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,871
Who'll have some more beer?

804
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,968
- Me.
- I wouldn't mind another drop.

805
01:02:23,548 --> 01:02:26,949
Here, Ma.
Put a head on it.

806
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:30,510
<i>Good evening, Mr. Jack.
Will you tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here?</i>

807
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:33,751
<i>- Oh, thanks.
- He'll be right out.</i>

808
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:38,159
Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget
about it, and let's go for a ride, huh?

809
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:40,857
Oh, sure.
How about it, Ma?

810
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:44,595
- That I will.
- Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat.

811
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:47,137
Aw, Ma.

812
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,765
There you are.

813
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,674
Drink it all, Ma.

814
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:57,110
Come on, Ma.

815
01:02:57,182 --> 01:03:00,208
Now, First Lady, I've got
a real surprise for you...

816
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:02,845
two of the fastest fillies
you ever sat behind.

817
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:06,118
Now, close your eyes and get inside.
Close 'em. Up one step. There you go.

818
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:11,527
Inside. Ma, this is Miss Fawcett.
This is Belle.

819
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:15,692
- Hmm! So it's a trick.
- No, wait a minute!

820
01:03:15,767 --> 01:03:19,533
You're going to meet Belle, so you
might as well get used to the idea.

821
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:22,573
- The devil I will. Let me out.
- Ma, you always were so stubborn.

822
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,700
If you don't stop it,
I'll give you the licking of your life.

823
01:03:25,777 --> 01:03:29,008
- Well, you don't think I'm gonna ride with her!
- Oh, come back here!

824
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,607
Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on!

825
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,176
Let me out! Let me out, I say!

826
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:40,247
- Sit still!
- Let me out! Stop it, I tell you!

827
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:42,350
I won't be treated
this way!

828
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,861
You Irish lunkhead!
What do you think you're doing?

829
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:49,229
My son an Irish lunkhead? How'd you like
to be treated? You with your grand manners.

830
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,394
Just as any woman who's going
to be his wife has a right to be treated.

831
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:57,533
<i>He'll never marry you. And now,
if you'll stop, I'll be takin' my leave.</i>

832
01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:00,305
- Stop here.
- Whoa!

833
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,746
- Wait. I'll get out.
- You'll do no such.

834
01:04:04,816 --> 01:04:08,343
It's you who'll be saving
the wear and tear of walking.

835
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:12,756
- Ma.
- Hmm!

836
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:15,384
How could you?

837
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,328
I'm sorry. I didn't think
Ma would act like that.

838
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,634
Take me home, please.

839
01:04:30,642 --> 01:04:33,543
My friends...

840
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:36,774
this campaign
has resolved itself...

841
01:04:36,848 --> 01:04:40,784
into one
clear-cut issue.

842
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:44,379
Shall the Patch
run Chicago...

843
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:48,357
or shall Chicago
run the Patch?

844
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:53,227
I promise you
that if I am elected...

845
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:56,699
the Patch will
either be cleaned up...

846
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,931
or it will be wiped out
like that.

847
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:02,666
<i>Hooray for Gil Warren.!</i>

848
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,208
- Who said that?
- Shh, shh.

849
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:09,303
- Oh, it's a shame.
- The trouble with him is he looks too honest.

850
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,611
People never trust
an honest man in office.

851
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,778
Well, I wish
he hadn't tried it.

852
01:05:15,853 --> 01:05:17,844
He'll never beat Warren.

853
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:20,288
Never say never
about politics.

854
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:23,156
What are you up to now?

855
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,718
Well, I was just wondering
what would happen...

856
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:29,563
if all Gil Warren's ward heelers
and poll watchers and repeaters...

857
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,932
failed to show up
on Election Day.

858
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:36,235
- What do you mean?
- He wouldn't stand much chance of being elected, would he?

859
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,502
George, drive
to Commissioner Beavers'.

860
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:43,813
Gil Warren's my friend.
I won't do it. I can't.

861
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:47,510
I won't do it! I can't!
I'll be ruined forever.

862
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:51,453
For doing your duty? Oh, come, come,
Commissioner. Be a man.

863
01:05:51,522 --> 01:05:53,513
He'll kill me.

864
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:57,550
Besides, what you're asking is against
the law, against all my principles.

865
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:00,756
You've been getting $100 a week
for doing what I tell you.

866
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,198
Every cent I got
was in cash.

867
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:08,000
Sure, I paid you in cash, but I always
sent it by a different man.

868
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:10,233
What? What do you mean?

869
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:14,608
Those 15 or 20 people would make fine
witnesses if you ever got any ideas.

870
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,614
Blackmail, eh?

871
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,082
All right. I'll fight.

872
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:26,914
Go ahead. Fight.

873
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,456
And you'll be back pounding the pavement
so quick, it'll make your head swim.

874
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,556
Come on.
He'll be there.

875
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:57,526
Hey, you!
Where's your ticket?

876
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,627
- I'm with him.
- You know this guy?

877
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:03,401
- I never saw him before in my life.
- One of us is in error.

878
01:08:03,474 --> 01:08:06,568
Outside, before I cloud up
and rain all over you.

879
01:08:06,644 --> 01:08:10,444
- That severs our relationship.
- One of them Reform guys. They got no manners.

880
01:08:51,922 --> 01:08:55,688
Belle, when you were working
for me at The Hub...

881
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,696
I bet you didn't think you'd be having the
first dance with the future mayor, did you?

882
01:08:59,764 --> 01:09:02,824
Are you counting your chickens
before they're hatched?

883
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,926
- It's a lead pipe cinch.
- Oh.

884
01:09:23,854 --> 01:09:26,755
You looking for me,
Commissioner?

885
01:09:57,121 --> 01:09:59,453
Hey, look what you done
to my suit!

886
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:08,621
- Hey, what's the idea?
- Stop it!

887
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:12,135
<i>Stop them, somebody.!
Stop them, somebody.! Stop them.!</i>

888
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:37,722
Ladies and gentlemen!
The house is pinched!

889
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:40,161
Stay back!

890
01:10:42,466 --> 01:10:44,798
Get back!
You can't get out this way.

891
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:54,407
Can you beat that? And just when
we were beginning to have a little fun.

892
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:58,938
You let me catch you with that Colby
woman again, and you won't call it fun.

893
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:03,385
Come on, come on.
Inside. Inside.

894
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,617
All right,
take it away.

895
01:11:18,536 --> 01:11:20,697
- What about it, chief?
- Yes, what about it?

896
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:24,104
It's all right, boys. It's all right.
You haven't got a thing to worry about.

897
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:26,837
I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.

898
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:30,574
- What about the bail?
- If it's bail they want, I've got it!

899
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:32,639
Better hurry, chief.
The polls are open already.

900
01:11:32,716 --> 01:11:36,675
Don't worry. You'll be at your posts
in 30 minutes. All right. What's the bail?

901
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:40,747
Sorry, Mr. Warren. Orders are to hold them
24 hours without bail...

902
01:11:40,825 --> 01:11:43,658
- On suspicion.
- What kind of suspicion?

903
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:46,628
- Suspicion of what?
- Just plain suspicion.

904
01:11:46,697 --> 01:11:50,098
You can't do that. This is Election Day.
They're my workers.

905
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,226
By the Eternal,
you've got to let them go!

906
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:55,534
- It ain't up to me.
- I'll get the commissioner!

907
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,531
I'll get Senator Colby!

908
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:01,578
I'll get my lawyer!
I'll tear this town wide open!

909
01:12:04,982 --> 01:12:07,644
- Where's Commissioner Beavers?
- Gone to the sanitarium.

910
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:10,812
- What sanitarium?
- I'm not allowed to give out his address.

911
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:12,879
Doctor's orders.

912
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:18,761
- Where's Judge Bender?
- Oh, the jud-jud-judge...

913
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:22,060
- I've got to see Judge Bender!
- Judge Bender left...

914
01:12:22,132 --> 01:12:24,692
on a h-hunting trip
this m-morning.

915
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:28,864
All the jud-judges
in town went with him.

916
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,874
They're o-organizing
a h-hunting club.

917
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:36,003
- Then I've got to see Senator Colby.
- I'm afraid that's imposs...

918
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,413
You can't do it.
See, S-Senator Colby...

919
01:12:39,483 --> 01:12:43,920
It's 12:00! The polls have been opened
six hours, and I'm tied hand and foot!

920
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:48,084
Every man in that jail controls at least
10 votes, enough to swing the election.

921
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,025
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna stop squawking.

922
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:55,555
- What's that?
- You're through. I've sold you out.

923
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:00,468
Don't try anything, Warren.

924
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:11,542
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go and vote for my brother.

925
01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:18,518
We O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

926
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:38,602
Look at him. You know,
he really looks like a mayor.

927
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:41,509
Gee, I bet Ma feels great.

928
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:22,377
<i>Dion, look at this!</i>

929
01:14:28,559 --> 01:14:30,550
Huh.

930
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:33,153
Huh, indeed.

931
01:14:40,237 --> 01:14:43,229
Belle, we're friends,
aren't we?

932
01:14:43,307 --> 01:14:45,901
I hope so.

933
01:14:45,976 --> 01:14:49,309
I've got a proposition
to put up to you.

934
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:53,077
It may startle you at first,
but I think you'll see my point.

935
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:57,211
I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want
to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me.

936
01:14:57,287 --> 01:15:00,518
- And you want me to help you?
- Exactly.

937
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:03,389
But after all,
what has it to do with me?

938
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,690
You know how things
are down there.

939
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:09,199
Everything that's rotten in
Chicago comes out of the Patch.

940
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:12,235
The whole thing is an atmosphere
of vice and crime.

941
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:15,430
It's getting out of control,
and I'm gonna wipe it out.

942
01:15:15,506 --> 01:15:17,371
How?

943
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:21,878
The law gives us the right
to condemn property.

944
01:15:21,945 --> 01:15:25,437
The courts will have it
appraised and set a fair price.

945
01:15:25,516 --> 01:15:29,543
It's what they call the right of eminent
domain. It's perfectly legal and fair.

946
01:15:31,422 --> 01:15:35,916
But all of Dion's money
is tied up in The Senate. Mine too.

947
01:15:38,028 --> 01:15:40,019
That's what's worrying me.

948
01:15:40,097 --> 01:15:42,531
If he won't see it our way,
there'll be trouble.

949
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:49,070
I don't know what to say.

950
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:52,131
Dion's a great person.
He can go anywhere, do anything...

951
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:55,303
if he only gets
on the right track.

952
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:59,440
Belle, I want
to see him marry you...

953
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:04,453
<i>have a home and children,
get something real out of life.</i>

954
01:16:04,521 --> 01:16:08,252
Don't you think that's
what I've been hoping for?

955
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:10,623
That's what he wants too,
if he can only see it.

956
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:16,032
What do you want me to do?

957
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,160
He couldn't stand
a public investigation.

958
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:22,228
You know how he operates
in the Patch.

959
01:16:22,306 --> 01:16:25,173
I couldn't do
a thing like that.

960
01:16:25,242 --> 01:16:27,267
<i>Believe me, Belle...</i>

961
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:30,939
if I can't bring him
to his senses any other way...

962
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:35,007
I'll start an investigation
that'll crack this town wide open.

963
01:16:35,085 --> 01:16:37,952
<i>I'll use you
as chief witness against Dion...</i>

964
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:41,582
<i>let you tell the whole rotten story
of how he operates in the Patch.</i>

965
01:16:41,658 --> 01:16:44,889
<i>How do you feel
about that, Belle?</i>

966
01:16:44,962 --> 01:16:49,490
I just wanted Belle
to understand my position...

967
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:52,296
same as I want you
to understand it.

968
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:56,499
- Dion, listen to Jack.
- I heard him. I know now where he stands.

969
01:16:56,573 --> 01:16:59,167
You knew exactly where
I stood before the election.

970
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:02,041
I told you and I told
the people of this city.

971
01:17:02,112 --> 01:17:05,013
- I elected you, not the people.
- You?

972
01:17:05,082 --> 01:17:09,280
Sure. It was my idea. I sent
that committee to see you.

973
01:17:09,353 --> 01:17:12,652
I paid for it, ran it, framed it,
threw Warren's men into jail.

974
01:17:12,723 --> 01:17:15,248
I even voted for you.

975
01:17:15,325 --> 01:17:17,486
I don't believe you.

976
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:20,052
Is that true?

977
01:17:21,365 --> 01:17:24,926
<i>- Yes.
- I just wanted it to look hunky-dory.</i>

978
01:17:27,337 --> 01:17:30,067
Why did you want me
to be mayor?

979
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:33,405
Oh, a lot of reasons.
I wanted to see if I could do it.

980
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:37,106
Or maybe it was because I wanted
to see the smile on Ma's face...

981
01:17:37,181 --> 01:17:39,479
when she rode with you
in the carriage election night.

982
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:44,146
All right. You elected me,
but I'm mayor.

983
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:48,248
Yes, you're mayor,
but I'm Chicago.

984
01:17:48,325 --> 01:17:50,850
I'd hate to
have to kick you out.

985
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,091
Don't try it. A lot of people
like what I'm doing.

986
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:00,227
- What are you going to get out of this?
- Nothing.

987
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:04,502
But I happen to have sense enough to see
what Jack's after, even if you haven't.

988
01:18:04,575 --> 01:18:07,601
- Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start...
- You keep out of this!

989
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:10,909
Well, of course,
since you've gone for Reform...

990
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,609
I guess we won't be seeing
very much of each other.

991
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:16,118
You're not gonna walk out
on Belle like that.

992
01:18:16,186 --> 01:18:19,883
It seems that she's the one
that's done the walking out.

993
01:18:19,957 --> 01:18:23,358
Dion. Dion!

994
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,422
Oh!

995
01:18:43,614 --> 01:18:47,846
<i>A grand jury investigation.!
Terrible.! Terrible.!</i>

996
01:18:47,918 --> 01:18:50,045
How did you ever get involved
in such a mess?

997
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,281
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you weren't...

998
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:54,347
in for a bit of sweatin'
yourself, Senator.

999
01:18:54,424 --> 01:18:57,291
You've been milkin' the Patch
for a long time.

1000
01:18:57,361 --> 01:19:00,888
Me? Why I'll give you to understand, sir,
that my life is an open book.

1001
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:04,456
Open or shut, brother, your shirttail's
out with the rest of us.

1002
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:07,367
It's my daughter
I'm thinking of.

1003
01:19:07,437 --> 01:19:09,598
I'll have to take her to Europe,
get her away from here.

1004
01:19:09,673 --> 01:19:11,766
- The trip would do her good.
- I'll have to ask you...

1005
01:19:11,842 --> 01:19:14,174
not to see my daughter
again ever.

1006
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:18,840
- To think I should be so deceived in the character...
- I've always wanted to see...

1007
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,907
what a senator looks like...

1008
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:23,248
when he gets a good,
swift kick in the pants.

1009
01:19:26,957 --> 01:19:30,256
- Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?
- I'm hurrying, honey.

1010
01:19:30,327 --> 01:19:33,296
Miss Belle,
you want this old plush?

1011
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:37,322
Yes. No. Throw it away.
I don't care what you do with it.

1012
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,426
Oh, this just fits
in my trunk.

1013
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:43,030
Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use
in you carryin' on like this.

1014
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:46,667
- Ain't no man worth it!
- Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?

1015
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:48,768
<i>I'm hurryin', honey.</i>

1016
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:56,145
- Get out of here!
- I'm gettin' out, honey.

1017
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:59,552
- Get out of here!
- Belle, don't act like that.

1018
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:02,439
<i>Belle, I want to talk to you.</i>

1019
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:05,769
Hattie, get out of the way!

1020
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:09,471
- Get him away from me!
- Get out of here, white man!

1021
01:20:12,482 --> 01:20:16,942
- Hattie, help me! Help me!
- Murder! Police! Help!

1022
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,284
- Get out!
- Belle, please.

1023
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,654
I'm sorry,
but I had to come.

1024
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:25,491
Just let me say one thing,
then you can put me out. I won't care.

1025
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:28,963
- Oh, please go.
- I don't ask you to forgive me.

1026
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:32,195
I've said and done things
no woman could ever forgive.

1027
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:35,329
But you've got to believe
I love you, Belle.

1028
01:20:35,405 --> 01:20:38,238
I always have
and I always will.

1029
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:41,038
Oh, why talk about it?

1030
01:20:41,111 --> 01:20:43,170
But you said you loved me.

1031
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,305
That's over.

1032
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,146
You can't change in a moment
any more than I can.

1033
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:51,153
We can't do
without each other.

1034
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,883
I can.
I'll make myself.

1035
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:58,189
Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll
go on fighting, but we'll do it together.

1036
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:01,162
We were meant
for each other.

1037
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,029
Belle, marry me.

1038
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:07,430
Now. Tonight.

1039
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:10,996
I've got the license
and the ring.

1040
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,271
We'll go to Jack,
have him marry us.

1041
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:16,335
Will you, Belle?

1042
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,980
Oh, my darling!

1043
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,383
Come on, Mr. Policeman.
Right in here. She...

1044
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:29,184
She's done
backslid again.

1045
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:36,264
Do you realize that 75%
of the buildings in the Patch...

1046
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,927
are made of pine?

1047
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:42,267
There are no sewers,
no hydrants.

1048
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:45,638
Nothing but filth, cesspools.

1049
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:50,840
But worst of all,
it is a veritable firetrap.

1050
01:21:50,914 --> 01:21:55,783
Now, that sort of thing may have been
excusable when Chicago was just beginning...

1051
01:21:55,852 --> 01:21:58,013
but that time has passed.

1052
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:01,080
Today it's a menace
to a great city...

1053
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:04,126
a cancer
that must be cut out.

1054
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:07,186
Now, I propose to condemn
the whole district...

1055
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:09,891
wipe it out
and start all over again.

1056
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:13,197
Yes, what is it?

1057
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:15,965
Tell him
I'll be right out.

1058
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:21,069
Will, uh, you gentlemen
go ahead with the discussion...

1059
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:23,874
and excuse me
for a little while, please?

1060
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,313
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

1061
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,648
Well, Jack, you've won.

1062
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:36,249
- I've won what?
- I've been a fool.

1063
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,997
I wouldn't take a million
for this moment.

1064
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:47,298
Now it's really the O'Learys
against the world.

1065
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,168
Well, here's the little
lady who's responsible.

1066
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,572
As if I didn't know it.

1067
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:57,306
As the mayor of this great and noble city,
can you marry people?

1068
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,848
Marry?

1069
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,908
Why, sure!

1070
01:23:04,087 --> 01:23:06,749
Wait a minute.
I'm not so sure.

1071
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:08,814
But I'll find out.

1072
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:11,554
What a mayor.

1073
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:15,064
Is there anything in the charter about
whether the mayor can perform a marriage?

1074
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:19,500
- I don't know, sir, but I'll find out.
- Hurry up and find out!

1075
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:24,006
"Having taken these pledges
of your affection and vows of fidelity...

1076
01:23:24,073 --> 01:23:27,167
"I do, therefore, by right of
the authority in me vested...

1077
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:29,768
"by the laws
of the state of Illinois...

1078
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:32,474
"pronounce you,
Dion Patrick O'Leary...

1079
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,143
"and you,
Belle Catherine Fawcett...

1080
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:37,686
lawfully married,
husband and wife. "

1081
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:46,494
That makes us
kissing kin, doesn't it?

1082
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:49,532
- I don't have to tell you how lucky you are.
- That's right.

1083
01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:52,591
- I just want to say congratulations.
- Thank you.

1084
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:56,298
I wish you every happiness
and... good night.

1085
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:58,363
Congratulations.
Good night.

1086
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:02,002
You'll never know
how much all this means to me.

1087
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:05,172
Remember that day
I told you he wasn't so bad?

1088
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,240
The O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

1089
01:24:08,318 --> 01:24:10,786
Right.

1090
01:24:10,854 --> 01:24:13,550
Now, let's go home
and tell Ma, huh?

1091
01:24:13,623 --> 01:24:18,788
Sure, but first there's just one
little matter I'd like to clear up.

1092
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:23,162
And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose
you go ahead and testify against me?

1093
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:25,997
Listen to him.

1094
01:24:26,069 --> 01:24:29,800
You didn't think I was gonna
let you two get away with it, did you?

1095
01:24:29,873 --> 01:24:33,468
- Why, Dion!
- Go ahead with your grand jury investigation.

1096
01:24:33,543 --> 01:24:36,569
She's my wife,
and you know the law...

1097
01:24:36,646 --> 01:24:40,480
A wife cannot testify
against her husband.

1098
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:42,541
Oh!

1099
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,321
Belle, where
are you going?

1100
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:51,224
What do you think of that?

1101
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:53,558
Why, you dirty...

1102
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:03,669
I haven't licked you
since we were kids.

1103
01:25:34,604 --> 01:25:38,768
<i>Of all the low, disgusting tricks
you ever pulled, this is the worst.</i>

1104
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,207
Well, you won't
get away with it.

1105
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:44,337
I'm gonna wipe out the Patch
and you along with it!

1106
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:46,882
- Johnson!
- Yes, sir. I've sent for the police.

1107
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,215
I don't want the police!
Get the city attorney!

1108
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:53,585
Tell him to start
the condemnation proceedings.

1109
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:56,489
And you get out of here! I never
want to see your face again!

1110
01:25:56,559 --> 01:26:00,154
Get the police commissioner.
Tell him to swear in 500 special deputies.

1111
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:03,426
Get the newspapers. Tell them that when
I get through with the Patch...

1112
01:26:03,499 --> 01:26:07,094
<i>- there won't be a stick or stone left standing.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1113
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:17,207
Hey, one at a time.
Quit that nudging.

1114
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:19,611
You'd think you
never been fed before.

1115
01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:23,083
You're so full already, you oughta be
sleepin' it off on the parlor sofa.

1116
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:26,121
Mutter, Mutter,
komm schnell!

1117
01:26:26,188 --> 01:26:27,815
Stop that heathen
jabbering and talk sense!

1118
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,757
<i>Dion, Jack, they fight!
Bitte, Mutter, komm.!</i>

1119
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:33,260
The devil you say!

1120
01:26:33,329 --> 01:26:35,957
You can take one more nip
while I'm knockin' their heads together.

1121
01:26:44,707 --> 01:26:47,141
- Dion married Belle Fawcett.
- What?

1122
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,541
Yeah, Jim Fellows
just came by to tell us.

1123
01:26:49,612 --> 01:26:52,945
Dion and Jack have had a knock-down,
drag-out fight about the Patch.

1124
01:26:53,015 --> 01:26:55,210
- And them grown-up and brothers.
- I'm gonna find 'em.

1125
01:26:55,284 --> 01:26:58,617
Wait. I'll go with you. And wait till I get
my hands on that Dion...

1126
01:26:58,687 --> 01:27:01,212
fightin' and marryin'
that creature behind my back.

1127
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:04,282
Mrs. O'Leary!
Mrs. O'Leary!

1128
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:09,229
Oh, Mrs. O'Leary!
Your barn! Look! Look!

1129
01:27:09,298 --> 01:27:12,131
I didn't put the bar
between Daisy's legs.

1130
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:15,193
Fire! Fire!

1131
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:17,865
Get Daisy and the calf
and the horse!

1132
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,103
Get that baby
back into the house!

1133
01:27:21,177 --> 01:27:24,908
Fire! Turn the alarm!
Fire! Turn the alarm!

1134
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:40,384
Fire!

1135
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:02,110
Come on, boys!

1136
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:05,153
Never mind the barn!
Let it go!

1137
01:28:05,221 --> 01:28:07,917
Save the house!
The house!

1138
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,486
Mrs. O'Leary, I'm gettin' out
everything that I can.

1139
01:28:14,563 --> 01:28:17,794
Mrs. Donovan, your
own house is a-goin'!

1140
01:28:17,867 --> 01:28:21,064
Me own house? Mrs. O'Leary,
me own house is a-burnin'!

1141
01:28:58,941 --> 01:29:02,775
- Get that cow!
- Come on, Daisy! Come on!

1142
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:14,179
<i>Get a hose over here.!</i>

1143
01:29:14,256 --> 01:29:16,281
<i>Come on.!</i>

1144
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,099
Giddyap.

1145
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:37,376
- Chief!
- Dion!

1146
01:29:37,446 --> 01:29:39,471
Here I am, Pickle!

1147
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:42,176
Dion, oh, Dion!

1148
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:45,186
- What's the matter?
- There's a big fire in the Patch!

1149
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:47,688
- Yeah? Where?
- DeKoven Street. The whole street's goin'!

1150
01:29:47,756 --> 01:29:50,190
You suppose that's
some of the mayor's doings?

1151
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,284
Sure. The mayor's
burning us out.

1152
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:56,695
<i>- He said he'd get us.
- Said he wouldn't leave a stick or a stone standing.</i>

1153
01:29:56,765 --> 01:29:59,632
- Looks bad, boy.
- Yeah, burning us out, huh?

1154
01:29:59,702 --> 01:30:02,068
- Couldn't even wait for condemnation proceedings.
- I'll go with you.

1155
01:30:02,137 --> 01:30:04,628
No, you stay here.
I've gotta find out how Ma is.

1156
01:30:04,707 --> 01:30:07,141
Give the boys a drink.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1157
01:30:07,209 --> 01:30:10,906
He's asked for a fight.
Well, I'll give it to him.

1158
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,380
Well, what'll
you fellas have?

1159
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:16,213
- I'll take some of this.
- Mighty funny business.

1160
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:19,152
- What?
- Well, I'm not saying anything...

1161
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:22,918
but I haven't got much faith in these fights
between brothers...

1162
01:30:22,992 --> 01:30:25,017
not when they're O'Learys.

1163
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:27,187
They've pulled some pretty
smart tricks in the past...

1164
01:30:27,263 --> 01:30:30,061
and I wouldn't put it
past 'em to do it again.

1165
01:30:30,132 --> 01:30:34,296
You heard what Dion said! No one's gonna
burn him out, brother or no brother.

1166
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:37,669
Well, I hope not. When I was running things,
nothing like this happened.

1167
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:41,403
- Hmm! Come on, fellas.
- All right, boys. You heard what he said.

1168
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:45,311
Spread the word. We'll have something
to say about bein' run out of the Patch.

1169
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:48,077
Wait a minute.
Get the boys together.

1170
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,550
- Tell them that I said we'll meet at the armory.
- We'll get this Jack O'Leary!

1171
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:27,584
Back up! Back up!
I've gotta get through! Back up!

1172
01:31:27,656 --> 01:31:31,148
Here, I think I can make
better time on foot.

1173
01:31:51,113 --> 01:31:55,550
All right, boys!
Put her on the other roof!

1174
01:31:55,617 --> 01:31:58,211
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

1175
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:00,221
Mommy!

1176
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:04,090
Mary!

1177
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:18,899
All right, boys, pump!

1178
01:32:42,364 --> 01:32:46,391
It's moving might fast in this wind,
leaping ahead blocks at a time.

1179
01:32:46,468 --> 01:32:48,459
<i>The Patch is like tinder.</i>

1180
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:51,904
<i>There hasn't been a drop of rain
for nearly three months.</i>

1181
01:32:51,974 --> 01:32:55,637
We've got to keep it away from the gas works.
We gotta keep it south of the river.

1182
01:32:55,711 --> 01:32:58,612
Have you any suggestions,
General Sheridan?

1183
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,205
Yes. Make a firebreak
at the edge of the Patch.

1184
01:33:01,283 --> 01:33:03,547
Blow up that entire section
along Randolph Street.

1185
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:08,488
- Fight this fire with dynamite!
- I authorize you to do everything possible to stop this fire.

1186
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:11,082
Commissioner,
mobilize your whole force.

1187
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,561
Swear in as many deputies as you need.
Clear that whole area.

1188
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,394
- Requisition all the foodstuffs you need.
- Yes, sir.

1189
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:22,062
Donovan, you and Johnson get in touch
with Milwaukee, all the surrounding cities.

1190
01:33:22,137 --> 01:33:24,571
Ask them to send us
all the fire apparatus they can.

1191
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,201
Wire Washington. Tell them we're gonna
need relief... money, medicine, troops.

1192
01:33:28,277 --> 01:33:31,940
- Keep me advised. I'll be with Gen. Sheridan.
- Yes, sir.

1193
01:33:49,164 --> 01:33:51,359
Miss Belle,
pull yourself together!

1194
01:33:51,433 --> 01:33:55,028
Come on, honey. Let's get outta here.
Come on, baby.

1195
01:33:55,103 --> 01:33:58,732
Pull yourself together. Let's get out
of here before judgment day gets us.

1196
01:33:58,807 --> 01:34:00,866
Come on, honey. Come on.

1197
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,492
Bob! Bob!
Where's Ma?

1198
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:32,165
She's gone to the North Side with Gretchen
and the baby in the wagon.

1199
01:34:32,241 --> 01:34:34,971
They had to go. Our house
was the first to burn.

1200
01:34:35,043 --> 01:34:39,002
- Our house? Why, that dirty... Where did they start it?
- In our barn.

1201
01:34:39,081 --> 01:34:43,142
Ma heard about you fighting, she left the
lantern in there and Daisy kicked it over.

1202
01:34:43,218 --> 01:34:46,016
I thought Jack did it
to burn out the Patch.

1203
01:34:46,088 --> 01:34:48,420
That mob thinks so too.
We gotta get to him.

1204
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:51,926
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know, but we've gotta stop that mob.

1205
01:34:58,166 --> 01:35:00,999
- Back up, I tell you!
- How can I back up?

1206
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,833
Why can't you look
where you're going?

1207
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:06,500
Get that flea-bitten
thing out of here!

1208
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:27,385
Come, darling, get out.
We have to walk.

1209
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:43,204
Wait! I'll just
be gettin' it.

1210
01:35:46,114 --> 01:35:49,140
I'll not be leavin' his picture.
It's all I've got left.

1211
01:35:49,217 --> 01:35:51,208
That fool cow!

1212
01:35:57,726 --> 01:36:01,890
<i>Look out! The wall! It's falling!</i>

1213
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,963
<i>Mutter.!</i>

1214
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,136
<i>- Gretchen! Gretchen!
- Mutter.!</i>

1215
01:36:16,211 --> 01:36:18,441
Gretchen!

1216
01:36:18,513 --> 01:36:22,973
Don't waste any time.
Get those people behind the line.

1217
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:25,611
- Captain!
- Yes, sir?

1218
01:36:25,687 --> 01:36:29,316
Take all of your men you can spare.
Use some of mine if necessary.

1219
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:33,122
Search every building. See that no one
is left behind. No one! Quickly!

1220
01:36:33,195 --> 01:36:35,254
Yes, sir.

1221
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:39,562
Sergeant, move all police lines back
one full block and let no one through!

1222
01:36:39,635 --> 01:36:41,535
Hey, where are you going?

1223
01:36:41,603 --> 01:36:45,903
- I've got to get through to The Senate.
- Nobody's going through.

1224
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:48,135
Mayor's orders. The streets cleared.
They're gonna dynamite.

1225
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:50,906
- Dynamite?
- Yeah, to make a firebreak.

1226
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:54,938
Come on, open up! Get back!
Back to the next corner!

1227
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:58,111
- Come on. Back to the next block.
- What are you gonna do?

1228
01:36:58,186 --> 01:37:01,349
I don't know.
Jack! Jack!

1229
01:37:01,423 --> 01:37:03,220
Get back! Come on!

1230
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:07,125
<i>- I've gotta get through.!
- Jack! Jack, I...</i>

1231
01:37:10,265 --> 01:37:13,359
Turn him loose.
I'll take care of him.

1232
01:37:13,435 --> 01:37:16,370
Get away from here,
you dirty, contemptible liar.

1233
01:37:16,438 --> 01:37:18,372
I've stood for all
I'm gonna stand from you.

1234
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,965
<i>I've got work to do,
and nobody is gonna stop me.!</i>

1235
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:25,343
You've got to listen to me! Gil Warren
and his mob are out to get you!

1236
01:37:25,414 --> 01:37:29,407
Everybody down here thinks you set fire to
the Patch. They're organizing against you.

1237
01:37:29,484 --> 01:37:31,816
It's my fault.
I thought so too.

1238
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:35,015
- You lowdown, good-for-nothing...
- Jack!

1239
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,150
Until I got home and found the house
burned to the ground...

1240
01:37:38,226 --> 01:37:40,490
- Ma, Gretchen and the baby gone.
- Where are they?

1241
01:37:40,562 --> 01:37:43,622
I put 'em in a wagon and started them
for the North Side.

1242
01:37:43,699 --> 01:37:45,860
They oughta be
across the river by now.

1243
01:37:45,934 --> 01:37:48,459
I'm sorry. I should have known better.
Jack, you've got to believe me.

1244
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:54,208
There's Gil Warren
and his gang now.

1245
01:37:54,276 --> 01:37:58,212
What the devil do I care
about Warren and his gang now?

1246
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,546
The only thing that matters is that
we're together and thinking alike. Come on!

1247
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:05,211
There they are, men!
Just like I told you.

1248
01:38:05,287 --> 01:38:07,278
The O'Learys.
The three of'em together.

1249
01:38:07,355 --> 01:38:10,449
You men, hold that line!
Don't let anybody through.

1250
01:38:10,525 --> 01:38:13,892
Keep those people back. I don't care
how you do it, but keep them back!

1251
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:15,953
Right.

1252
01:38:16,031 --> 01:38:20,092
Men! Listen!
Listen, men!

1253
01:38:20,168 --> 01:38:23,604
The fire was an accident. My brother
didn't have anything to do with it.

1254
01:38:23,672 --> 01:38:26,140
That's what you say,
but we know different.

1255
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:29,234
We've got to dynamite.
It's our only chance to save Chicago!

1256
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:31,336
<i>Let it burn.!</i>

1257
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:33,608
Men! Men! Think!

1258
01:38:33,682 --> 01:38:37,118
That's just what we're doing. Thinking.
Thinking it's another O'Leary trick.

1259
01:38:40,422 --> 01:38:43,357
<i>- Mayor O'Leary.!
- Yes, General?</i>

1260
01:38:43,425 --> 01:38:47,191
Have your men move this crowd
back to the end of that street.

1261
01:38:47,262 --> 01:38:51,198
- The dynamite is set. We're ready to light.
- All right, move that crowd!

1262
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:53,166
Push them back!
Get 'em back!

1263
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:57,228
Oh, no, you don't! We're not moving!
No one's running us out.

1264
01:38:57,305 --> 01:39:00,172
We got rights too,
and we know where we stand.

1265
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:03,871
<i>You're not gonna blow us up.
You don't dare.</i>

1266
01:39:03,945 --> 01:39:07,506
We're not gonna let 'em destroy
our homes to save their own.

1267
01:39:07,582 --> 01:39:10,813
<i>We're staying right here.
We'll show 'em who they're dealing with.</i>

1268
01:39:10,886 --> 01:39:14,253
They don't own Chicago.
They're... What?

1269
01:39:14,322 --> 01:39:18,053
<i>Hey.! Look.! Look.!
Stop him, somebody.!</i>

1270
01:39:20,262 --> 01:39:22,560
Dion! Dion!

1271
01:39:22,631 --> 01:39:26,431
Don't move an inch, men.
We've got our rights.

1272
01:39:26,501 --> 01:39:29,527
- Dion!
- Jack, light 'em. Light 'em!

1273
01:39:29,604 --> 01:39:31,765
- You're hurt.
- It's just a scratch.

1274
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,300
Get back, you fools!
All of you! And keep back!

1275
01:39:36,378 --> 01:39:38,505
Light 'em.

1276
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,582
Dion! Dion!

1277
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,724
<i>Get back, and keep back.!</i>

1278
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:57,924
<i>Get him, Rondo.!
Rondo, get him.!</i>

1279
01:39:57,999 --> 01:40:01,025
<i>Get him, Rondo.!</i>

1280
01:40:07,108 --> 01:40:12,205
<i>Get those fuses out.!
Pull 'em down.! Pull 'em down.!</i>

1281
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:21,246
<i>Get 'em down.!</i>

1282
01:40:21,323 --> 01:40:24,554
We're too late! We're too late!
Run for your lives, men!

1283
01:40:24,626 --> 01:40:27,652
<i>- We can't put 'em out.!
- Run for your lives!</i>

1284
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:43,306
Where's Jack?

1285
01:40:52,888 --> 01:40:55,356
Jack!

1286
01:41:38,867 --> 01:41:40,494
Open up!

1287
01:42:02,153 --> 01:42:05,987
Help! Help! Help!

1288
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,595
On to the lake, folks!

1289
01:42:24,842 --> 01:42:29,836
Cast off! Let go of that forward line
and get this boat away from here!

1290
01:42:29,914 --> 01:42:33,077
There's 10,000 barrels
of kerosene in that warehouse.

1291
01:42:33,151 --> 01:42:35,813
If this boat catches fire,
the warehouse is sure to go...

1292
01:42:35,887 --> 01:42:38,981
and we'll take
the whole North Side with us!

1293
01:42:50,668 --> 01:42:53,865
Try to get through
to the North Side!

1294
01:42:53,938 --> 01:42:56,964
<i>On to the lake.!</i>

1295
01:42:57,041 --> 01:43:01,569
<i>Bob.! Bob.! Bob.!</i>

1296
01:43:01,646 --> 01:43:03,637
That's Gretchen!

1297
01:43:03,715 --> 01:43:06,309
<i>- Bob!
- Gretchen.!</i>

1298
01:43:06,384 --> 01:43:08,716
Bob!

1299
01:43:08,786 --> 01:43:10,549
Gretchen!

1300
01:43:10,621 --> 01:43:12,418
<i>- Bob.!
- Gretchen!</i>

1301
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:16,358
Bob! Bob!

1302
01:43:17,662 --> 01:43:20,187
Gretchen!

1303
01:43:27,505 --> 01:43:31,805
Take your foot
off that picture! Oh!

1304
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:42,852
Mrs. O'Leary! I thought I saw you.
Lean on me.

1305
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,855
- Go on. Save yourself.
- Please, Mrs. O'Leary.

1306
01:43:45,923 --> 01:43:48,824
- Oh, it's you.
- Give me your arm.

1307
01:43:48,893 --> 01:43:50,884
- I will not.
- You'll be killed!

1308
01:43:50,962 --> 01:43:53,897
I'll not be owing
my life to you!

1309
01:43:53,965 --> 01:43:58,800
Hattie! Hattie!
Hattie!

1310
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:02,601
Come on.
Get up, please.

1311
01:44:02,673 --> 01:44:04,937
Please. Come on.
Come on.

1312
01:44:05,009 --> 01:44:08,604
- Go on and save yourself.
- I won't leave you. Hattie! Hattie!

1313
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:11,842
- You married him.
- Hattie!

1314
01:44:11,916 --> 01:44:14,885
I married him,
but it's all over now.

1315
01:44:14,952 --> 01:44:17,614
He only married me
to save the Patch.

1316
01:44:17,688 --> 01:44:21,283
You're lyin'. He loves you, and you turned
him against his own people.

1317
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:24,351
- He doesn't love me.
- But you love him.

1318
01:44:24,429 --> 01:44:26,795
<i>Hattie!</i>

1319
01:44:26,864 --> 01:44:29,765
Yes. Yes, I love him.

1320
01:44:32,103 --> 01:44:34,628
- Try, Mrs. O'Leary.
- I can't do it.

1321
01:44:34,705 --> 01:44:38,471
- Please.
- No, it's no use. I'm done for.

1322
01:44:40,678 --> 01:44:42,737
Please help me.

1323
01:44:42,814 --> 01:44:45,942
Please help me,
won't you?

1324
01:44:46,017 --> 01:44:48,110
Won't you, please?

1325
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:23,242
Dion, any
word of them?

1326
01:46:23,314 --> 01:46:27,580
No. No, I've been
all over the North Shore.

1327
01:46:27,652 --> 01:46:30,644
There's not
a trace of them.

1328
01:46:30,721 --> 01:46:34,020
You stay with Gretchen.
I'll look.

1329
01:46:34,091 --> 01:46:37,720
No. I'm gonna try
the South Shore.

1330
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:17,459
Mommy!

1331
01:47:19,637 --> 01:47:22,071
<i>Mommy.!</i>

1332
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:24,767
<i>Mommy.! Mommy.!</i>

1333
01:47:24,842 --> 01:47:26,833
<i>Mommy.!</i>

1334
01:47:51,836 --> 01:47:55,636
Ma. Ma!

1335
01:48:02,046 --> 01:48:04,976
Ma! Ma!

1336
01:48:05,049 --> 01:48:09,509
Heaven be praised!
It's Dion! Oh, Dion!

1337
01:48:09,587 --> 01:48:11,612
- Oh, Ma!
- Dion!

1338
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:14,954
- Oh, Ma!
- Oh, Dion, Dion!

1339
01:48:15,026 --> 01:48:17,654
- Ma!
- Are you hurt?

1340
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:21,630
Come on. Come on up
out of the wet.

1341
01:48:27,705 --> 01:48:30,333
- Oh, my child.
- Ma.

1342
01:48:30,408 --> 01:48:32,603
Where are the others?

1343
01:48:32,677 --> 01:48:35,908
Bob and Gretchen
and the baby are all right.

1344
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:38,471
And Jack?

1345
01:48:38,549 --> 01:48:40,608
Oh, Ma.

1346
01:48:40,685 --> 01:48:43,552
He's dead?

1347
01:48:43,621 --> 01:48:46,784
- Did you make it up with him?
- Yes.

1348
01:48:46,857 --> 01:48:49,951
Then I'll not be weepin'.

1349
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:52,621
It's the livin'
that need lookin' after.

1350
01:48:52,697 --> 01:48:55,791
Belle...

1351
01:48:55,866 --> 01:48:59,563
- Belle?
- What kind of a woman are you...

1352
01:48:59,637 --> 01:49:02,800
with that kind of a heart
and him your husband?

1353
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:15,681
It's gone, and
my boy's gone with it.

1354
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:18,779
But what he stood for
will never die.

1355
01:49:18,856 --> 01:49:21,848
It was a city of wood,
and now it's ashes.

1356
01:49:21,926 --> 01:49:24,588
But out of the fire
will be coming steel.

1357
01:49:24,662 --> 01:49:27,392
You didn't live
to see it, my lad...

1358
01:49:27,465 --> 01:49:30,559
no more than your
father did before you.

1359
01:49:30,634 --> 01:49:32,693
God rest the two of you.

1360
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:36,365
But there's Dion left,
and his children to come after.

1361
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:39,603
He'll have his dream, Ma.

1362
01:49:39,677 --> 01:49:43,078
Nothing can lick Chicago,
any more than it could lick him.

1363
01:49:43,147 --> 01:49:46,605
Aye. That's the truth.

1364
01:49:46,684 --> 01:49:49,949
We O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

1365
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:52,716
There's strength in us.

1366
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:57,193
And what we set out to do,
we finish.

1367
01:49:58,305 --> 01:50:58,500
