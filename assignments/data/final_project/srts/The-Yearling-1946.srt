1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:21,883
<i>Lake George, Florida. April, 1878.</i>

3
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,288
<i>I came across this lake once,
some years ago...</i>

4
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:29,864
<i>...in a boat that brought me home
after the war with the Yankees.</i>

5
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,627
<i>Came down this river,
going back into the wilderness...</i>

6
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:37,466
<i>...away from civilization,
looking for a place to settle...</i>

7
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:41,041
<i>...a place to live,
back into the scrub country.</i>

8
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,509
<i>It got wilder as I got deeper
into the woods.</i>

9
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,205
<i>I liked it. Vegetation was denser.</i>

10
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,682
<i>The trees had to struggle
for a breath of air.</i>

11
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,516
<i>Even wilder here, as I got back
closer to the sources...</i>

12
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:59,355
<i>...to the beginning of things,
further away from towns and wars.</i>

13
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:04,090
<i>And then I left the river,
went right into the woods themselves.</i>

14
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,564
<i>And here was the scrub country.</i>

15
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>Not many people lived here then,
just a few pioneers.</i>

16
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:14,973
<i>I found myself a wonderful wife
in a little village nearby.</i>

17
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,512
<i>Between us, out of this sea of trees,
we cleared and cultivated...</i>

18
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:25,086
<i>...a little piece of half-fertile
ground we call islands, like this one.</i>

19
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,054
<i>That was many years ago,
but we still live here.</i>

20
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,353
<i>We've had our hardships
and our happinesses.</i>

21
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:36,225
<i>This is our home.
It's called Baxter's Island.</i>

22
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:40,027
<i>That's my name, Penny Baxter.
Here's where we live:</i>

23
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:45,003
<i>Me, my wife, Ora,
and our little boy, Jody.</i>

24
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,939
Jody!

25
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,442
Jody!

26
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:39,949
Hey, coon. Them's mighty pretty
little fellas you got.

27
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:07,077
Jody!

28
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:15,187
You want Jody, Ma?

29
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:18,053
Where's that boy at?

30
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,525
I reckon he's around somewhere.

31
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:25,761
Most likely gallivanting somewhere
where it don't do nobody any good.

32
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,562
He's doing what's got to be done.

33
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:32,400
- I need some water!
- Well, we'll bring you some, Ma.

34
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,406
- When did you get back?
- Just got back now.

35
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,340
- Hello, Pa.
- Hello, Jody.

36
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:43,076
- Gets late mighty quick, Pa.
- That's April for you. Where you been?

37
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:46,346
To the glen.
I lay down and I was asleep.

38
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,545
Come, Caesar.

39
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,022
I aimed to follow some bees
and find the bee tree.

40
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:55,288
- You find it?
- I forget to look for it, till now.

41
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,331
Now tell the truth
and shame the devil.

42
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,799
Wasn't that bee tree an excuse
to go rambling?

43
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,199
I had a notion to go rambling.

44
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:09,743
That's what I figured. I was saving to
myself, There's Ma, busy in the house.

45
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,541
There's Jody hoeing
in the corn field all by himself.

46
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,081
The hoe gets heavier every minute.

47
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:20,187
I bet he's thinking,
"I ought to go rambling."

48
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,823
- That the way you figured?
- Yes, Pa.

49
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,084
Ma don't hold with rambling.

50
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:29,196
Most women can't see
how a man loves so to ramble.

51
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:33,266
I never let on you wasn't here.
I said, "He's around."

52
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:38,702
- Us men has got to stick together.
- Yes, Pa.

53
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,146
- Pa?
- Yes, boy?

54
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:50,581
I seen a sight today down at the glen.
A mammy coon with two babies.

55
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:55,382
- They was the prettiest little fellas.
- Coons is pretty.

56
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:58,424
Is it worth speaking to Ma about it?

57
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:03,725
They was so pretty, if I snare me one
for a pet, even Ma would love it.

58
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:06,265
Your ma ain't gonna love no coon.

59
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,131
Reckon she'd get mad
if I mentioned it?

60
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:10,737
What do you reckon?

61
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,273
- You two home at last?
- Yes, Ma!

62
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,672
I reckon she would.

63
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:20,976
But I wish I had me something
to pet and play with.

64
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:26,253
- You said men have to stick together.
- That's right, boy.

65
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:30,016
If you was to speak to Ma
about that little coon...

66
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:34,424
No, thank you.
I ain't aiming to die afore my time.

67
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,361
Get down to the sinkhole
and bring your ma some water.

68
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:39,933
Yes, Pa.

69
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,435
Hey, Ma! I like you, Ma!

70
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,977
You get mighty loving
when I got a dish in my hand.

71
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:57,278
That's when you're the prettiest.
That ain't sweet tater pone, is it?

72
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,080
- It is.
- It's sweet tater pone!

73
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,692
Pa, a big old buck watered down
at the glen today. I seen his...

74
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,797
When was you down at the glen?

75
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,132
Today, Ma.

76
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:17,067
So that's it.
And me calling and calling.

77
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,538
You getting slick as a clay road
in the rain.

78
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:25,043
- I fooled you! I got to fool you once!
- You fooled me.

79
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,911
- Evening, Ma.
- And you just as bad as the boy.

80
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:35,247
You both getting mighty sly.
Sit down afore the pone steams off.

81
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,255
Dear Lord, thanks again
for the vittles. Amen.

82
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,862
I declare,
that's a mighty skimpy blessing.

83
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,794
I get hungry when I go logging.
The Lord will know what I mean.

84
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,941
Ma? Ma, I seen a thing today.

85
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,911
Must I hear it or live in ignorance?

86
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,814
- It was only a big frog.
- A big frog?

87
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,581
A big frog!

88
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,420
Mighty interesting.

89
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:29,138
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night, boy.

90
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,478
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.

91
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,439
Pa?

92
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,513
- Pa!
- What is it, boy?

93
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:14,945
Does a coon always wash everything
before he eats it?

94
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,319
Does he, Pa?

95
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,655
That's right, boy. Now go to sleep.

96
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,394
If he washes everything
before he eats...

97
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:29,430
...he must be a pretty
clean animal, eh, Pa?

98
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:33,597
Coons is clean, now lie down, boy.

99
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,810
A coon knows how to take care
of himself, don't he?

100
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:42,114
Most animals take care of themselves.
Now get to bed!

101
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,219
- What's this talk about coons?
- Don't know.

102
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:48,519
Did I tell you I seen
a coon today, Pa?

103
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:52,421
Yes, you told me.
Now go to sleep, boy!

104
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,756
Did I tell you she had
a couple of babies?

105
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,399
Yes, you told me that too.

106
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:02,002
If Ma had seen them baby coons,
she'd love them.

107
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,699
We won't have no coons here.

108
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:09,571
What about a bear cub then?
If I should find myself one. Or a possum?

109
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,907
I'd love to have a baby fox
or a baby panther.

110
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:16,710
But I just gotta have me a pet.
We got milk aplenty.

111
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,878
You think we got milk aplenty?
There ain't an extra drop.

112
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,459
- It could have mine!
- You're spindly enough as it is.

113
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:31,859
How can we spare rations for critters?
We can barely keep our bellies full.

114
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:36,034
I just want something all my own.

115
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:41,301
Something to follow me and be mine.
Something with dependence to it.

116
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,240
Well, you'll not find that nowhere.

117
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:47,939
Not in the animal world
nor in the world of man.

118
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:52,387
Going on 12 and still wanting
some kind of a play dolly.

119
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,955
Pa was doing his man's share
of work at your age.

120
00:12:56,158 --> 00:13:00,151
Stop pestering and get to bed
afore I take a brush to you.

121
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,023
Yes'm.

122
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,195
Good night.

123
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,739
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night, son.

124
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,672
Seems like you get mighty hard
on the boy at times, Ora.

125
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,875
Let him tend to work.
Always running off...

126
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,418
...wanting to bring critters back.

127
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,216
Well, a boy ain't a boy too long.

128
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:35,625
Leave him kick up his heels a little.
Day will come, he won't even want to.

129
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:41,699
Ora, I've seen our boy stand agaze...

130
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,635
...and breathless at the wonderment
of bird and critter...

131
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,038
...wind, rain, the sun and the moon...

132
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:54,840
...just like I stood when I was a boy
in the forest.

133
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:04,153
Don't be afraid to love the boy, Ora.

134
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,426
I'll put up the stock.

135
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,341
What's the matter, Pa?

136
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,550
Your ma's gone down
to the burying ground, son.

137
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:08,120
Pa, a couple of old buck deer were
in our burying grounds today.

138
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,725
I seen their tracks.

139
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,089
Ora's and David's markers
were knocked down.

140
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:19,029
- Well, your ma wouldn't like that.
- I was obliged to right them.

141
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,101
One marker had something
written on it...

142
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,637
...but it's getting kind of dim.
I can't make it out.

143
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,709
That's Ezra Jr.
He never seen the light of day.

144
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,278
He died when he was born?

145
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,676
That's right, son.

146
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:39,778
- Ma never talks about them, does she?
- No.

147
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,589
Are they part of Ma's raring, Pa?

148
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,160
- You figured that out all by yourself?
- I was just wondering.

149
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,028
I'm proud you're looking
for the reason of things.

150
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:57,467
Figuring out what makes people rare
when they don't mean it.

151
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:01,541
- Your ma's a wonderful woman, Jody.
- Yes, Pa.

152
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,713
When we come here, years ago,
she was pretty...

153
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,848
...and full of the fun of life.

154
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,180
This place was a wilderness.
Your ma thought it were beautiful.

155
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,256
She pitched right in
and worked as hard as I did.

156
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,292
We made it a kind of game,
clearing this place we got.

157
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,897
The two of us together out here
in the wilderness.

158
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,624
A man couldn't have had a better wife.

159
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:32,372
Then when we lost the children,
one after the other.

160
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:40,676
It ain't easy for a woman to have
her young'uns taken away from her.

161
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:46,753
It does something to her. Makes
something inside her close up tight...

162
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:50,982
...so if it happens again,
she won't let it hurt her so much.

163
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,796
I was lucky, weren't I, Pa?

164
00:16:55,998 --> 00:17:00,458
I'm 11 years old.
I'm way past the age of dying.

165
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:07,340
What you two doing? Stop visiting.
It's time that boy got to sleep.

166
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,069
All right, Ma. He's going to sleep.

167
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,566
Pa!

168
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:39,369
Come look what's happened!

169
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,776
It's a calf and a shoat!
The door was broke!

170
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:48,740
- Take it easy, boy.
- But what happened, Pa? What done it?

171
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,885
Bear. A big one. Look there.

172
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,984
One toe's missing
on the right front paw. Old Slewfoot!

173
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,354
Old Slewfoot.

174
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:03,588
But none of the dogs bayed, Pa.

175
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,267
None. He had the wind in his favor.

176
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,197
He knew what he was doing.

177
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,065
We got to get him.
We obliged to get it.

178
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,798
I'm daresome to break the news to Ma.

179
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,807
What happened?
What you two doing?

180
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,470
What's the matter with you two?
I've been calling...

181
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,760
- Bear?
- It's Old Slewfoot, Ma!

182
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:40,799
Old Slewfoot. That dad-ratted,
no-account varmint!

183
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,836
Killing and not even eating
what he kills!

184
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,272
I hate that.
Last year it was our brood sow.

185
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,709
- Them dogs asleep right there!
- No dog's as smart as that bear.

186
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:58,785
- They could have barked!
- We got meat to eat for a while.

187
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,820
Meat now and none this winter.

188
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,318
- You aiming to get after that bear?
- I'll get after him now.

189
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,497
Can I go with you this time?
Can I, Pa?

190
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:14,567
- Hunting bears is man's work.
- I can do it! I know I can.

191
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,330
Don't ask for mercy
when it gets rough.

192
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,440
- Oh, no, Pa! No, Pa!
- You ain't taking him?

193
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,234
He's got to learn.

194
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:27,609
Jody, turn the new dog loose.
Ma, you get my gun and rations.

195
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,584
The wise scaper's changing
his direction...

196
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,454
...heading for the saw grass ponds.

197
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,395
If that's his notion, we can
slip around and surprise him.

198
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,467
- You sure can figure what it'll do.
- You belong to figure.

199
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,400
A critter's faster than us
and stronger.

200
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,699
But a man's got more sense.

201
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,675
He's a sorry hunter
if he can't outstudy him.

202
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:36,112
- Didn't Slewfoot kill a man once, Pa?
- So they say, boy.

203
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,554
Is your gun loaded, Pa?

204
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:58,536
I reckon we're getting Slewfoot
pretty tired out.

205
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:04,041
You won't feel so tired when Slewfoot
raise up in front of you.

206
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,952
Come on. Looks like that bear's
got himself a ticket to Jacksonville.

207
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,826
Pa? You'll not be scared
when we come up with him?

208
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,237
Not unless things go mighty wrong.
I don't reckon you'll be scared, son.

209
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,469
No, sir. No, Pa.

210
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,883
Pa, if I was to be scared,
must I climb a tree?

211
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:50,650
Yes. Even if you ain't scared, it's
a good place to watch the ruckus from.

212
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,254
Come on.
Don't go getting faintified on me.

213
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:59,912
I feared it, the thicket. They're
getting close. You best wait here.

214
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:03,057
No, Pa. I ain't scared.

215
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:06,022
Just keep behind me, then.

216
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:18,736
Easy, girl. Easy.

217
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,000
- You reckon he's in there, Pa?
- He's in there.

218
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,906
All right, Julie, get him!

219
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:32,949
- He's coming, Pa! He's coming!
- No, he ain't, boy! He's going!

220
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,203
- Perk! Here, Perk!
- Pa, the new dog's running away!

221
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,814
Now, Pa!

222
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:19,854
Pa, what's the matter?!

223
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,162
Look out, boy!

224
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,910
You hurt, Pa? You hurt?

225
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,416
- What happened?!
- Backfired.

226
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,120
Julie! Rip!

227
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,324
Rip! Here, Rip!

228
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,426
Rip! Here, Rip!

229
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,803
This confounded worthless gun!

230
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:16,580
It's Julie, Pa!

231
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:21,485
She'll be all right, boy.

232
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,091
We'll make a hammock out
of my coat and carry her.

233
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,624
There, Julie.

234
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:34,429
- Her breathing's still short.
- I reckon she's lost a mite of blood.

235
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:40,168
- Where you taking her?
- Jody's room.

236
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:45,176
I'll not pop in and out of bed
all night awaking you. Good night, Ma.

237
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,847
Good night.

238
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,715
She'll live, won't she, Pa?

239
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,687
I'm certain she will, son.

240
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,494
- I'm bedding her here.
- You best sleep with me, Pa.

241
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:06,463
- I'm figuring that, if you'll have me.
- I'll have you.

242
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:10,297
Now don't you go visiting all night.
Get to sleep!

243
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,166
Yes, Ma.

244
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:31,925
- What makes you so wakeful, son?
- I can't stop walking.

245
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:37,588
We went a fair piece.
How you like going after bear?

246
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,963
- Well, I like thinking about it.
- I know.

247
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,970
I like the tracking and seeing
the saplings broke down.

248
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:50,543
- But the fighting's right fearsome?
- It's mighty fearsome.

249
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:56,377
It's got to be. It's a hard law,
but it's the law. Kill or go hungry.

250
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:01,318
I was proud the way
you come along with me, son.

251
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,354
Thanks, Pa.

252
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,853
- You cold, son?
- I reckon, Pa.

253
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:11,862
Well, move over a mite.
I'll warm you.

254
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:36,150
It's get me a new gun
or court trouble.

255
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,825
How? Where's the money coming from?

256
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,394
I'm aiming to trade
that new dog of ours for one.

257
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:46,863
- You said he were no-account.
- He ain't much good on a bear hunt.

258
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:50,697
But you know them Forresters
is fools for dogs.

259
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:55,399
Trading with them, you'd do good
to still have your britches.

260
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,013
They're a reckless, black-hearted lot.
Lower than a doodlebug!

261
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,618
- Fodderwing ain't! He's my friend.
- A fine friend, crazy as a loon!

262
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,811
He ain't crazy, Ma.
He's just different.

263
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:13,983
Anyway, that's where we're heading.
Get that worthless dog untied, Jody.

264
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,659
Will you want to tote lunch?

265
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:22,303
Why, I'd not insult
my neighbors that way.

266
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,817
- What you thinking, son?
- I ain't thinking.

267
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:48,257
Just feeling the sun, listening
to the birds and looking around?

268
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,488
That's what I'm doing, Pa.

269
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:54,361
That's right.
You glad you're gonna see Fodderwing?

270
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:56,469
I like Fodderwing.

271
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:00,630
He can't do no harm if you don't
take his talk seriously.

272
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:06,007
Fodderwing wouldn't do nobody no harm.
He ain't crazy like Ma says at all.

273
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:11,311
He ain't to blame for hatching out
peculiar. He was the second setting.

274
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:15,780
We're there. I can see smoke
coming out of the chimney.

275
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:22,819
Here, Perk! Here, Perk!
Come on, boy. Come.

276
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:28,699
- Is he hurt?
- Nope.

277
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:35,399
- Then why are we toting him?
- I don't want nothing to happen to him.

278
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:57,559
Well, boy, it sounds like we're here.

279
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:07,400
- You got no cause to say it was Bella!
- It was Bella.

280
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:11,136
- Don't go saving it was Bella!
- I seen him myself!

281
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,213
- It wasn't Bella!
- Or either Major or Sophy.

282
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:16,474
Say it's Sophy, I'll bust you!

283
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:21,314
Shut up! You're worse than the dogs!
I'll flail all of you myself!

284
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,786
You hear what your pa said?
Shut your mouth!

285
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,929
Look out, Ma, you'll hurt somebody
one of these days.

286
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,859
Why, look there!

287
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:34,557
- Is it safe for a guy to get down?
- It's Penny Baxter!

288
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:38,170
- Get off that horse!
- What's wrong with your dog?

289
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,503
- Fodderwing will be glad to see you!
- Get off that horse.

290
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,769
Bring your horse right in.

291
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:48,415
- How's your woman, Penny?
- Ain't complaining none.

292
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,072
- Penny!
- Buck.

293
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:52,844
- How's your corn coming?
- Corn's good.

294
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,887
There's no corn-raiser
like Penny Baxter.

295
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,287
You scapers don't know
what farming is!

296
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:02,122
Ma's against the whole lot of us.

297
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:25,885
- Got me a new baby coon.
- A coon? Let's go see him.

298
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,215
My eagle died. He was too wild to pen.

299
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,655
- Won't catch nothing with wings again.
- Why?

300
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,127
If you had wings, what would you do?
You'd fly with them, wouldn't you?

301
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,791
- You'd never come down, would you?
- I reckon not.

302
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:45,268
Nothing with wings
should ever come down again.

303
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:48,067
You never did try to fly again,
did you?

304
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,802
I tried to fly too young.

305
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,785
That's Push. You remember him.

306
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:02,012
Hey, Push.

307
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:08,184
They won't raise no young'uns.
Lem says they's brothers.

308
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,128
Here's the coon.

309
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,329
Here, Racket.

310
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:21,437
Ain't he a thing?

311
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,975
If I get me another one,
you can have one too.

312
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,377
I'd be proud to have one,
but Ma won't let me keep nothing.

313
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:33,111
Oliver said he'd bring a monkey
from the South Seas...

314
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:36,779
...but Ma said she had enough monkeys
around as it is.

315
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,051
She meant Pa and me.

316
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,653
- Where is Oliver now?
- Sailing somewhere on the sea.

317
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:48,666
I'd never go to sea.
They ain't got no animals on the sea.

318
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,535
I might go to sea some day
if I could go with Oliver.

319
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:55,675
Oliver's my friend.

320
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:57,708
I got three friends:

321
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,608
Oliver and Pa and you.

322
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,947
I got lots of friends.

323
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,952
He's eating me!

324
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:09,817
He ain't hungry,
he just wants to be doing something.

325
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,515
- He likes you, Jody.
- I guess so.

326
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,059
He sleeps with me.

327
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:17,830
I sleep up there now.

328
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,158
Buck made it for me.

329
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,704
If you can stay the night,
you can sleep up there with me.

330
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,310
You like to sleep up there?

331
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,709
You see things at night
and hear things.

332
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,076
What?

333
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,844
All the things scared of the daytime.

334
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,887
I seen a deer and a wolf
playing together.

335
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,890
You couldn't have seen that.
They's enemies.

336
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,061
That's what folks tell you.

337
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:52,130
And I seen the Spaniards
riding on big black horses.

338
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:56,827
They's tall and dark
and have shiny helmets.

339
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:02,165
There ain't no Spaniards left.
They all gone, like the Indians.

340
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,773
They's here.

341
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,642
Listen to me. The next time
you go to your sinkhole...

342
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,251
...you know that magnolia
with the dogwood around it?

343
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,182
Just you look behind it.

344
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:17,824
There's always a Spaniard
on a big black horse...

345
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:21,017
...riding past that magnolia.

346
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,001
Guess we'd better go in.

347
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,334
Well, Jody and me set out
after them dogs.

348
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:39,104
That bear took them
across the scrub...

349
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:42,180
...along the ponds,
through the thicket...

350
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:46,149
...right to Juniper Creek,
where they caught up with him.

351
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:50,051
- Tarnation! I wish I'd been there.
- Get on with it!

352
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:53,352
- This dog go with them?
- Yes, he went along.

353
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,461
Do he hold the bear at bay?

354
00:36:55,663 --> 00:37:00,259
No, he's sorry. The sorriest bear-dog
I ever owned or followed.

355
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:03,431
- Got himself lame?
- No, he ain't lame.

356
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,198
What you holding him so careful for?

357
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:09,399
Keep him out of the jaws
of them bloodhounds.

358
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,839
- Valuable?
- Shut up, Lem!

359
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,274
Go on, Penny!

360
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,350
There he was, at the edge of Juniper
Creek, raring up on his hindlegs.

361
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,749
Before I shoot,
Julie gets him by the throat.

362
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:26,189
He pushes her off, and I get a chance
to shoot... and what happens?

363
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:28,589
- What did happen?
- Go on!

364
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:30,229
My gun won't shoot.

365
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:33,594
Tried it again and again,
but she won't shoot.

366
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:38,864
Julie's getting killed, Rip's getting
slashed, this dog's no good...

367
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:42,065
...my shotgun's no good,
and I'm in a pure fix.

368
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,613
- Quit that stopping all the time.
- Go on.

369
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:51,877
Well, just as I try the gun for
the last time, she hang fires on me.

370
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:56,547
Knocks me down. That makes
Slewfoot decide he's had enough.

371
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:59,749
He swims to the other side
of the creek...

372
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:03,920
...and the last we seen,
he's heading for no-man-knows-where.

373
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,998
I'd give a gallon of whiskey
to been there.

374
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,864
"Heading for no-man-knows-where"
is right!

375
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:15,771
- That Slewfoot is something!
- You're a liar, Penny Baxter.

376
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:19,378
No man ever said that of me afore.

377
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,882
Just two dogs don't make a bear run.
How come you never mentioned this dog?

378
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:29,455
Now don't press me, Lem.
I done told you, the dog is worthless.

379
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:33,525
He come out in good shape.
Not a mark on him, is there?

380
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,889
No, there's nary a mark on him.

381
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,760
Takes a clever dog to fight a bear
and get no scratch.

382
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,196
He's no good.

383
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,202
I wouldn't want you to get
no idea of trading for him.

384
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,705
- You'd get fooled and cheated.
- Simmer down, Lem!

385
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,970
If Penny don't wanna trade,
there's nothing say he got to.

386
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:09,057
Where's your manners, Lem?
Drinking all that jug.

387
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,496
Where's yours? Not giving company
a chance to wet their whistles?

388
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:17,395
Pa, you got the most sense
for such an old buzzard.

389
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:19,732
Don't take sense to crave liquor.

390
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:22,068
- Give it here.
- All right.

391
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,774
Pour me a noggin in the cup
and you can all sit down.

392
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:31,350
If I'd known you was coming,
I'd have cooked something fitting.

393
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,079
This looks fine enough
for the governor.

394
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:37,247
I reckon you folks give thanks, Penny.

395
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,054
Pa, it won't hurt you none
to ask blessing once in your life.

396
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,528
Oh, Lord...

397
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,296
Oh, Lord...

398
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,095
...we...

399
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,102
We...

400
00:39:56,544 --> 00:40:00,173
Oh, Lord, thou hast seen fit...

401
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:04,579
...to bless our sinning souls and...

402
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,616
And bellies with...

403
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,913
With...

404
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,646
With...

405
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:13,088
- With...
- Good vittles again. Amen.

406
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:15,990
- Thanks, Penny.
- Amen.

407
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,384
I want two things, Penny. I wanna
be in at the death of Slewfoot...

408
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,852
...and I want that dog.
- Mind what you do, Lem.

409
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,685
When I want a thing, I get it.

410
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:50,793
From England. No muzzleloading,
fill your own shells, easy as spitting.

411
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:55,095
Stick your shells in,
breech her, cock her...

412
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,702
...and you're ready for anything.

413
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,505
Shoots as true as the eagle flies.

414
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:06,443
Now take the gun for him,
or by thunder, I'll...

415
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,944
Well, I don't figure to get myself
murdered in the tracks...

416
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:14,110
...if that's the way it stands, Lem.

417
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:21,453
You gotta promise not to beat me
after you hunted him.

418
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,753
Shake.

419
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:47,978
You scapers got enough covers
up there?

420
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:51,117
- Yes, Ma.
- Yes'm.

421
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,758
- Good night.
- Night.

422
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,951
- Night, Ma.
- Night.

423
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,027
And then what happened?

424
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,567
It were a sunny day,
like this one we just had.

425
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,434
- You went to the roof?
- I went to the edge of the roof.

426
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:12,170
- And then you jumped?
- I jumped way out in the air.

427
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,211
What'd it feel like?

428
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:18,943
When I was jumping, it felt just
like I were flying for a minute...

429
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:22,987
...just like a bird.
And then it went kind of dark.

430
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:27,123
It were dark for quite a time.

431
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:31,788
- Was you bad hurted?
- I reckon.

432
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,924
It should've worked.

433
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:38,595
I were too young. Someday, I'll fly.

434
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:44,335
I'll just fly on and on.
It'll be easier than walking.

435
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:47,912
Walking ain't easy for me
since I tried to fly.

436
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:51,209
I guess near about everything
would like to fly.

437
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,947
Birds fly. Birds and angels.

438
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:59,617
Do you know what the end
of the world's like?

439
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:00,885
What?

440
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:06,465
It's empty and dark
and only clouds to ride on.

441
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,966
But the clouds is sunny and soft.

442
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,401
You just float on them
and go nowheres.

443
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:17,475
And all the animals
has little bright clouds to ride on.

444
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,409
Racket'll have a little one,
just alongside of mine.

445
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:25,949
And do you know what?
Sometimes, as you're drifting along...

446
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:28,951
...you drift right inside
another cloud.

447
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:32,490
You'll be on that one,
and we'll lie there and talk.

448
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,790
Just like we're talking now.
And you know what, Jody?

449
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,396
What?

450
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:41,864
The clouds are really
just the backs of angels...

451
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:45,664
...who are flying around up there
looking after things.

452
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,072
They'll look after you too, Jody,
until you're ready to fly.

453
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:54,770
How do you know that?

454
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,981
I just know.

455
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,020
Could be.

456
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,323
Yeah.

457
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,392
Could be.

458
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:15,634
Pa! Pa! Pa!
I can see him, Pa. I can see him.

459
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:20,463
An old Spaniard riding along.
Fodderwing said I could spy him here.

460
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:22,498
That's nice.

461
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:25,543
- What'd he say he seen?
- A Spaniard.

462
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:27,806
What Spaniard?

463
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,280
I don't know.

464
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:39,425
There, now. I was scared this
wouldn't stand another washing.

465
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:44,791
- What else you got that's cool to wear?
- Nothing, excusing my wedding dress.

466
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:49,628
- That black alpaca's nice.
- That went to pieces three years ago.

467
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:53,204
It went to pure rags,
doing work just like this.

468
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,703
Toting washing to a sinkhole
half a mile from the house...

469
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:00,870
...toting water to wash and cook in.

470
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:05,275
You'll get your well one day,
right outside your door.

471
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,443
I'll believe it when I see it.

472
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,785
After all these years of waiting,
I'll take no stock in it.

473
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:23,169
Ora, I think me and Jody'll
make us a trip to Volusia.

474
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:28,833
Yeah. I got some trading I wanna do.

475
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,413
Ain't it exciting just to see it, Pa?

476
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:42,453
Yes, once in a while,
it's a pleasure to see a town.

477
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,715
Get along, Caesar.

478
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:48,223
It'll be nice seeing
your sweetheart, won't it?

479
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,522
You know I got no sweetheart.

480
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:55,361
You ain't going back on Eulalie
after you held hands last Christmas?

481
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:59,027
I wasn't holding hands.
It's a game they was playing.

482
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,175
If you say that again, Pa,
I'll just die.

483
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:05,868
All right.
Just wanted to get it straight.

484
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:10,983
Hello there, Mr. Ranger.

485
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:14,848
Hello, Mr. Ranger.

486
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,149
- Who's there?
- Customers.

487
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,220
Hi there, Penny Baxter. Hiya, Jody.

488
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,727
Hello, Mr. Ranger.

489
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,736
I was just getting set to noon.

490
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:34,635
You stay right where you are.
Sorry we woke you up.

491
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:40,303
It ain't nothing.
I can catch up with it later.

492
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:53,285
Well, look there who's in town.

493
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:58,354
Hiya, fellas. How'd that
there dog I swapped you come out?

494
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,296
- Say that again.
- How's the sorry dog I traded you?

495
00:47:02,503 --> 00:47:05,961
- We ain't laughing about it.
- You ain't mad, Buck?

496
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:09,074
I ain't saving.
You keep out of Lem's way.

497
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:10,743
Lem in town with you?

498
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:13,572
Yes, but he's courting
Twink Weatherby.

499
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,179
She's Oliver's girl.

500
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:19,079
Just don't let Lem
hear you say that, young'un.

501
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:26,684
I'm sorry Lem feels that way
about the trade.

502
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:29,260
You just told him the truth.

503
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,592
My words was straight...

504
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:35,700
...but my intentions was as crooked
as the Ocklawaha River.

505
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:40,334
The steamboat captain's
been asking about you.

506
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:45,171
Says these city folks traveling
the river's hollering for venison.

507
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:50,339
- What's next?
- Two boxes, 12-gauge brass shell cases.

508
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,782
Two boxes, 12-gauge brass shell cases.

509
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:58,356
Just hollering for it, he says,
and it ain't half as good as pork.

510
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,620
- You and me, we know it. What's next?
- One pain curer.

511
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:06,196
One pain curer.

512
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:12,301
Yes, sir, as I says to my nephew,
"Oliver, you're just as well..."

513
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:15,703
- Oliver in town?
- Oliver! Oliver back?

514
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:20,539
- Where'd he go to this long time?
- He says he traveled the seven seas.

515
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:24,844
You reckon he saw whales this time?
Where is Oliver?

516
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:28,715
The sailor? He's out with his gal,
Twink Weatherby.

517
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:31,413
But Millwheel said she's Lem's girl.

518
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,492
Don't you bother your head about that.

519
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:37,391
That completes it. You figure that up.

520
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:43,093
With the cash left over, I'll buy some
tobacco seed for the spring money crop.

521
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:48,798
With that money, I'll buy brick and
mortar for a well outside our door.

522
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:53,242
- What do you think, Mr. Boyles?
- That'll be fine for Mrs. Baxter.

523
00:48:55,983 --> 00:48:59,976
- What's this stuff? Black alpaca?
- Yeah, that's what it is.

524
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:02,018
That's what I thought.

525
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:06,124
I think I sold Mrs. Baxter
a dress length of that alpaca...

526
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:08,920
...about four or five summers back.

527
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,529
That's pretty.

528
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,733
Young man, you don't come in
to trade very often...

529
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:25,640
...so I'll treat you to a dime's worth
of anything you've a notion for.

530
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:33,010
I reckon that mouth organ's
worth more than a dime.

531
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,657
Well, yes,
but it's been here a long while.

532
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:42,385
Take it and welcome.

533
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:47,090
- Well, now. That's unusual kind.
- Thank you, sir.

534
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,270
- There's your gal now, Jody.
- Pa.

535
00:49:56,476 --> 00:50:00,242
It's Eulalie.
Come out special just to see you.

536
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:05,380
- Pa.
- Now go say "How do" to her. Go on.

537
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:16,354
- Your boy's got manners, Mr. Baxter.
- He's right smart of a comfort.

538
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:44,620
- He hit me with a potato!
- Jody, you put that down.

539
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:49,860
What's got into you?
How come you shame me like that?

540
00:50:50,063 --> 00:50:53,032
Now you go up and excuse yourself.

541
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:00,729
Jody!

542
00:51:16,923 --> 00:51:21,019
Right smart lot of spunk
your boy's got, Mr. Baxter.

543
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:25,460
Thank you, Mr. Boyles.
We'll be back later for our things.

544
00:51:28,135 --> 00:51:33,402
Quick! They're killing Oliver. He's
fighting Lem and all the Forresters.

545
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:37,634
They're killing him.
Is Twink Lem's or Oliver's girl?

546
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,312
- They can't decide.
- Who do we fight for?

547
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:45,952
- Whoever's taking a licking: Oliver.
- But the Forresters are friends too.

548
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,681
- Who's judging this fight?
- We are!

549
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,621
If it takes three men to whip one,
the one man's the best.

550
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,851
Hello, Oliver. Welcome home.

551
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:57,293
Oliver!

552
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:00,955
Am I glad to see you,
you old landlubber, you.

553
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:05,002
I brought you a gift from China.
I saw a lot of whales too.

554
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,902
I'll smash you like a skeeter
if you get in my way.

555
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:11,577
We'd have fought him one at a time.

556
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:14,747
I'll fight any man saving
that about my gal.

557
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:17,314
And I'll say it again.

558
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:19,809
Keep off him!

559
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:26,788
I ain't seen a fight
this good for months.

560
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,727
- Reckon I'll get in it too. Coming?
- Might as well.

561
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,836
Hit him again!

562
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,974
Jody! Get out of this!

563
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:53,315
Get off, you little...!

564
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,170
I'm back, Ma.

565
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:33,718
What happened to you?

566
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:37,029
- We got in a fight.
- Who did?

567
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,360
Me, Pa, the Forresters and Oliver.
They was beating him bad.

568
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:44,059
They couldn't decide
if Oliver's girl...

569
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:47,069
Now, ain't that just fine!

570
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,943
Where's your pa?

571
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:00,309
I'm here.

572
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:03,756
Well, ain't that just fine!

573
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:29,206
Now, did I make a good trade?
That makes near $5.00 we got saved.

574
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,977
You know what that money's going for?
Tobacco seed.

575
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,781
Enough seed to have
a fine money crop next spring.

576
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:41,017
The money we get from that
is going into bricks and mortar...

577
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:45,927
...so's you can have your new well,
right outside your door.

578
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,429
Well, I declare.

579
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,467
I just can't imagine it.

580
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:55,539
Washing right on my own place!

581
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:59,303
Having all the water
I need right here.

582
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:03,380
Not even caring if some
slops over now and then.

583
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:07,647
Being able to waste a whole bucket
of nice cold water...

584
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:10,654
...just to cool myself with.

585
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:15,792
I declare it'll be such a blessing,
it won't seem natural.

586
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:38,112
I bet you ain't bought half my order.

587
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,549
I never knowed a man vet
who could be trusted to...

588
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,656
Where's my paregoric? Where's my...?

589
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:57,797
That's just like a man!
Throwing away money on such as this.

590
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:01,701
Men got no more sense than...
How much did this cost?

591
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:05,207
Tell me how much you wasted
on such foolishness.

592
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:09,781
The next time you go to Volusia,
I'll... How much was this?

593
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:18,548
She's raring, Pa. Don't she like it?

594
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:21,592
She likes it, boy.

595
00:56:36,076 --> 00:56:37,407
Giddap.

596
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:48,353
Fodderwing claims
he can talk to vultures.

597
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,853
They wouldn't have much
I'd wanna hear.

598
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:55,426
Maybe if you was to tame one,
it might make a pretty nice pet.

599
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:02,000
Whoa, Caesar. Whoa.

600
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:05,399
Well, Ma, been admiring
our fine crop of corn?

601
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:09,564
I ain't admiring nothing.
Know why the hogs didn't come in?

602
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:11,869
- Why?
- They was stole.

603
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:17,094
- Stole?
- They was baited. Look here.

604
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:22,034
I was by the sinkhole. I seen
this corn and hog tracks beside it.

605
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,106
- They come and took them.
- Who have, Ma?

606
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:29,178
That ain't hard to guess.
Them fine friends of yours.

607
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,508
- The Forresters?
- Them black-hearted, thieving...

608
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,082
Jody, fetch me my gun.

609
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,564
Look, Pa!

610
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:02,774
So that's what they done.
They trapped them.

611
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:14,618
They had a cart, Pa.

612
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,262
And that track leads plain as anything
right to the Forresters.

613
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:28,365
Dogged if I can understand
cold out meanness.

614
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,405
Well, boy, we're obliged to follow.

615
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:37,673
Lem said he'd shoot if we come around.
I'd rather let them keep the hogs.

616
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,315
And go without meat?

617
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:45,250
How will we live if we don't protect
our rations? You wanna beg off going?

618
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:53,195
- I reckon not. I reckon to go with you.
- All right then.

619
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:57,458
There's trouble waiting,
you just as good go to meet it.

620
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:04,605
- Pa!
- Get back! Watch the dogs!

621
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,078
Pa!

622
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,282
He got me, boy.

623
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:14,314
He was a big one.

624
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,948
Get the gun.

625
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:31,892
Pa, it's a doe.

626
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:35,435
Do as I say.
Use your knife to open up her belly.

627
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,040
What am I to do?

628
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:48,014
Cut out the liver and heart.
Maybe we got a chance this way. Hurry.

629
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,892
Hurry, boy!

630
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,000
- You'll bleed to death.
- I'd rather that than swell.

631
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,571
I seen a man die. I can feel it draw.

632
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:11,501
Do it hurt, Pa?

633
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,610
Like a hot knife.
Give me the heart, boy.

634
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:25,017
- The doe's got a fawn.
- Sorry, boy, I can't help it.

635
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:31,758
Listen, I got to make for home.
You get on to the Forresters.

636
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,691
Have them get Doc Wilson.

637
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,992
- It's my only chance. Can you do it?
- I can.

638
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:40,967
- Save I'm snake-bit afore they shoot.
- I can do it.

639
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,798
Keep out of Lem's way.

640
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:48,707
Have one of them pick me up in case
I can't make it. And hurry, boy!

641
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:54,111
You'll make it! You hear me?
You're obliged to make it.

642
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:08,860
Fodderwing!

643
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,795
Fodderwing!

644
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,368
- Fodderwing!
- What do you want? You little varmint.

645
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,131
- Pa's snake-bit.
- What kind of snake?

646
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,707
- A big rattler.
- Where'd it get him?

647
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,707
- In the arm.
- Is he swelling?

648
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,539
It's bad swelled already.

649
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:28,208
Please ride for Doc Wilson.
Please ride for him, quick. Please!

650
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:31,445
- I'll ride for him.
- I thank you, Millwheel.

651
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:33,885
I'd help a dog was snake-bit.

652
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:38,187
I'll pick up Penny.
Walking's bad for a man is snake-bit.

653
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:27,467
Pa! Oh, Pa!

654
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:31,848
Old Death's got to wait a while on me.

655
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,418
Doc. Hey, doc.

656
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,611
- What?
- Look at Pa.

657
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:47,124
Lord of the jaybirds, he made it.

658
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:51,066
- He's dead!
- Not by a long shot.

659
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:53,465
He's pulled through.

660
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:57,133
You sound like you're sorry.

661
01:02:57,341 --> 01:03:02,802
- I could sleep for a week.
- That's just what I want you to do.

662
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:07,883
He ain't pretty,
but by thunder, he's alive.

663
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:10,280
I woke up fixing to bury him.

664
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:14,548
- How he done it without whiskey?
- How come you be out of it?

665
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:18,023
I was finishing my last jug
when you rode up.

666
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:23,029
How was I to know somebody was
to get snake-bit? Thank you, ma'am.

667
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,224
Jody, you finished?

668
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:30,429
Take this warm milk into your pa.
And mind you don't spill none of it.

669
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:36,369
Now did I have me a real good snort,
I'd be pretty nigh satisfied.

670
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:47,886
It were a near thing, Pa.

671
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,924
- You all right now, though.
- That's right.

672
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:55,224
I'm proud, the way you kept your head
and done what was needed.

673
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,461
What's the matter, boy?

674
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,901
- Pa, you recollect that doe you shot?
- Can't never forget her.

675
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,700
Most likely she saved your life?

676
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,400
She saved me, that's certain.

677
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:12,912
Pa, you recollect
that little fawn she had?

678
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:14,975
Yes, boy.

679
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:19,213
Most likely it's mighty scared
and lonesome and hungry.

680
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:20,788
I reckon so.

681
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,518
It might be out there,
not knowing which way to go.

682
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:26,253
Might be.

683
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,090
It won't take much to raise it.

684
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:32,359
It'll soon make out
on leaves and acorns.

685
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:36,336
You figure the farthest
of any young'un I ever knowed.

686
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,737
We've taken its mammy
and it weren't to blame.

687
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:43,038
It don't seem grateful
to let it starve, do it?

688
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:47,240
Pa, you figure I could go out
and see could I find him?

689
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:51,114
- And tote it here?
- Tote it here and raise it.

690
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,447
Pa?

691
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:59,227
Boy, you've got me hemmed in.

692
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:03,832
You tell your ma I said
you was to go and get it.

693
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:07,362
Hey, Pa!

694
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:31,661
Hey, doves!

695
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,448
It's me.

696
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,856
It's me...

697
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,528
...Jody!

698
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,225
Well...

699
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,336
I'm proud you found him.

700
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,134
He weren't scared of me.

701
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:03,109
He was laving right where
his mammy made his bed.

702
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,773
Look, Ma! I found him.

703
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,375
So I see.

704
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,818
It'll take milk for a long while.

705
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:19,325
I don't know as I'd have consented
if I'd knowed it was so young.

706
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,626
He ain't so young.

707
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,891
Is he, Pa?

708
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:34,734
Ora...

709
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:39,678
...I got one thing to say,
then I'll have no more talk about it.

710
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:44,445
The little fawn's as welcome
in this house as Jody. It's hissen.

711
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:48,590
And we'll raise it without grudgement
of milk or meal.

712
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:53,092
You've got me to answer to,
I ever hear you quarreling about it.

713
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:57,700
This is Jody's fawn
just like Julie's my dog.

714
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,668
I only said it was young.

715
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,299
All right, so it is.

716
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,977
Now, don't you bother
about him at all.

717
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,312
I'll tend to everything
that needs tending to.

718
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,387
He won't be a mite of trouble to you.

719
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,035
I fooled you.

720
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:13,763
Hey! Wait for me.

721
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,342
Come on!

722
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:20,871
Come on!

723
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,185
Come on, I'll race you.

724
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:46,853
Hey, Ma!
You wanna see him butt?

725
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:48,585
Look it, Ma!

726
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:52,458
- Did you see him, Ma?
- I seen him.

727
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:58,630
Look at him thisaway, Ma.
Ain't his eves pretty?

728
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:01,906
They can see mischief too far.

729
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:06,547
- Ain't he got a cute, foolish tail?
- All deer's tails look the same.

730
01:13:06,714 --> 01:13:10,241
- You wanna pet him? You can.
- I ain't petting no fawns.

731
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,684
I gotta get a name for him.

732
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:19,053
I've studied and I can't think of one
good enough for him.

733
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:22,862
You think more of that fawn
than of your pa.

734
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,025
Oh, Pa!

735
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:30,535
But I just got to.
I gotta get something special.

736
01:13:30,705 --> 01:13:35,142
- Why don't you call him Rover?
- Ma! Rover's a dog's name.

737
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,705
Well, call him Joe, then.

738
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:42,409
Ma! Joe Baxter
sounds like a man.

739
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,144
He's gotta get him a special name.

740
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:49,854
- You know who'd get me a good name?
- Who's that?

741
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:52,458
- Fodderwing.
- Fodderwing's ailing.

742
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:57,427
But he'd just love to see my little
fawn. And he gets wonderful names.

743
01:13:57,932 --> 01:14:02,426
He'll get you a name.
He's got an ear for such things.

744
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:05,698
Can I, Ma? Can I?

745
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:09,503
All I know is, my voice
don't mean nothing around here.

746
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:10,905
Ma!

747
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:17,707
Jody!

748
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:21,444
What?

749
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:24,921
You gotta quit sleeping
with that fawn.

750
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,795
Just don't you be impatient now.

751
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,565
You think you're baggily...

752
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:41,505
...because you can get into bed
without having to undress.

753
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:44,707
Get over.

754
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:50,079
I wanna explain something to you.

755
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:54,551
Pretty soon, we'll go see Fodderwing,
he'll give you a name.

756
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,280
You'll like Fodderwing.

757
01:14:56,491 --> 01:15:00,393
I want you to behave real mannerly,
so as he'll take to you.

758
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:02,756
You and me and...

759
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,136
You hear that?
That's a wolf.

760
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:13,239
You ever hear a noise like that,
you get in the house quick.

761
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,842
You hear any noises
that is animals...

762
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,537
...you start running and bleating
so as I'll hear you.

763
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:22,745
You listening to me?

764
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:37,757
I don't know what ails Ma.

765
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:42,699
You smell just fine.

766
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:58,641
Come on.

767
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:04,349
This here's where Fodderwing lives.
Stand still.

768
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:08,290
You gotta look nice if you want him
to put a name to you.

769
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:13,696
Fodderwing always shows me his pets.
Now I've got something to show him.

770
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,391
Come on!

771
01:16:22,176 --> 01:16:24,007
Fodderwing.

772
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:30,179
Maybe they's all asleep.

773
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:35,118
Fodderwing! It's Jody!
I got me something.

774
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:40,059
Come to see Fodderwing.
Come to show him my fawn.

775
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:43,557
I come special!

776
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:47,396
He's dead!

777
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:57,302
- But I come to see him.
- You come too late.

778
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,447
I'd have fetched you
if there'd been time.

779
01:17:00,648 --> 01:17:03,515
There wasn't time enough
to fetch old doc.

780
01:17:03,718 --> 01:17:08,451
One minute he was breathing,
and the next minute, he just wasn't.

781
01:17:08,656 --> 01:17:11,250
Like as if you'd blowed out a candle.

782
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:17,330
You can come look at him.

783
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:56,699
I lost my boy.

784
01:17:56,871 --> 01:18:00,136
My poor crookedy boy.

785
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,977
He'll not hear, but speak to him.

786
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:23,519
Hey.

787
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,274
I knowed you'd hate it fearful.

788
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:41,579
I wished he could've seen your fawn.

789
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:46,486
I told him about it.
He talked a lot about it.

790
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:50,484
He said, "Jody's got him a brother."

791
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:56,288
That's how come we to be here.
I come for Fodderwing to name him.

792
01:18:56,497 --> 01:19:01,696
He did name him. He said,
"A fawn has a little white flag.

793
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,872
His tail is a little white flag.

794
01:19:05,072 --> 01:19:08,564
If I had a fawn, I'd name him Flag."

795
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:12,769
He said, "Flag the fawn
is what I'd call him."

796
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:19,242
Flag.

797
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:24,456
Flag the fawn.

798
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:51,383
Penny, you've had a Christian raising.

799
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,316
We'd be proud, did you say something.

800
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:04,362
Oh, Lord, almighty God...

801
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,931
...it ain't for us ignorant mortals
to say what's right and what's wrong.

802
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,268
Was any one of us to be doing it...

803
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:18,037
...we'd not have made this poor boy
into a cripple.

804
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:23,778
But, Lord, in a way of speaking,
you made it up to him.

805
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,818
You give him a way
with the wild critters.

806
01:20:27,021 --> 01:20:31,651
You give him a sort of wisdom.
Made him knowing and gentle.

807
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,594
And now you've seen fit
to take him...

808
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:40,665
...where being crookedly
in mind or limb don't matter.

809
01:20:40,868 --> 01:20:47,239
But, Lord, it pleasures us to think now
you've straightened out them legs.

810
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:52,141
It pleasures us to think on him
walking around as easy as anyone.

811
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:57,210
And Lord, give him a few redbirds...

812
01:20:57,418 --> 01:21:02,378
...and maybe a squirrel or a coon
to keep him company, like he had here.

813
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:05,354
All of us is somehow lonesome...

814
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:11,020
...and we know he'll not be lonesome,
do he have wild things around him.

815
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:16,295
If it ain't asking too much,
put a few varmints in heaven.

816
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:19,805
Thy will be done.

817
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:21,868
Amen.

818
01:22:30,077 --> 01:22:32,170
What's all this?

819
01:22:33,414 --> 01:22:38,010
- You can't leave them in this storm.
- They'd get blowed off the place.

820
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,813
You keep them out of my way.

821
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:54,498
Why didn't you let in the cow and
Caesar and have everything to suit you?

822
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:56,966
Maybe we could let in Old Slewfoot.

823
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,934
Pa, when we gonna hunt
Old Slewfoot again?

824
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:02,336
Jody, you're wet to the skin.

825
01:23:02,843 --> 01:23:06,244
I got to dry Flag.
Look how good he shines up.

826
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,915
Get out of them wet clothes.

827
01:23:11,218 --> 01:23:15,780
Ain't it nice hearing the wind and
rain, and us in here safe and cozy?

828
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,014
That's right, son.

829
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:22,093
Maybe we can tell a few tales tonight.
How'd you like that?

830
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,232
- Hey, Pa.
- Maybe your ma'll tell us a tale.

831
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:27,367
- Eh, Ma?
- I might.

832
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,659
Hey, Ma!

833
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:42,546
Well, Uncle Miles looked at them
two bear cubs and he says:

834
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,583
"I'm gonna catch me one of them."
So he did.

835
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:48,415
But he didn't have nothing
to tote it in.

836
01:23:48,589 --> 01:23:51,717
Being from Georgia,
he had on long underdrawers.

837
01:23:51,892 --> 01:23:55,555
He took them off, tied knots
in the legs and made a sack.

838
01:23:56,096 --> 01:24:00,123
He put the cub in it, and as he's
reaching for his britches...

839
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:02,366
...here comes a-crashing.

840
01:24:02,536 --> 01:24:06,165
And that she-bear come
out of the thicket, right at him.

841
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,037
- Jody-boy, fetch me my pipe, son.
- Oh, Pa!

842
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:20,811
- What you grinning at?
- Oh, nothing.

843
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,153
I look all right?

844
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,585
You look just dandy, sweetheart.

845
01:24:31,532 --> 01:24:33,159
Thank you, boy.

846
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:38,564
He takened out through
the swamp and dropped the cub.

847
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:42,004
And the old mammy gathered it up,
drawers and all.

848
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:45,009
She was so close,
she stepped on a vine...

849
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:48,637
...and it tripped him and throwed him
in the brambles.

850
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,946
Now, Aunt Moll
was kind of muddle-minded.

851
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:56,021
She never could make out
how he come home without drawers...

852
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:59,250
...and his bottom scratched.
Uncle Miles said:

853
01:24:59,426 --> 01:25:03,294
"That weren't nothing to the puzzling
of that mammy bear...

854
01:25:03,464 --> 01:25:05,625
...over them drawers on her cub."

855
01:25:09,436 --> 01:25:13,634
Oh, Pa, you got all them tales
in your mind and don't tell them.

856
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:18,838
I ain't much for dogs, but there was
a dog once I takened a notion to.

857
01:25:20,314 --> 01:25:22,339
She had the prettiest coat.

858
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:27,250
I said to the owner,
"When she finds pups, I'd like one."

859
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,918
He says, "But you ain't got
no way of hunting."

860
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:33,616
I wasn't vet married to your pa.

861
01:25:33,794 --> 01:25:36,888
"A hound'll die," he says,
"if it ain't hunted."

862
01:25:37,064 --> 01:25:40,727
"Is she a hound?" says I.
He said, "Yes'm."

863
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:45,133
I said, "Then I sure don't want one,
for a hound'll suck eggs."

864
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,317
Well...

865
01:25:59,486 --> 01:26:04,287
Well, now, that's a mighty exciting tale.
You got any more like that one?

866
01:26:05,092 --> 01:26:06,559
I might.

867
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:27,339
You reckon it's fixing to do damage?

868
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,751
Rotted!

869
01:27:11,925 --> 01:27:13,790
Most of them rotted!

870
01:27:13,961 --> 01:27:15,929
Our whole crop!

871
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:19,796
Keep turning them so's they all
get a mite of heat.

872
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:23,395
Most of these beans is molded.

873
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:29,031
Six days of rain. We just as good
to quit fighting and lay down and die.

874
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:32,303
Well, Job takened worse punishment.

875
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:35,073
That's right, find the good in it!

876
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:44,857
Get out of that,
you dad-ratted varmint!

877
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:47,858
Ma! Ma! Don't hit him again.

878
01:27:48,328 --> 01:27:51,263
That ends it.
That critter gives me no peace.

879
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,730
He can't come in this house, never.

880
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,563
He's just hungry, Ma.
He ain't had much.

881
01:27:56,737 --> 01:28:01,071
- Lock him up in the barn. If he...
- Leave off, the both of you.

882
01:28:01,241 --> 01:28:05,644
Ain't it enough to have trouble
pouring on us out of the skies?

883
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,441
Has a man got to die to find peace?

884
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,671
What's happening now?

885
01:28:31,872 --> 01:28:33,362
Seems like...

886
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:49,254
Pa, it's stopped!

887
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:16,480
Ma, it seems like times
a body gets struck down so low...

888
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:20,347
...ain't a power on earth can ever
bring him up again.

889
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,785
Seems something inside him dies...

890
01:29:22,956 --> 01:29:25,982
...so he don't even want
to get up again...

891
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,428
...but he does.

892
01:29:30,397 --> 01:29:34,299
They ain't much of a world left
for us, but it's all we got.

893
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:37,733
Let's be thankful
we got any world at all.

894
01:29:44,678 --> 01:29:46,111
Here comes the sun.

895
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,182
Hey, Ma, look at this day!

896
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:30,414
If I was dead,
I'd notice a day like this.

897
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,288
Just right for corn.
Just right for okra. For tobacco...

898
01:30:34,461 --> 01:30:37,589
...cowpeas, potatoes, greens.

899
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:40,665
Hey, Ma, we got us a planting Pa,
ain't we?

900
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:44,260
To hear him, you'd think
he'd plant the world.

901
01:30:44,638 --> 01:30:45,969
I'd purely love to.

902
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:50,269
Come on. If we're gonna do
that planting, we best keep busy.

903
01:30:50,644 --> 01:30:55,308
When these tobacco plants come up,
we won't have to tote water no more.

904
01:30:55,482 --> 01:30:59,441
Ma's gonna have a well,
right outside our door.

905
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,948
Pa give us a lot of chores today.

906
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,520
There. Now we're all done.

907
01:31:07,694 --> 01:31:10,629
Come on. You sit in the doorway.

908
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:52,065
Hey, Pa.

909
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:59,542
- Was that Jody?
- What if it was?

910
01:31:59,713 --> 01:32:03,080
Now stand still.
You'll bust one of these seams.

911
01:32:36,616 --> 01:32:40,712
Stand still, I tell you.
You want I should spoil it?

912
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:53,658
- I done the hoeing you told me to do.
- All right, all right.

913
01:32:55,902 --> 01:33:00,396
- And I got the tobacco plants watered.
- That's good, boy.

914
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:09,912
Anything else I should do, Pa?

915
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:12,946
I guess not.

916
01:33:20,994 --> 01:33:22,985
That's sure mighty pretty, Pa.

917
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:27,390
I'll pretty you with a piece
of fat wood! Get out of here!

918
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:31,535
Can I bring Flag to see
how pretty it looks?

919
01:33:31,838 --> 01:33:33,567
- You gonna get...
- Be still!

920
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:35,970
You said you'd be through by now!

921
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:40,341
- He's gotta learn how dresses is made.
- Not on me, he don't.

922
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,505
Besides, I'm getting feverish.

923
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:45,708
Well, fight it a minute
and turn around.

924
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:51,148
How do you think I'll finish
in time for the wedding?

925
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,957
What wedding?
Who's getting married?

926
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:56,789
- Oliver's getting married.
- Oliver?

927
01:33:56,997 --> 01:34:00,990
That ain't the worst of it.
They're going to Boston to live.

928
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:05,605
- We ain't gonna see Oliver no more?
- I'm afraid not, boy.

929
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:15,674
Now, tomorrow, I'm going
to Oliver's wedding.

930
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:19,341
After they're married,
they're going off to Boston...

931
01:34:19,519 --> 01:34:21,987
...so we'll be kind of alone.

932
01:34:22,155 --> 01:34:25,591
Take care of yourself while I'm away.
Be good.

933
01:34:25,759 --> 01:34:27,386
You understand?

934
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:32,999
I been doing some figuring.
You're getting kind of big.

935
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:39,668
Now I don't care for girls,
and I don't never aim to get married.

936
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,106
But when you get a little bigger,
maybe you're gonna want a doe.

937
01:34:44,277 --> 01:34:47,644
So someday I'm fixing to build
a house by the glen.

938
01:34:47,814 --> 01:34:49,748
And I'm gonna get you a doe.

939
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:53,511
We're all gonna live there
together by the glen.

940
01:34:53,687 --> 01:34:57,521
Do you like that?
Me living with you?

941
01:34:57,691 --> 01:35:00,956
See, I'm gonna take care of you fine.

942
01:35:04,798 --> 01:35:06,493
Now, good night.

943
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:20,207
It's right nice seeing a lot of people
again, and the buildings and stores.

944
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:24,407
My, how it's growed! That there
house never used to be there.

945
01:35:24,584 --> 01:35:27,883
- It's been built a year.
- Ma don't get out enough.

946
01:35:28,054 --> 01:35:30,614
- That's the truth.
- How do you do?

947
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:34,624
- Why, how do, Miss Saunders?
- How do, Miss Saunders?

948
01:35:36,029 --> 01:35:40,056
- She won't recollect me.
- How do you do, Miss Baxter?

949
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,258
How do you do?

950
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:46,100
Well, I declare!

951
01:36:01,054 --> 01:36:03,181
Well, best get going.
Bye, Penny.

952
01:36:03,356 --> 01:36:06,723
- Jody and me'll miss you.
- Miss me enough to visit.

953
01:36:06,893 --> 01:36:08,451
I'll visit you, Oliver.

954
01:36:08,628 --> 01:36:13,429
Thanks for sticking by me. I won't
forget you. Not even in the China Sea.

955
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,936
Bye, Eulalie. Be a good girl and
maybe you'll look after Jody for me.

956
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:21,164
- Bye, Miss Baxter.
- Bye.

957
01:36:21,341 --> 01:36:23,172
Goodbye, Jody.

958
01:36:23,343 --> 01:36:26,335
Shall I kiss you goodbye, Jody?

959
01:36:26,513 --> 01:36:30,313
Well, I guess
it wouldn't hurt nothing.

960
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:33,315
- Come on.
- You'll miss the boat!

961
01:36:33,486 --> 01:36:36,319
Hey, come on, honey.
We'll miss the boat.

962
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:39,385
- Bye.
- Bye.

963
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:46,494
Bye, Oliver. Bye, Twink.

964
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:59,603
I don't like folks going away.

965
01:37:00,513 --> 01:37:03,004
It's like they was dying.

966
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:06,242
The way Fodderwing done.

967
01:37:06,686 --> 01:37:08,881
That's life, boy.

968
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:11,214
Getting and losing.

969
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:13,450
Losing and getting.

970
01:37:16,029 --> 01:37:19,089
I'm glad I got Flag.

971
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,774
Flag. Stop that. Oh, Flag.

972
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:32,434
You'll knock this milk over.

973
01:37:32,612 --> 01:37:35,706
He missed me, Pa.
Flag sure missed me yesterday!

974
01:37:35,882 --> 01:37:40,114
He just tags after me like a dog.
Just like your old...

975
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:47,483
What's happened, Pa?

976
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:53,558
We been saving a long time to get
enough to set out them tobacco seeds.

977
01:37:53,733 --> 01:37:56,600
It weren't Flag done it. Weren't Flag.

978
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:58,465
It were Flag.

979
01:38:00,173 --> 01:38:03,108
It won't do no good.
He ruined half the crop.

980
01:38:03,276 --> 01:38:05,938
But Flag didn't mean it, Pa.

981
01:38:07,247 --> 01:38:11,274
Ma, listen, Flag didn't mean it.
Ma, listen. Ma!

982
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:19,148
She figured at last she'd get a well.
That's why she's quiet.

983
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:23,194
- Flag didn't mean it.
- I don't figure he done it malicious.

984
01:38:23,363 --> 01:38:28,096
He were just racing back and forth,
and it were something to jump on.

985
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:33,568
What you looking at him that way for?

986
01:38:33,907 --> 01:38:36,842
He's a yearling now, for sure.

987
01:38:37,277 --> 01:38:40,838
- You think a heap of him, don't you?
- Why, sure.

988
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:48,414
Yes, you're a pair of yearlings now.

989
01:38:49,322 --> 01:38:51,051
It grieves me.

990
01:38:59,532 --> 01:39:02,660
What you do that for?
You're a yearling now.

991
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:05,634
You're growed up.
You gotta be good.

992
01:39:06,706 --> 01:39:11,166
- I can do that, Pa. I know just how.
- No, we'll do it together, boy.

993
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:19,017
There's a good few he ain't touched.
Think we got enough for Ma's well?

994
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:21,585
No, I'm afraid not, boy.

995
01:39:22,555 --> 01:39:24,250
But I got a little idea.

996
01:39:24,424 --> 01:39:27,257
Let's clear the field
behind the pot garden.

997
01:39:27,427 --> 01:39:32,262
There's a few stumps there. If we can
get them out, we might plant cotton.

998
01:39:32,432 --> 01:39:33,456
Pa!

999
01:39:33,633 --> 01:39:36,727
A money crop, so your ma
can still get her well.

1000
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:40,999
Hey, Pa! We can do it! We can do it!

1001
01:39:41,174 --> 01:39:43,938
Giddap, Caesar. Go on. Giddap.

1002
01:39:53,286 --> 01:39:58,314
This is the last one, Pa. Where do
you figure we best dig Ma her well?

1003
01:39:58,491 --> 01:40:02,257
We best get this field in cotton
before we figure on that.

1004
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:06,297
Now, giddap, Caesar. Go on.
Giddap now!

1005
01:40:14,674 --> 01:40:16,869
What's the matter, Pa?

1006
01:40:17,043 --> 01:40:20,604
It's all right.
I'll be all right in a minute.

1007
01:40:22,348 --> 01:40:25,044
- I reckon I strained myself.
- I'll get Ma.

1008
01:40:25,218 --> 01:40:26,810
No!

1009
01:40:26,986 --> 01:40:28,954
I'll be all right.

1010
01:40:29,689 --> 01:40:32,624
Unhitch Caesar. I'll ride him in.

1011
01:40:38,531 --> 01:40:43,264
You don't never know when to quit.
If you had a mite of sense...

1012
01:40:44,504 --> 01:40:48,804
- You likely ruptured yourself.
- Please to hush, Ora.

1013
01:40:50,977 --> 01:40:52,672
Is it easier, Pa?

1014
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:56,612
Feels mighty good,
laving down this way. Hardly feel it.

1015
01:40:56,783 --> 01:40:58,842
You're obliged to take it easy.

1016
01:40:59,018 --> 01:41:00,542
I reckon.

1017
01:41:01,154 --> 01:41:04,783
If it happens that I ain't out of bed
for a few days...

1018
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:07,119
...you think you can take charge?

1019
01:41:07,293 --> 01:41:10,285
- I can take charge.
- Know what is to be done?

1020
01:41:10,463 --> 01:41:13,796
Cowpeas need hoeing.
I best watch for worms. And...

1021
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:18,700
You know as good as I, you got to
keep that yearling out of the fields.

1022
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:22,467
- I'll keep him out, Pa.
- That's fine.

1023
01:41:22,642 --> 01:41:24,837
You keep him out, religious.

1024
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:29,107
Yes, sir.
I'll just take charge of everything.

1025
01:41:30,283 --> 01:41:34,743
You best get to bed, now.
You got a lot to do tomorrow.

1026
01:41:34,921 --> 01:41:40,188
You get a good sleep too, Pa.
Got to get your strength back.

1027
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,191
All right, son.

1028
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,100
Night, Pa.

1029
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:50,133
Good night, son.

1030
01:41:59,779 --> 01:42:01,041
Your pa asleep?

1031
01:42:01,214 --> 01:42:04,809
He's getting to sleep.
You best get to bed too, Ma.

1032
01:42:04,984 --> 01:42:06,508
What's that?

1033
01:42:08,988 --> 01:42:12,048
I said, you best get to bed.

1034
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:15,894
Mr. Impudent Bigmouth,
you just get to your room.

1035
01:42:16,062 --> 01:42:17,120
Yes, ma'am.

1036
01:42:17,297 --> 01:42:20,755
- Some people getting mighty important.
- Yes'm.

1037
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:22,424
- Night.
- Night.

1038
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:08,171
Look. These here's for your supper.
I only wasted two shots.

1039
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:09,576
That's mighty fine.

1040
01:43:09,749 --> 01:43:14,118
I'm taking charge all right.
Everything's coming along fine.

1041
01:43:14,287 --> 01:43:17,654
Why, the corn is the best
I ever seen and...

1042
01:43:19,559 --> 01:43:21,789
What's the matter, Pa?

1043
01:43:23,296 --> 01:43:28,632
- When did you see the corn last?
- Yesterday. It's near an inch high.

1044
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:31,292
Your ma here says...

1045
01:43:32,805 --> 01:43:35,205
She says something has ate it.

1046
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:37,309
Ate the corn?

1047
01:43:37,477 --> 01:43:40,071
She says nearly
the whole crop is gone.

1048
01:43:40,246 --> 01:43:43,841
But that ain't right.
Yesterday it was all right.

1049
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:47,919
It appears like something
must have ate it during the night.

1050
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:51,819
- Flag ain't ate it.
- He did.

1051
01:43:51,991 --> 01:43:56,189
He wouldn't eat the corn!
He never ate nothing he shouldn't.

1052
01:43:56,362 --> 01:43:58,728
Go and see!

1053
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:08,771
And that settles it!
That deer has got to go!

1054
01:44:30,763 --> 01:44:32,390
It were Flag.

1055
01:44:33,766 --> 01:44:36,428
I reckon. Yes, sir.

1056
01:44:36,969 --> 01:44:42,464
But he won't never do it again, Pa.
I'll whip him with a stick, Pa.

1057
01:44:42,642 --> 01:44:46,806
- He ain't been whipped.
- You don't think whipping will help?

1058
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:48,071
I'll pen him up...

1059
01:44:48,247 --> 01:44:51,683
We got no place to pen up
a wild thing like that.

1060
01:44:51,851 --> 01:44:55,116
I'll halter him. I'll tie him
and let him kick...

1061
01:44:55,288 --> 01:44:58,280
Now, wait a minute, boy.
Just listen to me.

1062
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,392
Yes, Pa. I'm listening.

1063
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,893
What's happened is powerful bad.
You know that.

1064
01:45:04,063 --> 01:45:06,964
- Yes.
- But your ma and me have an agreement.

1065
01:45:07,133 --> 01:45:09,727
We're going to have a try at a remedy.

1066
01:45:09,902 --> 01:45:14,566
- You'll work extra hard to fix things?
- Oh, Pa, I'll do anything.

1067
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:19,075
- I'll work like you never seen!
- All right, all right.

1068
01:45:19,245 --> 01:45:22,043
First, you get whatever corn
we got left.

1069
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:24,740
Then you plant it
like we done before.

1070
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:27,647
Then you build our fence up high.

1071
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:31,688
When it's higher than you can reach,
I hope I can help you.

1072
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:36,693
But you got to get it all up
before the corn starts showing again.

1073
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:39,559
Maybe that way we're safe.

1074
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:44,096
- You understand, boy?
- You can depend on me, Pa.

1075
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:59,443
Soon as I get the corn planted, you'll
stay in the barn till the fence is up.

1076
01:47:23,536 --> 01:47:24,935
Jody.

1077
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:37,715
I'm proud to see you
working so hard, boy.

1078
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:41,911
But the yearling ain't worth killing
yourself over.

1079
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:45,750
I ain't killing myself, Pa.
I ain't killing myself.

1080
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:49,587
I'd give a year of my life
to help you with this.

1081
01:47:49,795 --> 01:47:53,322
I can do it all right, Pa.
I can do it.

1082
01:49:07,406 --> 01:49:11,172
We done it, Ma! We done it!

1083
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:13,106
Hey, Ma!

1084
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:23,147
- Never mind squeezing my life out.
- I sure thank you for helping me, Ma.

1085
01:49:23,322 --> 01:49:26,985
I never figured you had it in you
to work this way.

1086
01:49:27,259 --> 01:49:30,695
Looks as if we're gonna
have a crop after all.

1087
01:49:30,896 --> 01:49:33,456
And a fence, Ma!

1088
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:36,167
Ain't it wonderful!

1089
01:49:37,003 --> 01:49:41,406
Let's go in and tell your pa
we're done. He'll be mighty proud.

1090
01:50:51,844 --> 01:50:53,175
Jody.

1091
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:57,343
Come here, close to me.

1092
01:51:03,956 --> 01:51:07,517
You know we depend on our crops
to live, don't we?

1093
01:51:07,693 --> 01:51:08,682
Yes, sir.

1094
01:51:09,061 --> 01:51:14,055
- We can't go on having them destroyed.
- No, sir.

1095
01:51:14,266 --> 01:51:20,000
There is no way in the world to keep
that yearling from destroying them.

1096
01:51:20,539 --> 01:51:25,499
I'm sorry. I can't never
tell you how sorry.

1097
01:51:25,711 --> 01:51:28,737
But all's been done was possible.

1098
01:51:29,515 --> 01:51:34,475
Take the yearling out in the woods
and tie him and shoot him.

1099
01:51:44,997 --> 01:51:46,157
Pa...

1100
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:52,760
Pa...

1101
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:01,207
You gotta go away, Flag.

1102
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:05,883
You gotta go away
and never come back.

1103
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:14,359
You're growed up now. You gotta
go out and find yourself a doe.

1104
01:52:14,527 --> 01:52:17,792
We can't all live together
like I planned.

1105
01:52:17,997 --> 01:52:22,331
You've been bad,
without meaning to be.

1106
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:26,562
You can make out by yourself,
can't you?

1107
01:52:26,772 --> 01:52:31,436
You'll be all right. You're smart.

1108
01:52:32,511 --> 01:52:35,571
Besides, I don't care for you no more.

1109
01:52:35,781 --> 01:52:39,581
You ain't cute like you used to be
when you was little.

1110
01:52:40,786 --> 01:52:45,382
You go now. Ain't nobody got any use
for you around here anymore!

1111
01:52:45,691 --> 01:52:48,159
Go on, you hear me? You go!

1112
01:52:48,327 --> 01:52:50,887
There's nothing I can do to save you!

1113
01:52:51,063 --> 01:52:54,555
Go on! You gonna get killed
if you stay around here!

1114
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:56,894
Get out before I shoot you!

1115
01:52:57,102 --> 01:53:01,266
And don't you never come back!
Don't you never!

1116
01:53:31,437 --> 01:53:34,600
How come you not to do
what I told you?

1117
01:53:35,507 --> 01:53:37,065
I couldn't.

1118
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:41,108
I just couldn't, Pa.

1119
01:53:51,056 --> 01:53:53,650
Tell your ma to come here.

1120
01:53:54,093 --> 01:53:56,994
Go to your room and shut the door.

1121
01:53:57,429 --> 01:53:58,919
Yes, sir.

1122
01:54:09,341 --> 01:54:12,208
Pa says you're to go to him.

1123
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:02,122
I didn't mean to hurt the critter.
I can't shoot straight.

1124
01:55:02,328 --> 01:55:03,852
Flag!

1125
01:55:04,163 --> 01:55:05,494
Jody!

1126
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:08,798
You got to finish him, boy.

1127
01:55:09,268 --> 01:55:12,465
You got to put him out of his torment!

1128
01:55:22,915 --> 01:55:27,375
You done it on purpose.
You always hated him!

1129
01:55:27,586 --> 01:55:31,078
You went back on me!
You told her to do it!

1130
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:34,225
I hate you! I hope you die!

1131
01:55:34,393 --> 01:55:37,658
I hope I never see you again!

1132
01:55:56,281 --> 01:55:58,841
It's me, Flag.

1133
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:01,846
It's me, Jody.

1134
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:43,759
Jody!

1135
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:48,057
Jody!

1136
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,165
Flag.

1137
01:57:27,773 --> 01:57:29,331
Flag.

1138
01:57:41,854 --> 01:57:45,847
Ma! I'm hungry, Ma.

1139
01:57:46,058 --> 01:57:48,322
I'm hungry.

1140
01:58:27,499 --> 01:58:28,898
Look sharp there.

1141
01:58:29,101 --> 01:58:33,470
Something ahead. What is it?
Reverse engine. Lower the aft boat.

1142
01:58:39,444 --> 01:58:42,641
- What's he doing on the river?
- Skinny, ain't he?

1143
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:45,612
- Try him something to eat.
- He ain't awake.

1144
01:58:45,784 --> 01:58:48,150
I'll get him some soup.

1145
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:56,254
Pa!

1146
01:58:57,162 --> 01:58:58,993
- Pa!
- Take it easy, kid.

1147
01:58:59,197 --> 01:59:02,860
- He's feverish, ain't he?
- He's waking up.

1148
01:59:03,802 --> 01:59:06,430
Well, young'un, what's the matter?

1149
01:59:06,638 --> 01:59:09,300
We about run you down in the dark.

1150
01:59:09,508 --> 01:59:11,601
You hungry, boy?

1151
01:59:12,711 --> 01:59:14,269
Hungry?

1152
01:59:20,385 --> 01:59:21,909
Hey there!

1153
01:59:24,022 --> 01:59:25,512
Not too fast.

1154
01:59:43,475 --> 01:59:44,464
Ora?

1155
01:59:46,378 --> 01:59:47,902
It's me.

1156
01:59:48,146 --> 01:59:49,943
It's Jody.

1157
01:59:53,085 --> 01:59:54,416
Jody.

1158
02:00:01,293 --> 02:00:03,124
Come close.

1159
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,775
Boy, we near about give you out.

1160
02:00:19,044 --> 02:00:20,602
You all right?

1161
02:00:22,514 --> 02:00:27,213
You all right. You ain't dead
nor gone. You all right.

1162
02:00:28,086 --> 02:00:29,610
Glory be!

1163
02:00:32,024 --> 02:00:36,791
- I had to come home.
- Why, sure you did.

1164
02:00:36,995 --> 02:00:41,022
I ain't meant what I said
about hating you.

1165
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:43,133
Why, sure you ain't.

1166
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:46,769
When I was a child,
I spake as a child.

1167
02:00:50,542 --> 02:00:54,239
- Where's Ma?
- She drove the wagon to Doc Wilson's.

1168
02:00:54,746 --> 02:00:59,240
Your ma's been searching for you.
She ain't done nothing else.

1169
02:00:59,451 --> 02:01:02,750
She'll be mighty glad you're home.

1170
02:01:03,755 --> 02:01:06,952
Jody, I'd be proud to know
where you been.

1171
02:01:07,125 --> 02:01:09,650
I been on the river.

1172
02:01:10,662 --> 02:01:12,425
I aimed to go to Boston.

1173
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:15,531
I see.

1174
02:01:16,334 --> 02:01:17,961
Were you hungry?

1175
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:22,733
I didn't get nothing to eat
for three days.

1176
02:01:22,974 --> 02:01:25,841
I'm sorry you had to learn it
that way.

1177
02:01:26,044 --> 02:01:31,676
Now you know Old Starvation. He's got
a face meaner than Old Slewfoot.

1178
02:01:32,884 --> 02:01:35,250
It's fearful!

1179
02:01:38,123 --> 02:01:39,818
Sit, boy.

1180
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:47,764
You figured I went back on you.

1181
02:01:47,966 --> 02:01:50,366
That's why you runned away.

1182
02:01:51,737 --> 02:01:57,175
Son, there's a thing every man's got
to know. Maybe you know it already.

1183
02:01:57,375 --> 02:02:03,575
It wasn't only me. Wasn't only your
yearling deer having to be destroyed.

1184
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:09,813
- Boy, life goes back on you.
- Yes, sir. I reckon.

1185
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:13,286
You've seen how things go
in the world of men.

1186
02:02:13,592 --> 02:02:18,120
Every man wants life
to be a fine thing and easy.

1187
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:24,030
Well, it is fine, son, powerful fine.
But it ain't easy.

1188
02:02:24,736 --> 02:02:29,503
I wanted life to be easy for you.
Easier than it was for me.

1189
02:02:30,008 --> 02:02:33,808
A man's heart aches seeing his
young'uns face the world.

1190
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:39,383
Knowing they got to get their insides
tore out the way his was tore.

1191
02:02:39,584 --> 02:02:42,576
I wanted to spare you
as long as I could.

1192
02:02:42,788 --> 02:02:48,784
I wanted you to be with your yearling.
I knowed the lonesomeness be easier.

1193
02:02:49,127 --> 02:02:51,960
But every man's lonesome.

1194
02:02:52,197 --> 02:02:57,692
Well, what's he to do then? What's
he to do when he gets knocked down?

1195
02:02:57,903 --> 02:03:00,701
Why, take it for his share and go on.

1196
02:03:01,573 --> 02:03:03,438
I'm ashamed I run off.

1197
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:07,508
You're near enough growed
to do your choosing, Jody.

1198
02:03:07,712 --> 02:03:11,375
Maybe you'd crave to go
to sea like Oliver.

1199
02:03:11,583 --> 02:03:16,282
But I'd be proud did you choose
to live here and farm the clearing.

1200
02:03:16,454 --> 02:03:19,685
I'd be proud to see the day
you got a well dug.

1201
02:03:19,858 --> 02:03:24,921
So's no woman here'd be obliged to do
her washing on a seepage hillside.

1202
02:03:26,164 --> 02:03:27,654
You willing?

1203
02:03:30,869 --> 02:03:32,336
I'm willing.

1204
02:03:32,737 --> 02:03:34,398
Shake.

1205
02:03:38,176 --> 02:03:41,976
It's food and drink
to have you home, boy.

1206
