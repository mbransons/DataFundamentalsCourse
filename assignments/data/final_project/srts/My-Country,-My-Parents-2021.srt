1
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,581
Make an inventory of this rapid harvest.

2
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,292
No problem.

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,857
What's this?

4
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,449
Who did this?

5
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,816
Who else?

6
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,541
Your son Chengfeng.

7
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,966
Chengfeng.

8
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,249
Chengfeng is getting into trouble.

9
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,232
That half-hearted kid.

10
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,092
Where is he?

11
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,658
It's all good.

12
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,149
Look who is back.

13
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,583
Did you finish your task?

14
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,867
You're back.

15
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,067
Chengfeng.

16
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,683
It's all good.

17
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,766
Such a bad temper.

18
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,533
Can't you talk to your son nicely?

19
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,099
What do you want?

20
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,957
You call that work?

21
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,541
Those crops were hardly reaped.

22
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,157
Is that what they taught
you at the academy?

23
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,607
Besides, who told you
that you can ride him?

24
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,107
Look at your shoe marks
on my horse's belly.

25
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,133
You know he's off limits.

26
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,181
Report. Urgent message from Chief of Staff.

27
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,919
Upon receiving this message,

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,375
Commander Ma and you are
to reply immediately.

29
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,482
You ordered all horses to work the fields

30
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,816
except for your precious ride.

31
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,283
What else can I ride?

32
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,832
You've given him a task.

33
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,207
Why didn't you inform me?

34
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,781
Stop right there. Come back.

35
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,066
Stop right there.

36
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:02,306
Punk. You better stop.

37
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,575
Think you are tough?

38
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,892
Let's move.

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,665
Since May, Gen Okamura orchestrated a huge
sweep-up operation, unleashing his hounds.

40
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,248
Latest report indicated that on the 9th
we had traitors who defected to the enemy.

41
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:11,541
Our regiment's location
might have been compromised.

42
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,124
The commanders have ordered us

43
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,541
to halt harvesting and sabotage operations.

44
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,475
And break out of the encirclement.

45
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,425
Light machine guns.

46
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,675
Air burst.

47
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,457
Grenade launchers.

48
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,400
No heavy weapons.

49
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,416
Not quite right, keep listening.

50
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,874
Armoured units.

51
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,592
West side.

52
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,857
The planes are their vanguard.

53
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,482
They are smoking us out.

54
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,690
Inform every company
to withdraw independently.

55
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:51,666
Entire regiment is to rendezvous
at Ziya River by daybreak tomorrow.

56
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:53,832
Do you copy?

57
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,207
Gone deaf?

58
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,325
Copy that, Sir.

59
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,282
Grain in Ear.

60
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,883
Silent Shrike.

61
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,141
I told you it's just an air raid.

62
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:29,125
Japs don't tunnel.

63
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:50,017
Message from Chief of Staff.
Japs have discharged the dam.

64
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,706
We are not the enemy. Release.

65
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,648
- We are not the enemy.
- Put down the gun.

66
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,175
Put down. Not the enemy, put down your gun.

67
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,690
Don't touch my stomach.

68
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:08,457
Put her down.

69
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,441
The urgent message is that
Japs have discharged the dam.

70
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:14,191
Our only chance of crossing is
to detour via Dayin village.

71
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,208
Sons of bitches.

72
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:27,666
I want everyone accounted for.

73
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,416
Get their finger prints.

74
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,749
Every soul.

75
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,299
Take it. It's for the road, bro.

76
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,916
- No, thank you.
- There's more.

77
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,791
That's very kind of you, madam.

78
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,408
Take it.

79
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,450
Thank you, madam.

80
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,081
My man gave me the gun.

81
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,665
Around early spring he came
home and left the gun with me.

82
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,574
The name is Xiao Shuncheng.

83
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,383
He claimed to be from 23rd Regiment.

84
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,865
It's verified. Dachunzi
is a military spouse.

85
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,148
Been over 9 months.

86
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,107
Baby is due soon.

87
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,950
How's your neck?

88
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,083
It's alright.

89
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:10,149
Nasty scratch. Let me have a look.

90
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,006
It's nothing. I said it's nothing.

91
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,524
You deserved it for being mindless.

92
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,858
Another inch and you're dead.

93
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,056
What am I to do?

94
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:22,606
Your family affairs are not my business.

95
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,365
I was talking about these folks.
What are you talking about?

96
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,791
We don't have much time.

97
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:30,574
They'll be doomed
if the Japs get here.

98
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:34,624
The river isn't far, but
the path is mountainous.

99
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,207
Are we bringing them or not?

100
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,291
We'll bring them if it's possible,

101
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,566
but I don't believe it is.

102
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:44,275
52 people, most of
whom can barely walk.

103
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,140
I heard that the Japs have
left some villages untouched.

104
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,815
Perhaps they can hide underground.

105
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,174
You think you're smart

106
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,566
and the Japs can't find them like we did?

107
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:55,982
Exactly.

108
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,331
We can't just hope for the best.

109
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,233
Especially with military families.

110
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:00,582
They will be eliminated.

111
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,556
What are you blaming me for?
Am I being heartless?

112
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:03,649
Why are you yelling?

113
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,941
I'm not yelling.

114
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,441
Have I yelled?

115
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:09,749
Japanese armoured vehicles are on our tail.

116
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,082
Keep procrastinating

117
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,399
and we might as well let
Big Guy dig a larger grave

118
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,208
for them and us,
plus the horses.

119
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,433
Mom.

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,108
Whose child is this?

121
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,358
Mom.

122
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:02,198
Listen to me. Bring a few more men.

123
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,667
What if you can't find the 3rd Company?

124
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,898
Bring Chengfeng along.

125
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,281
When it comes to intel-collecting,
he's better than either one of us.

126
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:14,291
You trust me with your child.

127
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,915
If anything happens to him,
how am I gonna tell you?

128
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,316
I'm already grateful that
Huang Rui is with me.

129
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:24,541
My marksmanship has no rivals
in the cavalry and the army.

130
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:28,733
You're almost perfect,
except for your bragging.

131
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,691
What's the bloody hurry?

132
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,675
Make haste.

133
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:41,698
Even if it's the last thing I do,
I'll steer this bull to the south.

134
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,008
When you have crossed
the river, send up a flare.

135
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,366
Wang. Stay safe and sound.

136
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,575
God is on our side.

137
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,849
Dachunzi tried every horse
and none was mountable.

138
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,024
She said they'll rock her baby out.

139
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,816
Can't even complete such a simple task.

140
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,274
You think I am not busy?

141
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,807
She lost her man.

142
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:19,707
What?

143
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,224
Her man is dead.

144
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:25,150
I didn't know what to
say when she asked me.

145
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,769
A while ago, at Raoyang,

146
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,430
the entire 23rd Regiment was wiped out.

147
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,267
You. Come here.

148
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,749
Can you take care of him?

149
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,982
Of course.

150
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,541
Sankui. Eat this.

151
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,424
Leave them to Big Boss.

152
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:51,857
Listen up, if you
want to live, follow us.

153
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,399
Big Boss.

154
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,423
Be careful. Don't kick his belly.

155
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,574
Who is Big Boss?

156
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,248
Do as you're told.

157
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:03,699
Obey all military orders.

158
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,390
Big Boss.

159
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:10,099
To my father, this horse
is more precious than I am.

160
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,749
Get moving, old lady.

161
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,107
Honey.

162
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,541
Honey.

163
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,657
Our valuables are under the bed.

164
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,707
The Japs have eyes everywhere.

165
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,215
When I give the order, everyone
is to keep their mouth shut.

166
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,374
If you have to fart,
keep it inside your pants.

167
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,366
Let's go. Keep moving.

168
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,606
Enemy aircraft. Take cover.

169
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:33,874
Enemy aircraft.

170
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,066
Take cover.

171
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,024
Spread out and protect the civilians.

172
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,049
Not that way.

173
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,249
Come this way.

174
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,507
Spread out and protect the civilians.

175
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:45,007
Go. Quickly.

176
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,567
Hide underground.

177
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:49,983
Futing and Yupo.

178
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,124
Monkey and Jingguo.

179
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,083
Mount and shoot.

180
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:01,308
Yang and Long, prepare for ambush.

181
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,416
Erya.

182
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,133
Erya.

183
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,925
Go.

184
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,958
Big Guy.

185
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:14,875
Wait till he takes the bait.

186
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,249
Grandpa.

187
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,724
I know. For your grandpa.

188
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,591
Big Guy. For your grandpa.

189
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,950
Grandpa.

190
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,131
All the other companies have
crossed the river except for 3rd.

191
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:38,249
No news about Commissar,
Huang Rui and them.

192
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,524
No news is good news.

193
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:43,008
Commissar must have
led them into the maze.

194
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,291
From a young age, I've never
been treated like he was.

195
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,524
What is this?

196
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:15,325
Mugwort.

197
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:18,975
Rub it over your neck wound.

198
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,416
Back in the Combined Arms Brigade,

199
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,524
there was this kid from Shanxi

200
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,991
and tetanus took his life.

201
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,950
He was about your age.

202
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:31,183
You think I'm afraid of death?

203
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:38,175
I fear that you are not.

204
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,457
I joined the army in 1925.

205
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,392
I've seen too much.

206
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,940
I was leading a recon platoon last year,

207
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,749
and on Mount Taihang I
encountered my first poison gas.

208
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,416
About half the platoon,

209
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,900
horses and men,

210
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:01,142
their bodies were covered with blisters.

211
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:06,792
My life was saved
by Big Boss's speed.

212
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,050
I am alive

213
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,767
because I'm always the first to charge.

214
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,508
When you wanted to join the army

215
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,225
your mom went berserk with me.

216
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,800
If you want to be a hero, I won't stop you.

217
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:35,833
But my son can
never be a casualty.

218
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,783
I chose to defend our country

219
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,125
but I feel guilty about your mother.

220
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,017
If you have to die, die after me.

221
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:54,775
Or else I'll be ashamed
to face your mother.

222
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,475
He peed on your hand.

223
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,708
You did the same at his age.

224
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,457
Nothing noticeable.

225
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,599
The Japs are finally quiet.

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,582
Our regiment has crossed the river.

227
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,865
- Any news of Commissar?
- None.

228
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,191
How about this?

229
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,206
I'll take a few men to search
for them with fast horses.

230
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,916
We'll return by daybreak.

231
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,731
I heard that. Count me in.

232
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,174
You.

233
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,348
Without me, how are you
gonna get any messages out?

234
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,656
I'll take the transmitter and
leave the receiver behind.

235
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:01,265
When you rendezvous with the
regiment, send up a flare.

236
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,981
When I see the flare I'll send you
a situation briefing immediately.

237
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,422
Let's seize this opportunity
while the Japs are taking a nap.

238
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,158
Commander.

239
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,425
No kicking of his belly.

240
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,783
Copy that.

241
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,533
What's wrong?

242
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,417
An emergency.

243
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,265
Once we use the transmitter
the Japs will locate us.

244
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:57,566
District Command demands

245
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,066
radio silence for all units

246
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,066
while operating in enemy-occupied areas.

247
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,374
Bloody Japs.

248
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,274
That's why we can't shake them off.

249
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,016
The Japs are betting big.

250
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,399
Looks like a lot of men.

251
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,274
We can't outrun them.

252
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:14,207
If we fight how
long can we last?

253
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,241
Given our firepower, we
might last for 30 seconds,

254
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,567
or perhaps just five.

255
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,225
Grandpa.

256
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,357
Anywhere beyond this
bend and we'll be made.

257
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,191
Bloody Japs.

258
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,565
We might die anyway.

259
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,499
I say we take some of them with us.

260
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,233
Get your weapons ready.

261
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:34,942
Hold on.

262
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,441
Radio guy.

263
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:43,165
Colonel. The cavalry's last
transmission was from these mountains.

264
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,241
Without my orders, nobody moves.

265
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:50,508
All units, forward.

266
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,800
Chao.

267
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,199
Shoot the flare.

268
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,867
What?

269
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,366
Shoot the flare. Shoot the flare.

270
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,782
Shoot the flare. Shoot it.

271
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,566
Good news at last.

272
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,191
They've crossed the river.

273
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,041
Halt.

274
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,742
Halt.

275
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,017
Chengfeng's message.

276
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,400
Commissar and Huang Rui
were killed in action.

277
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,349
We

278
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,867
Regroup

279
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:38,983
immediately.

280
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:42,065
Colonel, we just intercepted
their radio signal,

281
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:45,265
which came from Yechenzuo village.

282
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:48,058
This flare is a decoy.

283
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:52,706
The real target is the village.

284
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,342
Move out.

285
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,457
What's going on?

286
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,650
Why are the Japs withdrawing?

287
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,848
Commander, you asked Chengfeng to
transmit when he sees the flare.

288
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,800
Everyone, get ready

289
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,575
to move out.

290
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,608
Keep moving.

291
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,917
Quickly.

292
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,292
Quickly, the villagers have arrived.

293
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,041
Mother, there are boats.

294
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,341
We're saved.

295
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,333
The boats are here for us.

296
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,269
Colonel, no more
Chinese troops to be found.

297
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,981
Thank goodness.

298
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:10,924
We're saved.

299
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,049
Thank you so much.

300
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,319
We're saved.

301
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,030
Go.

302
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,899
Our signal triangulation
was cracked by the enemy.

303
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,542
Colonel,

304
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,491
they've tricked us.

305
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:31,125
Looks like they have a death wish.

306
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:38,624
Chengfeng, don't try
to be like your father.

307
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,583
This battle is not yours to fight.

308
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,658
It's still undetermined
who'll be the first to charge.

309
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,442
Fire.

310
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:12,992
Stop.

311
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,991
Baby's coming out.

312
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,983
It's a boy.

313
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,316
Colonel, the Chinese troops
on the hill are defenseless,

314
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,850
we will eliminate them soon.

315
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,692
Release.

316
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:28,900
Enemy cavalry spotted at our rear.

317
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,574
Turn all cannons around.

318
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:48,249
Turn all cannons around.

319
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,150
Quickly.

320
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:57,874
Fire.

321
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,749
Fire.

322
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,358
Quickly.

323
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,457
Stop the charging cavalry.

324
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,766
Stop the charging cavalry.

325
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,317
Stop them now.

326
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,442
All weapons free.

327
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:10,875
Fire at will.

328
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:52,374
Bastard.

329
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,750
They are coming towards us.
Their horses are too fast.

330
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,166
Hold the line. Don't fall back.

331
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,667
They're getting close.

332
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,000
They're too fast.

333
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,749
Charge.

334
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,292
Charge.

335
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:31,283
I'm Luo Tong.

336
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,250
For honor and glory I fight the battles.

337
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,623
What do you want? Kid. Commander.

338
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,358
It's alright.

339
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,100
Here.

340
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:01,875
You are Sankui.

341
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,792
Mother.

342
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:08,649
Mother.

343
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,783
What's wrong?

344
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,483
This is your child?

345
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,792
What's his name?

346
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,024
What's his name?

347
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,950
Chengfeng.

348
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,949
No running. Wait till I catch you...

349
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,832
Kid, this is not a playground.

350
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,399
I'll beat you up! Look
at the mess you made.

351
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,900
Get out!

352
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,891
An explosion!

353
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:07,083
Another explosion!

354
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,850
Hurry, if you're too slow, you'll miss it.

355
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:12,807
Get up there!

356
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:15,279
Quick!

357
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,732
Wait for me!

358
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,449
Get out of the way!

359
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,273
Can you see it?

360
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:23,099
I see smoke.

361
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,291
Come down!

362
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,650
Over there.

363
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,249
The data before the test run was fine.

364
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,675
I don't know what caused the explosion.

365
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,682
Let's send the debris for analysis.

366
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:45,175
Yes.

367
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:57,600
We must pinpoint the explosion point to
determine the cause of the explosion.

368
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,931
Then we must account for
the entire ignition process.

369
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:03,483
Cameras alone are not sufficient.

370
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,592
Next time I will inspect it
visually, if that's what it takes.

371
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,291
Master Yu,

372
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,890
I heard your son was in another fight.

373
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,249
With whom?

374
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,399
With Master Zhang's son.

375
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,067
Dont't worry about it.

376
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,550
Master, Take a break, please.

377
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,723
Smells good. We are having meat today!

378
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,732
Wow, meat!

379
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,307
Your loss if you don't eat some.

380
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:16,665
Own up to your mistake,
or you won't get to eat.

381
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,698
I won't eat then. I did nothing wrong.

382
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:21,207
But you got into a fight
with Little Four Eyes.

383
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,499
Look at him.

384
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,932
Clearly, he lost to Four Eyes.
He lost the fight.

385
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,849
I hit him first. Of course, I didn't lose.

386
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,666
Tell your mother that you are sorry.
Then you get to eat.

387
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,242
I won't.

388
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,717
Then I must teach you a lesson.

389
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,341
I will ask you one more time.
Are you sorry?

390
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,183
No.

391
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,024
Shush.

392
00:43:55,025 --> 00:43:55,766
Are you sorry?

393
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:56,725
No.

394
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:58,790
You dare talk back to me! You're
not sorry for hitting someone?

395
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,833
That's enough. Let's eat.

396
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,056
You should have listened to me. You
could have avoided the spanking.

397
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:08,642
Let's eat.

398
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,542
Let's.

399
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,875
I know why my brother was fighting.

400
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:22,432
Brother Four Eyes said
Dad makes firecrackers.

401
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:25,899
Whoever makes firecrackers you
could have avoided the spanking.

402
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,892
Dad, where's the meat?

403
00:45:02,392 --> 00:45:05,232
Stop hiding. Come out.

404
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,733
Here, eat this.

405
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:16,499
Dad, what exactly do you do?

406
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,241
Do you make firecrackers?

407
00:45:19,242 --> 00:45:21,507
Of course not.

408
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:23,492
Then what do you do?

409
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:26,225
I'm a...

410
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,066
I'm a poet.

411
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:33,807
My job is to write
poems in the sky.

412
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:35,949
How do you write poems in the sky?

413
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,641
That's a secret.

414
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:40,099
Children aren't allowed to know.

415
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,666
I don't care what you do,

416
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:43,907
as long as you're not making firecrackers.

417
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,058
Of course I'm not making firecrackers.

418
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:52,857
If Big Brother asks again
whether or not we could die,

419
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:53,932
what do we tell him?

420
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,874
Just tell the truth.

421
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,782
No, that's too cruel.

422
00:45:57,783 --> 00:45:59,625
I don't think he will take it well.

423
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,716
But, how can we avoid the topic?

424
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:04,408
Accidents happen.

425
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,042
From the first day of our
research on solid fuels,

426
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:15,891
since we knew that China
was developing from scratch,

427
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:18,507
and that it would take trial and error,

428
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,717
we've already understood.

429
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,450
What are you writing?

430
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:31,058
A poem.

431
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,750
A poem, you?

432
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,292
I told our son I'm a poet.

433
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,690
Let me read it.

434
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:40,940
It's not finished yet.

435
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:44,032
I'll show you when it's done.
Just a quick look!

436
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,841
If you're not working late today,

437
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:55,942
go to the village, see if
you can buy some meat.

438
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,433
Buy meat?

439
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:02,074
To satisfy our children's cravings.

440
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:03,749
I've been craving meat for a long time.

441
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,617
Then get more.

442
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,242
Wait.

443
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:17,925
The poem I wrote, see if you like it.

444
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,982
Brother, I'm scared.

445
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:04,642
Don't be.

446
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,967
Get up.

447
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,382
Shredded meat!

448
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,825
Go ahead.

449
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,232
It's delicious! Where did we get the meat?

450
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,498
A gift from your father's co-worker.

451
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:01,582
Where's Dad?

452
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,141
Where did you two go last night?

453
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:05,575
I will save a piece for Dad.

454
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,550
Where did you go, you and Dad?

455
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,933
We went to buy meat for you.

456
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:34,391
Be quiet!

457
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,550
I now call this meeting to order.

458
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,116
I'll speak first.

459
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:41,265
My dad hasn't come home in days.

460
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:42,807
Mom told me he has to put in extra hours.

461
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:44,257
I found it odd too.

462
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:45,766
My dad hasn't come home either.

463
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:47,016
My mom was crying.

464
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,391
Maybe he will not come back.

465
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:50,207
What does that mean?

466
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:51,415
It means he's gone to heaven.
So he won't come home.

467
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:54,174
Stop catastrophizing, you wimp.
You're ruining our meeting.

468
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,581
Stop arguing.

469
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:00,790
Rather than speculating here,

470
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,724
we might as well go investigate.

471
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:04,507
What do you say to that?

472
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:05,540
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

473
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:09,099
Let's go.

474
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,348
According to Comrade Shi Ruhong's report,

475
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:13,207
prior to his death,

476
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:16,332
plus the data analysis from this accident,

477
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,407
we have established that the
explosion happened in the engine head.

478
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:27,098
The modified propellant
formulation was not good enough.

479
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:29,399
We need to run the test again.

480
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,631
The heat insulation layer needs
to be partially thickened.

481
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:36,948
For our next test, we need
to reduce the engine speed.

482
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:40,432
All these could be major
causes of an accident.

483
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:43,649
Who are the comrades from the
propellant trimming workshop?

484
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,349
Do you think you could
improve the trimming accuracy

485
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,557
of the propellant surface to under 0.5 mm?

486
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:50,208
Can you do that?

487
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,192
Comrade Yu Kaiying.

488
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:11,217
Didn't I tell you to take some time off?

489
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:16,625
I can improve the
accuracy to 0.2 mm.

490
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:24,125
Where are you hiding?

491
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,558
Show yourself.

492
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,098
- Why are you crouching?
- Stand up.

493
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,016
What are you all doing in the factory?

494
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:34,708
Looking for my dad.

495
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,849
Me too.

496
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,873
What's your father's name?

497
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:39,475
Zhang Xiaoping.

498
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:41,458
And yours?

499
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,374
My father's name...

500
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,790
What's my father's name?

501
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,724
His father's name is Big Dummy.

502
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:48,724
What are you laughing at?

503
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:52,099
Stand still. Speak when spoken to

504
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,807
You... What's
your father's name?

505
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:57,883
Shi Ruhong.

506
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,891
Come again?

507
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:01,967
Shi Ruhong.

508
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,467
Stop going to there to
look for your father.

509
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,958
He doesn't work there anymore.

510
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,708
Then where is he?

511
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,058
What exactly does he do?

512
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:43,175
There's a thing called a Kongming Lantern.

513
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:46,824
You light a candle in the middle, and
the heated air inflates the lantern.

514
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:48,917
Then it can fly.

515
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,467
That's what your father makes.

516
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,232
But...

517
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:58,324
He makes something much much bigger.

518
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,549
Many times more impressive.

519
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,867
And it can lift very heavy
objects up into the sky.

520
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:07,842
That's how he writes his poems.

521
00:53:10,392 --> 00:53:12,767
He promised to write one for me.

522
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:42,842
This is the poem I wrote.
See if you like it.

523
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,250
See you tonight.

524
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:52,125
See you tonight.

525
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:35,641
Comrades. Three months from now,

526
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:37,665
the solid propellant engine
we are responsible for making

527
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,057
will be needed for a docking test

528
00:54:40,058 --> 00:54:41,991
with the rest of the rocket.

529
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:44,750
Three months to go, comrades.

530
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,550
Gauge the propellant.

531
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,474
0.8 mm, Master.

532
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:58,099
This is a tough battle.

533
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,807
But, when we succeed,

534
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:06,458
we will have our
satellite in space.

535
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:10,867
0.6 mm.

536
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,591
Here's the poem your father wrote for you.

537
00:55:13,592 --> 00:55:15,542
Just one line.

538
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,624
0.4 mm.

539
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,700
Here's another poem your
father wrote for you.

540
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,325
Get up.

541
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:58,820
It's raining.

542
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:17,166
Don't just stand there!

543
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,558
Close the window now!

544
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,816
They said there would be heavy rain,

545
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:26,773
those of us on overtime
were told to return home!

546
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:28,224
Dad!

547
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:30,292
Mom!

548
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,390
Brother!

549
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:35,366
Dad is back.

550
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:37,332
Where is he?

551
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,166
These houses can't
withstand heavy rain!

552
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,432
Dad!

553
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:43,216
Mom!

554
00:56:43,217 --> 00:56:46,065
Everyone please stay calm! Don't panic!

555
00:56:46,066 --> 00:56:47,891
They are sending people over to help!

556
00:56:47,892 --> 00:56:50,342
Dad.

557
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,390
- Are you two ok?
- Mom, what took you so long? I was scared.

558
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:56,991
- I'm here now.
- Where's Dad?

559
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:59,349
Don't be afraid. Come here.

560
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,557
Stay here.

561
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:04,100
Okay.

562
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:06,607
Where's dad?

563
00:57:06,608 --> 00:57:08,442
Your dad is working late.

564
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,092
Hey!

565
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:20,506
- Where are you going?
- Mom, don't leave me.

566
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:22,417
I'm not leaving.

567
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:33,183
Don't cry.

568
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:42,599
- Point the light in mom's direction.
- Okay.

569
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,591
Is my father dead?

570
00:57:59,592 --> 00:58:01,748
Come inside. Close the door.

571
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:04,158
I won't come in until you tell me.

572
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:07,516
We will talk inside.

573
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,641
Tell me quickly!

574
00:58:09,642 --> 00:58:11,541
Don't stand in the rain!

575
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:14,690
- Why won't you tell me?
- Come inside. We will talk inside.

576
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,242
What can't you tell me?

577
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,474
I've been going house to house.

578
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:29,624
All their fathers are back. Except mine.

579
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:31,892
Is he dead?

580
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,600
Yes, your father is dead.

581
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,457
You're lying.

582
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,015
My father isn't dead.

583
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,124
I want my father.

584
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,515
I'm your father now.

585
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,182
My father is a man, and you are a woman.

586
00:59:16,183 --> 00:59:17,682
I can do what your father did.

587
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,482
My father writes poems. You can't.

588
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:21,956
Forget about poems. We need to battle.

589
00:59:21,957 --> 00:59:24,773
My father can howl like a wolf. Can you?

590
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,316
My father spanks me.
You've never spanked me.

591
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,616
Don't make me.

592
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,600
Hit me then.

593
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,916
I don't hit you, huh? What about now?

594
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:38,407
It doesn't hurt.

595
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,173
- It doesn't hurt.
- Don't you talk back to me.

596
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:44,274
Mom, stop hitting.

597
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:47,199
I didn't hit you because I
didn't have the heart to.

598
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,283
Has your father really hit you before?

599
00:59:58,483 --> 01:00:01,457
My father and my father before him.

600
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:04,725
Are both dead.

601
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:10,299
Mom, stop hitting.

602
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,799
Mom, stop hitting.

603
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,724
Mom, stop hitting.

604
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:21,808
They're both dead.

605
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:41,342
Does it hurt?

606
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,432
You are late picking up your son today.
What's the holdup?

607
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,175
Long story.

608
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,391
The test failed.

609
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,108
We will try the new formulation tomorrow.

610
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,807
I hope my son was not too much trouble?

611
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:15,041
He's a sweet boy.

612
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,582
Then I will take him home now.

613
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:19,374
Maybe let him stay the night with us?

614
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,175
He may keep you up.

615
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,074
He already sleeps over all the time.
I don't want to impose.

616
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:27,341
It's not a bother.

617
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:30,423
Plus, I'm counting on your son to take
care of our little one in the future.

618
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:31,749
Go home and get some rest.

619
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,300
Okay.

620
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,467
Good luck with tomorrow's test.

621
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,633
I will take it.

622
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,982
I have a favor to ask.

623
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:14,558
Could you help me

624
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:20,567
hide his death from the children?

625
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,217
Especially Big Brother.

626
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:29,807
It would devastate him.

627
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:34,608
His biological
father also died here.

628
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:38,341
Starting today,

629
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:41,257
could all the male
comrades avoid going home?

630
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:42,974
Tell your family that
you're working overtime.

631
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:45,717
Before the mission
is complete, We...

632
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:51,266
We must not let the children
know that their father is gone.

633
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:24,360
Master

634
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,342
Are you alright, Master?

635
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:30,767
Do you need a break?

636
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,474
We don't have the time.

637
01:04:33,475 --> 01:04:35,441
The test is approaching.

638
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:37,342
0.2 mm.

639
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,258
Give me the number one blade.

640
01:04:48,892 --> 01:04:50,016
Gauge it.

641
01:04:50,017 --> 01:04:51,500
Okay.

642
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:56,980
Run!

643
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:33,475
Are you on a hunger strike?

644
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:40,050
There.

645
01:05:56,642 --> 01:05:59,099
The poem your father wrote for you.

646
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,850
Now it's finished.

647
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,991
My father didn't write it.

648
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:07,548
Listen to me. You are
turning ten next month.

649
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:09,331
I want to start treating you as an adult.

650
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,016
Let's talk like adults.

651
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:12,833
Can we do that?

652
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:33,206
Brother, can this really fly?

653
01:07:33,207 --> 01:07:35,506
I'll count down from three,
and we will let go, okay?

654
01:07:35,507 --> 01:07:36,541
Okay.

655
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:37,907
Three.

656
01:07:37,908 --> 01:07:39,041
Two.

657
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:40,508
One.

658
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:47,108
It's flying!

659
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:05,316
Mom. Please don't die!

660
01:08:05,317 --> 01:08:08,558
Please don't die!

661
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:15,950
It's possible that I could die too.

662
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,683
You won't die.

663
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:26,392
The thing that your father made
is similar to this lantern.

664
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:30,183
Both rely on the fire in the
middle to fly to the heavens.

665
01:08:31,067 --> 01:08:33,367
My job

666
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:37,708
is to make the fire.

667
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,275
But it's a dangerous job.

668
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,591
If something bad happens, I'll die too.

669
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:48,625
You won't die.

670
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,208
You never know.

671
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:57,642
In case I die,

672
01:08:58,408 --> 01:09:00,432
would you regret

673
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:03,175
still holding a grudge against your mother?

674
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:11,808
In our family,

675
01:09:12,717 --> 01:09:15,360
you're now the man of the house.

676
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,517
When Mom is not around,

677
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:26,025
you have to look after your sister for me.

678
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,825
Okay?

679
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,567
I'm sorry, child.

680
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,207
Your father and your mother

681
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:45,132
may not be there

682
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:47,250
to see you grow up.

683
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,999
Comrades.

684
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,424
This is our final test run.

685
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:12,016
We won't get a second chance.

686
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:13,291
Are we confident?

687
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,457
Yes.

688
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:15,599
Can we complete the mission?

689
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,475
Yes, we can.

690
01:10:54,575 --> 01:10:56,399
Brother.

691
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,892
If only Mom and Dad had
lived to see this day,

692
01:11:01,683 --> 01:11:04,842
they would be incredibly proud.

693
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:09,681
Their little girl who used
to be afraid of everything,

694
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:14,933
and now, she is an astronaut.

695
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:23,799
When mom passed a few
years ago, I made a wish.

696
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,933
I wanted too, to go up
there and write poems.

697
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:32,606
Comrade Commander-in-Chief,
Astronaut Shi Tiannuo

698
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,541
reporting for duty for this manned mission.

699
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,524
We're all set. Waiting for instructions.

700
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:47,641
Manned spacecraft Shenzhou has
entered the countdown phase.

701
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:52,474
Astronaut Shi Tiannuo is about to
embark on her first trip to space.

702
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:39,257
My children.

703
01:12:39,258 --> 01:12:41,324
If I could,

704
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:45,916
I would tell you all the
mysteries of this world.

705
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:49,916
I would tell you about our
great mountains and rivers.

706
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,475
About the rising sun and setting moon.

707
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:56,807
Our honor and dreams,

708
01:12:56,808 --> 01:13:00,475
frustrations and sorrows.

709
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:05,991
I would tell you, in making fuel,

710
01:13:05,992 --> 01:13:11,049
we light up ourselves to
illuminate the dreams of others.

711
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:15,831
In making rockets we
give up what is ours,

712
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:18,642
to achieve a collective vision.

713
01:13:19,442 --> 01:13:24,266
Life is to be used for a cause.

714
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:28,725
Death is affirmation of life

715
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,699
The vast universe

716
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,950
makes our death
so insignificant.

717
01:13:48,442 --> 01:13:51,174
Tiny dust particles

718
01:13:51,175 --> 01:13:54,017
are the beginning of the universe.

719
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:57,782
Our small steps today

720
01:13:57,783 --> 01:14:00,908
are the beginnings of greatness.

721
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,107
And you,

722
01:14:16,108 --> 01:14:18,724
my children,

723
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:21,307
give us, ordinary as we are,

724
01:14:21,308 --> 01:14:26,717
the will to begin creating
a beautiful new world.

725
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:17,374
My Father

726
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,957
My father's name is Zhao Pingyang.

727
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,808
He's got a big head
and a chubby body.

728
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:28,849
Ever since I was little,

729
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,141
people have said my father

730
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:31,391
disregards his responsibilities

731
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:33,349
and always tries to find the easy way out.

732
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,974
But I disagree.

733
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:39,199
My father is good at learning new things

734
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,224
and has great computation skills.

735
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:44,557
A sofa in the furniture
store costs? 95.7.

736
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,599
My father thinks that's too expensive,

737
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,641
so he spent? 0.31
on a carpentry book

738
01:16:50,642 --> 01:16:52,599
and drew up blueprints himself.

739
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,866
Then he spent? 8.5

740
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:58,599
on some scrap wood
and built a new sofa.

741
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,407
But then he ran into
yet another problem.

742
01:17:02,408 --> 01:17:03,599
While moving upstairs

743
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,725
the sofa got stuck in the stairwell.

744
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:11,041
Others said his efforts were wasted

745
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:13,891
but my dad faced the challenge head-on

746
01:17:13,892 --> 01:17:16,656
and came up with a brilliant idea.

747
01:17:16,657 --> 01:17:18,257
Lift!

748
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,282
Up, up!

749
01:17:19,283 --> 01:17:21,807
He made a pulley
and successfully

750
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:24,558
hoisted the sofa upstairs.

751
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,125
Let's go.

752
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:30,975
Watch out.

753
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:37,332
The sofa fit perfectly in our house.

754
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:39,306
My mom was particularly satisfied.

755
01:17:39,307 --> 01:17:40,699
What is this?

756
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,407
The zig zag bridge at City God Temple?

757
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,266
Are you doing puzzles here?

758
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:47,807
In the end the fabric,
the springs and the tools

759
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:50,849
cost? 31.06 in total.

760
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:53,016
My dad said that by building this sofa

761
01:17:53,017 --> 01:17:57,330
he basically earned? 64.64.

762
01:17:57,925 --> 01:18:00,249
My dad is also warm-hearted
towards the neighbors

763
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:03,232
and approaches comrades with enthusiasm.

764
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:06,874
My neighbors fought over
splitting water bills.

765
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:10,723
So my dad installed individual
water meters for each family.

766
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:14,723
The monthly water bill
was reduced by? 0.72.

767
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:16,999
The installation cost was earned
back in just a year and a half,

768
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,974
which the neighbors were happy to pay.

769
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:22,974
And they even praised
my dad as a central figure

770
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,655
in the realization of the four
modernization developing strategies.

771
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:29,499
My dad cares for the people.

772
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,082
He took time out of his busy schedule to

773
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:35,766
go to rural areas
and visits farmers.

774
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:38,766
After thorough research my dad decided to

775
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:42,808
help them expand their
product distribution channels.

776
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:45,307
He was particularly supportive of

777
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:48,891
the duck eggs selling in
the production brigade.

778
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,916
One kilogram of duck eggs costs? 1.5,

779
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:55,324
and once transported to the
city it is sold for? 1.9.

780
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:57,307
15 kilograms each time,

781
01:18:57,308 --> 01:18:59,641
minus 10 % in incidental fees,

782
01:18:59,642 --> 01:19:02,941
and he could earn? 5.4.

783
01:19:02,942 --> 01:19:06,931
The other day my dad was appointed by
his factory to attend the Canton Fair.

784
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:09,307
Unintimidated by neither
hardship nor fatigue.

785
01:19:09,308 --> 01:19:11,182
He brought back 40 cute tropical fish

786
01:19:11,183 --> 01:19:14,099
from Guangzhou,
which greatly enriched

787
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,141
Uncle Jiang's life after retirement.

788
01:19:18,142 --> 01:19:22,124
My dad spent? 0.2 on each fish, which
he sold for? 0.5 to Uncle Jiang.

789
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:25,590
Subtracting? 1.7 for the fish tank and?
0.05 the tube,

790
01:19:25,591 --> 01:19:31,291
this time my dad earned another? 10.25.

791
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:35,999
My dad is also strict with
himself and never wastes money.

792
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,916
It takes? 0.04 to make a three-minute
call on a public telephone.

793
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:41,707
He keeps an eye on his watch
every time he makes a call

794
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,224
and hangs up the phone

795
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:45,016
at exactly two minutes
and fifty-nine seconds,

796
01:19:45,017 --> 01:19:47,700
refusing to spend an extra? 0.04.

797
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,317
Hello

798
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:59,750
Six Seven Eight

799
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,766
And so because of all these virtues,

800
01:20:02,767 --> 01:20:05,940
my dad has become the most pupolar
person in our neighborhood.

801
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:09,865
He has told everyone that in the future
there will be phones without cords,

802
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:12,824
trains without wheels,

803
01:20:12,825 --> 01:20:15,266
bridges over the Huangpu River,

804
01:20:15,267 --> 01:20:17,691
and skyscrapers in Pudong.

805
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:19,124
Some of the neighbors don't believe him

806
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,607
and say he's speaking nonsense.

807
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,174
There is a saying

808
01:20:23,175 --> 01:20:25,249
The duck is a prophet of spring
when the river becomes warm.

809
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,557
The duck what?

810
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:28,057
The duck prophet.

811
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:29,749
I see.

812
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,867
So you are this duck.

813
01:20:34,517 --> 01:20:35,849
And so from that day on,

814
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:39,682
my dad was given a
nickname The duck prophet

815
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:41,457
The duck prophet is coming back.

816
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:45,641
Through his hard work,
my family has? 386.5

817
01:20:45,642 --> 01:20:47,225
in savings now.

818
01:20:49,308 --> 01:20:50,866
My dad was also appointed as

819
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:53,541
the sales manager at the 2nd
Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory.

820
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,749
Their product sales have since
continuously reached record-breaking highs.

821
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:00,098
I must learn from my
dad and train myself to be

822
01:21:00,099 --> 01:21:03,175
a useful person to the people.

823
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:08,891
Zhao Xiaodong's
essay is lively and vivid,

824
01:21:08,892 --> 01:21:10,557
which is something worth learning from.

825
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,532
Ms. Qian, He's bragging!

826
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:14,566
We're neighbors.

827
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:16,266
Since his dad was
appointed as sales manager,

828
01:21:16,267 --> 01:21:18,699
the company's medicinal wine
hasn't been selling well at all.

829
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,798
If you don't believe me, just
go to his house and look.

830
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:24,799
His entire house is packed
with medicinal wine.

831
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,141
His dad has spent all their money

832
01:21:26,142 --> 01:21:27,806
- on buying the medicinal wine
- Stop it

833
01:21:27,807 --> 01:21:31,031
and their savings dropped into
the negatives a long time ago.

834
01:21:31,032 --> 01:21:33,831
His dad was also kicked out
of their house by his mom.

835
01:21:33,832 --> 01:21:36,106
Go live in your father's house
or else we get a divorce.

836
01:21:36,107 --> 01:21:39,457
And now they're
about to divorce.

837
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,699
It's not true. You're lying.

838
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,807
Do you know who his father is?

839
01:21:43,808 --> 01:21:45,116
Who is he?

840
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:48,715
There used to be a man who always sold
duck eggs in front of our school gate.

841
01:21:48,716 --> 01:21:51,367
And that man is his father.

842
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,523
Embarrassed by his father,

843
01:21:54,524 --> 01:21:57,157
Dongdong avoided him
every day after school.

844
01:21:57,158 --> 01:21:59,341
I can pay for it, all right?

845
01:21:59,342 --> 01:22:00,141
Duck prophet!

846
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:00,883
Yes!

847
01:22:00,884 --> 01:22:06,015
Duck prophet!

848
01:22:06,016 --> 01:22:06,866
Stop it!

849
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:07,932
Be quiet!

850
01:22:07,933 --> 01:22:10,017
Put it down!

851
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:25,532
Mr. Zhao, I can understand that kids often
put their parents on a pedestal in essays.

852
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:28,516
But what kind of person would
you like Dongdong to be?

853
01:22:28,517 --> 01:22:30,557
You can't let him solely
pursue materialistic goals.

854
01:22:30,558 --> 01:22:32,349
He must also have spiritual pursuits.

855
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,898
You need to encourage him to
be more like Chen Jingrun,

856
01:22:34,899 --> 01:22:38,124
someone who makes significant contributions to
our country even without sitting on a couch.

857
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,082
I never prevented him from
becoming more like Chen Jingrun.

858
01:22:46,142 --> 01:22:48,449
Then what's the deal with
all the wine at your house?

859
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,099
This Ginseng Longan Wine is

860
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,641
produced by our factory - The 2nd
Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory.

861
01:22:51,642 --> 01:22:53,557
It's made from a traditional
recipe with real ingredients.

862
01:22:53,558 --> 01:22:56,099
But I'd like to sell it
in an untraditional way.

863
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,016
Comrade Duck Prophet,

864
01:22:58,017 --> 01:22:59,974
as a sales manager at
a state-owned factory,

865
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,806
please don't focus your attention
on such crooked methods.

866
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:06,206
All the students are
laughing at Dongdong now.

867
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:08,874
Go home and do some self-reflection.

868
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,575
Put it in the bag.

869
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:25,441
That's Dongdong and his dad.

870
01:23:25,442 --> 01:23:27,031
Dongdong and his dad.

871
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:29,333
Isn't that the Duck Prophet?

872
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:45,225
Dongdong, come here.

873
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:49,475
Dongdong. Hurry up, Dongdong!

874
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,175
Hurry!

875
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,165
Dongdong, come up quickly.

876
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:57,090
- Don't push. It's overcrowded already.
- Dongdong, hurry up.

877
01:23:57,091 --> 01:23:58,859
- Just get off.
- Make some room.

878
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,499
Come on, come on.

879
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,681
- Dongdong. Dongdong, hurry up.
- Get off.

880
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:04,200
Dongdong.

881
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:15,641
What's wrong? Are you upset with me?

882
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:17,224
Did I embarrass you?

883
01:24:17,225 --> 01:24:19,260
Yes, you did.

884
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:24,356
I'll behave better next time
and try to make you proud.

885
01:24:24,357 --> 01:24:26,366
When is next time?

886
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:29,100
Next time is just next time.

887
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,392
Mom.

888
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:57,124
Let me do it.

889
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,682
Honey I'm so grateful for you.

890
01:24:58,683 --> 01:25:00,349
Why did he bring you home today?

891
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:03,632
I passed by the school today, so I
picked him up and brought him home.

892
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:10,174
Honey. This is your favorite dessert.

893
01:25:10,175 --> 01:25:12,582
- I'm not going back tonight.
- Cut it out.

894
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:15,915
You and your horrible wine get out of
this house together and go to your dad's.

895
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,891
What you just said isn't objective.

896
01:25:17,892 --> 01:25:21,298
This wine is at the very least made from a
traditional recipe, with real ingredients.

897
01:25:21,299 --> 01:25:22,624
How could it be horrible?

898
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:25,016
Plus, we already bought
a sewing machine,

899
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:27,449
which means our
life is pretty good.

900
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:29,407
How dare you say that?

901
01:25:29,408 --> 01:25:30,557
Are you out of your mind?

902
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,823
If you hadn't promised to sell
thousands of bottle of wine in a year,

903
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,723
would your factory have
overstocked so much wine?

904
01:25:35,724 --> 01:25:39,656
And as if that wasn't enough, you continued
to bite off more than you can chew.

905
01:25:39,657 --> 01:25:41,349
As you know, this house
wasn't big to begin with,

906
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:45,207
but now we have got
neither money nor space.

907
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:48,673
I went to No.1 Food store on Nanjing
road today and convinced them

908
01:25:48,674 --> 01:25:50,307
to sell our wine from next month on.

909
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:51,965
The distribution channel is alreadu opened.

910
01:25:51,966 --> 01:25:53,166
Just keep bragging!

911
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,807
Do you think I'll still believe in you?

912
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:57,631
Let me tell you, Zhao Pingyang.
This is my last warning.

913
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,374
You must get rid of this
terrible wine within a month.

914
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:04,099
Either you drink it all or
pour it into the Huangpu River.

915
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,025
Does it taste good?

916
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,599
Don't worry. It's fine.

917
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,474
Your mom has more bark than bite.

918
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:24,916
Are you sure you can sell all the wine?

919
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:25,932
Are you bragging again?

920
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:27,724
How come you don't believe me either?

921
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,266
I've already come up with a solution.

922
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,381
But to implement this solution,
I need you to do me a favor.

923
01:26:31,382 --> 01:26:33,116
What is it?

924
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:37,407
Little Fatty. Did you expose
Dongdong in school today?

925
01:26:37,408 --> 01:26:39,149
Who told you my wine is not selling well?

926
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:41,082
It's... My dad.

927
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,557
I knew it was him.

928
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:44,807
I'm running around every
day doing actual things,

929
01:26:44,808 --> 01:26:46,923
while your dad just smokes, drinks tea and
reads the newspaper all day in the office.

930
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:48,432
He's in no position to criticize me.

931
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:51,565
If I sell all the wine within a
month, you must apologize to Dongdong.

932
01:26:51,566 --> 01:26:55,440
Otherwise I'll cut your big ears
off and have them with my wine.

933
01:26:55,441 --> 01:26:59,740
Little Fatty's big ears are getting
even bigger. It's a sign of good luck.

934
01:26:59,741 --> 01:27:01,607
Didn't I tell you to go home
and finish your homework?

935
01:27:01,608 --> 01:27:02,932
Then why are you still here?

936
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:04,642
Go home.

937
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:09,066
Kicked out by your wife?

938
01:27:09,067 --> 01:27:12,107
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
What do you know?

939
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:20,250
You remember the lines, right?

940
01:27:23,517 --> 01:27:27,165
Suppose your mom and I actually
get a divorce, what would you do?

941
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,599
Would you choose your mom or me?

942
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,267
Mom.

943
01:27:30,975 --> 01:27:33,550
Listen, we're not
going to get a divorce.

944
01:27:36,683 --> 01:27:40,741
Don't sulk. You must work with me after
getting on the bus. Did you hear me?

945
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:49,406
Oh my gosh! Buddy.

946
01:27:49,407 --> 01:27:52,115
Please don't knock
over my medicinal wine.

947
01:27:52,116 --> 01:27:53,615
Mister, mister.

948
01:27:53,616 --> 01:27:56,723
Are you holding the
Ginseng Longan Wine?

949
01:27:56,724 --> 01:27:58,790
Yes. It is. How did you know?

950
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:00,474
My grandpa is very fond of it.

951
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,366
He said there is longan,
Yu zhu and ginseng in it.

952
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:04,391
With real ingredients,

953
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:05,724
it not only boosts vitality
and nourishes blood,

954
01:28:05,725 --> 01:28:06,782
promotes fluid production
and benefits the lungs,

955
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:08,824
but also relax muscles
and improves eyesight.

956
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,806
Since he's begun to drink this wine, my
grandpa has been eating well, sleeping well,

957
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:13,449
glowing with health
and jumping high,

958
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:16,091
as if he's suddenly ten years younger.

959
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:20,331
Really? Then you should definitely tell
your grandpa to drink more of this wine.

960
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:22,531
Where did you get this?
How much did it cost?

961
01:28:22,532 --> 01:28:24,641
The usual price is? 30.

962
01:28:24,642 --> 01:28:28,390
But I know someone from the
factory so I got it for only? 18

963
01:28:28,391 --> 01:28:30,057
Then if my grandpa buys it from you,

964
01:28:30,058 --> 01:28:32,240
could you make it a bit cheaper
so he can buy a bottle too?

965
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:34,224
In that case I'll be bankrupt!

966
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:36,282
But on behalf of the admirable
care you give your grandpa,

967
01:28:36,283 --> 01:28:38,599
I'll make it? 16 for you.

968
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,307
Wow, that's a steal.

969
01:28:40,308 --> 01:28:43,325
Then my grandpa must buy more.

970
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:52,641
Treasure!

971
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:55,099
What a Treasure!

972
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:58,474
Longan, Yu zhu, Ginseng,
with real ingredients.

973
01:28:58,475 --> 01:29:02,190
If my grandpa wants to buy from
you, please just sell him a bottle.

974
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:04,299
Relaxes the muscles
and improves eyesight.

975
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:08,049
Mister, please sell it to me.

976
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,490
I need replenishment too.

977
01:29:09,491 --> 01:29:11,473
- Boosts vitality and nourishes blood, - promotes
fluid production and benefits the lungs.

978
01:29:11,474 --> 01:29:14,874
Mister I'm begging you to sell me this.

979
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:15,766
Mister.

980
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:18,391
You are a living Lei Feng,
sacrificing yourself for others.

981
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:21,731
Our whole family will remember
your kindness forever.

982
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:23,166
Oh my gosh!

983
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:26,998
Is this the legendary
Ginseng Longan Wine?

984
01:29:26,999 --> 01:29:27,849
Eat well.

985
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:28,641
Sleep well.

986
01:29:28,642 --> 01:29:29,349
Jump high.

987
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:30,266
Leap far.

988
01:29:30,267 --> 01:29:31,282
Glow with health.

989
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:33,350
Jump high.

990
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:35,932
Do you want some?

991
01:29:35,933 --> 01:29:37,682
No.

992
01:29:37,683 --> 01:29:40,098
Mister, I must criticize you.

993
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:41,307
Don't you think it's very selfish of you

994
01:29:41,308 --> 01:29:43,949
to not sell me any of the wine?

995
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,741
Honey, should we buy two bottles
of the wine for your dad?

996
01:29:47,742 --> 01:29:49,016
It's too expensive.

997
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:53,490
It will make your dad happy, which
means you won't beat me again.

998
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:55,349
I'll take two bottles.

999
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:57,792
Duck Prophet.

1000
01:30:02,433 --> 01:30:04,073
I've been watching you for quite a while.

1001
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:06,182
When was your son adopted by others?

1002
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:07,475
How did I not know?

1003
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,766
I can't believe you called him mister.

1004
01:30:10,767 --> 01:30:12,007
Why don't you call him comrade?

1005
01:30:13,475 --> 01:30:15,017
Comrade, please don't be fooled.

1006
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:16,808
This guy is

1007
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,940
the sales manager at a
pharmaceutical factory.

1008
01:30:19,392 --> 01:30:20,807
And this boy is his son.

1009
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:23,100
What they're trying to
sell is in very low demand.

1010
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:24,932
It's not!

1011
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:26,807
There's nothing wrong with the quality.

1012
01:30:26,808 --> 01:30:27,892
Nonsense.

1013
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:05,224
We have everything we need, right?

1014
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:06,225
Yes.

1015
01:31:06,975 --> 01:31:07,975
Comrades,

1016
01:31:08,517 --> 01:31:10,016
are you working for the
Shanghai TV Station?

1017
01:31:10,017 --> 01:31:12,057
Are you doing news reporting?

1018
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:14,858
We're going to film the retirement
home for the Double Ninth Festival.

1019
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:16,266
What a coincidence!

1020
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:17,932
I work for the 2nd Traditional
Pharmaceutical Factory.

1021
01:31:17,933 --> 01:31:19,641
We're also going to visit the elderly

1022
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,849
at their retirement home for
the Double Ninth Festival.

1023
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,849
Could you film our visit as well?

1024
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:24,850
Sure.

1025
01:31:32,017 --> 01:31:33,017
Cut.

1026
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:34,057
Good.

1027
01:31:34,058 --> 01:31:35,349
You done?

1028
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,932
Done.

1029
01:31:35,933 --> 01:31:38,057
Director, could you
film one more shot

1030
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:39,224
of me opening the bottle

1031
01:31:39,225 --> 01:31:40,266
and the elderly drinking the wine

1032
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:41,932
and their satisfied smiles?

1033
01:31:41,933 --> 01:31:43,433
No. No.

1034
01:31:44,017 --> 01:31:45,641
This is not how we do news reports.

1035
01:31:45,642 --> 01:31:47,516
Then could you take one more close-up shot

1036
01:31:47,517 --> 01:31:49,766
and make sure our brand
logo is big and clear?

1037
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:50,767
Close-up?

1038
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:53,307
Do you have any idea how much it costs

1039
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:54,599
for a 10-second shot?

1040
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,182
How much?

1041
01:31:55,183 --> 01:31:56,557
Enough to buy 25 kilos of pork belly.

1042
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:58,141
Our factory can pay for it.

1043
01:31:58,142 --> 01:31:59,224
It's not something you can just pay for.

1044
01:31:59,225 --> 01:32:00,849
We are not making an advertisement for you.

1045
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:01,724
Advertisement?

1046
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:02,725
What is an advertisement?

1047
01:32:03,517 --> 01:32:04,266
Mr. Feng,

1048
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:06,100
the elderly performing Tai Chi are ready.

1049
01:32:11,433 --> 01:32:13,724
Young Comrade, what
is an advertisement?

1050
01:32:13,725 --> 01:32:14,891
An advertisement is

1051
01:32:14,892 --> 01:32:17,016
a very short film broadcasted on TV,

1052
01:32:17,017 --> 01:32:18,641
aimed at promoting and selling products.

1053
01:32:18,642 --> 01:32:19,599
That's great!

1054
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,599
It suits us.

1055
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,760
Can we film an advertisement?

1056
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:25,266
We don't have that
in China only abroad.

1057
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,932
Our TV station never broadcasts ads.

1058
01:32:26,933 --> 01:32:28,693
Never before but never
in the future either?

1059
01:32:30,058 --> 01:32:31,432
I'm not sure.

1060
01:32:31,433 --> 01:32:33,432
But there are articles
about this in the paper

1061
01:32:33,433 --> 01:32:34,953
and our leaders are discussing it too.

1062
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:36,807
Well how about

1063
01:32:36,808 --> 01:32:37,891
if I hire you to make an advertisement,

1064
01:32:37,892 --> 01:32:38,892
would you do it?

1065
01:32:39,517 --> 01:32:40,557
I could.

1066
01:32:40,558 --> 01:32:41,758
But you'll have to pay for it.

1067
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:43,891
Either way Mr. Feng won't agree to it.

1068
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,307
I'm not asking Feng.

1069
01:32:45,308 --> 01:32:46,350
I'm asking you.

1070
01:32:48,392 --> 01:32:49,512
May I have your name please?

1071
01:32:50,017 --> 01:32:51,474
You can call me Xiao Ma.

1072
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:52,517
Director Ma.

1073
01:32:57,642 --> 01:32:58,642
Advertisement?

1074
01:32:59,392 --> 01:33:01,451
Do you know anyone who's
made an advertisement before?

1075
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,224
I've talked about it to a
senior staff at the TV station.

1076
01:33:03,225 --> 01:33:05,932
According to reliable
sources, it's probable that

1077
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,141
they'll start broadcasting ads soon.

1078
01:33:07,142 --> 01:33:08,391
We must seize this opportunity.

1079
01:33:08,392 --> 01:33:10,312
It could be the first TV
advertisement in China.

1080
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:13,266
Manager Zhao, I have
a TV set in my house

1081
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:14,267
which I watch everyday.

1082
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,599
But I have never seen
anything like you described.

1083
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,849
Do you think I'm
stupid enough to pay for

1084
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,016
something I've never seen before?

1085
01:33:22,017 --> 01:33:23,017
It won't cost very much.

1086
01:33:23,558 --> 01:33:24,558
Stop talking.

1087
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:28,474
We now have an abundance of wine in stock

1088
01:33:28,475 --> 01:33:30,475
just because I believed
in what you have said.

1089
01:33:33,183 --> 01:33:35,224
Please think about some
practical solutions.

1090
01:33:35,225 --> 01:33:36,225
Don't shoot for the moon.

1091
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:38,724
Do you drink this wine?

1092
01:33:38,725 --> 01:33:39,182
I don't drink wine.

1093
01:33:39,183 --> 01:33:40,475
Do you think I can drink it all?

1094
01:33:41,017 --> 01:33:42,141
Do you know what an advertisement is?

1095
01:33:42,142 --> 01:33:42,724
What is it?

1096
01:33:42,725 --> 01:33:43,641
You don't even know what
an advertisement is.

1097
01:33:43,642 --> 01:33:46,016
Dongdong, please listen to me.

1098
01:33:46,017 --> 01:33:47,557
Your mom has demanded that I sell

1099
01:33:47,558 --> 01:33:48,974
all the wine within a month, right?

1100
01:33:48,975 --> 01:33:50,266
There are only 15 days left as of today.

1101
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:51,724
So you have to help me get

1102
01:33:51,725 --> 01:33:52,891
the key to the wooden chest,

1103
01:33:52,892 --> 01:33:53,974
and take out the household
registration booklet inside,

1104
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:56,766
in case your mom is going
to divorce me in a rage.

1105
01:33:56,767 --> 01:33:58,557
I don't think you actually want
the household registration booklet.

1106
01:33:58,558 --> 01:34:01,118
You just want me to steal my mom's
money for your advertisement.

1107
01:34:02,433 --> 01:34:04,349
My boy is smart indeed.

1108
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,766
It's not stealing but simply borrowing

1109
01:34:05,767 --> 01:34:07,474
your mom's money to make an ad.

1110
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:08,224
When the advertisement is done,

1111
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,505
our family will also be secured.

1112
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:17,891
Dongdong.

1113
01:34:17,892 --> 01:34:18,892
Dongdong.

1114
01:34:22,683 --> 01:34:24,182
This is the only money we have left.

1115
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:26,223
Mom will definitely divorce
you once she finds out.

1116
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,600
I know.

1117
01:34:28,225 --> 01:34:29,557
Do you remember what I said before

1118
01:34:29,558 --> 01:34:31,868
The duck is a prophet of spring
when the river becomes warm.

1119
01:34:31,892 --> 01:34:33,224
It is only because the duck
isn't afraid to go into the river

1120
01:34:33,225 --> 01:34:34,432
that it is able to feel
when the water becomes warm

1121
01:34:34,433 --> 01:34:35,474
and able to capture fish.

1122
01:34:35,475 --> 01:34:36,182
Always be

1123
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:38,682
the first duck brave enough
to jump into the river.

1124
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:40,807
But I feel we're already in the river.

1125
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:41,808
Right,

1126
01:34:42,308 --> 01:34:45,016
Then do you dare to be a brave duck?

1127
01:34:45,017 --> 01:34:46,017
Yes.

1128
01:34:46,683 --> 01:34:47,683
My good boy.

1129
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:06,599
Mom, give me the key.

1130
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,682
Where's yours?

1131
01:35:07,683 --> 01:35:08,683
I left it home.

1132
01:35:09,433 --> 01:35:10,833
Why didn't you leave yourself home?

1133
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:15,182
Finish your homework first
and don't mess around.

1134
01:35:15,183 --> 01:35:16,183
OK.

1135
01:35:43,183 --> 01:35:45,391
Today is my first date with Zhao.

1136
01:35:45,392 --> 01:35:46,599
He's a good guy.

1137
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,808
It's the happiest day in my life.

1138
01:35:53,017 --> 01:35:54,017
Have another pork chop.

1139
01:35:55,225 --> 01:35:56,807
I've already figured out the story.

1140
01:35:56,808 --> 01:35:57,932
A minute and a half in total.

1141
01:35:57,933 --> 01:35:58,641
The story will be about

1142
01:35:58,642 --> 01:35:59,974
a family of three that goes to a store

1143
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:00,974
to buy the Ginseng Longan Wine

1144
01:36:00,975 --> 01:36:02,807
as a gift for their grandpa,
who is very satisfied

1145
01:36:02,808 --> 01:36:03,808
after drinking the wine.

1146
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:09,141
Manager Zhao, thank
you for the noodles.

1147
01:36:09,142 --> 01:36:11,099
But this is very difficult.

1148
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,975
You asked for money
which I got now.

1149
01:36:14,225 --> 01:36:15,266
Even if I could

1150
01:36:15,267 --> 01:36:17,349
get a hold of the camera by using
news reporting as an excuse,

1151
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,182
what about the film negatives?

1152
01:36:19,183 --> 01:36:20,724
It requires four leaders' signatures

1153
01:36:20,725 --> 01:36:22,099
to get the negatives.

1154
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,891
Then we'll buy some.

1155
01:36:22,892 --> 01:36:24,849
Have you seen a store
that sells film negatives?

1156
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:27,182
It's not something you can just buy.

1157
01:36:27,183 --> 01:36:28,974
Without a letter of introduction,

1158
01:36:28,975 --> 01:36:30,099
you can't even hire

1159
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,420
actors or book filming locations.

1160
01:36:32,183 --> 01:36:33,600
Just forget it.

1161
01:36:35,017 --> 01:36:36,017
Xiao Ma,

1162
01:36:36,475 --> 01:36:37,475
Director Ma.

1163
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,682
We had a deal.

1164
01:36:38,683 --> 01:36:39,808
You can't just give up now.

1165
01:36:41,308 --> 01:36:43,183
Come on, think about it.

1166
01:36:43,725 --> 01:36:45,224
If the advertisement is well filmed,

1167
01:36:45,225 --> 01:36:46,266
then you would be the first TV ad director

1168
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,017
in all of China.

1169
01:36:48,558 --> 01:36:49,807
The first one.

1170
01:36:49,808 --> 01:36:51,141
The progenitor.

1171
01:36:51,142 --> 01:36:52,391
The founder.

1172
01:36:52,392 --> 01:36:53,557
I'll take care of the film negatives

1173
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:54,599
and the actors.

1174
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,641
You just let me know what your

1175
01:36:55,642 --> 01:36:57,162
requests are for the filming location.

1176
01:36:59,183 --> 01:37:00,141
It should be a place with grandeur.

1177
01:37:00,142 --> 01:37:00,891
Yes.

1178
01:37:00,892 --> 01:37:01,432
Style.

1179
01:37:01,433 --> 01:37:02,016
Yes.

1180
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:03,017
And a feeling of

1181
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,724
natural and harmonious.

1182
01:37:05,725 --> 01:37:06,925
Then we can do it in my house.

1183
01:37:07,433 --> 01:37:09,224
Waiter, another bowl
of noodles please.

1184
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:10,225
Got it.

1185
01:37:23,892 --> 01:37:25,307
The unexposed head of negative reels

1186
01:37:25,308 --> 01:37:26,599
are supposed to be discarded,

1187
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,599
but I think it's quite a waste,

1188
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,724
so I've been keeping them for years.

1189
01:37:28,725 --> 01:37:30,474
Luckily, they're long
enough for your short film.

1190
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:31,724
They're already spliced together.
Here you go.

1191
01:37:31,725 --> 01:37:32,725
Thank you.

1192
01:37:37,267 --> 01:37:38,767
How dare you come here?

1193
01:37:39,725 --> 01:37:41,307
The fish you have sold me last time

1194
01:37:41,308 --> 01:37:42,557
turned upside down within a few days.

1195
01:37:42,558 --> 01:37:43,558
Not even.

1196
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,974
They died on the night we bought them.

1197
01:37:45,975 --> 01:37:47,141
Give my? 20 back.

1198
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:49,849
I will give you? 30 and
you can keep the change.

1199
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:50,975
Just do me a favor.

1200
01:37:53,683 --> 01:37:54,474
Look.

1201
01:37:54,475 --> 01:37:56,599
You'll have the opportunity
to be on the cover.

1202
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,474
I've already told you Zhao Pingyang.

1203
01:37:58,475 --> 01:38:00,307
I've never thought about
becoming an actress.

1204
01:38:00,308 --> 01:38:01,266
You're such a beautiful lady.

1205
01:38:01,267 --> 01:38:03,224
It'd be a shame if you
don't go into acting.

1206
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:04,724
You should come too, Xiao Mei.

1207
01:38:04,725 --> 01:38:06,267
I'll make you a movie star.

1208
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:10,349
On your birthday

1209
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,557
we're going to film at the
drugstore in the morning

1210
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:12,682
and at our house in the afternoon.

1211
01:38:12,683 --> 01:38:14,557
What I'm sayning now is very crucial.

1212
01:38:14,558 --> 01:38:16,141
You have to let your mom take you out

1213
01:38:16,142 --> 01:38:17,474
to Nanjing Road and stay there for 6 hours.

1214
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:18,974
You can't come back home
until the time is up

1215
01:38:18,975 --> 01:38:19,974
It's all or nothing.

1216
01:38:19,975 --> 01:38:22,095
This is called luring the
enemy away from their base.

1217
01:38:22,933 --> 01:38:23,849
What are you looking at?

1218
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:24,850
Nothing.

1219
01:38:33,267 --> 01:38:34,267
Hurry up!

1220
01:38:38,808 --> 01:38:39,599
Everyone must move quickly.

1221
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,474
We've only got 6 hours in total

1222
01:38:40,475 --> 01:38:41,807
to film the rest of the shots.

1223
01:38:41,808 --> 01:38:43,432
We must remember the original
location of all the furniture

1224
01:38:43,433 --> 01:38:44,516
and put everything back after we're done

1225
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:46,392
My wife must not spot any difference.

1226
01:38:57,808 --> 01:38:59,724
Dongdong, it's
your birthday today.

1227
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:02,433
I'll let you have
anything you want.

1228
01:39:04,308 --> 01:39:05,308
Mom.

1229
01:39:06,142 --> 01:39:07,432
I want to have some pork mooncakes.

1230
01:39:07,433 --> 01:39:08,433
Sure.

1231
01:39:08,933 --> 01:39:09,933
The line is so long.

1232
01:39:10,975 --> 01:39:11,641
Let's go.

1233
01:39:11,642 --> 01:39:13,368
A long line means the
mooncakes must be yummy.

1234
01:39:13,392 --> 01:39:14,792
I want to have some pork mooncakes.

1235
01:39:21,392 --> 01:39:22,992
If there's no line, then it's not yummy?

1236
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:24,766
Let's rehearse it first.

1237
01:39:24,767 --> 01:39:25,724
Ready.

1238
01:39:25,725 --> 01:39:26,725
Action!

1239
01:39:28,767 --> 01:39:31,099
Father, this is a
present for you.

1240
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,682
Ginseng Longan Wine.

1241
01:39:32,683 --> 01:39:35,807
May you be healthy,
live long and prosper.

1242
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,808
Cut.

1243
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,474
That's too pompous.

1244
01:39:39,475 --> 01:39:40,516
Oh.

1245
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:41,016
Be lifelike.

1246
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:41,432
Oh.

1247
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:41,849
Be natural.

1248
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:42,682
Oh.

1249
01:39:42,683 --> 01:39:43,016
Ok?

1250
01:39:43,017 --> 01:39:43,432
I got it.

1251
01:39:43,433 --> 01:39:44,433
Be more lifelike.

1252
01:39:45,225 --> 01:39:46,225
Sorry.

1253
01:39:46,683 --> 01:39:47,599
Right.

1254
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,600
Let's do a first take.

1255
01:39:51,433 --> 01:39:52,433
Rolling.

1256
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:53,767
Action!

1257
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:57,433
Dad, This Gingan
Lonseng Wine is for you.

1258
01:39:58,308 --> 01:39:59,891
Sorry I mispronounced words.

1259
01:39:59,892 --> 01:40:00,892
Cut.

1260
01:40:02,683 --> 01:40:04,016
Why did you look at the camera?

1261
01:40:04,017 --> 01:40:05,017
I'm sorry.

1262
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,182
Don't be nervous.

1263
01:40:06,183 --> 01:40:07,349
You make mistakes more easily when nervous.

1264
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:08,350
Take a deep breath.

1265
01:40:09,808 --> 01:40:10,932
Adjust my relaxing.

1266
01:40:10,933 --> 01:40:12,225
No. Adjust my breathing.

1267
01:40:14,058 --> 01:40:15,683
Just relax.

1268
01:40:18,225 --> 01:40:19,225
Rolling.

1269
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:23,183
Action!

1270
01:40:23,558 --> 01:40:25,225
Dad, This is a father for you.

1271
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:34,600
Don't buy this. Let's go.

1272
01:40:35,225 --> 01:40:36,391
Mom, I'm still hungry.

1273
01:40:36,392 --> 01:40:37,307
I'm exhausted.

1274
01:40:37,308 --> 01:40:38,474
Stop eating.

1275
01:40:38,475 --> 01:40:40,474
Mom, I'd also like
to go to the cinema.

1276
01:40:40,475 --> 01:40:41,755
Which film do you want to watch?

1277
01:40:42,392 --> 01:40:43,433
Manhunt.

1278
01:40:44,142 --> 01:40:46,183
You've already seen it
six times with your dad.

1279
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:49,412
Then I want to see Mistress Xiang Lin.

1280
01:40:49,975 --> 01:40:51,517
Do you have any idea who she is?

1281
01:40:52,267 --> 01:40:54,350
I think She looks
like my grandma.

1282
01:40:55,267 --> 01:40:56,267
Let's go.

1283
01:40:56,475 --> 01:40:57,724
Your grandma?

1284
01:40:57,725 --> 01:40:58,725
Dongdong.

1285
01:40:59,767 --> 01:41:00,975
Watch the car.

1286
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:05,349
Cut.

1287
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,391
This shot is done.

1288
01:41:06,392 --> 01:41:07,682
Let's do a close-up.

1289
01:41:07,683 --> 01:41:08,474
Move the light.

1290
01:41:08,475 --> 01:41:10,224
Director, how
many shots are left?

1291
01:41:10,225 --> 01:41:11,474
Quite a few.

1292
01:41:11,475 --> 01:41:12,475
Come on. Be quick.

1293
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:31,475
Mom, I'd like to
watch the film again.

1294
01:41:32,892 --> 01:41:35,017
Why do you like this film so much?

1295
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:36,724
Let's go home.

1296
01:41:36,725 --> 01:41:37,725
Let's go.

1297
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:41,642
What's wrong?

1298
01:41:41,975 --> 01:41:42,974
What's wrong?

1299
01:41:42,975 --> 01:41:44,557
Mom, I have a stomachache.

1300
01:41:44,558 --> 01:41:45,016
Where?

1301
01:41:45,017 --> 01:41:45,932
Here?

1302
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,267
Yes.

1303
01:41:52,558 --> 01:41:53,974
Look at you!

1304
01:41:53,975 --> 01:41:56,215
You ate so much it's no
surprise you have a stomachache.

1305
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:03,641
Does it hurt here?

1306
01:42:03,642 --> 01:42:04,349
Yes, it does.

1307
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,350
Take it easy.

1308
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,932
What about here?

1309
01:42:06,933 --> 01:42:07,933
Yes.

1310
01:42:08,517 --> 01:42:09,642
It's quite serious.

1311
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:12,474
You'll need a few
acupuncture treatments.

1312
01:42:12,475 --> 01:42:13,475
Acupuncture.

1313
01:42:14,267 --> 01:42:16,517
Mom, I suddenly feel fine.

1314
01:42:17,142 --> 01:42:18,557
What's the matter with you?

1315
01:42:18,558 --> 01:42:20,099
That's weird.

1316
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,308
Oh well I just farted.

1317
01:42:24,808 --> 01:42:25,892
That is weird.

1318
01:42:28,933 --> 01:42:30,224
The light is too dim now.

1319
01:42:30,225 --> 01:42:31,284
Change it to a brighter light.

1320
01:42:31,308 --> 01:42:31,849
Quickly.

1321
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:32,641
I think it's fine.

1322
01:42:32,642 --> 01:42:33,642
No. It's not.

1323
01:42:41,142 --> 01:42:42,267
We're running out of time.

1324
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,724
Little Fatty is coming back soon.

1325
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:46,205
We don't have much time. Let's start.

1326
01:42:46,892 --> 01:42:48,517
You are so annoying.

1327
01:42:49,267 --> 01:42:51,067
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder everyday.

1328
01:43:02,433 --> 01:43:03,307
Boosts vitality.

1329
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:04,599
Nourishes blood.

1330
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,600
A good wine.

1331
01:43:06,058 --> 01:43:06,516
Good.

1332
01:43:06,517 --> 01:43:07,016
Cut.

1333
01:43:07,017 --> 01:43:08,057
This shot is done.

1334
01:43:08,058 --> 01:43:09,682
Now let's take the last shot.

1335
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:10,683
Great.

1336
01:43:14,892 --> 01:43:16,350
My wife is sick in bed.

1337
01:43:16,933 --> 01:43:18,453
Are you guys setting up this search...

1338
01:43:19,308 --> 01:43:21,724
setting up this searchlight
to illuminate her?

1339
01:43:21,725 --> 01:43:22,849
That's despicable.

1340
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:23,849
Stop what you're doing.

1341
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:24,599
Sorry. Mr.Fatty.

1342
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,474
We're making a film.

1343
01:43:25,475 --> 01:43:26,641
That's none of my business.

1344
01:43:26,642 --> 01:43:28,432
But you must not disturb your neighbors.

1345
01:43:28,433 --> 01:43:29,766
And we're neighbors.

1346
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:30,224
Please don't be upset.

1347
01:43:30,225 --> 01:43:31,225
Cut the nonsense!

1348
01:43:35,267 --> 01:43:36,474
It really doesn't hurt?

1349
01:43:36,475 --> 01:43:37,558
No.

1350
01:43:38,308 --> 01:43:39,975
Little Fatty, Why
are you sitting here?

1351
01:43:40,517 --> 01:43:43,557
Dongdong, My parents
didn't let me stay home.

1352
01:43:43,558 --> 01:43:45,638
Can I go to your house to
watch the film being shot?

1353
01:43:45,975 --> 01:43:47,183
What film?

1354
01:43:48,433 --> 01:43:49,642
What's going on?

1355
01:43:51,933 --> 01:43:52,933
Fake!

1356
01:43:53,683 --> 01:43:55,849
Even the vase is fake.

1357
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,266
You filmmakers always

1358
01:43:57,267 --> 01:43:59,349
deceive audience with fake things.

1359
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:00,641
Shame on you.

1360
01:44:00,642 --> 01:44:01,557
Shame on you.

1361
01:44:01,558 --> 01:44:02,682
Mr. Fatty. Calm down.

1362
01:44:02,683 --> 01:44:03,099
Please don't be mad.

1363
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:04,057
Stop talking!

1364
01:44:04,058 --> 01:44:05,307
I won't allow you to
continue filming today.

1365
01:44:05,308 --> 01:44:06,474
Just give me five
minutes for the last shot.

1366
01:44:06,475 --> 01:44:08,682
I won't even give
you one second.

1367
01:44:08,683 --> 01:44:09,641
Stop filming!

1368
01:44:09,642 --> 01:44:10,849
I won't allow it!

1369
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:12,100
You can wait for the sun.

1370
01:44:12,892 --> 01:44:13,975
Mr. Fatty!

1371
01:44:19,183 --> 01:44:20,183
Get out of the way.

1372
01:44:22,142 --> 01:44:23,142
Get out of the way.

1373
01:44:31,267 --> 01:44:32,599
Mr. Fatty,

1374
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,016
I bought this blanket when
Zhao and I got married.

1375
01:44:35,017 --> 01:44:36,807
I've never used it.

1376
01:44:36,808 --> 01:44:38,182
Are you satisfied now?

1377
01:44:38,183 --> 01:44:39,516
Can you please give him

1378
01:44:39,517 --> 01:44:41,391
five minutes to finish filming?

1379
01:44:41,392 --> 01:44:42,392
Can you?

1380
01:44:45,558 --> 01:44:46,099
Put the flowers in the vase.

1381
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,220
I have something else to do.

1382
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,220
Then let's continue filming.

1383
01:44:51,183 --> 01:44:52,433
Back to your positions.

1384
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,307
(Three Months Later)

1385
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:36,517
Then we'll follow your instructions.

1386
01:45:37,933 --> 01:45:38,933
Xiao Ma.

1387
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:39,391
President.

1388
01:45:39,392 --> 01:45:41,100
I heard that you've made an ad?

1389
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:42,850
Yes.

1390
01:45:43,183 --> 01:45:46,076
Our TV station has been thinking about
launching an advertising business.

1391
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,432
Show me your ad.

1392
01:45:47,433 --> 01:45:48,057
Yes, okay.

1393
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:48,807
President,

1394
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:51,182
do we need to report
this to the leaders

1395
01:45:51,183 --> 01:45:52,932
and ask what they think before we proceed?

1396
01:45:52,933 --> 01:45:53,933
Just in case.

1397
01:45:54,142 --> 01:45:55,474
I'm afraid we might be accused of

1398
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:56,932
making mistakes regarding principle.

1399
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,474
What mistakes?

1400
01:45:58,475 --> 01:46:00,100
It already passed the conference vote

1401
01:46:00,933 --> 01:46:02,349
to expand enterprise production,

1402
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:03,432
increase economic efficiency,

1403
01:46:03,433 --> 01:46:05,224
and improve people's living standards.

1404
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:06,558
Those are the biggest principles.

1405
01:46:07,267 --> 01:46:07,849
Don't worry.

1406
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:09,307
I'll take responsibility
if anything bad happens.

1407
01:46:09,308 --> 01:46:10,141
I'll fetch it for you.

1408
01:46:10,142 --> 01:46:11,142
OK.

1409
01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:13,099
Don't try to fool me.

1410
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:14,350
I've made films before too.

1411
01:46:16,642 --> 01:46:17,974
Dear audience,

1412
01:46:17,975 --> 01:46:22,307
today is Sunday 28th of January 1979,

1413
01:46:22,308 --> 01:46:24,057
the first day of the first lunar month.

1414
01:46:24,058 --> 01:46:26,725
The following is the main
content of the news program

1415
01:46:27,433 --> 01:46:30,182
Today is the 37th day after the closing of

1416
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:31,807
the Third Plenary Session of
the Eleventh Central Committee.

1417
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,516
Cadres and masses from all walks of life

1418
01:46:33,517 --> 01:46:34,932
organized spontaneously to

1419
01:46:34,933 --> 01:46:37,766
study the Communiqu? Of the Third Plenary
Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

1420
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:39,432
Tell Dongdong to stop watching TV.

1421
01:46:39,433 --> 01:46:41,113
He sits there waiting for the ad everyday.

1422
01:46:41,767 --> 01:46:43,017
Dongdong, stop watching TV.

1423
01:46:47,433 --> 01:46:49,517
This wine won't
sell well anyway.

1424
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,057
I'll take two bottles to your grandpa's

1425
01:46:51,058 --> 01:46:52,392
to celebrate the New Year.

1426
01:46:54,558 --> 01:46:55,838
When will the ad be broadcasted?

1427
01:46:56,392 --> 01:46:57,224
Probably never.

1428
01:46:57,225 --> 01:46:58,225
I have no idea.

1429
01:47:00,017 --> 01:47:01,767
Do you think I'm useless?

1430
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,427
Next time you write an essay,

1431
01:47:04,892 --> 01:47:06,850
feel free to write
whatever you want about me,

1432
01:47:07,558 --> 01:47:08,975
all right?

1433
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:11,932
Are you ready?

1434
01:47:11,933 --> 01:47:12,933
Let's go.

1435
01:47:13,517 --> 01:47:14,307
Put on your sweater.

1436
01:47:14,308 --> 01:47:15,308
OK.

1437
01:47:17,767 --> 01:47:19,142
Turn off the TV, Dongdong.

1438
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:21,308
Zhao Pingyang,

1439
01:47:21,642 --> 01:47:22,641
grab a few more bottles
of wine for you dad.

1440
01:47:22,642 --> 01:47:24,182
Don't waste good wine.

1441
01:47:24,183 --> 01:47:26,850
Dad, mom, come and watch the ad.

1442
01:47:29,392 --> 01:47:29,974
Come.

1443
01:47:29,975 --> 01:47:31,017
Where?

1444
01:47:32,392 --> 01:47:34,349
Dad, this present is for you.

1445
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:35,516
Ginseng Longan Wine.

1446
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:38,349
May you be healthy,
live long and prosper.

1447
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:40,224
Ginseng Longan Wine.

1448
01:47:40,225 --> 01:47:41,141
Boosts vitality.

1449
01:47:41,142 --> 01:47:42,266
Nourishes blood.

1450
01:47:42,267 --> 01:47:44,932
A good wine for
family and friends.

1451
01:47:44,933 --> 01:47:47,642
Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present.

1452
01:48:00,267 --> 01:48:02,433
This Ginseng Longan
Wine is really hard to get.

1453
01:48:05,642 --> 01:48:07,932
It's so hard to buy this wine.

1454
01:48:07,933 --> 01:48:08,641
It's so hard to buy.

1455
01:48:08,642 --> 01:48:10,516
Good product. Be quick.

1456
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:13,224
I told you it's hard to get.

1457
01:48:13,225 --> 01:48:14,225
Over there.

1458
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:19,808
Hurry up.

1459
01:48:20,392 --> 01:48:21,516
Hello comrade.

1460
01:48:21,517 --> 01:48:23,225
How's this wine been selling today?

1461
01:48:23,767 --> 01:48:24,724
Very well.

1462
01:48:24,725 --> 01:48:26,017
Almost sold out.

1463
01:48:26,683 --> 01:48:27,849
Usually just few people purchase it.

1464
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:29,057
But for some reason, today

1465
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:30,308
everyone's here to buy it.

1466
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,266
That's because of

1467
01:48:32,267 --> 01:48:34,027
its traditional recipe
and real ingredients.

1468
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:35,642
That's true.

1469
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:44,350
I remember now,

1470
01:48:45,225 --> 01:48:47,182
something my dad once said to me.

1471
01:48:47,183 --> 01:48:48,183
Dongdong,

1472
01:48:48,933 --> 01:48:50,182
I believe that

1473
01:48:50,183 --> 01:48:51,975
you'll become a successful person one day.

1474
01:48:56,308 --> 01:48:57,350
But it's at this momment

1475
01:48:58,183 --> 01:49:00,267
that I can finally believe what my dad said

1476
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,225
was true.

1477
01:49:03,517 --> 01:49:04,558
My father

1478
01:49:05,808 --> 01:49:07,517
was perhaps indeed a duck prophet.

1479
01:49:10,683 --> 01:49:12,682
Dad, this present is for you.

1480
01:49:12,683 --> 01:49:13,849
Ginseng Longan Wine.

1481
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:16,641
May you be healthy,
live long and prosper.

1482
01:49:16,642 --> 01:49:18,557
Ginseng Longan Wine.

1483
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:19,474
Boosts vitality.

1484
01:49:19,475 --> 01:49:20,599
Nourishes blood.

1485
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,224
A good wine for
family and friends.

1486
01:49:23,225 --> 01:49:25,975
Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present.

1487
01:49:28,267 --> 01:49:29,600
Since then

1488
01:49:30,308 --> 01:49:33,100
advertisements have reached
every family in China

1489
01:49:33,892 --> 01:49:37,017
and have become a part of our lives.

1490
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:10,350
My dad was not only the
first advertiser in China,

1491
01:50:11,017 --> 01:50:13,100
but also one of the first
people who bought stocks,

1492
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,808
used mobile phones,

1493
01:50:16,558 --> 01:50:19,266
and bought commodity housing in Pudong.

1494
01:50:19,267 --> 01:50:23,557
What others regarded as
his daydreams turned out

1495
01:50:23,558 --> 01:50:24,725
all to be true.

1496
01:50:25,683 --> 01:50:28,557
Many said my dad
was the duck prophet,

1497
01:50:28,558 --> 01:50:32,307
a miraclulous man,
able to predict the future.

1498
01:50:32,308 --> 01:50:34,516
I only finally understood when I grew up

1499
01:50:34,517 --> 01:50:36,308
that he is not the miracle,

1500
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:38,100
but ourselves.

1501
01:50:57,975 --> 01:51:00,682
Later, I became an engineer.

1502
01:51:00,683 --> 01:51:03,266
In 2016 I led my team to

1503
01:51:03,267 --> 01:51:05,432
build the tallest building in China:

1504
01:51:05,433 --> 01:51:06,933
Shanghai Tower.

1505
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:12,141
There are 285 commercial
buildings in Lujiazui

1506
01:51:12,142 --> 01:51:14,350
with 43,000 companies inside.

1507
01:51:15,017 --> 01:51:18,683
Our generation is also
creating a new world

1508
01:51:19,267 --> 01:51:21,307
full of hope.

1509
01:51:21,308 --> 01:51:22,808
A bright new world.

1510
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:24,307
Son.

1511
01:51:24,308 --> 01:51:25,516
What are you writing?

1512
01:51:25,517 --> 01:51:27,932
What's the height of the
Shanghai Tower that you designed?

1513
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:28,933
632 meters.

1514
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:30,642
Is it the tallest in China?

1515
01:51:31,183 --> 01:51:33,100
It's the second tallest in the world.

1516
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:36,766
Why are you writing it down?

1517
01:51:36,767 --> 01:51:38,141
For my essay.

1518
01:51:38,142 --> 01:51:39,517
The title is My Father.

1519
01:51:42,767 --> 01:51:43,767
Dad, mom,

1520
01:51:44,142 --> 01:51:45,974
are you looking through
the binoculars again?

1521
01:51:45,975 --> 01:51:49,642
Your dad has looked
over 100 times.

1522
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:52,182
That red roof used to be our old house.

1523
01:51:52,183 --> 01:51:53,682
I know.

1524
01:51:53,683 --> 01:51:54,974
I found it a long time ago.

1525
01:51:54,975 --> 01:51:55,849
Well, this building you designed

1526
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,016
is absolutely amazing.

1527
01:51:57,017 --> 01:51:58,266
Like I said before,

1528
01:51:58,267 --> 01:52:00,141
The duck is a prophet of spring
when the river becomes warm.

1529
01:52:00,142 --> 01:52:02,432
Always be

1530
01:52:02,433 --> 01:52:04,849
The first duck that dares
to jump into the river.

1531
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:05,892
That's right

1532
01:53:09,283 --> 01:53:09,949
I'm sorry!

1533
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,199
I will never do that again.

1534
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:11,782
Where has gone the hot water?

1535
01:53:11,783 --> 01:53:12,741
Mom, it was my fault.

1536
01:53:12,742 --> 01:53:13,699
Where has gone the hot water?

1537
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,366
I was half way in my shower
when the hot water ran out.

1538
01:53:15,367 --> 01:53:16,741
How dare you to take apart
the water heater, huh?

1539
01:53:16,742 --> 01:53:17,532
Sorry.

1540
01:53:17,533 --> 01:53:18,407
The fan

1541
01:53:18,408 --> 01:53:20,574
The hair dryer The
vacuum cleaner Besides,

1542
01:53:20,575 --> 01:53:21,575
What are these?

1543
01:53:22,492 --> 01:53:23,657
I was wondering why all
the appliances in our house

1544
01:53:23,658 --> 01:53:25,450
keep breaking and breaking after repairs.

1545
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,407
Now I see.

1546
01:53:27,408 --> 01:53:29,848
If there is one thing in this
house to be fixed, that is you.

1547
01:53:30,075 --> 01:53:31,075
Kid,

1548
01:53:31,658 --> 01:53:33,117
say goodbye to your plane.

1549
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:10,925
You are not taking apart the appliances;

1550
01:54:11,283 --> 01:54:13,574
you are tearing our
mother-son relationship apart.

1551
01:54:13,575 --> 01:54:14,575
Mom.

1552
01:54:14,908 --> 01:54:16,241
The ceiling light fell off by itself.

1553
01:54:16,242 --> 01:54:17,407
I didn't do anything!

1554
01:54:17,408 --> 01:54:18,782
As if it doesn't want to
live, like the way you don't.

1555
01:54:18,783 --> 01:54:20,199
Listen, let me explain.

1556
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,199
For a static object,

1557
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,574
if an external force is
greater than the friction,

1558
01:54:23,575 --> 01:54:25,241
it naturally moves.

1559
01:54:25,242 --> 01:54:27,449
And that external force
might be the gravity

1560
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:29,617
or some unknown, mysterious force.

1561
01:54:31,242 --> 01:54:34,449
The force is neither
unknown nor mysterious.

1562
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,533
Let me show you.

1563
01:54:38,617 --> 01:54:39,282
Aren't you familiar?

1564
01:54:39,283 --> 01:54:40,199
Is this the force you are referring to?

1565
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,200
Is it mysterious?

1566
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:13,950
The ball is mine.

1567
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,200
Yours?

1568
01:56:18,575 --> 01:56:20,699
Can you guys keep down
your construction noise?

1569
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:22,616
It shook off our ceiling light.

1570
01:56:22,617 --> 01:56:24,407
My mom thought I did it.

1571
01:56:24,408 --> 01:56:26,117
See the works of her spank.

1572
01:56:28,783 --> 01:56:29,616
Generally speaking,

1573
01:56:29,617 --> 01:56:31,949
mothers spank for guiding ways.

1574
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:33,870
Then, can you see the
ways my mother is guiding?

1575
01:56:34,867 --> 01:56:36,866
Your mother lost her way.

1576
01:56:36,867 --> 01:56:39,241
Forget about it You
should apologize right now.

1577
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:40,116
Your mother spanked you.

1578
01:56:40,117 --> 01:56:41,757
You should tell your mother to apologize.

1579
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,199
Give back the ball.

1580
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,532
Xiaoxiao, stop dragging your feet.

1581
01:56:44,533 --> 01:56:45,532
You are getting late for school.

1582
01:56:45,533 --> 01:56:47,173
Don't think about getting your ball back.

1583
01:57:27,825 --> 01:57:29,699
Fanfan, the teacher said that

1584
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,574
Empress Dowager Cixi was buried

1585
01:57:31,575 --> 01:57:33,449
with a priceless jewel in her mouth,

1586
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:34,616
the luminous pearl.

1587
01:57:34,617 --> 01:57:35,783
Yeah, so?

1588
01:57:36,575 --> 01:57:37,908
It is right here.

1589
01:57:40,367 --> 01:57:41,241
Didn't the teacher say that

1590
01:57:41,242 --> 01:57:43,407
it was lost long time ago
in some foreign countries?

1591
01:57:43,408 --> 01:57:45,032
You know, my dad is a special agent,

1592
01:57:45,033 --> 01:57:46,532
and he brought it back.

1593
01:57:46,533 --> 01:57:47,324
If you like it,

1594
01:57:47,325 --> 01:57:49,005
I don't mind if you play it for some days.

1595
01:57:50,283 --> 01:57:51,574
You, big liar!

1596
01:57:51,575 --> 01:57:53,199
Come, everybody.

1597
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,699
Xiaoxiao said this luminous pearl
belonged to Empress Dowager Cixi.

1598
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,741
Empress Dowager Cixi?

1599
01:57:57,742 --> 01:57:59,324
Must be a fake.

1600
01:57:59,325 --> 01:58:02,074
Getting things from Empress Dowager Cixi,

1601
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:04,991
your dad must be
an imperial eunuch.

1602
01:58:04,992 --> 01:58:06,782
Rebound. Your dad is an imperial eunuch.

1603
01:58:06,783 --> 01:58:08,617
Bounce back. Your dad is an eunuch.

1604
01:58:10,408 --> 01:58:11,768
Xiaoxiao's dad is a special agent.

1605
01:58:12,575 --> 01:58:14,366
Don't believe him.

1606
01:58:14,367 --> 01:58:17,407
Few days ago, he just said
his dad is Yao Ming's coach.

1607
01:58:17,408 --> 01:58:18,657
Don't believe a word of it.

1608
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:20,491
Isn't his dad an astronaut?

1609
01:58:20,492 --> 01:58:21,741
He changed his job because of acrophobia?

1610
01:58:21,742 --> 01:58:24,282
I still keep some lunar
soil that Xiaoxiao gave me.

1611
01:58:24,283 --> 01:58:26,533
He said his dad's a scientist.

1612
01:58:27,117 --> 01:58:28,699
Why haven't you inherited from him?

1613
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:30,020
Are you the real son of your dad?

1614
01:58:30,825 --> 01:58:32,408
Wang Mingtu.

1615
01:58:32,992 --> 01:58:34,366
I've been putting up with you for too long.

1616
01:58:34,367 --> 01:58:35,367
I'm Jackie Chan!

1617
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,616
I'm Jet Li!

1618
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:38,532
Stop!

1619
01:58:38,533 --> 01:58:40,613
Jackie Chan, sit down; Jet
Li, go back to your seat!

1620
01:59:00,242 --> 01:59:01,242
Watch out!

1621
01:59:09,908 --> 01:59:10,908
Watch out!

1622
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:15,158
Watch out here!

1623
01:59:31,908 --> 01:59:32,908
Looking for cars?

1624
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,242
Come on in.

1625
01:59:34,783 --> 01:59:36,408
Come, sir. This way.

1626
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:39,177
You sure you want to bring in this guy?

1627
01:59:39,783 --> 01:59:40,407
Remember,

1628
01:59:40,408 --> 01:59:43,074
never judge a person's
purchasing power by his looks.

1629
01:59:43,075 --> 01:59:44,325
Get the swipe machine ready!

1630
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:57,282
Sir, Sir, the first time
that I saw this car,

1631
01:59:57,283 --> 01:59:59,908
I was as excited as you.

1632
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:06,657
You must be a pro.

1633
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:08,658
You first check the chassis
when looking for cars.

1634
02:00:11,117 --> 02:00:13,797
I know the chassis is awesome but
we can't just keep staring at it.

1635
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:15,116
Here.

1636
02:00:15,117 --> 02:00:16,757
The boss sits in the rear. Give it a try.

1637
02:00:21,158 --> 02:00:22,199
Sir,

1638
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:25,116
we offer different
types to fit you the best.

1639
02:00:25,117 --> 02:00:27,157
Ranging from hundred
thousands to millions yuan,

1640
02:00:27,158 --> 02:00:28,558
our cars cover almost all purposes,

1641
02:00:29,742 --> 02:00:31,342
whether it is for family, business or...

1642
02:00:35,617 --> 02:00:37,343
Yes! That is the exact
expression that I'm looking for.

1643
02:00:37,367 --> 02:00:38,407
You perfectly illustrates

1644
02:00:38,408 --> 02:00:40,407
the mind-blowing luxury experience

1645
02:00:40,408 --> 02:00:41,616
that is beyond the description of words.

1646
02:00:41,617 --> 02:00:44,574
This car, features
the most advanced

1647
02:00:44,575 --> 02:00:45,574
battery technologies in the world so far.

1648
02:00:45,575 --> 02:00:48,408
It has the amazing charge efficiency.

1649
02:00:49,533 --> 02:00:50,533
Indeed amazing.

1650
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:55,075
Why is it out of battery?

1651
02:00:57,825 --> 02:00:58,825
Emm...

1652
02:00:58,992 --> 02:01:00,282
Sorry, sir.

1653
02:01:00,283 --> 02:01:02,074
This car might not have been charged.

1654
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:03,449
How about we switch a car?

1655
02:01:03,450 --> 02:01:04,116
Sure.

1656
02:01:04,117 --> 02:01:05,277
Let me open the door for you.

1657
02:01:09,992 --> 02:01:11,532
What just happened was a pure accident.

1658
02:01:11,533 --> 02:01:12,949
The battery in this car

1659
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:15,032
undoubtedly has strong
cells, high charge rate,

1660
02:01:15,033 --> 02:01:16,033
and wonderful capacity.

1661
02:01:19,492 --> 02:01:20,492
Power-off?

1662
02:01:21,325 --> 02:01:22,742
Why is it dead again?

1663
02:01:23,908 --> 02:01:25,033
Where has the power gone?

1664
02:01:47,325 --> 02:01:48,366
Tomorrow is the Parents' Day.

1665
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:49,616
You gonna have your mom come again?

1666
02:01:49,617 --> 02:01:52,532
Your mom did nothing but
cracking sunflower seeds.

1667
02:01:52,533 --> 02:01:54,616
It will be nice if your dad could come.

1668
02:01:54,617 --> 02:01:55,783
I wanna see your dad.

1669
02:01:57,658 --> 02:01:59,950
Xiaoxiao, where are you going?

1670
02:02:02,617 --> 02:02:03,617
Give me back the ball.

1671
02:02:05,492 --> 02:02:08,367
Look, is he Xiaoxiao's dad?

1672
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:11,700
He looks like a homeless

1673
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,575
Can I hold your hand for a second?

1674
02:02:20,617 --> 02:02:23,783
Like a homeless I
will go with my dad.

1675
02:02:36,408 --> 02:02:38,742
Wow, you found my school.

1676
02:02:39,367 --> 02:02:40,700
Here's the ball.

1677
02:02:59,825 --> 02:03:00,825
What's wrong?

1678
02:03:03,283 --> 02:03:04,283
Water...

1679
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:06,450
Water...

1680
02:03:10,033 --> 02:03:11,075
Not waterproof.

1681
02:03:12,492 --> 02:03:14,575
What's wrong with you? Tell me, quick.

1682
02:03:27,742 --> 02:03:28,532
Freeze.

1683
02:03:28,533 --> 02:03:29,866
I know you are a robot,

1684
02:03:29,867 --> 02:03:30,947
and you are not waterproof.

1685
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,282
Let me ask you.

1686
02:03:32,283 --> 02:03:34,117
Robots should look like me.

1687
02:03:37,242 --> 02:03:39,032
You look way too human.

1688
02:03:39,033 --> 02:03:40,825
Double chin, potbelly,

1689
02:03:41,408 --> 02:03:42,867
what are these for?

1690
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:45,116
The adipose layer cushions the body

1691
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:46,492
and protects core parts.

1692
02:03:47,908 --> 02:03:49,032
What is this?

1693
02:03:49,033 --> 02:03:50,353
Why do you want it back so badly?

1694
02:03:51,908 --> 02:03:53,074
Are you grilling me?

1695
02:03:53,075 --> 02:03:55,157
No, I'm helping to dry you.

1696
02:03:55,158 --> 02:03:56,491
I want to save you.

1697
02:03:56,492 --> 02:03:58,908
Only by using it can I go back to 2050.

1698
02:04:05,492 --> 02:04:07,533
You came from 2050?

1699
02:04:08,867 --> 02:04:11,148
Scientists are performing a
time travel experiment on me.

1700
02:04:13,617 --> 02:04:15,158
What is it like in 2050?

1701
02:04:16,867 --> 02:04:18,787
Are there more people or
more robots on streets?

1702
02:04:19,617 --> 02:04:20,991
Can cars fly?

1703
02:04:20,992 --> 02:04:22,324
What energy sources are used?

1704
02:04:22,325 --> 02:04:23,325
I don't know either.

1705
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:24,907
I was just off from production line

1706
02:04:24,908 --> 02:04:26,116
and they brought me here.

1707
02:04:26,117 --> 02:04:28,158
What are you advanced robots able to do?

1708
02:04:31,450 --> 02:04:32,491
Don't harm me.

1709
02:04:32,492 --> 02:04:34,032
And I won't harm you.

1710
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:35,199
Don't worry.

1711
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,408
I can't attack humans.

1712
02:04:39,033 --> 02:04:40,575
You scared me to death.

1713
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:43,358
Why don't you tell me earlier?

1714
02:04:45,533 --> 02:04:46,700
Wow.

1715
02:04:48,283 --> 02:04:49,283
Here's the thing:

1716
02:04:50,408 --> 02:04:51,699
Tomorrow is the Parents' Day.

1717
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:52,782
If you come with me,

1718
02:04:52,783 --> 02:04:53,992
I will give you back the ball.

1719
02:05:02,783 --> 02:05:03,783
How's that?

1720
02:05:04,367 --> 02:05:06,325
Even my mom has never seen these.

1721
02:05:07,783 --> 02:05:08,867
You made all these?

1722
02:05:09,783 --> 02:05:10,783
Yep.

1723
02:05:11,867 --> 02:05:14,241
My dad studies artificial intelligence,

1724
02:05:14,242 --> 02:05:15,408
and I might get it from him.

1725
02:05:16,242 --> 02:05:18,032
This will be the finale
project for tomorrow.

1726
02:05:18,033 --> 02:05:18,866
Can you help to take a look?

1727
02:05:18,867 --> 02:05:20,533
How to make higher and further flights?

1728
02:05:21,617 --> 02:05:22,617
I can't help,

1729
02:05:23,450 --> 02:05:24,450
but I can take a look.

1730
02:05:25,325 --> 02:05:27,324
You don't know my mom's temper.

1731
02:05:27,325 --> 02:05:30,074
If she sees this plane,
she will throw it away.

1732
02:05:30,075 --> 02:05:31,491
Every day, she forced me to
practice Mathematical Olympiad,

1733
02:05:31,492 --> 02:05:33,252
English speaking, and
ancient poems recital.

1734
02:05:33,492 --> 02:05:35,657
All those naggings keep
going on and on and on.

1735
02:05:35,658 --> 02:05:37,366
My head is about to explode.

1736
02:05:37,367 --> 02:05:39,116
Then, why haven't you?

1737
02:05:39,117 --> 02:05:40,117
Mom.

1738
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:42,366
You can't hide a plane that big.

1739
02:05:42,367 --> 02:05:43,367
Come here.

1740
02:05:46,992 --> 02:05:48,157
Who's this?

1741
02:05:48,158 --> 02:05:49,366
He is Xing Yihao.

1742
02:05:49,367 --> 02:05:51,992
The blind date that Ms.
Wang arranged for you.

1743
02:05:55,992 --> 02:05:57,991
So, you are into cosplay.

1744
02:05:57,992 --> 02:05:59,242
Which character are you?

1745
02:06:02,408 --> 02:06:03,408
Son,

1746
02:06:03,783 --> 02:06:04,782
go play.

1747
02:06:04,783 --> 02:06:07,033
Mom, I... Play now or never.

1748
02:06:12,408 --> 02:06:13,408
Let's chat.

1749
02:06:18,242 --> 02:06:19,242
My bag, please.

1750
02:06:22,617 --> 02:06:23,742
As you can see,

1751
02:06:24,658 --> 02:06:26,578
I have been a mom and a
dad for all these years.

1752
02:06:27,075 --> 02:06:29,155
Every now and then, I'll
have to handle some liquor.

1753
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:31,158
And I don't want him to see.

1754
02:06:31,825 --> 02:06:33,700
So I thought about hanging out here

1755
02:06:34,242 --> 02:06:36,158
till I am sober.

1756
02:06:36,783 --> 02:06:38,325
Now that he has grown up,

1757
02:06:39,117 --> 02:06:40,950
and the hardest time has passed.

1758
02:06:41,533 --> 02:06:44,116
Please go and tell Ms. Wang

1759
02:06:44,117 --> 02:06:46,200
that don't arrange blind
dates for me anymore.

1760
02:06:47,242 --> 02:06:48,950
Besides, a man of this quality

1761
02:06:49,492 --> 02:06:50,825
is definitely not my thing.

1762
02:06:52,367 --> 02:06:53,487
What happened to his father?

1763
02:06:54,283 --> 02:06:55,763
Ms. Wang has not told you about that?

1764
02:06:57,117 --> 02:06:58,158
They clicked?

1765
02:06:59,533 --> 02:07:01,158
His dad studies artificial intelligence.

1766
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:03,950
He always says, To make dreams come true,

1767
02:07:04,783 --> 02:07:07,023
you will have to go through
failures thousands of times.

1768
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,940
Five thousand times of failures

1769
02:07:09,575 --> 02:07:11,867
will carve out his great
technological product.

1770
02:07:13,075 --> 02:07:15,795
However it turned out that only
after the fifth try, he passed away.

1771
02:07:17,658 --> 02:07:18,991
I'm sorry for your loss.

1772
02:07:18,992 --> 02:07:20,117
He was gone too soon.

1773
02:07:21,658 --> 02:07:22,867
The boy got it from his dad,

1774
02:07:23,617 --> 02:07:24,950
fiddling with all these.

1775
02:07:26,908 --> 02:07:28,949
I was just afraid if he
fell behind his school work,

1776
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:30,430
and still he is not cut out for that.

1777
02:07:32,533 --> 02:07:33,700
His dad's dream

1778
02:07:34,283 --> 02:07:36,242
is to enable machines
to learn autonomously.

1779
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,283
But you are turning you child

1780
02:07:40,075 --> 02:07:41,875
into a machine that can
do nothing but study.

1781
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:48,200
Fly higher.

1782
02:07:53,408 --> 02:07:54,408
Indeed.

1783
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:57,241
I can't let my son live in good times

1784
02:07:57,242 --> 02:07:58,408
but without a good mom.

1785
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,200
Alright.

1786
02:08:04,783 --> 02:08:05,783
Hang in there.

1787
02:08:06,658 --> 02:08:07,658
I'll go home.

1788
02:08:08,325 --> 02:08:09,325
Ma Daiyu.

1789
02:08:10,367 --> 02:08:11,408
Two more rounds?

1790
02:08:13,450 --> 02:08:14,450
Nope,

1791
02:08:14,825 --> 02:08:16,033
I'm sober now.

1792
02:08:18,533 --> 02:08:20,283
Boy, let's go home.

1793
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,992
Take the plane

1794
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:23,700
Ok

1795
02:08:32,283 --> 02:08:33,617
I wish you could come tomorrow.

1796
02:08:52,283 --> 02:08:54,242
When you enter the school later,

1797
02:08:54,867 --> 02:08:56,116
try to be cool, OK?

1798
02:08:56,117 --> 02:08:57,283
Absolutely

1799
02:09:10,867 --> 02:09:11,867
Look at that!

1800
02:09:12,658 --> 02:09:13,949
Roasting under this big summer sun,

1801
02:09:13,950 --> 02:09:15,824
he wears layers without sweating.

1802
02:09:15,825 --> 02:09:17,200
How frail.

1803
02:09:17,867 --> 02:09:20,825
He is cosplaying Leon

1804
02:09:27,992 --> 02:09:29,117
With that speed,

1805
02:09:29,783 --> 02:09:31,866
I could hit the target before he knows it.

1806
02:09:31,867 --> 02:09:33,325
Mom.

1807
02:09:34,658 --> 02:09:35,574
Oh my boy.

1808
02:09:35,575 --> 02:09:36,616
I was heavy-handed

1809
02:09:36,617 --> 02:09:37,574
Do not tell your dad about this.

1810
02:09:37,575 --> 02:09:38,575
Ah, my boy

1811
02:09:48,867 --> 02:09:50,700
Please stay there, I
will come downstairs.

1812
02:09:59,992 --> 02:10:01,157
Fretting?

1813
02:10:01,158 --> 02:10:02,699
If I walk like this, you fret, right?

1814
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:03,616
Move quickly,

1815
02:10:03,617 --> 02:10:05,177
or the Parents' Day would be over soon.

1816
02:10:10,283 --> 02:10:12,782
You already are the center
of attention for kids.

1817
02:10:12,783 --> 02:10:14,575
You don't need to dress up this formal.

1818
02:10:15,408 --> 02:10:16,949
Though it's the first time we meet,

1819
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:19,074
I have already heard a lot about you.

1820
02:10:19,075 --> 02:10:20,407
You have been through so
much hardships these years;

1821
02:10:20,408 --> 02:10:21,449
I taught them about going to moon,

1822
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:22,491
you brought back the lunar soil;

1823
02:10:22,492 --> 02:10:23,074
I taught them about Cixi,

1824
02:10:23,075 --> 02:10:24,515
you brought back the luminous pearl;

1825
02:10:25,492 --> 02:10:27,492
Have you been in contact
with the aliens recently?

1826
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:31,324
Despite all the hustle-and-bustle,

1827
02:10:31,325 --> 02:10:33,005
remember to spend more time with your kid.

1828
02:10:38,617 --> 02:10:39,617
Come on!

1829
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:42,617
Come and defense me.

1830
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:45,783
Come on, Yao Ming's coach.

1831
02:11:01,783 --> 02:11:03,366
Three shots in a row.

1832
02:11:03,367 --> 02:11:05,532
Three shots in a row, can you?

1833
02:11:05,533 --> 02:11:06,032
Excuse me.

1834
02:11:06,033 --> 02:11:07,241
Let me introduce myself.

1835
02:11:07,242 --> 02:11:09,950
I was a former
second-level athlete.

1836
02:11:10,867 --> 02:11:11,867
Sorry for you

1837
02:11:12,367 --> 02:11:13,367
Come, show around.

1838
02:11:14,658 --> 02:11:17,741
My dad was a foregone
second-level athlete.

1839
02:11:17,742 --> 02:11:21,949
My dad was a foregone
second-level athlete.

1840
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:22,950
Come on.

1841
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:27,075
Can you do that? Go for it.

1842
02:11:28,033 --> 02:11:29,033
Have a try

1843
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,574
There, there. Follow me.

1844
02:11:34,575 --> 02:11:35,895
Pose like this, Yao Ming's coach.

1845
02:11:45,242 --> 02:11:47,116
Dad, you scored!

1846
02:11:47,117 --> 02:11:48,242
You scored!

1847
02:11:49,325 --> 02:11:50,450
Dad, you scored!

1848
02:11:53,242 --> 02:11:54,242
Dad.

1849
02:12:01,825 --> 02:12:02,825
My dad scored!

1850
02:12:06,325 --> 02:12:07,700
Xiaoxiao's dad is amazing.

1851
02:12:09,408 --> 02:12:11,992
My dad won! My dad scored!

1852
02:12:26,283 --> 02:12:28,033
Dad, try another one.

1853
02:12:42,075 --> 02:12:44,617
I want to eat dumplings.

1854
02:12:45,742 --> 02:12:46,742
Here.

1855
02:12:57,242 --> 02:12:59,992
Come on, come on Dad, I'm hungry

1856
02:13:00,533 --> 02:13:02,992
I'm hungry Dad

1857
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:06,699
I'm hungry I am truly hungry

1858
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:08,282
It's not yet lunch time.

1859
02:13:08,283 --> 02:13:10,200
Dad, I'm hungry

1860
02:13:15,325 --> 02:13:16,325
Ready?

1861
02:13:23,367 --> 02:13:24,866
We are coming last in the race.

1862
02:13:24,867 --> 02:13:25,867
Try harder.

1863
02:13:26,117 --> 02:13:28,032
Wouldn't it be too fast if I do?

1864
02:13:28,033 --> 02:13:29,033
As long as we race fast.

1865
02:13:32,742 --> 02:13:34,200
Cheeky wins.

1866
02:13:37,367 --> 02:13:38,367
Speed up.

1867
02:13:39,617 --> 02:13:40,617
Straight up your waist.

1868
02:13:51,325 --> 02:13:53,407
Go, Xiaoxiao!

1869
02:13:53,408 --> 02:13:54,992
Xiaoxiao! Go, Xiaoxiao!

1870
02:14:02,283 --> 02:14:03,617
I won! I won!

1871
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,283
Why don't you smile?

1872
02:14:13,408 --> 02:14:14,907
I don't know how.

1873
02:14:14,908 --> 02:14:16,033
I will show you, like this.

1874
02:15:01,617 --> 02:15:04,574
Teacher, I applied
principles of aerodynamics

1875
02:15:04,575 --> 02:15:06,367
to make a glider.

1876
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,616
How impressive, Yihang.

1877
02:15:11,617 --> 02:15:13,116
I'm so proud of you.

1878
02:15:13,117 --> 02:15:14,437
Thank you for your encouragement.

1879
02:15:16,242 --> 02:15:18,699
Teacher, I got inspired
for making this plane

1880
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:20,575
because my dad irons my mom's clothes.

1881
02:15:21,742 --> 02:15:22,742
No, the opposite.

1882
02:15:23,783 --> 02:15:27,366
It is powered by steam
to provide perpetual fuel.

1883
02:15:27,367 --> 02:15:29,282
Teacher, cleared for departure.

1884
02:15:29,283 --> 02:15:30,283
Departure approved.

1885
02:15:37,408 --> 02:15:40,200
Dad, the power is gone.
What can help it fly?

1886
02:15:43,575 --> 02:15:46,158
Damn, your dad.

1887
02:16:01,408 --> 02:16:02,783
It's a bionic plane.

1888
02:16:03,325 --> 02:16:05,407
How wonderful, Weiwei.

1889
02:16:05,408 --> 02:16:07,907
You see, in science, we
must keep our integrity.

1890
02:16:07,908 --> 02:16:09,199
Although there were ups and downs,

1891
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:11,157
you got to advance forward.

1892
02:16:11,158 --> 02:16:12,158
Understand?

1893
02:16:17,325 --> 02:16:18,657
I'm sorry, Weiwei's dad.

1894
02:16:18,658 --> 02:16:19,658
What a coincidence.

1895
02:16:20,867 --> 02:16:22,241
Mine is bionic too.

1896
02:16:22,242 --> 02:16:24,199
Yours is not bionic.

1897
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:25,950
Yours is bio-release.

1898
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:29,533
Bionics eat this?

1899
02:16:30,492 --> 02:16:31,949
I intended to buy this pigeon

1900
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:34,033
to simulate a bionic plane.

1901
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:36,324
I didn't expect this. I was simple minded.

1902
02:16:36,325 --> 02:16:37,157
Time is so limited

1903
02:16:37,158 --> 02:16:38,700
that I just made a remote control.

1904
02:16:41,908 --> 02:16:43,074
Go, Da Cheng.

1905
02:16:43,075 --> 02:16:44,075
Alright.

1906
02:16:53,742 --> 02:16:54,742
Xiaoxiao,

1907
02:16:55,242 --> 02:16:57,242
can your stuff fly or not?

1908
02:16:58,367 --> 02:16:59,991
Yours are just toys.

1909
02:16:59,992 --> 02:17:01,657
Mine is a real plane.

1910
02:17:01,658 --> 02:17:03,949
It hovers vertically like an helicopter,

1911
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:06,532
and speeds up like a fixed-wing aircraft.

1912
02:17:06,533 --> 02:17:09,866
Teacher, it combines
the merits of both types,

1913
02:17:09,867 --> 02:17:11,867
and is forged as a new type of aircraft.

1914
02:17:31,033 --> 02:17:32,033
It's on fire!

1915
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:33,200
Don't gather around.

1916
02:17:34,033 --> 02:17:35,324
Turn off, please
Don't gather around.

1917
02:17:35,325 --> 02:17:37,085
Xiaoxiao's father,
please take the kids away

1918
02:17:51,367 --> 02:17:53,699
It caught fire.

1919
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:55,324
The plane was shot down.

1920
02:17:55,325 --> 02:17:57,491
My plane flew nicely last night.
My dad was there too!

1921
02:17:57,492 --> 02:17:58,692
If you don't believe, ask him.

1922
02:17:58,825 --> 02:18:00,700
Surely your dad speaks for you.

1923
02:18:01,992 --> 02:18:02,992
Last night,

1924
02:18:03,742 --> 02:18:05,366
I didn't actually see that.

1925
02:18:05,367 --> 02:18:06,967
I couldn't take my eyes off your mother.

1926
02:18:07,575 --> 02:18:09,575
Even if it flew last night,
it fails to do so now,

1927
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,760
proving that it's just not good enough.

1928
02:18:13,033 --> 02:18:15,325
You failed.

1929
02:18:16,367 --> 02:18:17,867
It failed to fly.

1930
02:18:36,367 --> 02:18:37,367
Why are you here?

1931
02:18:38,117 --> 02:18:39,557
I brought back the airplane for you.

1932
02:18:40,075 --> 02:18:41,075
I don't need it.

1933
02:18:45,575 --> 02:18:48,855
To make dreams come true, you will have
to go through failures thousands of times.

1934
02:18:49,117 --> 02:18:51,908
Five thousand times of failures
make a great product like me.

1935
02:18:54,325 --> 02:18:56,492
You should follow your
father's path to move forward.

1936
02:18:57,742 --> 02:18:59,902
How can you give up your
dream after only one failure?

1937
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,100
At least your dad tried five times.

1938
02:19:02,617 --> 02:19:03,742
Who gave up dreams?

1939
02:19:04,283 --> 02:19:05,408
I gave up on you.

1940
02:19:06,742 --> 02:19:07,942
You could have vouched for me.

1941
02:19:08,408 --> 02:19:09,907
But, instead, you didn't
trust me on one hand,

1942
02:19:09,908 --> 02:19:11,948
and accused me in front of
the crowds on the other.

1943
02:19:12,242 --> 02:19:13,783
My dad would never do that.

1944
02:19:15,408 --> 02:19:16,408
Since he's gone,

1945
02:19:16,825 --> 02:19:17,950
I think about him every day.

1946
02:19:19,575 --> 02:19:21,255
The reason I did all of these is to figure

1947
02:19:21,783 --> 02:19:23,492
out why his study is so important for him,

1948
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:26,117
even leaving my mom and me behind.

1949
02:19:29,658 --> 02:19:30,783
Ever since I met you,

1950
02:19:32,783 --> 02:19:34,117
I thought my dad was back.

1951
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:36,532
But I was wrong.

1952
02:19:36,533 --> 02:19:37,741
You are a cold-blood machine.

1953
02:19:37,742 --> 02:19:39,157
You don't have feelings at all.

1954
02:19:39,158 --> 02:19:40,908
Go away. You don't deserve to be my dad.

1955
02:21:55,783 --> 02:21:56,783
Xing Yihao

1956
02:23:29,742 --> 02:23:30,867
Xing Yihao

1957
02:23:32,158 --> 02:23:33,283
Xing Yihao

1958
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,242
Somebody help!

1959
02:23:41,908 --> 02:23:44,450
Help! Help me drag him up here!

1960
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:10,699
Aren't you leaving?

1961
02:24:10,700 --> 02:24:12,117
Who told you to come back?

1962
02:24:14,742 --> 02:24:17,158
Last time I missed the plane's flight.

1963
02:24:17,908 --> 02:24:19,188
I want to see it before leaving.

1964
02:24:20,575 --> 02:24:21,908
Did you see it then?

1965
02:24:22,992 --> 02:24:23,992
I saw...

1966
02:24:25,033 --> 02:24:26,325
I saw you paddling in the water.

1967
02:24:38,242 --> 02:24:39,407
It's time for me to go.

1968
02:24:39,408 --> 02:24:41,324
Please don't go.

1969
02:24:41,325 --> 02:24:43,992
Could you stay and be my dad?

1970
02:24:44,867 --> 02:24:46,116
Just between you and me.

1971
02:24:46,117 --> 02:24:47,450
I'll protect you.

1972
02:24:48,117 --> 02:24:50,950
I will never let you get close to water.

1973
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:55,575
I have to go back

1974
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:58,325
to prove that the experiment is a success.

1975
02:24:59,742 --> 02:25:02,533
But I don't want you to go.

1976
02:25:03,367 --> 02:25:06,282
If you really need to go,
can you take me with you?

1977
02:25:06,283 --> 02:25:08,449
I will go home right now and pack my stuff,

1978
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:09,992
and bring my mom too.

1979
02:25:12,242 --> 02:25:14,202
If I stay any longer,
I will never be able to go.

1980
02:25:15,867 --> 02:25:16,867
I'm sorry.

1981
02:25:17,908 --> 02:25:19,033
I missed this time again.

1982
02:25:21,033 --> 02:25:22,575
But I'm sure it did take off.

1983
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:25,200
Xiaoxiao,

1984
02:25:25,575 --> 02:25:26,575
You can!

1985
02:25:30,825 --> 02:25:33,617
Could you please stay?

1986
02:25:52,117 --> 02:25:53,117
Xiaoxiao,

1987
02:25:57,450 --> 02:25:58,700
help me put it in.

1988
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:47,200
Look at this.

1989
02:27:43,242 --> 02:27:47,533
You guys made him travel to the past.

1990
02:27:52,492 --> 02:27:54,742
Thus we see the future.

1991
02:27:57,075 --> 02:27:58,075
I'm here to announce,

1992
02:27:58,950 --> 02:28:04,075
the first time-travel experiment by mankind

1993
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:07,450
was a complete success.

1994
02:28:57,783 --> 02:28:59,033
Nice to meet you again.

1995
02:28:59,742 --> 02:29:01,574
Thank you for giving me

1996
02:29:01,575 --> 02:29:03,992
an unique childhood memory, dad.

1997
02:29:04,908 --> 02:29:06,283
YOU made me.

1998
02:29:07,033 --> 02:29:08,242
YOU are my dad.

1999
02:29:41,867 --> 02:29:43,032
Wow, what a big hand-made rocket!

2000
02:29:43,033 --> 02:29:43,949
That's my son.

2001
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:44,616
Which one?

2002
02:29:44,617 --> 02:29:45,617
That one.

2003
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:48,450
Ready to go?

2004
02:29:49,492 --> 02:29:49,907
Yes!

2005
02:29:49,908 --> 02:29:50,907
Go, my boy!

2006
02:29:50,908 --> 02:29:51,866
Don't hurry.

2007
02:29:51,867 --> 02:29:53,158
Son, take your time.
