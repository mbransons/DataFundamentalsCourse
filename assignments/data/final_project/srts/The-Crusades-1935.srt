1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,475
She's denied the cross for suicide...

3
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:33,035
and buried at the
center of a crossroads. Huh.

4
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:36,815
Show me the logic. Father?

5
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,825
What?

6
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,895
The devil is a practical man.

7
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,984
If she were a witch, she was
a poor return on his investment.

8
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,994
What would you know of logic?

9
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:52,334
Oh, I have ears, Father. Although
one is notched because I love justice.

10
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:54,424
You love thieving.

11
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,474
Shut up. You dig.

12
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,423
Crusaders.

13
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,333
Clear the road, if you will.

14
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,133
Squire! Hyah!

15
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,762
This is for the burial from my lord...

16
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,562
and a Mass...

17
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,802
for her soul.

18
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,112
Wait.

19
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,082
Have you forgotten?
She was your brother's wife.

20
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,082
She was a suicide. Cut off her head.

21
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,952
And return the ax.

22
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,741
You know this place, my lord?

23
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,811
Know it?

24
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,001
I know all of it.

25
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,011
Your brother? You have spoken to him?

26
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,781
On what matter, my lord?
He is still arrested.

27
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,881
Your brother is as responsible
for his wife's sin as I am.

28
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,391
Opinions differ, my lord.

29
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:01,761
The burial was... Yes.

30
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,851
And you did not mutilate the person? No.

31
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:08,760
Good. The law can go too far.

32
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,960
It can too far. I ask myself...

33
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,540
"Would Jesus do it thusly?"

34
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,370
There is so much done in Christendom
of which Christ would be incapable.

35
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,910
You must release your brother.
I cannot do without him.

36
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,640
My-My brother, my lord bishop,
uh, is possessed by the devil...

37
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,950
and must be... examined.

38
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,420
Your brother is as mad as you are.
He grieves.

39
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,550
Without your brother,
I cannot finish my church.

40
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,290
Let him out. And give him this.

41
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,389
And tell him that he is at
the very center of my prayers.

42
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,048
The bishop needs you.

43
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,848
Release him. On your feet.

44
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,728
This is not heaven. It's the world.

45
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,888
And there's troubles in it.

46
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,437
Do yourself no injury.

47
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:08,177
Other men are always good for that.

48
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:30,066
And what of Jerusalem? Jerusalem?

49
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:33,336
In peril, my lord, as always.

50
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:36,236
We have stood there against the
Saracens for over a hundred years.

51
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:40,116
The Saracens, as you call them,
have now unified in Egypt...

52
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,016
Syria and all Arabia.

53
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,146
Saracens and someone new.

54
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,516
Saladin, the king.

55
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,616
Gibberish.

56
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:57,926
Very fine. And yet, you do not drink.

57
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,006
A knight should be a knight...

58
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,336
a monk a monk. Brother.

59
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,135
Not both. One, that's what I say.

60
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:10,605
Now I may be old-fashioned,
but, as for the cup...

61
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:14,775
I have, uh, an artificer, uh, a blacksmith.

62
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:18,545
Or did have.

63
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:23,025
Which son of the blacksmith
of my time is the blacksmith now?

64
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,855
Balian, the eldest.

65
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,985
His child died.

66
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,625
His wife fell into a melancholy.
She would not listen to reason.

67
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:36,835
She killed herself... it occurs.

68
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:40,334
But what's that to you?

69
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,404
Private matter.

70
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:50,844
It's been six and 20 years
since my brother took the cross.

71
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:56,584
Now he returns an actual
baron of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

72
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:59,314
How is that for the lot
of the younger brother?

73
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:04,024
With no heir, comes to me and thus to you.

74
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,824
Then I thank the stars for my uncle.

75
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,813
Go on.

76
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,363
Her grave was here.

77
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:43,363
Or was it there?

78
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:46,733
I'm afraid I can't tell
you the exact location.

79
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,172
I wasn't present at the burial.

80
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:54,142
Call me a liar.

81
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:56,542
You have reason.

82
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,622
You never fight back.

83
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,222
Hmm? Hmm?

84
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,832
You always turn the other cheek.

85
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:16,022
I think that you
conceive yourself without sin.

86
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:19,332
That is a sin!

87
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,639
We shall work.

88
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,089
I told you to stop that now!

89
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,838
That is the man. That is the man.

90
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,508
You're an armorer, yes?

91
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:18,048
An artificer according to
your lord and this priest.

92
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:21,058
You have my sympathy and my blessing.

93
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:25,648
Your dead wife and stillborn child
are today the subject of my prayers.

94
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,418
We need all these horses shod.

95
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:32,588
We need food, and we'll pay.

96
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,808
Says yes.

97
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:39,528
Have you killed any? Have you killed any?

98
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:48,147
He has made great engines for sieges.

99
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:54,087
He has made war machines
that cast the largest stones.

100
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:57,247
He also works finely in silver.

101
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:02,397
He will be one of the few on your
journey worth more alive than dead.

102
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,557
Shut up.

103
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,467
Have you been at war?

104
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:17,947
On horse. And as an enginer also.

105
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,017
Against whom and for whom did you fight?

106
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,976
For one lord against another...

107
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,916
on a point which cannot be remembered.

108
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:28,506
There's better game now...
one god against another.

109
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,856
The pay is proportionate.
I've been telling him that.

110
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:26,235
Do you still advise what
you advised upon the road?

111
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,815
I do, my lord.

112
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:33,874
But know that this man
Balian mourns his wife.

113
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:46,364
What does that say?

114
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:50,234
"What man is a man who does
not make the world better?"

115
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,304
Leave me with this man.

116
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:03,504
God has made us man. We must suffer all.

117
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,844
I also have lost.

118
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:18,953
Some say Jerusalem is the very
center of the world for asking forgiveness.

119
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:22,693
For myself, I call it here.

120
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,763
Now.

121
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,203
I knew your namesake.

122
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:48,622
I knew your mother.

123
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:56,332
To be courteous, I should say
that it was against her objections.

124
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:59,832
But I was the lord's
brother and she had no choice.

125
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:03,162
But I did not force her.

126
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,672
I have forgiveness to ask of you.

127
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:36,491
I am Godfrey, the baron of Ibelin.

128
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,591
I have 100 men at arms in Jerusalem.

129
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:43,611
If you will come with me,
you will have a living...

130
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,611
and... you will have my thanks.

131
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,771
There it is.

132
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,181
Whoever you are, my lord...

133
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:53,151
my place is here.

134
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:56,550
What made it your place is now dead.

135
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,260
You will never see me again.

136
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,990
If you want anything of me, take it now.

137
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,300
I want nothing.

138
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,030
I am sorry for your troubles.
God protect you.

139
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,919
Jerusalem is easy to find.

140
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:42,159
You come to where the men speak Italian...

141
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,069
then continue until they
speak something else.

142
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:48,539
We go by Messina. Good-bye.

143
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,508
The village does not want you.

144
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,638
When the old lord is dead,
they will drive you out.

145
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:43,257
When the bishop is dead, it is certain.

146
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,457
And you take my property.

147
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,857
The Church. You.

148
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,487
They would have taken you to Jerusalem...

149
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,797
away from... all this.

150
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,867
I arranged it.

151
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,347
I swear to you...

152
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,907
you will have no peace
so long as you stay here.

153
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:09,477
No man ever needed a new world more.

154
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:14,617
Imagine your sin and pain erased.

155
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:17,286
All.

156
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,476
If you take the Crusade...

157
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:34,666
you may relieve your
wife's position in hell.

158
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:39,766
I put it delicately...
She was a suicide. She is in hell.

159
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,276
Though what she does there without a head...

160
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,853
Wait here.

161
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:23,613
Have you come to kill me?

162
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:27,443
Even these days, it is not easy.

163
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,543
Well?

164
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,132
I have done...

165
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,602
murder.

166
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,832
Haven't we all?

167
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,832
Is it true...

168
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:50,272
that in Jerusalem I can erase my sins...

169
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,342
and those of my wife?

170
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,342
Is it true?

171
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,912
We can find out together.

172
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:01,412
Show me your hand.

173
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,931
Hey!

174
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,070
Pick it up. Let's see what you're
made of. His hand is hurt, my lord.

175
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,730
I once fought two days with an
arrow through my testicle. Ah, yes.

176
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,220
Never use a low guard. You fight well.

177
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,290
Let's work on your skills.

178
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,420
Take a high guard, like this.

179
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,399
The Italians call it la poste di falcone...
the guard of the hawk.

180
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,559
Strike from high, like this.

181
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,739
Do it.

182
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,099
Sword straighter. Come on.

183
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,439
Leg back, bend your knees. Sword straighter.

184
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,839
Defend yourself.

185
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,839
The blade isn't the only part of a sword.

186
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,519
Attack.

187
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,228
I have your leave?

188
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,698
Pay attention.

189
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:33,457
What's this?

190
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,247
Uncle. Nephew.

191
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:50,307
You have with you a man, Balian,
who killed a priest, his brother.

192
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:54,817
I'm charged by both my father and
the lord bishop to bring him back.

193
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:04,957
What he says is true.

194
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:07,037
They have the right to take me.

195
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,826
I say he is innocent of the charge.

196
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:13,766
If you say he's guilty, then we'll fight,
and God will decide the truth of it.

197
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:17,536
My German friend is a
close student of the law.

198
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,436
Just give him to me.
I'll fight you for something else.

199
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:23,446
Uncle, he's a murderer.

200
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:25,516
So am I.

201
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:33,556
Whoever dies here today,
you will certainly be among them.

202
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:38,216
You are my uncle. I must give you the road.

203
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:39,816
Hyah! Hyah!

204
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:52,135
Heinrich!

205
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,075
Aah!

206
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:56,235
To the flanks!

207
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:11,595
Aah!

208
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,225
Hyah! Aah!

209
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:34,242
Hyah! Come on!

210
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:38,012
Hyah!

211
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:05,302
Thank my brother for his love!

212
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,540
I am the son of Roger...

213
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,840
Take your helmet off while addressing me.

214
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm am the son of Roger de Cormiere.

215
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,430
I am accorded the privilege of ransom.

216
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,130
This is true.

217
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,938
Ah. Well, you broke the arrow.

218
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:59,248
If the ribs are broken,
some marrow may enter the blood...

219
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:03,218
in which case you'll take a fever and die.

220
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,478
Or a cyst will form...

221
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:07,558
and you'll live.

222
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,398
You're in the hands of God.

223
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:14,118
Get me some more wine.

224
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:27,737
It was not...

225
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,107
that they had no right to take you.

226
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:32,977
It was the way they asked.

227
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:35,307
They had the right to take me.

228
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,017
So do I.

229
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:59,737
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

230
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:02,137
It is the path to heaven.

231
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:06,476
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

232
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:09,636
It is the path to heaven.

233
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:12,216
Godfrey.

234
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,716
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

235
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:20,196
It is the path to heaven.

236
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:31,796
Where do you go? To Jerusalem, brother.

237
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:35,676
By which road? Someone knows.

238
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,806
God knows.

239
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:53,725
When shall we stop this madness?

240
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:56,425
It will soon be beyond my concern.

241
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:05,665
Who is this?

242
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,705
My son.

243
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:17,774
Would I have fought you when you
were still capable of making bastards.

244
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:22,944
I knew your mother when she was making hers.

245
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:26,454
Fortunately, you're
too old to be one of mine.

246
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:31,284
All will be settled.

247
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,952
Do you know...

248
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,282
what lies in the Holy Land?

249
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:37,022
A new world.

250
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:40,562
A man who, in France, had not a house...

251
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:43,832
is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

252
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:48,272
He who was the master
of a city begs in the gutter.

253
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:50,802
There, at the end of the world...

254
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,812
you are not what you were born...

255
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:57,002
but what you have it in yourself to be.

256
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:59,342
I hope to find forgiveness.

257
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,381
That's all I know.

258
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:08,781
Whatever your position,
you are of my house...

259
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:12,421
and that means you will
serve the king of Jerusalem.

260
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:15,501
What could a king ask of a man like me?

261
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:21,161
A better world than has ever been seen.

262
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:23,241
A kingdom of conscience.

263
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:26,371
A kingdom of heaven.

264
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:29,771
There is peace between Christian and Muslim.

265
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,741
We live together.

266
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:36,250
Or, between Saladin and the king, we try.

267
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,150
Did you think that lay
at the end of Crusade?

268
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,490
It does.

269
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,490
My son, you are all that survives me.

270
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,190
Do not disappoint me.

271
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,670
When we took the Holy Land,
we took the Saracen trading ports.

272
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,180
Italian ships carry silks and spices
and pilgrims, if they have money.

273
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,249
And Italy becomes rich
as the Savior intended.

274
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:16,519
Who are those men?

275
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,059
Muslims. Saracens.

276
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,459
And they're allowed their prayers?

277
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,259
If they pay the tax.

278
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,229
Subhena Rabi Alladin.

279
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:31,529
Praise be to God.
It is proper to praise him.

280
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:34,909
Sounds like our prayers.

281
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,249
It's good.

282
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:53,458
When the king is dead...

283
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:57,048
Jerusalem will be no
place for friends of Muslims...

284
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:00,028
or traitors to Christendom...

285
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,728
like your father.

286
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,028
I am Guy de Lusignan.

287
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:09,808
Remember that name.

288
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,938
And me.

289
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,248
- Keep it.
- My lord.

290
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:25,187
How will you ride if you have
no stick to beat the horse?

291
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:31,427
He will be king in Jerusalem one day.

292
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,457
Holy mother of God, pray for us...

293
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,537
now and at the hour of our death.

294
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,477
Balian.

295
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,887
Hurry.

296
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:06,056
I can go no further.

297
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:17,566
Get on your knees.

298
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:42,325
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

299
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:45,925
Be brave and upright that God may love thee.

300
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:50,305
Speak the truth always,
even if it leads to your death.

301
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:54,935
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong.

302
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:57,745
That is your oath.

303
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,514
And that's so you remember it.

304
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:19,124
Arise a knight and baron of Ibelin.

305
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:34,044
Defend the king.

306
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:36,204
I- If the king is no more...

307
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,284
protect the people.

308
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:44,193
It is time now, my lord, to
confess to holy God, not your son.

309
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:48,533
Are you sorry for all your sins?

310
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,593
For all but one.

311
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:20,682
You sail now for Jerusalem, as your
father wished. I'll follow within the week.

312
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,022
Now the voyage is perilous.

313
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:28,002
If God has purpose for you there,
he'll keep you safe in his hands.

314
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,072
If not...

315
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:33,102
God bless you.

316
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:28,037
Whoa. Whoa.

317
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,197
Whoa.

318
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:57,836
He says that is his horse.

319
00:42:57,936 --> 00:43:00,636
Why would it be his horse?

320
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,506
Because it is on his land!

321
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:05,706
I took this horse from the sea.

322
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:16,846
He says you are a great liar...

323
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:19,856
and he will fight you
because you are a liar.

324
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,356
I have no desire to fight.

325
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,396
Then you must give him the horse.

326
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:31,755
No.

327
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,855
Fight me fairly!

328
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:49,215
Why? Why should he?

329
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,725
He is a knight.
And I am the baron of Ibelin.

330
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:03,564
He says the baron of Ibelin is old.

331
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:06,224
He knew him at Damascus.

332
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:08,304
I am the new one.

333
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:32,394
Stop!

334
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:39,233
Ibelin, that's enough! Ibelin, no!

335
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:03,653
You have taken it very well
that I have killed your master.

336
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:06,233
It was the end of his time.

337
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:09,703
All is as God wills it.

338
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:15,492
Now finish this.

339
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:35,112
Take me to Jerusalem.

340
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,950
Very good horse.

341
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,560
Take the horse...

342
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,020
and be about your business.

343
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,530
This is your prize of battle.

344
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,570
I am your prisoner...
your slave, should you wish it.

345
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,760
I have been a slave, or very near to one.

346
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,459
I will never keep one,
nor suffer any to be kept.

347
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,439
Go.

348
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,449
The man you killed was a very
great cavalier among the Muslims.

349
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,709
His name was Mummad al Fais.

350
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,979
I will pray for him.

351
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:20,689
Your quality will be
known among your enemies...

352
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:23,559
before ever you meet them, my friend.

353
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,468
Old man, where is it
that Christ was crucified?

354
00:47:57,698 --> 00:47:59,758
Salaam alaikum.

355
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:25,617
God, what is it you want of me?

356
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:05,786
How can you be in hell
when you're in my heart?

357
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:52,795
You must have known him. What?

358
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:56,764
Since you carry Godfrey's sword,
you must have known him.

359
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,104
I did.

360
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:02,834
A man my size?

361
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,654
Yes.

362
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:11,874
And green eyes.

363
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:18,194
Blue.

364
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:27,194
Come with us...

365
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:29,564
my lord.

366
00:50:51,993 --> 00:50:54,763
No. Give me the towel.

367
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:57,363
Give me the towel. Give me the towel.

368
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:32,792
A man who, in France, had not a house...

369
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:35,872
is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

370
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:09,601
Stop.

371
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,641
You're hurting him.

372
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:15,401
Whoa. Whoa.

373
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:34,360
Where's your master?

374
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,090
I have none.

375
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,170
Give me some water.

376
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:56,689
Thank you for the drink.

377
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,349
If you happen to see Balian,
the son of Godfrey...

378
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:04,359
tell him that Sibylla called.

379
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:18,539
So, how find you Jerusalem?

380
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,729
God does not speak to me.

381
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:23,209
Not even on the hill...

382
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:25,299
where Christ died.

383
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,578
I am outside God's grace.

384
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:29,808
I have not heard that.

385
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:32,578
At any rate, it seems...

386
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:35,678
I have lost my religion.

387
00:53:35,788 --> 00:53:38,728
I put no stock in religion.

388
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:40,488
By the word "religion"...

389
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:44,398
I've seen the lunacy of fanatics of every
denomination be called the will of God.

390
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:49,158
I've seen too much religion in
the eyes of too many murderers.

391
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,068
Holiness...

392
00:53:51,168 --> 00:53:53,108
is in right action...

393
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:57,938
and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.

394
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:00,038
And goodness...

395
00:54:02,987 --> 00:54:04,917
what God desires...

396
00:54:05,017 --> 00:54:08,887
is here and here.

397
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:13,047
By what you decide to do
every day, you will be a good man.

398
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:16,057
Or not.

399
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:18,187
Come.

400
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:46,026
The king has made a peace with
Saladin these past six years.

401
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:50,216
He holds Jerusalem as a
place for prayer for all faiths...

402
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:53,026
as the Muslims did before we came.

403
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:56,426
These men are Templars. They killed Arabs.

404
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:05,776
So they are dying...

405
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:08,036
for what the pope would command them to do.

406
00:55:08,146 --> 00:55:11,636
Yes. But not Christ, I think.

407
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:13,715
Nor this king.

408
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:28,195
Who says I raid?

409
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:29,965
That witness...

410
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:33,235
all of Jerusalem...

411
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:35,825
holy God and me.

412
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:41,205
That witness, if you call him
that, is a Saracen. He lies.

413
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:43,375
There will come a day,
Reynald de Chatillon...

414
00:55:43,485 --> 00:55:46,605
when you are not protected by your title.

415
00:55:46,715 --> 00:55:49,314
Oh? When will that be?

416
00:55:49,424 --> 00:55:51,584
Alert me, Tiberias, when men are equal...

417
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:53,814
and the kingdom of heaven has arrived.

418
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:57,824
Those Templars have been hung
for a raid that I know you commanded.

419
00:55:57,924 --> 00:56:00,124
Prove it.

420
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:02,464
I will wait at Kerak until you do.

421
00:56:02,564 --> 00:56:06,764
The king will take your
castle of Kerak, Reynald.

422
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:09,064
Try to take it, Tiberias.

423
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:11,234
I'll be there.

424
00:56:18,614 --> 00:56:23,174
I cannot protect your caravans unless
you agree to be escorted by our soldiers.

425
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:25,183
I trade to make money...

426
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:28,523
not to offend God by
associating with Christians.

427
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:32,653
But you will take Christian gold.
Gold is gold.

428
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:36,363
Mmm. Of course.

429
00:56:39,473 --> 00:56:41,373
My lord Tiberias.

430
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:51,703
My lord.

431
00:56:54,183 --> 00:56:56,743
It's true.

432
00:56:56,853 --> 00:56:58,753
You're your father's son.

433
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:01,252
He was my friend.

434
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:03,912
I am yours.

435
00:57:04,022 --> 00:57:05,922
Godfrey dead.

436
00:57:06,032 --> 00:57:08,932
It could have come at a better time. Come.

437
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:14,622
It was shouted in the streets
that you killed a great lord of Syria.

438
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:18,072
Saladin himself sent word...

439
00:57:18,172 --> 00:57:20,762
that your fight did not breach the peace...

440
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:22,812
that you had cause.

441
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,712
What know you of Saladin?

442
00:57:26,812 --> 00:57:28,712
That he is king of the Saracens...

443
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,042
and that he surrounds this kingdom.

444
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:34,551
He has 200,000 men in Damascus alone.

445
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,551
He could win a war if he goes to war...

446
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:42,651
and he's daily given cause for
war by fanatics newly from Europe...

447
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,421
by Templar bastards
like Reynald de Chatillon.

448
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:49,591
Here, from this room, I keep
the peace, so far as it can be kept.

449
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:53,801
But Saladin and the king between them...

450
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:56,741
would make a better world.

451
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:00,471
If it lives only for a while,
Tiberias, it still has lived.

452
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,551
All right.

453
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:09,421
What did your father tell
you of your... obligations?

454
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:11,490
That I was to be a good knight.

455
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,260
I pray the world...

456
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,520
and Jerusalem...

457
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:21,290
can accommodate such a rarity...

458
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,370
as a perfect knight.

459
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,200
Have you dined?

460
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,920
The Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem...

461
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,580
and her husband, Guy de Lusignan.

462
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:56,629
So, how many knights did you find in France?

463
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:59,029
Fifty.

464
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,999
They've sworn allegiance to the king?

465
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:03,509
Of course, Tiberias.

466
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:05,579
Obviously.

467
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,479
You sit at my table?

468
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:17,389
Is it not the king's table? Is it?
I have not seen a king at it for some years.

469
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:22,658
I cannot eat.
I... I am finicky about company.

470
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:26,088
In France this could not inherit.

471
00:59:26,198 --> 00:59:29,758
But here there are no civilized rules.

472
00:59:29,868 --> 00:59:31,768
I have business in the East.

473
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:38,168
My wife does not lament my absences.

474
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:41,768
That is either the best of wives...

475
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,008
or the very, very worst.

476
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:48,778
Do you go to meet Reynald?
No, my lord. He is in disfavor.

477
00:59:48,888 --> 00:59:51,188
I am a member of this court.

478
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:55,348
Why should I make league
with that... troublemaker?

479
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:05,037
To the very best of wives.

480
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:08,367
God bless Jerusalem.

481
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,197
My lord, the king will see him now.

482
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,367
The king would see Godfrey's son.

483
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:15,067
I'll take him.

484
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:20,047
This morning I spoke
without knowing who you were.

485
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:23,917
I knew who you were. It's unmistakable.

486
01:00:24,017 --> 01:00:26,147
I loved your father...

487
01:00:26,257 --> 01:00:28,227
and I shall love you.

488
01:00:32,126 --> 01:00:34,096
Do you fear being with me?

489
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:36,166
No.

490
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:40,236
And yes.

491
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,826
A woman in my place has two faces.

492
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:47,376
One for the world...

493
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:50,406
and one which she wears in private.

494
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:53,076
With you I'll be only Sibylla.

495
01:00:58,386 --> 01:01:01,376
Tiberias thinks me unpredictable.

496
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,216
I am unpredictable.

497
01:01:07,795 --> 01:01:09,355
No. There.

498
01:01:24,545 --> 01:01:29,645
Come forward.
I am glad to meet Godfrey's son.

499
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:32,115
He was one of my greatest teachers.

500
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:37,055
He was there when, playing with
the other boys, my arm was cut.

501
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:41,995
And it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that I felt no pain.

502
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:46,964
He wept when he gave my father the news...

503
01:01:47,064 --> 01:01:49,034
that I am a leper.

504
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:54,534
The Saracens say that this disease...

505
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:58,374
is God's vengeance against
the vanity of our kingdom.

506
01:01:58,474 --> 01:02:00,644
As wretched as I am...

507
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:04,444
these Arabs believe that the
chastisement that awaits me in hell...

508
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,074
is far more severe and lasting.

509
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:11,454
If that's true, I call it unfair.

510
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,264
Come. Sit.

511
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:20,393
Do you play? No.

512
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,833
The whole world is in chess.

513
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:26,373
Any move can be the death of you.

514
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:29,563
Do anything except
remain where you started...

515
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:32,443
and you can't be sure of your end.

516
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:35,033
Were you sure of your end once?

517
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:39,243
I was. What was it?

518
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:44,253
To be buried a hundred
yards from where I was born.

519
01:02:44,353 --> 01:02:46,383
And now?

520
01:02:46,493 --> 01:02:49,393
Now I sit in Jerusalem and look upon a king.

521
01:02:54,002 --> 01:02:57,562
When I was 16 I won a great victory.

522
01:02:57,672 --> 01:03:00,762
I felt, in that moment,
I would live to be 100.

523
01:03:02,002 --> 01:03:05,302
Now I know I shall not see 30.

524
01:03:06,442 --> 01:03:10,212
None of us know our end, really...

525
01:03:10,312 --> 01:03:12,752
or what hand will guide us there.

526
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:16,152
A king may move a man.

527
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:18,412
A father may claim a son.

528
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:21,892
That man can also move himself.

529
01:03:21,992 --> 01:03:25,822
And only then does that
man truly begin his own game.

530
01:03:27,102 --> 01:03:29,291
Remember, how so ever you are played...

531
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:33,491
or by whom, your soul
is in your keeping alone...

532
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:37,271
even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power.

533
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:41,371
When you stand before God, you cannot say...

534
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:44,381
"But I was told by others to do thus"...

535
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:48,311
or that virtue was
not convenient at the time.

536
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:50,321
This will not suffice.

537
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:52,681
Remember that.

538
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:56,361
I will.

539
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,691
You know what this is?

540
01:04:00,801 --> 01:04:03,630
A fortification. What do you think of it?

541
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,930
You disapprove.
Well, how would you improve it?

542
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:13,440
A cross. Or better, a star, like this.

543
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,840
That way no part of the
fortress may be approached...

544
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,640
without being exposed
to fire from another part.

545
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,310
Yes, I like this.
Your walls are more difficult to address.

546
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,880
Very good.

547
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:30,220
You will go to your father's
house at Ibelin, your house now...

548
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:34,520
and then from there you
will protect the pilgrim road.

549
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,690
Safeguard in particular
the Jews and the Muslims.

550
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,559
All are welcome in Jerusalem.

551
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:45,609
Not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.

552
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:47,699
Protect the helpless.

553
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:50,239
And then maybe one day,
when I am helpless...

554
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,469
you will come and protect me.

555
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:17,657
There, my lord.

556
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:19,527
Ibelin.

557
01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:14,875
Quod sumus...

558
01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:17,645
hoc eritis.

559
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:22,125
Such as we are, you will be.

560
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,094
Your father was important.

561
01:07:58,194 --> 01:08:00,994
His lands were not.

562
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:03,364
That will suit me.

563
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:11,104
My lord, you have a thousand acres...

564
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:14,073
a hundred families.

565
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,233
You have Christians, Jews, Muslims.

566
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,243
You have 50 pairs of oxen.

567
01:08:19,343 --> 01:08:22,713
This is a poor and dusty place.

568
01:08:22,813 --> 01:08:26,343
What we do not have is water.

569
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:35,851
Right. Stone the walls.

570
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:37,169
I'm on my way to Cana.

571
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:43,849
Where Jesus changed water to wine.

572
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:48,589
But a better trick would be
to change you to a nobleman.

573
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:52,749
That should be easy. In France a
few yards of silk can make a nobleman.

574
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:56,889
I expect your hospitality.

575
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:58,489
It is given.

576
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:00,729
Latif.

577
01:12:47,206 --> 01:12:50,176
But this isn't adultery. It's washing.

578
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:57,285
But if it were adultery...

579
01:12:57,385 --> 01:12:59,355
which it isn't...

580
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:02,355
the Commandments are not for people like us.

581
01:13:02,455 --> 01:13:04,445
They are for the others.

582
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:08,225
Did they give you something to eat?

583
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:11,195
They said to wait until the master returned.

584
01:13:14,065 --> 01:13:17,035
My cook will prepare
something while you wash.

585
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:43,664
What?

586
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:46,564
It seems years since I've seen a woman eat.

587
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:48,194
Truly?

588
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,264
I was watching you today.

589
01:13:54,374 --> 01:13:57,344
You've been given a
patch of dirt, and it seems...

590
01:13:58,444 --> 01:14:01,344
you will build a new Jerusalem here.

591
01:14:01,444 --> 01:14:03,414
It is my land.

592
01:14:05,553 --> 01:14:08,523
Who would I be if I did
not try to make it better?

593
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:27,093
They try to be one...

594
01:14:27,203 --> 01:14:29,433
one heart...

595
01:14:29,543 --> 01:14:31,513
one morality.

596
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:34,203
Their prophet says, "Submit."

597
01:14:34,313 --> 01:14:36,443
Jesus says...

598
01:14:37,483 --> 01:14:39,813
"Decide."

599
01:14:39,913 --> 01:14:42,712
Did you decide on Guy?

600
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:47,882
Guy was chosen by my mother.

601
01:14:47,992 --> 01:14:50,792
My first husband died
before our son was born.

602
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:54,262
I was only 15.

603
01:14:55,862 --> 01:14:58,232
I've met your son.

604
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:41,829
I could stay here forever.

605
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:44,599
This house is yours.

606
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,399
Why do you think I'm here?

607
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:01,449
I know that Ibelin is
not on the way to Cana.

608
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:03,748
What else do you know, my lord?

609
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:06,218
I know that you are a princess...

610
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:09,088
and I am no lord.

611
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:10,858
You're a knight.

612
01:17:10,968 --> 01:17:14,028
Neither earned nor proved.

613
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:24,138
I'm not here with you because
I'm... I'm bored or wicked.

614
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:27,248
I'm here because...

615
01:17:28,318 --> 01:17:30,218
because in the East...

616
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:33,218
between one person and another...

617
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:35,448
there is only light.

618
01:18:48,355 --> 01:18:50,685
Halt!

619
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:56,065
This caravan is armed, Reynald.

620
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,965
Good. No sport otherwise.

621
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,825
They've seen us.

622
01:19:01,935 --> 01:19:03,705
Go after them.

623
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,635
A rider is getting away.
It's a broad desert. Nothing'll come of it.

624
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:11,045
I prefer not to be hanged
before my wife is queen. Don't worry.

625
01:19:11,145 --> 01:19:13,175
"Who but Reynald?" they'll say.

626
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:16,305
It's always me. They'll believe
it in Jerusalem, I assure you.

627
01:19:16,415 --> 01:19:20,685
You were at Nazareth, praying.
You're a dangerous man.

628
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:24,084
If the war's to be now or
later, I would have it now.

629
01:19:24,194 --> 01:19:27,894
How long can the leper last?
God wills it. God wills it!

630
01:19:27,994 --> 01:19:31,024
God wills it! Jerusalem!

631
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:34,064
Charge!

632
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:03,433
It's you! Ha!

633
01:20:40,832 --> 01:20:43,272
This is from France.

634
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,992
I've never been there.

635
01:20:45,102 --> 01:20:47,262
This from my brother.

636
01:20:47,372 --> 01:20:49,842
This to remind us of death.

637
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:52,602
And this...

638
01:20:54,252 --> 01:20:56,612
I bought the day I saw you.

639
01:20:58,382 --> 01:21:00,412
You lie.

640
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:33,541
Guy de Lusignan and Reynald
de Chatillon, with the Templars...

641
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:35,621
have attacked a Saracen caravan.

642
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:38,661
Liar!

643
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,661
Silence!

644
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:42,891
It was no caravan.

645
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:46,520
It was an army headed for Bethlehem
to desecrate the birthplace of our Lord!

646
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:50,800
Reynald, with the Templars,
have broken the king's pledge of peace.

647
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,370
Saladin will come into this kingdom...

648
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:57,910
Tiberias knows more than a Christian
should about Saladin's intentions.

649
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:07,080
That I would rather live
with men than kill them...

650
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,020
is certainly why you are alive.

651
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,420
That sort of Christianity
has its uses, I suppose.

652
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,190
We must not go to war with Saladin!

653
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,029
We do not want it, and we
may not win it. Blasphemy!

654
01:22:21,129 --> 01:22:23,099
Blasphemy!

655
01:22:25,469 --> 01:22:28,909
An army of Jesus Christ, which
bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.

656
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:32,409
Does the count of Tiberias
suggest that it could be?

657
01:22:32,509 --> 01:22:35,499
There must be war. God wills it!

658
01:22:35,609 --> 01:22:38,949
God wills it! God wills it!

659
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:41,749
God wills it!

660
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:43,549
God wills it!

661
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:54,089
Silence!

662
01:23:03,268 --> 01:23:07,138
Saladin has crossed the
Jordan with 200,000 men.

663
01:23:08,648 --> 01:23:11,808
He will make first for Kerak
and Reynald de Chatillon.

664
01:23:11,918 --> 01:23:13,818
My lord...

665
01:23:21,058 --> 01:23:24,488
We must meet him before he reaches Kerak.

666
01:23:24,598 --> 01:23:26,558
I will lead the army.

667
01:23:26,658 --> 01:23:31,117
My lord, if you travel, you'll die.

668
01:23:31,237 --> 01:23:34,497
Send word to Balian to
protect the villagers.

669
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:39,167
Assemble the army.

670
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:01,427
What becomes of us?

671
01:24:02,897 --> 01:24:04,867
The world will decide.

672
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:09,796
The world always decides.

673
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:31,286
My lord! The king is marching on Kerak.

674
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,535
Let's go! Hurry. Straight on!

675
01:24:55,315 --> 01:24:59,375
Saracen cavalry.
They're coming to close Reynald in.

676
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:02,075
These people are not safe outside the walls.

677
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,815
Saladin will certainly come behind him.

678
01:25:17,934 --> 01:25:20,404
Go into the fortress now.

679
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:25,704
Hyah! Hah!

680
01:25:33,184 --> 01:25:35,414
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

681
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:37,584
Hyah! Hyah!

682
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:54,363
Visitors!

683
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:08,913
My lord Balian! My lord Balian!

684
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,753
My lord Reynald prays you
bring your force into Kerak.

685
01:26:13,853 --> 01:26:17,383
Thank you, but no.
If we do, these people will die.

686
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:21,293
We'll hold the Saracen
cavalry until the king arrives.

687
01:26:21,403 --> 01:26:24,763
So be it. Hyah!

688
01:26:27,073 --> 01:26:29,432
We cannot attack that and live.

689
01:26:32,712 --> 01:26:36,402
My lady. What do you look at?

690
01:26:36,512 --> 01:26:38,482
A knight.

691
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,512
His men.

692
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:53,092
Are you with me?

693
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:51,880
Forward!

694
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:02,330
Divide!

695
01:30:05,886 --> 01:30:08,856
Your quality will be
known among your enemies...

696
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:11,226
before ever you meet them, my friend.

697
01:30:14,436 --> 01:30:17,196
You were not that man's servant.

698
01:30:17,306 --> 01:30:20,596
No. He was my servant.

699
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:33,976
What becomes of us? As you deserve.

700
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:37,545
You reap what you sow.

701
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:40,525
You have heard of this, no?

702
01:30:41,825 --> 01:30:44,025
Get up.

703
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:58,845
You may go into Kerak...

704
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:01,505
but you will die there.

705
01:31:01,615 --> 01:31:04,235
My master is here.

706
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:27,864
Tell my lord Saladin
that Jerusalem has come.

707
01:32:29,032 --> 01:32:30,932
Saladin.

708
01:32:53,452 --> 01:32:57,981
I pray you'll pull back your
cavalry and leave this matter to me.

709
01:32:58,091 --> 01:33:02,891
I pray you'll retire unharmed to Damascus.

710
01:33:02,991 --> 01:33:05,621
Reynald of Chatillon will be punished.

711
01:33:05,731 --> 01:33:07,631
I swear it.

712
01:33:07,731 --> 01:33:10,701
Withdraw, or we will all die here.

713
01:33:22,851 --> 01:33:25,081
Do we have terms?

714
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:31,191
We have terms.

715
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:42,090
I will send you my physicians.

716
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:47,700
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

717
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,449
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

718
01:34:50,868 --> 01:34:53,238
On your knees.

719
01:34:55,508 --> 01:34:57,698
Lower.

720
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:03,838
I... am Jerusalem.

721
01:35:06,048 --> 01:35:09,148
And you, Reynald...

722
01:35:09,248 --> 01:35:12,448
will give me the kiss of peace.

723
01:35:31,207 --> 01:35:33,197
Guard.

724
01:35:40,887 --> 01:35:44,117
What are you looking at? A dead man.

725
01:35:44,217 --> 01:35:47,207
Reynald de Chatillon, you are arrested...

726
01:35:47,327 --> 01:35:49,347
and condemned.

727
01:35:52,227 --> 01:35:54,956
Come.

728
01:36:06,076 --> 01:36:09,306
If you continue like this...

729
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:11,746
I shall have to find a use for you.

730
01:36:11,846 --> 01:36:13,816
If God can spare you, that is.

731
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:16,046
God does not know me.

732
01:36:16,146 --> 01:36:17,816
Yes, but I do.

733
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:43,905
I need you in Jerusalem.

734
01:37:27,434 --> 01:37:30,334
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

735
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:40,643
Why did we retire?

736
01:37:40,743 --> 01:37:43,733
Why?

737
01:37:43,853 --> 01:37:47,843
God did not favor him. God, alone,
determines the results of battles.

738
01:37:47,953 --> 01:37:51,283
The results of battles
are determined by God...

739
01:37:51,393 --> 01:37:54,693
but also by preparation, numbers...

740
01:37:54,793 --> 01:37:58,563
the absence of disease
and the availability of water.

741
01:37:58,663 --> 01:38:02,863
One cannot maintain a
siege with the enemy behind.

742
01:38:02,963 --> 01:38:07,533
How many battles did God win
for the Muslims before I came?

743
01:38:07,643 --> 01:38:12,043
That is, before God
determined that I should come.

744
01:38:13,683 --> 01:38:15,582
Few enough.

745
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:19,552
That's because we were sinful.

746
01:38:21,352 --> 01:38:24,182
It is because you were unprepared.

747
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:27,522
If you think that way,
you shall not be king for long.

748
01:38:33,962 --> 01:38:37,732
When I am not king, I quake for Islam.

749
01:38:39,172 --> 01:38:41,162
Thank you for your visit.

750
01:38:45,242 --> 01:38:47,902
Thank you for your visit.

751
01:38:53,081 --> 01:38:55,311
You promised.

752
01:38:55,421 --> 01:38:58,511
You promised to return Jerusalem.

753
01:39:00,021 --> 01:39:01,921
Don't forget.

754
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:21,041
If I do not deliver war, I have no peace.

755
01:39:21,141 --> 01:39:24,041
The king of Jerusalem will die soon.

756
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:28,580
When he is dead, the boy will become
king of a kingdom he cannot control.

757
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:33,450
The Christians will make the war you need.

758
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:35,469
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

759
01:40:37,748 --> 01:40:43,048
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

760
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:46,818
Reynald de Chatillon!

761
01:40:51,698 --> 01:40:54,568
Reynald de Chatillon!

762
01:40:54,668 --> 01:40:58,998
The things that we have left undone...

763
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:02,798
plague us as death comes.

764
01:41:02,908 --> 01:41:05,238
That is why to the dying...

765
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:07,938
There is no comfort but the Lord.

766
01:41:08,048 --> 01:41:11,038
Spare me your sermon.

767
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:14,947
Go and prepare your people
for the coronation of my nephew.

768
01:41:17,357 --> 01:41:19,987
Your confession, my lord.

769
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:23,187
I shall confess to God when I see him...

770
01:41:26,127 --> 01:41:28,097
not to you.

771
01:41:29,137 --> 01:41:31,697
Now leave me.

772
01:42:17,446 --> 01:42:21,286
You sometimes dream you are my wife.

773
01:42:21,386 --> 01:42:24,085
Let's pretend you are.

774
01:43:01,694 --> 01:43:03,654
I must go.

775
01:43:08,064 --> 01:43:11,504
We can't meet in the city.

776
01:43:11,604 --> 01:43:13,364
Then we will leave it.

777
01:43:13,464 --> 01:43:17,464
And live how? Live where?

778
01:43:17,574 --> 01:43:19,634
Balian...

779
01:43:19,744 --> 01:43:23,004
my brother's dying.

780
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:28,514
My son will be king and I
his regent. I must rule for him.

781
01:43:28,614 --> 01:43:32,344
And not just in Jerusalem, but Acre...

782
01:43:32,454 --> 01:43:34,823
Ashkelon, Beirut.

783
01:43:37,463 --> 01:43:39,423
And Guy?

784
01:44:07,653 --> 01:44:11,452
Always surround your knights
with your foot soldiers.

785
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,652
These rooms are not yours.

786
01:44:19,902 --> 01:44:24,062
One day I will be the husband
I was commissioned to be.

787
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:27,232
And perhaps not, my dear.

788
01:44:27,342 --> 01:44:31,672
Your lover has a hundred
knights and the love of the king.

789
01:44:31,782 --> 01:44:35,232
I, the largest force in the kingdom...

790
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:38,012
and the support of the Templars.

791
01:44:38,122 --> 01:44:41,742
I can do without the king's affection.

792
01:44:41,852 --> 01:44:43,882
But as for your love...

793
01:44:53,431 --> 01:44:55,761
Then we must come to an understanding.

794
01:44:55,871 --> 01:45:01,431
You need my knights or
his rule will be bloody and brief.

795
01:45:15,621 --> 01:45:17,711
So, my friend...

796
01:45:17,821 --> 01:45:21,420
the time has come to conclude my affairs.

797
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:23,490
If I leave the army with Guy...

798
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:27,460
he will take power through my
sister and make war on the Muslims.

799
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:32,260
We have decided that you shall
take command of the army of Jerusalem.

800
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:36,270
Will you defend my nephew when he's king?

801
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,840
Whatever you ask. I will serve.

802
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:45,040
No, hear it all before you answer.

803
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:50,250
Would you marry my sister, Sibylla,
were she free of Guy de Lusignan?

804
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:53,790
And Guy?

805
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:57,049
He will be executed...

806
01:45:57,159 --> 01:46:01,259
along with his knights who
do not swear your allegiance.

807
01:46:04,339 --> 01:46:06,529
I cannot be the cause of that.

808
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:11,369
"Whatever you ask. I will serve."

809
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:17,839
"A king may move a man," you said...

810
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:23,049
"but the soul belongs to the man."

811
01:46:23,149 --> 01:46:25,819
Yes, I did.

812
01:46:25,919 --> 01:46:28,119
You have my love...

813
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:31,018
and my answer.

814
01:46:31,128 --> 01:46:34,148
Oh. So be it.

815
01:46:35,228 --> 01:46:38,328
Why do you protect Guy, hmm?

816
01:46:38,438 --> 01:46:41,628
He's a man who insults you, who hates you...

817
01:46:41,738 --> 01:46:44,368
who'd kill you himself if he had the chance.

818
01:46:44,478 --> 01:46:47,208
Fulfill the salvation of this kingdom.

819
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:49,248
Would it be so hard...

820
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:52,208
to marry Sibylla?

821
01:46:52,318 --> 01:46:57,048
Jerusalem has no need of a perfect knight.

822
01:46:57,148 --> 01:47:01,058
No. It is a kingdom of conscience...

823
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:03,058
or nothing.

824
01:47:22,207 --> 01:47:24,107
Sibylla.

825
01:47:36,687 --> 01:47:39,457
Who are you to refuse a king?

826
01:47:39,557 --> 01:47:43,286
I will have power, without Guy or with him.

827
01:47:43,396 --> 01:47:47,696
Guy is indebted to your say-so
and my brother's, but it's mine.

828
01:47:49,906 --> 01:47:53,536
Do you have any idea of
Jerusalem except that it is yours?

829
01:47:53,636 --> 01:47:56,906
You will never hold it in
peace as your brother did.

830
01:47:57,006 --> 01:47:58,806
It will be war.

831
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:02,406
My grandfather took Jerusalem in blood.

832
01:48:02,516 --> 01:48:06,416
I'll keep it the same way or any way I can.

833
01:48:06,516 --> 01:48:08,386
I am what I am.

834
01:48:08,486 --> 01:48:10,586
I offer you that...

835
01:48:11,656 --> 01:48:13,756
and the world.

836
01:48:20,065 --> 01:48:22,325
You say no.

837
01:48:24,105 --> 01:48:26,575
Do you think I'm like Guy?

838
01:48:26,675 --> 01:48:30,165
That I would sell my soul?

839
01:48:36,445 --> 01:48:38,415
There'll be a day...

840
01:48:38,515 --> 01:48:41,485
when you will wish
you had done a little evil...

841
01:48:41,585 --> 01:48:44,215
to do a greater good.

842
01:48:50,395 --> 01:48:53,364
Reynald.

843
01:49:00,474 --> 01:49:02,444
My lord.

844
01:49:38,743 --> 01:49:40,643
Mmm.

845
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:48,103
Do you really think the king wants you
head of the army once he's gone? Hmm?

846
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:51,853
Think your wife does?

847
01:49:57,863 --> 01:50:01,993
I have a problem. Ah, yes. Balian.

848
01:50:02,103 --> 01:50:04,562
I saw him at Kerak.

849
01:50:05,972 --> 01:50:08,662
Celebrated.

850
01:50:08,772 --> 01:50:12,502
You must beware a popular man.

851
01:50:12,612 --> 01:50:15,202
Kill him.

852
01:50:21,722 --> 01:50:23,842
What's that? England.

853
01:50:23,952 --> 01:50:27,082
The king? Richard. And his father was Henry.

854
01:50:27,192 --> 01:50:30,252
Good. And that? France.

855
01:50:30,362 --> 01:50:32,122
Will I ever see France?

856
01:50:32,232 --> 01:50:35,462
Maybe one day. But you must be king here.

857
01:50:36,632 --> 01:50:40,031
How many islands can you see here?

858
01:50:40,131 --> 01:50:43,231
One, two... The king will see you.

859
01:50:43,341 --> 01:50:49,041
No, I can't. I can't bear
to look at him. Use this.

860
01:50:49,141 --> 01:50:51,911
It doesn't mean I don't love him.

861
01:50:52,011 --> 01:50:54,611
Go, madam.

862
01:52:31,408 --> 01:52:34,638
Oh. Hello.

863
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:40,688
I was dreaming...

864
01:52:40,788 --> 01:52:44,478
I was back in that summer...

865
01:52:44,588 --> 01:52:46,818
when I defeated Saladin.

866
01:52:46,928 --> 01:52:49,898
Do you remember it?

867
01:52:49,998 --> 01:52:53,058
I was only 16.

868
01:52:53,168 --> 01:52:55,658
You were a beautiful boy.

869
01:52:55,768 --> 01:52:58,998
Yes. You have always been beautiful.

870
01:53:00,107 --> 01:53:02,077
In every way.

871
01:53:05,777 --> 01:53:10,677
My beautiful sister. I've missed you.

872
01:53:10,777 --> 01:53:12,677
So beautiful.

873
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:17,507
I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain.

874
01:53:20,727 --> 01:53:23,697
Remember me as I was.

875
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:27,497
I will.

876
01:54:18,615 --> 01:54:20,675
Sibylla.

877
01:54:34,895 --> 01:54:37,335
If my son has your knights...

878
01:54:40,135 --> 01:54:43,005
you have your wife.

879
01:56:05,652 --> 01:56:08,142
Behold your rightful king and heir...

880
01:56:08,252 --> 01:56:11,242
to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

881
01:56:11,362 --> 01:56:14,952
Yes! Yes! Yes!

882
01:56:15,062 --> 01:56:17,862
Long live the king in prosperity.

883
01:56:17,962 --> 01:56:22,022
Long live the king. Long live the king.

884
01:56:22,132 --> 01:56:24,072
Long live the king.

885
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:42,381
One may stare into the
light until one becomes the light.

886
01:56:42,491 --> 01:56:44,651
I've done it many times.

887
01:56:51,701 --> 01:56:53,631
There's your religion.

888
01:56:53,731 --> 01:56:57,001
One spark, a creosote bush.

889
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:04,301
There's your Moses. I did not hear it speak.

890
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:07,171
That does not mean that there is no God.

891
01:57:07,281 --> 01:57:10,470
Do you love her?

892
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:13,850
Yes. The heart will mend.

893
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:17,250
Your duty is to the people of the city.

894
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:19,750
I go to pray. For what?

895
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:25,920
For the strength to endure what is to come.

896
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:27,930
And what is to come?

897
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:32,660
The reckoning is to come for
what was done 100 years before.

898
01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:35,700
The Muslims will never forget.

899
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:41,300
Nor should they.

900
01:58:12,509 --> 01:58:15,479
My lady, your letter to Saladin.

901
01:58:15,579 --> 01:58:20,448
Peace to be sustained, borders
respected, trade allowed to continue.

902
01:58:20,548 --> 01:58:24,208
Is this wise to show your intentions?

903
01:58:24,318 --> 01:58:27,258
Better, surely, to let him wonder.

904
01:58:27,358 --> 01:58:29,378
We keep my brother's peace.

905
01:58:29,488 --> 01:58:31,588
Sign it.

906
01:58:42,668 --> 01:58:45,158
Take the seal.

907
01:58:46,438 --> 01:58:49,498
Be careful. Be careful.

908
01:59:00,987 --> 01:59:03,957
Put it back, my darling.

909
01:59:16,967 --> 01:59:20,027
Hey!

910
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:52,366
There is a rumor.

911
01:59:52,476 --> 01:59:54,466
We must condemn it immediately.

912
01:59:55,776 --> 01:59:59,976
Call it treason,
and kill those who whisper it.

913
02:00:00,076 --> 02:00:04,415
The rumor will die if
we show the boy as active.

914
02:00:06,355 --> 02:00:09,755
How long before he wears a mask?

915
02:00:12,325 --> 02:00:15,295
Will you have one made for him?

916
02:00:15,395 --> 02:00:20,025
How did my boy deserve it?

917
02:00:24,065 --> 02:00:26,505
Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias.

918
02:00:29,205 --> 02:00:32,505
No kingdom is worth my son alive in hell.

919
02:00:34,475 --> 02:00:37,885
I will go to hell instead.

920
02:01:00,274 --> 02:01:03,724
Do you remember the story of Llewellyn? No.

921
02:01:03,844 --> 02:01:08,004
Well, do you remember why? No.

922
02:01:08,114 --> 02:01:10,374
He was so lonely...

923
02:01:10,484 --> 02:01:14,214
and he called all the gods.

924
02:01:14,314 --> 02:01:18,753
Why? Because he was desperate.
It was a proof of love.

925
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:05,020
Is this why you came to the Holy Land?

926
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:07,360
Come on!

927
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,650
Leave us.

928
02:03:37,389 --> 02:03:40,849
The boy's in heaven? Yes.

929
02:03:40,959 --> 02:03:44,789
His mother has more backbone than I do.

930
02:03:44,899 --> 02:03:48,159
She's in the crypt and will not come out.

931
02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:55,969
Have the Templars killed Balian? Yes.

932
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:58,599
Reynald...

933
02:03:58,709 --> 02:04:00,679
give me a war.

934
02:04:02,279 --> 02:04:04,909
That is what I do.

935
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:09,139
Behold your rightful queen and heir...

936
02:04:09,259 --> 02:04:11,489
to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

937
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:14,218
Yes! Yes! Yes!

938
02:04:14,328 --> 02:04:17,388
I, Sibylla, by the grace
of the Holy Spirit...

939
02:04:17,498 --> 02:04:21,088
choose as king Guy de Lusignan...

940
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:24,098
the man who's been my husband.

941
02:04:24,198 --> 02:04:27,368
With the help of God,
he will rule his people well.

942
02:04:30,808 --> 02:04:34,178
Long live the king in prosperity.

943
02:04:34,278 --> 02:04:38,308
Long live the king. Long live the king.

944
02:04:38,418 --> 02:04:40,278
Long live the king.

945
02:05:02,907 --> 02:05:06,037
I am what I am.

946
02:05:06,147 --> 02:05:08,047
Someone has to be.

947
02:05:32,836 --> 02:05:34,806
Saladin's sister.

948
02:05:36,276 --> 02:05:38,176
I know.

949
02:05:54,256 --> 02:05:56,246
Saladin achki.

950
02:05:57,995 --> 02:05:59,985
I know.

951
02:06:22,685 --> 02:06:26,315
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

952
02:06:26,425 --> 02:06:28,325
Speak.

953
02:06:33,624 --> 02:06:36,724
The sultan demands the
return of his sister's body...

954
02:06:36,834 --> 02:06:38,824
the heads of those responsible...

955
02:06:38,934 --> 02:06:41,234
and the surrender of Jerusalem.

956
02:06:45,604 --> 02:06:47,504
Does he?

957
02:06:49,114 --> 02:06:51,574
What answer do you return to Saladin?

958
02:07:02,954 --> 02:07:05,724
This.

959
02:07:20,143 --> 02:07:23,373
Take the head to Damascus.

960
02:07:31,313 --> 02:07:33,543
I am Jerusalem.

961
02:07:37,823 --> 02:07:42,923
Assemble the army! Yea!

962
02:08:03,682 --> 02:08:05,942
Now this assembly of barons...

963
02:08:06,052 --> 02:08:09,312
and all Jerusalem is complete.

964
02:08:09,422 --> 02:08:13,982
There are those among you who
may disagree with our succession...

965
02:08:14,092 --> 02:08:16,852
but it is war.

966
02:08:16,962 --> 02:08:19,192
Aye!

967
02:08:19,302 --> 02:08:22,061
And I am...

968
02:08:22,171 --> 02:08:24,261
the king.

969
02:08:25,401 --> 02:08:28,731
We march at once. What say this council?

970
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:32,471
Aye! No.

971
02:08:32,581 --> 02:08:37,671
If you must have war, this army
cannot move away from water.

972
02:08:39,081 --> 02:08:42,351
You have a chance to hold the city...

973
02:08:42,451 --> 02:08:45,221
but if you move out against Saladin...

974
02:08:45,321 --> 02:08:48,781
this army will be destroyed
and the city left defenseless.

975
02:08:48,891 --> 02:08:52,591
When I wish a blacksmith
to advise me in war...

976
02:08:52,701 --> 02:08:55,160
I will tell him.

977
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,960
Saladin wants you to come out.

978
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,330
He is waiting for you to make that mistake.

979
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,630
He knows his man.

980
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:08,570
We should meet the enemies of God. Aye!

981
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,580
And so we shall.

982
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:14,140
Then you do so without my knights.

983
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:19,690
Then I will have the glory, Tiberias.
You had yours years and years ago.

984
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:22,450
It's time for mine.

985
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:30,729
Forward!

986
02:09:33,099 --> 02:09:35,069
Forward!

987
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:52,419
Tiberias.

988
02:09:53,859 --> 02:09:58,489
When Saladin has finished
with Guy, he will come.

989
02:09:58,589 --> 02:10:00,559
We must look to the defenses.

990
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:04,029
The boy's dead.

991
02:10:07,938 --> 02:10:09,928
Guy. No.

992
02:10:10,038 --> 02:10:12,838
The boy was leprous like his uncle.

993
02:10:12,938 --> 02:10:15,598
She gave him peace.

994
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:17,678
She let him go...

995
02:10:20,018 --> 02:10:23,848
and Jerusalem along with him.

996
02:10:27,658 --> 02:10:30,018
Keep to your lines!

997
02:10:30,128 --> 02:10:32,288
You go with the army?

998
02:10:32,398 --> 02:10:34,358
My order is with the army.

999
02:10:34,458 --> 02:10:37,228
You go to certain death.

1000
02:10:37,328 --> 02:10:39,558
All death is certain.

1001
02:10:39,668 --> 02:10:43,297
I shall tell your father
what I've seen you become.

1002
02:11:24,906 --> 02:11:27,176
When Saladin comes...

1003
02:11:28,276 --> 02:11:31,246
we're not defensible.

1004
02:11:33,716 --> 02:11:36,846
Save the people from what I have done.

1005
02:11:36,956 --> 02:11:38,856
I will.

1006
02:12:41,754 --> 02:12:43,274
God wills it.

1007
02:13:12,813 --> 02:13:15,413
Can you sense it?

1008
02:13:15,513 --> 02:13:18,383
There has been no messenger.

1009
02:14:39,471 --> 02:14:42,301
I drink water for what it is.

1010
02:14:46,311 --> 02:14:48,331
I did not give the cup to you.

1011
02:14:48,441 --> 02:14:51,210
No, my lord.

1012
02:16:01,048 --> 02:16:04,018
A king does not kill a king.

1013
02:16:04,118 --> 02:16:06,578
Were you not close enough to a great king...

1014
02:16:06,688 --> 02:16:09,278
to learn by his example?

1015
02:16:46,657 --> 02:16:49,787
I've given Jerusalem my whole life.

1016
02:16:49,897 --> 02:16:51,797
Everything.

1017
02:16:54,327 --> 02:16:59,427
First I thought we... were fighting for God.

1018
02:16:59,537 --> 02:17:04,337
Then I realized we were
fighting for wealth and land.

1019
02:17:04,437 --> 02:17:06,407
I was ashamed.

1020
02:17:14,646 --> 02:17:16,846
Tiberias.

1021
02:17:16,956 --> 02:17:19,786
There is no more Jerusalem.

1022
02:17:21,086 --> 02:17:24,996
I shall go to Cyprus. Will you come with me?

1023
02:17:25,096 --> 02:17:26,656
No.

1024
02:17:28,126 --> 02:17:30,596
You are your father's son.

1025
02:17:32,236 --> 02:17:36,796
Saladin must move his
army from water to water.

1026
02:17:36,906 --> 02:17:40,846
That gives you four days, maybe five.

1027
02:17:42,276 --> 02:17:44,806
God be with you.

1028
02:17:44,916 --> 02:17:48,505
He's no longer with me.

1029
02:18:40,704 --> 02:18:43,864
Mark 400. Four hundred!

1030
02:18:43,974 --> 02:18:47,064
Four hundred!

1031
02:19:01,653 --> 02:19:03,553
They're here.

1032
02:19:03,653 --> 02:19:05,353
It is only one man.

1033
02:19:09,023 --> 02:19:11,723
No. They're here.

1034
02:19:31,582 --> 02:19:35,242
This is the only section of
the wall that they can attack...

1035
02:19:35,352 --> 02:19:38,222
once they begin to bombard the walls.

1036
02:19:38,322 --> 02:19:41,552
They will stop only to avoid hitting
their own siege towers as they come in.

1037
02:19:41,662 --> 02:19:43,992
We take the bombardment.

1038
02:19:44,092 --> 02:19:46,652
When they cease firing, we fire.

1039
02:19:50,402 --> 02:19:53,202
We must leave the city.

1040
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:55,272
How exactly, my lord bishop?

1041
02:19:55,372 --> 02:19:57,862
The fastest horses from a lesser gate.

1042
02:19:58,912 --> 02:20:00,812
And the people?

1043
02:20:00,912 --> 02:20:05,142
It is unfortunate about
the people, but it is God's will.

1044
02:20:12,551 --> 02:20:14,491
Silence!

1045
02:20:17,761 --> 02:20:19,661
Silence!

1046
02:20:23,831 --> 02:20:25,801
It has fallen to us...

1047
02:20:25,901 --> 02:20:27,961
to defend Jerusalem...

1048
02:20:28,071 --> 02:20:32,301
and we have made our
preparations as well as they can be made.

1049
02:20:33,941 --> 02:20:37,341
None of us took this city from Muslims.

1050
02:20:38,811 --> 02:20:42,680
No Muslim, of the great
army now coming against us...

1051
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:47,520
was born when this city was lost.

1052
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:52,150
We fight over an offense we did not give...

1053
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:55,490
against those who were
not alive to be offended.

1054
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:00,270
What is Jerusalem?

1055
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:03,360
Your holy places lie
over the Jewish temple...

1056
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:06,130
that the Romans pulled down.

1057
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,840
The Muslim places of worship lie over yours.

1058
02:21:11,350 --> 02:21:13,810
Which is more holy?

1059
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:19,909
The wall? The mosque?

1060
02:21:20,019 --> 02:21:22,149
The sepulcher?

1061
02:21:22,259 --> 02:21:24,379
Who has claim?

1062
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:26,859
No one has claim.

1063
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:30,169
All have claim!

1064
02:21:30,269 --> 02:21:32,429
That is blasphemy. Be quiet.

1065
02:21:32,539 --> 02:21:34,509
We defend this city...

1066
02:21:34,609 --> 02:21:37,269
not to protect these stones...

1067
02:21:37,379 --> 02:21:40,499
but the people living within these walls.

1068
02:22:03,468 --> 02:22:05,938
My lord. My lord, my lord.

1069
02:22:06,038 --> 02:22:11,028
How are we to defend
Jerusalem without knights?

1070
02:22:11,138 --> 02:22:13,798
We have no knights! Truly?

1071
02:22:23,558 --> 02:22:27,218
What is your condition?
I'm servant to the patriarch.

1072
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:30,017
He's, uh, one of my servants.

1073
02:22:30,127 --> 02:22:33,687
Is he? You were born a servant?

1074
02:22:33,797 --> 02:22:36,227
Kneel.

1075
02:22:40,137 --> 02:22:42,967
Every man at arms...

1076
02:22:43,067 --> 02:22:45,067
or capable of bearing them...

1077
02:22:45,177 --> 02:22:47,077
kneel!

1078
02:22:51,077 --> 02:22:53,307
On your knees!

1079
02:22:59,957 --> 02:23:04,186
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

1080
02:23:04,296 --> 02:23:07,926
Be brave and upright that God may love thee.

1081
02:23:09,466 --> 02:23:13,426
Speak the truth even
if it leads to your death.

1082
02:23:16,206 --> 02:23:18,106
Safeguard the helpless.

1083
02:23:18,206 --> 02:23:20,106
That is your oath.

1084
02:23:25,616 --> 02:23:27,776
And that is so you remember it.

1085
02:23:27,886 --> 02:23:30,946
Rise a knight.

1086
02:23:31,056 --> 02:23:32,716
Rise a knight!

1087
02:23:39,965 --> 02:23:43,555
Master Gravedigger. It is you.

1088
02:23:43,665 --> 02:23:46,425
Not what I was. Nor are you.

1089
02:23:46,535 --> 02:23:48,625
Rise a knight.

1090
02:23:51,175 --> 02:23:55,335
Who do you think you are?
Will you alter the world?

1091
02:23:55,445 --> 02:23:59,275
Does making a man a knight
make him a better fighter?

1092
02:24:06,185 --> 02:24:08,085
Yes.

1093
02:24:43,254 --> 02:24:45,224
Almaric...

1094
02:24:47,924 --> 02:24:52,553
if you survive, Ibelin is yours.

1095
02:24:54,833 --> 02:24:57,063
You are master of Ibelin.

1096
02:25:02,643 --> 02:25:04,613
I confirm it.

1097
02:25:06,143 --> 02:25:10,173
Rise a knight and baron of Ibelin.

1098
02:25:12,113 --> 02:25:16,283
But it is a poor and dusty place.

1099
02:25:28,632 --> 02:25:32,832
My lord? No.

1100
02:25:41,042 --> 02:25:43,532
When will it begin?

1101
02:25:47,822 --> 02:25:50,252
Soon.

1102
02:26:20,331 --> 02:26:22,321
Get them to the walls!

1103
02:26:23,901 --> 02:26:27,361
Water! Bring water!

1104
02:26:28,841 --> 02:26:31,471
Get to the walls.

1105
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:35,981
Push!

1106
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:41,320
Run! Push!

1107
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,930
Why do they not fire back?

1108
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:03,500
They wait.

1109
02:28:28,957 --> 02:28:33,727
That was only the first day.
There may be a hundred more.

1110
02:28:33,827 --> 02:28:37,287
Saladin will show no mercy.

1111
02:28:40,307 --> 02:28:42,267
We must hold out...

1112
02:28:42,367 --> 02:28:44,927
force him to offer terms.

1113
02:28:45,037 --> 02:28:46,137
What terms?

1114
02:28:46,147 --> 02:28:50,667
We fight for the people...
their safety and freedom.

1115
02:29:45,065 --> 02:29:46,995
Mercy. No.

1116
02:29:47,105 --> 02:29:49,035
I cannot.

1117
02:30:37,854 --> 02:30:41,684
Four hundred! Four hundred!

1118
02:30:41,784 --> 02:30:44,183
Four hundred! Fire! Fire!

1119
02:31:13,653 --> 02:31:15,643
Three hundred! Three hundred!

1120
02:31:15,753 --> 02:31:17,783
Fire! Fire!

1121
02:31:17,893 --> 02:31:20,882
Fire!

1122
02:31:28,332 --> 02:31:30,922
One-fifty! One-fifty!

1123
02:31:31,972 --> 02:31:34,592
Line up! Fire!

1124
02:32:06,571 --> 02:32:10,601
Hold your fire! Hold!

1125
02:32:17,651 --> 02:32:20,111
Fire!

1126
02:32:20,211 --> 02:32:22,151
Fire!

1127
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:01,650
Oil! Now!

1128
02:33:04,330 --> 02:33:06,189
Fire!

1129
02:33:25,509 --> 02:33:27,979
Who defends?

1130
02:33:28,079 --> 02:33:32,209
Balian of Ibelin,
the son of Godfrey. Godfrey.

1131
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:35,759
Godfrey nearly killed me in the Lebanon.

1132
02:33:35,859 --> 02:33:39,189
Truly, I did not know he had a son.

1133
02:33:39,289 --> 02:33:41,118
It was his son at Kerak.

1134
02:33:45,128 --> 02:33:48,568
The one you let live. Yes.

1135
02:33:48,668 --> 02:33:51,138
Perhaps you should not have.

1136
02:33:51,238 --> 02:33:55,038
Perhaps I should have
had a different teacher.

1137
02:36:13,844 --> 02:36:15,744
Fire!

1138
02:36:19,984 --> 02:36:22,504
Fire!

1139
02:36:22,614 --> 02:36:24,714
Fire!

1140
02:36:25,954 --> 02:36:27,944
Fire!

1141
02:36:28,054 --> 02:36:30,254
Now!

1142
02:37:29,212 --> 02:37:33,652
You are not a sister. We are what we do.

1143
02:37:35,452 --> 02:37:38,682
Then I'm a man who's traveled
a long way to die for nothing.

1144
02:37:40,062 --> 02:37:42,152
What would you say to that?

1145
02:37:47,232 --> 02:37:49,431
I- I would say that I'm sorry.

1146
02:37:49,531 --> 02:37:51,521
And I'm sorry for you...

1147
02:37:53,941 --> 02:37:55,961
Queen of Jerusalem.

1148
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,460
When a body is burnt...

1149
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:51,890
it cannot be resurrected until Judgment Day.

1150
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,120
If we do not burn these bodies...

1151
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:58,400
we will all be dead
of disease in three days.

1152
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:01,299
God will understand, my lord.

1153
02:39:01,409 --> 02:39:03,369
And if he doesn't...

1154
02:39:03,469 --> 02:39:08,739
then he is not God, and we need not worry.

1155
02:39:21,989 --> 02:39:24,429
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

1156
02:39:24,529 --> 02:39:28,289
The wall, where the Christopher
Gate used to be, has been weakened.

1157
02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:31,099
Usually when a gate is blocked in,
it is weaker than the wall around it.

1158
02:39:31,199 --> 02:39:35,658
Or stronger. It is weaker.
Rashid has seen it.

1159
02:39:35,768 --> 02:39:39,638
This will be our door into Jerusalem.

1160
02:39:48,688 --> 02:39:52,748
This is where we will make our stand.

1161
02:39:52,858 --> 02:39:54,648
We must prepare.

1162
02:39:57,798 --> 02:40:00,628
Brothers! Brothers!

1163
02:40:00,728 --> 02:40:02,928
God has sent you this day!

1164
02:40:03,028 --> 02:40:05,498
You will take no prisoners!

1165
02:40:05,598 --> 02:40:08,798
As they did, so shall it be done!

1166
02:40:08,908 --> 02:40:12,167
Allah hu akbar! Allah hu akbar!

1167
02:40:49,746 --> 02:40:52,606
When this wall comes down...

1168
02:40:54,586 --> 02:40:56,986
there will be no quarter.

1169
02:40:57,086 --> 02:41:00,546
If you throw down your arms...

1170
02:41:00,656 --> 02:41:02,586
your families will die.

1171
02:41:06,756 --> 02:41:09,596
We can break this army here.

1172
02:41:13,496 --> 02:41:17,126
So I say let them come!

1173
02:41:17,236 --> 02:41:20,036
Let them come!

1174
02:41:20,136 --> 02:41:23,265
Come on! Come on!

1175
02:41:23,375 --> 02:41:25,505
Come on!

1176
02:45:01,719 --> 02:45:06,819
Remember me in France, Master Gravedigger.

1177
02:45:06,929 --> 02:45:08,589
My lord!

1178
02:45:40,958 --> 02:45:43,258
They will ask for terms.

1179
02:45:43,358 --> 02:45:46,488
They must ask for terms.

1180
02:45:46,598 --> 02:45:50,698
Convert to Islam. Repent later.

1181
02:45:52,908 --> 02:45:56,498
You've taught me a lot
about religion, Your Eminence.

1182
02:46:18,727 --> 02:46:21,527
Will you yield the city?

1183
02:46:25,407 --> 02:46:29,067
Before I lose it,
I will burn it to the ground.

1184
02:46:29,177 --> 02:46:31,467
Your holy places, ours.

1185
02:46:31,577 --> 02:46:34,737
Every last thing in
Jerusalem that drives men mad.

1186
02:46:36,577 --> 02:46:40,106
I wonder if it would
not be better if you did.

1187
02:46:40,216 --> 02:46:43,186
You will destroy it? Every stone.

1188
02:46:43,286 --> 02:46:47,346
And every Christian knight
you kill will take 10 Saracens with him.

1189
02:46:47,456 --> 02:46:49,856
You will destroy your army
here and never raise another.

1190
02:46:49,956 --> 02:46:54,526
I swear to God that to take
this city will be the end of you.

1191
02:46:59,106 --> 02:47:01,726
Your city is full of women and children.

1192
02:47:01,836 --> 02:47:04,706
If my army will die...

1193
02:47:04,806 --> 02:47:06,776
so will your city.

1194
02:47:11,546 --> 02:47:14,076
You offer terms. I ask none.

1195
02:47:18,455 --> 02:47:22,615
I will give every soul safe
conduct to Christian lands.

1196
02:47:22,725 --> 02:47:24,985
Every soul...

1197
02:47:25,095 --> 02:47:27,965
the women, the children, the old...

1198
02:47:28,065 --> 02:47:32,935
and all your knights and
soldiers, and your queen.

1199
02:47:33,035 --> 02:47:36,265
Your king, such as he is...

1200
02:47:36,375 --> 02:47:38,535
I leave to you...

1201
02:47:38,645 --> 02:47:41,075
and what God will make of him.

1202
02:47:41,175 --> 02:47:43,305
No one will be harmed.

1203
02:47:43,415 --> 02:47:45,675
I swear to God.

1204
02:47:45,785 --> 02:47:50,014
The Christians butchered every Muslim
within the walls when they took this city.

1205
02:47:50,114 --> 02:47:52,914
I am not those men.

1206
02:47:53,024 --> 02:47:55,484
I am Saladin.

1207
02:47:55,594 --> 02:47:58,254
Saladin.

1208
02:48:08,974 --> 02:48:13,064
Then under these terms,
I surrender Jerusalem.

1209
02:48:14,344 --> 02:48:16,244
Salaam alaikum.

1210
02:48:16,344 --> 02:48:19,074
And peace be with you.

1211
02:48:23,414 --> 02:48:25,853
What is Jerusalem worth?

1212
02:48:27,383 --> 02:48:29,283
Nothing.

1213
02:48:35,163 --> 02:48:37,063
Everything.

1214
02:49:17,802 --> 02:49:20,742
I have surrendered Jerusalem.

1215
02:49:20,842 --> 02:49:24,332
All will be safely escorted to the sea.

1216
02:49:26,912 --> 02:49:29,672
If this is the kingdom of heaven...

1217
02:49:33,222 --> 02:49:35,682
let God do with it as he wills.

1218
02:49:47,801 --> 02:49:50,891
Balian!

1219
02:49:51,001 --> 02:49:53,031
Balian!

1220
02:49:53,141 --> 02:49:55,401
Yes! Thanks to the Lord!

1221
02:50:10,921 --> 02:50:14,520
Your brother's kingdom was here... and here.

1222
02:50:16,290 --> 02:50:19,590
That kingdom can never be surrendered.

1223
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:28,230
What should I do?

1224
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:34,940
I'm still the queen of
Acre, Ashkelon, Tripoli.

1225
02:50:36,050 --> 02:50:38,740
Decide not to be a queen...

1226
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:41,320
and I will come to you.

1227
02:51:10,609 --> 02:51:12,909
The perfect knight.

1228
02:51:13,019 --> 02:51:15,139
Is that what you think you are, is it?

1229
02:51:30,128 --> 02:51:32,158
We are all of us what we do.

1230
02:52:42,366 --> 02:52:44,336
Do it.

1231
02:52:49,246 --> 02:52:51,536
When you rise again...

1232
02:52:51,646 --> 02:52:53,666
if you rise...

1233
02:52:55,286 --> 02:52:58,116
rise a knight.

1234
02:54:11,454 --> 02:54:14,054
This horse...

1235
02:54:16,124 --> 02:54:18,753
is not a very good horse.

1236
02:54:18,863 --> 02:54:21,123
I will not keep it.

1237
02:54:22,563 --> 02:54:25,363
Thank you.

1238
02:54:26,973 --> 02:54:29,203
And if God does not love you...

1239
02:54:29,303 --> 02:54:33,263
how could you have done all
the things that you have done?

1240
02:54:34,743 --> 02:54:36,973
Peace be upon you.

1241
02:54:38,413 --> 02:54:40,543
Alaikum salaam.

1242
02:56:51,679 --> 02:56:53,649
A queen never walks.

1243
02:57:00,689 --> 02:57:02,919
And yet you are walking.

1244
02:58:21,027 --> 02:58:24,367
Forward!

1245
02:58:25,837 --> 02:58:27,806
Forward!

1246
02:58:32,146 --> 02:58:34,106
Halt!

1247
02:58:37,346 --> 02:58:40,286
We crusade to recover
the kingdom of Jerusalem.

1248
02:58:45,126 --> 02:58:48,246
You go to where the men speak Italian...

1249
02:58:48,356 --> 02:58:52,016
and then continue until
they speak something else.

1250
02:58:59,966 --> 02:59:02,735
We've come by this road to find Balian...

1251
02:59:02,835 --> 02:59:04,935
who was defender of Jerusalem.

1252
02:59:06,175 --> 02:59:09,075
I am the blacksmith.

1253
02:59:10,715 --> 02:59:13,615
And I am the king of England.

1254
02:59:13,715 --> 02:59:16,115
I am the blacksmith.

1255
02:59:19,385 --> 02:59:23,415
Formation! Forward!

1256
02:59:24,305 --> 03:00:24,280
