1
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:43,806
My reminiscence.

2
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:46,933
I always thought
that for such a lovely river...

3
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,936
...the name was mystifying:

4
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,771
Cape Fear.

5
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:54,817
When the only thing to fear
on those enchanted summer nights...

6
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:59,696
...was that the magic would end
and real life would come crashing in.

7
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,693
Okay, Cady, the moment
you've been waiting for.

8
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,929
Any people coming for you, Cady?

9
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,474
-What about your books?
-Already read them.

10
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,294
Hi. How are you?

11
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,463
-żCómo estás?
-Bien.

12
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,009
This ropa limpia?

13
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:47,845
No, that means "clean." These are dirty.

14
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,431
The idea is to resolve the tension.

15
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,061
I need to find a motif
that's about movement.

16
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:58,606
Not the most mind-blowing concept
for a travel agency...

17
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,650
...but what the hey?

18
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:05,196
-Like an arrow, maybe?
-Yeah, like an arrow.

19
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,698
Maybe.

20
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:10,535
But, see, then the other aspect
is stability...

21
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,537
...a company that you can trust.

22
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,874
So if you can balance those ideas...

23
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,376
...in a way that's pleasing to the eye
then you got a logo.

24
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,589
Okay: Movement, stability...

25
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,590
...and an arrow.

26
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:30,012
Okay, I'll think of something for that one.

27
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,516
Benjamin! Yes.

28
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,602
They switched babies on me
at the hospital, didn't they?

29
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,271
How'd you do in there?

30
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:42,150
I got the judge to postpone
the alimony hearing for another 21 days.

31
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:43,901
Great.

32
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:47,571
I've got till Monday to find out
which S and L and which municipality...

33
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:50,616
-...my son-in-law stashed all that money.
-Right.

34
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,702
-Anyway, my daughter and I thank you.
-You're welcome, Tom.

35
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,957
Here's Daddy!

36
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,795
Good-bye, Junior.

37
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,422
ˇAdios!

38
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,973
Yes, that's very creative, Junior.

39
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:21,563
He liked me.

40
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:25,067
All this time, he actually liked me.

41
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:38,413
You can't go in. Your father's making
a television appearance for his campaign.

42
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,583
Dad, I've got to talk to you.

43
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,421
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm about to go on the air.

44
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:48,423
What is this smoke?

45
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,928
Excuse me.

46
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:00,269
Come on, let's move seats.

47
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,574
Okay, then I quit as your son.

48
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:18,496
Do you believe that annoying loser guy?

49
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,581
You should have just punched him out.

50
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:23,376
What? Just punched him out?
What do you mean?

51
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,921
You boxed. You could've
shoved him around, shut him up.

52
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,547
-I could take you.
-Careful.

53
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:31,717
-That's who I could take.
-You could've kicked him in the face.

54
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,218
Kicked him in the face?

55
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:36,429
You know how to fight dirty.
You do that for a living.

56
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,140
Real cute, Leigh.

57
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,477
-Let's sit outside.
-How much do I owe you?

58
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,104
-It's taken care of.
-Taken care of? Who?

59
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:45,814
There.

60
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:03,165
Girls, come on, let's sit inside.
Yeah, let's sit inside.

61
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,818
Mr. Perfect Form.

62
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,736
-Look.
-What?

63
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,406
You gotta snap your wrist
on the backhand.

64
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,075
Usually I like a little music
at this point, Sam.

65
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,453
Sam, I want to play in this lifetime.

66
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,871
All right.

67
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,208
-You gotta snap your wrist.
-Tag.

68
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:53,548
-We should stop doing this for a while.
-Doing what? We're not doing anything.

69
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,384
-No, I know that.
-Yet.

70
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:58,553
Okay. Fine. Maybe you're right.

71
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,096
Why? Does your wife mind?

72
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,559
My wife doesn't even know you exist,
which, most certainly, is for the best.

73
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,394
Why's that?

74
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,314
God, Lori, you know why you ask
that question?

75
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,525
-'Cause you've never been married.
-Why?

76
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,360
Is marriage synonymous with deception?

77
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:18,072
It's just that when two people...

78
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:21,742
...get married and live together
for a long time...

79
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:27,540
I like hanging out with you, so sue me.

80
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,586
You're funny, and you're cute,
and, I don't know...

81
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:35,549
We talk about the courts
and which judge is senile...

82
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,717
...which one wears a gun under his robe.

83
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,387
Oh, God. You know, Lori,
another time, another place...

84
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:42,931
...and who knows?

85
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,060
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah, it's a light docket.

86
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:50,521
No, I won two out of three.
Let's make it best out of five.

87
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:55,777
All right, that's good, actually,
because today I let you win.

88
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,571
-Sure you did.
-See ya.

89
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:09,040
Free as a bird. You go wherever you want
with whomever.

90
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,918
That much freedom
could get a fellow in trouble.

91
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,546
-I'd like my keys.
-Could it be you don't remember me?

92
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,425
I remember you.
You were at the movies the other night.

93
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:20,551
I'm disappointed. I'm hurt.

94
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:22,553
I would like my keys.

95
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,015
Max Cady.

96
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,643
You look the same.

97
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,687
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.

98
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,566
But they say the average man
gains a pound a year till he's about...

99
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,026
Come on.

100
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,363
Gains a pound a year till he's about 60.

101
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:43,992
Me? I dropped a pound every year
in my sentence.

102
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:48,496
-Atlanta, '77.
-You got it. July.

103
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:52,374
Fourteen years since I held a set of keys.

104
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,213
Well, you look good, healthy.

105
00:10:57,296 --> 00:11:00,591
Thank you. It's a struggle
to stay healthy in the joint.

106
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,427
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

107
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:07,098
They would stick you with
the white trash. They don't work all day.

108
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,433
In fact...

109
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:11,852
...this little old cigar is my only vice...

110
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:15,648
...'cause I needed a vice in the joint
to remind me I was human.

111
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,318
What brings you to New Essex?

112
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,321
Oh, the climate.

113
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,032
Boy, the South.

114
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:27,743
I'm thinking of settling down here
in New Essex, Counsellor.

115
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,329
Have you been following me?

116
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,041
It's a small town.
We're gonna run into each other.

117
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,085
-Well, take care, Mr. Cady.
-You, too.

118
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,424
-You're gonna learn about loss.
-What?

119
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,520
Dad, could you...

120
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,898
I'm sorry, Dani.

121
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,110
-What're you working on?
-It's English.

122
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:03,570
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel...

123
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:05,907
...which is a kind of reminiscence...

124
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:09,118
...and we have to attempt something
in the same style.

125
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,538
What's it about, your reminiscence?

126
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,708
The houseboat.

127
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:26,635
It's not even July 3 yet.

128
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,304
We ought to take two weeks
and go to Wilmington...

129
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,640
...like the old times, dock the houseboat.

130
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,601
I wanted to in early June.
You said you didn't have time.

131
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,313
-I probably don't.
-Yeah, now I don't, either.

132
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,856
Besides, Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

133
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:43,819
Is it really that critical
that she can't miss two damn weeks?

134
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:46,446
You know,
the alternative was to expel her.

135
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:51,201
Maybe this Drama teacher from the college
will get her excited about something.

136
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:53,704
Yeah, about him, probably.

137
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:57,666
Why'd they have to make such a stink,
like she was on heroin, or something?

138
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,044
I mean, what's marijuana?

139
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,880
You and I smoked a little dope in our time.

140
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,300
In some cultures,
it's considered almost a sacrament.

141
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,385
I realize in ours it's forbidden.

142
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,474
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality.

143
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,100
Honey.

144
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:18,562
-Worship of idols, cannibalism.
-Do that again.

145
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:21,940
-What?
-Do that again.

146
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:16,137
-Sam, somebody's out there!
-What?

147
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:19,432
Leave the light off. Leave it off.

148
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:25,688
I saw him when the fireworks went off.

149
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:27,523
What?

150
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:30,777
-I think I talked to him this afternoon.
-You know him?

151
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,654
I want you the hell off my property!

152
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,294
He's gone.

153
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:57,345
He said,
"I'm gonna make you think about loss."

154
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:01,057
Or, "I'm gonna make you learn about loss."
Something like that.

155
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,684
That's very poetic.

156
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,813
-Who is he? Where did he come from?
-He's from...

157
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:10,190
Come on, Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

158
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:15,154
He doesn't mind me at all.
It's your dog. Come on.

159
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,365
No, he shouldn't be up on the table.

160
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,284
-You'll have dog hairs in the tea.
-Get down.

161
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,869
Where's he from?

162
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,455
He's from the hills, Pentecostal crackers.

163
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,666
What was he in prison for?

164
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,671
-I think it was battery.
-You think it was battery?

165
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:37,343
-Who did he batter? A man? A woman?
-I don't know.

166
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:41,221
It was fourteen years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

167
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,599
I really don't remember.

168
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,228
What does he want with you?

169
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,023
He's just trying to bug us,
just messing around.

170
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,941
He's an ex-con, so he's just...

171
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,613
You know, he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

172
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:00,783
-Yeah, your clientele.
-Yeah.

173
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,746
-'Bye, Dad.
-'Bye, Dani.

174
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,666
-You look tired.
-Thanks. I needed that.

175
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,711
I'd rather Dani didn't wander out alone...

176
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,464
...on her walks in the woods...

177
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,675
...till I've started a few things,
maybe even talk to the boss.

178
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,927
-What if she takes Benjamin with her?
-Big Ben, our guard dog?

179
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,971
What's he gonna do, lick him to death?

180
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,309
-Just tell her.
-What? I hardly know anything about him.

181
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:29,395
I don't mean his biography.
Just there's some creep around.

182
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,189
If you see him again,
call the cops and then call me.

183
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,357
What about a weapon?

184
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:37,945
In case things get exciting around here.

185
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,947
Would you feel more secure
with a loaded gun in the house?

186
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,325
We'd end up using it on each other.

187
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,246
Or Dani would. He won't do anything.
He just got out of prison.

188
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,749
He doesn't want to go right back.

189
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:53,961
Call Lee Heller.

190
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:58,131
Lee is a colorful character but he's still
the best criminal lawyer in the state.

191
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,634
-Good.
-Get me Lee Heller.

192
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:04,096
-Sam, you defended this guy, right?
-Right.

193
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,306
What makes you think
he wants to harm you?

194
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,267
Yesterday I was getting in my car.

195
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,145
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.

196
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,523
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."

197
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,943
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist threat statutes.

198
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,780
Tom, for Christ's sake, the guy's an ex-con.

199
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,825
You know as well as I do what that means.

200
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,620
Last night, there he was, behind our house.

201
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,915
-Attempted B and E.
-No, not exactly.

202
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,668
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

203
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,380
That's not even trespassing, Sam.

204
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:40,716
Come on. What can I say?
Get a restraining order.

205
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:43,843
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.

206
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:47,515
Good. Anything I can do.

207
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:50,183
Tom, fourteen years ago...

208
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:54,729
...in this case I had a report on the victim.

209
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,732
-It was a rape case.
-That's right.

210
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,026
Rape and aggravated sexual battery.

211
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,612
Anyway, I had a report on this victim...

212
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:04,531
...and it came back
that she was promiscuous.

213
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,534
And...

214
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,246
...I buried it.

215
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:16,752
-Anybody else know about this?
-No, I buried it.

216
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,172
I didn't show it to the client
or the prosecution.

217
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:23,133
But if you had seen
what this guy had done to this girl...

218
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:26,136
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...

219
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,681
"...the Assistance of Counsel
for his defense."

220
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,391
I know the Sixth Amendment.
I believe in it.

221
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,811
That's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

222
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:36,396
There was no way to serve the law
in that capacity.

223
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,941
Some folks don't have the right
to the best defense?

224
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,109
Of course they deserve the best defense!

225
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,903
But if you had seen what he did
to this girl...

226
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:46,907
-Buried the report.
-lf it was your own daughter.

227
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:50,034
-Yeah, I mean...
-Buried the report.

228
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,162
Jesus, Sam.

229
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:55,123
Oh, God.

230
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:03,382
But I don't see how he could know that.
He was illiterate.

231
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,759
I had to read everything to him:
the probable cause affidavit...

232
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:09,012
...the arrest reports, everything.

233
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:13,142
There's no way he could know that.

234
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,737
Hey, Dani...

235
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:28,573
...it's so quiet out here,
and the light's so perfect...

236
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:31,659
...why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

237
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,328
Why?

238
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:35,830
I told you why.

239
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:40,168
Is it because he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

240
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,670
What do you know about that? A flasher?

241
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:45,756
You don't think I've been flashed before?

242
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,678
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.

243
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,848
If you want to come out, come on out.
If you don't, go on.

244
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,849
Do whatever you want.

245
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,853
But don't go outside.

246
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,651
'Afternoon, Counselor.

247
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,115
What do you want, Mr. Cady?

248
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:21,834
They're great at that age, ain't they?

249
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:25,796
All those discoveries ahead of them.
You're lucky.

250
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:29,384
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

251
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:32,511
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead...

252
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:34,889
...which, in a way, I was.

253
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:39,226
Mr. Cady, I realize that you suffered.

254
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,481
I understand your problem,
but, I mean, why me?

255
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,942
I was your lawyer. I defended you.

256
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,987
Why not badger the D.A. or the judge?

257
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:52,990
-"Badger."
-Why not them?

258
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:59,497
Best I remember,
they was just doing right by their jobs.

259
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,625
I didn't do my job? Is that right?

260
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,754
I pleaded you out
to a lesser occluded offense.

261
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,130
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

262
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:11,926
I'd have been up for parole in seven years
according to Georgia penal code.

263
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,430
Rape is a capital offense.
You could've gotten life, death.

264
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:18,141
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

265
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,062
I learned to read during my stretch.

266
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:27,025
First, Spot Goes To The Farm...

267
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:30,736
...then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

268
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,576
Did you know, after I discharged you,
I acted as my own attorney?

269
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,036
Applied several times for an appeal.

270
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,038
No, I didn't know that.

271
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,960
So, here we are...

272
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:50,047
...two lawyers, for all practical purposes,
talking shop.

273
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:52,216
How much do you want, Mr. Cady?

274
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:57,012
-How much do I want what?
-How much money do you want?

275
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:01,392
Money?
Counselor, do I look destitute to you?

276
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:04,353
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

277
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,899
You ever been a woman?

278
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:11,568
-A what?
-A woman.

279
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:16,698
Some fat, hairy, ugly hillbilly's wet dream?

280
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:24,123
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.

281
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,959
You don't know
what suffering is, Counselor.

282
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:29,921
Like it says in Galatians 3:

283
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:33,591
"Have ye suffered so many things in vain?"

284
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:40,806
I learned from the get-go in the joint
to get in touch with my feminine side.

285
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:51,067
I'm open to some sort of discussion
on compensation.

286
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,403
What shall be my compensation, sir...

287
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:57,739
...for being held down and sodomized
by four white guys...

288
00:23:57,823 --> 00:24:00,033
...or four black guys?

289
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,287
Shall my compensation be the same?

290
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:06,748
What is the formula for compensation, sir?

291
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:09,125
How about $10,000 in cash?

292
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:13,422
Do I...

293
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,469
Let's just break that down.

294
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,098
That figure just came
to the top of my head.

295
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:28,019
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.

296
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,689
I'll tell you what. Let's say $50,000.

297
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:33,400
$50,000 into fourteen years.

298
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:36,319
Fourteen years times 365 days...

299
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,364
...is about 5,000 days.

300
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:44,244
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

301
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:47,205
That's not even minimum wage.

302
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,084
To say nothing about the family
and respect that I lost.

303
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:55,213
I don't think you really understand
what we're talking about.

304
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,715
Fourteen years.

305
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:01,136
Whoops.

306
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:04,473
Gotta git.
I'm late for another appointment.

307
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:11,396
I got some good news.

308
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,398
I got the bank, the account number.

309
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:16,776
I'll call your son-in-law's lawyer,
tell him we're going to court.

310
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,945
Mr. Bowden, your wife's on line one.

311
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:21,197
Ask her to hold. I have to make a call.

312
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:24,325
-I wouldn't make that call. The way I'd...
-Mr. Bowden...

313
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,452
...she says it's urgent.

314
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:31,582
Yeah?

315
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,964
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

316
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,591
They sounded like he was screaming...

317
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:42,552
...and then Dani came running in, and I...

318
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:45,805
...I called the vet.

319
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:49,976
Then it was so weird because...

320
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,815
...it was like he was winding down...

321
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:00,152
...just winding down like an old clock.

322
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,197
Then, all of a sudden, he just stopped.

323
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:07,076
He had this kind of...

324
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,790
...his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...

325
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,918
...surprised look.

326
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,005
And then...

327
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,010
...then he died.

328
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:29,182
He just died, before the vet even got here.

329
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:33,561
What did the vet say?

330
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:36,397
-That he was poisoned.
-Poisoned?

331
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,566
What kind of poison?

332
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:43,655
-I don't know what kind of poison.
-Jesus! I told you not to let him out.

333
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:46,073
-I didn't let him out!
-Then how?

334
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,617
Stop!

335
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:53,331
I've got an English setter myself,
so I don't cotton to dog killers.

336
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:57,293
Trouble is, poisoning a dog is just a fine.

337
00:26:57,543 --> 00:27:00,046
But if he's unemployed,
he has to have money...

338
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,923
...or we'll bust him for vagrancy.

339
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:04,758
We'll give him a full-body strip search.

340
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,679
Jerk a knot in his tail.

341
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,431
All right.

342
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:15,478
They got so many ways on the books
to lean on an undesirable.

343
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:18,856
He'll feel about as welcome
around here as a case of yellow fever.

344
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,984
-Hands against the wall.
-Spread them.

345
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:24,904
-That him?
-Face the wall.

346
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,741
One-way mirror, Mr. Bowden.
He doesn't know you're here.

347
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:30,076
Yeah, that's him.

348
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,078
Get the shirt off.

349
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:36,207
-Come on, hurry up.
-Just pass it over to him.

350
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,796
-Hand it to me.
-Knock off the shoes.

351
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:45,132
Hand them to the other officer.

352
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,344
Pass them to him. Come on.

353
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:52,765
Put the arms out.

354
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,268
Put your arms out straight.

355
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:59,104
Roll your palms.

356
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:00,355
Do what he says.

357
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,360
Turn around, slow.

358
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:17,039
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.

359
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,712
Stand still.

360
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,717
One more step for you.
You know the routine.

361
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,679
Against the wall.

362
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:35,390
We searched his apartment.
Car registration and everything's in order.

363
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:39,019
There's no guns or any other weapons.
But we found these.

364
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,274
Cady's savings account.

365
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,818
$30,000?

366
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,361
Yeah, his mother died
while he was serving.

367
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:50,698
The farm got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

368
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:53,784
He's got money.
Where does that leave us?

369
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:56,870
At the very least, we nail him
for the dog. What happened?

370
00:28:56,954 --> 00:28:59,790
You let the dog out. Cady abducted him.

371
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,169
We didn't let the dog out.

372
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:07,423
Cady came into your house?
That's illegal entry with intent.

373
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:10,593
But he didn't come in the house.

374
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:15,180
I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly how he did it.

375
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:17,933
I just know that he did it somehow.

376
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:19,935
That's not good enough, Mr. Bowden.

377
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,229
You're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

378
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:24,272
Get off the pants.

379
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:31,362
Sooner or later, he's gonna screw up.

380
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,532
The sheriff assured me
that they always do. He's an ex-con.

381
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:37,119
He's going to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

382
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:38,829
I'd still like to kill him.

383
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,689
How come you didn't join up with them?
You can tap.

384
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:07,649
You can tap dance.

385
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:11,820
I wanted to once, but I don't know...

386
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,332
-Son of a bitch.
-What?

387
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:32,341
-He's staring at you.
-What are you talking about?

388
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:38,888
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:41,600
Hot as a firecracker on the 4th of July.

390
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,730
-You're damn lucky to have her, boy.
-You son of a bitch.

391
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:48,732
Where did he go?

392
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,991
Watch my arm. It might be broke.

393
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:01,828
What's with you? You have no right
to be pushing me around like that.

394
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:05,373
I was just watching the parade.
I wasn't pranking on nobody.

395
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:08,084
What are you getting so upset about?

396
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,378
You're lucky I don't sue you.

397
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:13,089
All right.

398
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:16,092
-Settle down.
-I am settled down.

399
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:19,888
-What are you doing?
-It's nothing.

400
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:23,391
-Who was that?
-It's no one. Come on.

401
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,811
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

402
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,482
-I think he really hurt his arm.
-Mom!

403
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:36,779
-Strong drink you got there, mister.
-You said it.

404
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:40,492
Just put a little goldfish in it,
and you'll be fine.

405
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,121
You seem to be having a good time.

406
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:47,541
-I've been practicing.
-Practicing for what?

407
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:50,793
-How to fall on the floor?
-A life of debauchery.

408
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,169
Debauch, what?

409
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,964
Debauchery. It's a three-syllable word.

410
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:59,594
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

411
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:02,472
-I made you blush.
-Blush?

412
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:06,643
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

413
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,730
I had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married.

414
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:15,277
-You certainly did not.
-I don't know what I was thinking.

415
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,487
God only knows.

416
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:19,989
Aren't I the bozo on this bus?

417
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:24,660
Oh, God. Lest you think that I slept
with this particular married guy...

418
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:26,454
That's your business. Not mine.

419
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:30,165
I don't want to make it sound like
I've been through a busload of them.

420
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,460
That's the way it sounded to me.

421
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,838
-He was the first.
-Oh, yeah.

422
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,631
-He was, I swear.
-Oh, yeah.

423
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:40,343
-Oh, boy.
-Tell it to the judge.

424
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,099
-Actually the rat stood me up today.
-Did he?

425
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:47,725
-Yes!
-What a shame.

426
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,644
I know.

427
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:52,229
So, now it's my turn. Where are you from?

428
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:53,648
Where am I from?

429
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,399
-You're gonna love this.
-Yes.

430
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:59,863
I'm from the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

431
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:09,830
You think I'm joking? That's the truth.
I just got released from prison.

432
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:14,001
My god. This is the way
my day has been turning out.

433
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,796
Actually, it reminds me of a joke.

434
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:21,593
-Do you want to hear it?
-Tell me. Liven up the night.

435
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,971
An unmarried woman...
Wait a minute, that's not it.

436
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:29,307
-Come on, get the joke straight.
-Shut up. Let me do it.

437
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,477
An unmarried woman meets a guy...

438
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,271
...and he tells her he just got out of prison.

439
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:36,440
"What did you do?" she asks.

440
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:40,902
"I hacked my wife into 52 pieces
with a chain saw."

441
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:44,949
She says, "So, you're single?"

442
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,660
-That's even funnier.
-Thank you.

443
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,786
-Could I ask you something?
-What?

444
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,164
-What did you do?
-I knew you were going to ask.

445
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,877
-I hacked my wife into 52 pieces.
-I was afraid you'd say that.

446
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,671
I'm a very small person, so maybe...

447
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:02,550
Maybe I can hack you into 40 pieces.

448
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:10,391
-What did you do, really?
-No, really, but what did you do?

449
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:17,188
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant and...

450
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,357
...when they came to arrest us...

451
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:22,320
...this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me.

452
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:26,198
I popped the bastard,
so they gave me a little time for it.

453
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,952
I'm drinking a sea breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

454
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,581
You have to stay sober. If you ain't
sober, you're taking your chances.

455
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,750
Because I'm just one hell of an animal.

456
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,793
Yeah? Do tell.

457
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,966
Get you on this side, doll. Let's do this.

458
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:46,051
Who is Loretta anyway?

459
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:48,762
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

460
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:52,682
-I thought I was the love of your life.
-Chopped her into 52 pieces.

461
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:00,148
He hurt you like this, that married guy?

462
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:03,568
-He hurt you like this?
-I told you, we never did anything.

463
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:06,988
-He hurt you like this?
-Oh, scandal.

464
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,199
He's a rough one.

465
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:11,409
How's this feel?

466
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,707
Oh, my God. Am I under arrest?

467
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,294
Not quite, darlin'.

468
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,467
Officer, I swear, it's all a mistake.

469
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:31,304
That married guy hurt you like this?

470
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,433
Because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this!

471
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,611
I've got you now, bitch!

472
00:35:56,497 --> 00:35:58,748
Dani, when did this key stop working?

473
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:01,584
What? Oh, I don't know.

474
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:05,338
No wonder. A wire's missing.

475
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:10,677
A piano wire is missing. Was somebody
fooling around with the piano?

476
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,178
What?

477
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:15,974
-Yeah?
-Mr. Bowden.

478
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:19,685
-I think we might have a little break.
-Good.

479
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:23,565
I can be there in a half hour.
All right, fine. Thank you.

480
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,777
-Who was that?
-Cady raped another girl.

481
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:30,697
Rape? You said it was battery.

482
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,449
The case was wobbly. I got it reduced.

483
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,952
I remember those days, old slippery Sam.

484
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:39,039
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to alarm you or Dani.

485
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:42,083
-Why? How old was that girl?
-16.

486
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,126
16, what?

487
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,760
My birthday is coming up.

488
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,888
Neighbors heard screams and called us.

489
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,724
When the perp drove off,
somebody made his plate.

490
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,768
-Max Cady.
-Great.

491
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:03,104
We got one little problem.
The girl is scared.

492
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:05,940
She's claiming she fell down some stairs.

493
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,744
Don't look at me.

494
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,123
Oh, my God.

495
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:24,709
You two know each other?

496
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:31,174
Yeah, we work together.

497
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,801
I'll be outside.

498
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,891
I'm so stupid.

499
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:48,065
You stood me up at the club the other day.

500
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,194
Then you didn't call.

501
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,156
By last night...

502
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,159
...I was feeling pretty reckless.

503
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,287
I thought about what you said, you know...

504
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,626
...that your wife didn't know I existed.

505
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:10,004
And I felt like...

506
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:12,506
...I was going to show you.

507
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:17,386
I guess I showed you, all right, didn't I?

508
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:21,390
I guess I really showed you.

509
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,106
Listen to me, okay?

510
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,318
Now, look, this guy Cady...

511
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,987
...he's done this kind of thing before.

512
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:39,033
Now, he's going to do this
over and over again...

513
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,453
...unless you testify
and we take him to court...

514
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,955
No.

515
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,498
And press charges and testify.

516
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,005
I know how it works. I see it every day.

517
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:56,508
Only this time, I'm on the other side.

518
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,805
I don't want to explain why I was in a bar...

519
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,433
...and how much I had to drink
and what I was wearing.

520
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,894
Not by the people I work with.

521
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:12,024
Not by the guys that I see
cross-examine other people on the stand.

522
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,112
Just crucify them.
They just laugh about it later.

523
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,073
They'll even ask about you.

524
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,286
Listen to me. I don't care about that.

525
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:27,122
Well, I care about that.

526
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,958
I'm sure you do, too.

527
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:36,798
I'm terribly sorry. I'm just terribly sorry.

528
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,307
If this is something personal
between you, the girl and Cady...

529
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:46,476
Personal?

530
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:50,938
All right, come on, Lieutenant.
What are you implying?

531
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,358
Only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly.

532
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:55,859
Not by the police.

533
00:39:56,985 --> 00:40:00,322
This Cady is planning to rape my wife,
but it's not your problem?

534
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,783
I can't bust someone for planning a rape.

535
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:05,577
You're a lawyer.
You know that damn well.

536
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,579
-Thanks.
-The way I'd handle it...

537
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:10,082
What, file a restraining order?
I already did.

538
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,167
Just think of Cady as a tiger.

539
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:15,920
The trick is to get him out of the brush.
How do we do that?

540
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:19,008
You stake out a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

541
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,800
What are you suggesting?

542
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:24,388
That I use my family as bait?
And then what?

543
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:28,099
Hope that this psychopath
attacks my wife and child?

544
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,520
-Then what? Blow his head off?
-I'm a law officer.

545
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:36,024
It would be unethical of me to advise a
citizen to take the law into his own hands.

546
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,195
-I suppose you must've misunderstood me.
-I guess I must've.

547
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:43,281
Well, pardon me all over the place.

548
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:11,643
And he's been harassing my family.

549
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:15,773
Cleverly, so that the law can't touch him.

550
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:18,984
I believe he's able to slip
in and out of the house undetected.

551
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,944
Although, is he out? I can't tell.

552
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:23,780
He's either out or in. I'm not sure.

553
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,281
I can't see through walls.

554
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,951
I'm not asking you to see through walls.
That's fine.

555
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,290
Why can't anybody do anything for me?
What good are cops and laws...

556
00:41:33,415 --> 00:41:36,876
Sam, calm down.
Let me explain something to you.

557
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:39,921
The system is set up to handle
generalized problems...

558
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:42,215
...like burglary and robbery.

559
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:46,052
But if some lone creep targets you
for some obscure reason...

560
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:49,305
...the system is slow and skeptical.
Pathetic even.

561
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:53,267
What's your connection with this fellow?

562
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:57,981
-I was his lawyer, his public defender.
-But you shafted him somehow, right?

563
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:02,694
-At least that's the way he perceives it.
-I don't care what you did.

564
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:05,739
-What did he do?
-He raped a 16-year-old girl.

565
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,409
Do you have a daughter around 16?

566
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:11,077
She's 15.

567
00:42:11,954 --> 00:42:13,371
Here's the deal.

568
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:17,000
I'll do a background check,
follow him and write up a risk assessment.

569
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:20,170
-Great. Now, the cops...
-I can find him.

570
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:23,965
-His name's Max Cady.
-Just take it easy. Stay calm.

571
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,886
Dani, you can just relax because...

572
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:32,098
...your daddy has a private investigator
on the payroll.

573
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:33,975
Isn't that right?

574
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:37,728
What's your feeling about him?
What, Sam Spade?

575
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:41,148
Mickey Spillane? Peter Gunn?

576
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:43,901
Dirty Harry? Perry Mason?

577
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:46,946
No. Perry Mason was a lawyer.

578
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,200
The minute I walked in
this guy's office, I felt relaxed.

579
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:52,201
This guy is totally in charge.

580
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,621
Kersek deals with these types for a living.

581
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:57,123
He looked like he was going to enjoy...

582
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:00,918
-Yes?
-Yeah, it's me.

583
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:06,132
After you left, I had this conversation
with a C.O. at Statesboro prison.

584
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:08,884
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

585
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:12,429
There was this other inmate
working there with him, obstinate S.O.B.

586
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:16,559
He hated Cady's cigar smoke
and was always moaning about it.

587
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:20,187
One day, they found him
with his neck broke and his tongue bit off.

588
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:21,063
Jesus.

589
00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:22,189
Yeah.

590
00:43:26,277 --> 00:43:29,029
They couldn't place Cady
at the scene of the accident...

591
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:30,698
...if you want to call it that...

592
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,533
...at least not out loud.

593
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:36,537
But the parole board kept him in
for another seven years.

594
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:40,207
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

595
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,459
-Who was that?
-Our private eye.

596
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:44,546
I thought we were relaxed now.

597
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:48,424
New Essex County Hospital.

598
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:51,427
Yes, room 5036, please.

599
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,596
-One minute, please.
-All right.

600
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,224
-Hello?
-Hi, Lori, it's me.

601
00:43:57,308 --> 00:44:00,603
I just feel God-awful
you got dragged into this thing.

602
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:02,020
It's not your fault.

603
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:07,109
If I had any idea that Cady would hurt you
to get at me, I would have warned you.

604
00:44:07,234 --> 00:44:09,862
Yeah, I know. I'm glad you called.

605
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:11,905
Yeah, well.

606
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:15,618
-I'm so sorry about this.
-I feel the same way.

607
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,039
Are you really determined
about moving back to Connecticut?

608
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:23,083
I've thought about it a lot.

609
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,962
I just think it's probably the best thing.

610
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:29,339
I thought that maybe
I could go back to school.

611
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:31,968
I'm really going to miss you.

612
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,094
Right. Excuse me.

613
00:44:34,178 --> 00:44:36,555
-That sounds real good.
-Yeah.

614
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,643
-That'll work out fine. I'll get back to you.
-All right, 'bye.

615
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:48,234
Well, I just don't know what I hate more:

616
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:53,321
That insipid tone
or your stupid, sophomoric infidelities.

617
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:55,490
Who was that?

618
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:59,286
-The girl that got beat up?
-Yes, it was.

619
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:02,873
I already told you.
She's a clerk at the county courthouse.

620
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,293
And what? You're fucking her?

621
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:11,131
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.

622
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:15,135
Why is it that whenever I have
a private phone conversation...

623
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,805
...you assume that I'm fucking someone?

624
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,725
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

625
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:25,896
Yes, that's why he chose her.
But I'm not fucking her in any way.

626
00:45:28,065 --> 00:45:31,318
Well, you sleazy son of a bitch!

627
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,530
Stop it!

628
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:37,991
Dani is right downstairs.

629
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:43,622
-Honey, there's nothing the matter.
-Yeah, I can see, Dad.

630
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:48,169
I thought you promised
to leave all that shit behind in Atlanta.

631
00:45:56,927 --> 00:46:00,555
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty little secrets...

632
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,725
...in those sessions with Dr. Hackett.

633
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,936
-We talked that one incident to death.
-Why did you bother?

634
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:09,272
-Because you asked me to go.
-I mean, why did you bother?

635
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:14,861
Why did you bother with you and me?
With the marriage?

636
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:18,365
Uprooting me and Dani? Moving?

637
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,327
Because that's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out.

638
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:26,038
-What is it I don't get?
-You don't get it.

639
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,086
Nadine?

640
00:46:32,337 --> 00:46:33,547
It's Dani.

641
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:36,216
Nothing.

642
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:39,928
I'm just losing my mind here.

643
00:46:41,012 --> 00:46:44,850
You know, had the balls to walk out,
if that's what you wanted.

644
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,895
Like I was going to split,
with you acting the way you act.

645
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,605
Acting? You did some acting.

646
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,482
I don't remember acting.

647
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:55,610
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.

648
00:46:55,736 --> 00:46:59,906
Remember not working for three months?
Not fixing any meals?

649
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,992
I'm not on fucking trial here!

650
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:06,746
Do you remember crying every morning
afternoon, evening? Remember that?

651
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,626
I scared you, huh?

652
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:14,838
What did you think, Sam?

653
00:47:15,922 --> 00:47:18,466
You thought maybe
I was going to kill myself?

654
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:20,677
-Over you?
-Who else?

655
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:22,346
You pompous ass.

656
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:25,264
You wouldn't leave the bedroom!

657
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:29,978
-I wish you could say the same.
-This what Dr. Hackett talked about.

658
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:31,646
Digging up the past.

659
00:47:34,357 --> 00:47:37,736
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messing around in New Essex.

660
00:47:37,819 --> 00:47:39,362
And I have not been.

661
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:43,032
As far as this girl goes, she's just a kid.

662
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:44,451
That shouldn't stop you.

663
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:48,496
She's a baby. You gravitate
to people in the same profession as you.

664
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:50,081
You gravitate to women.

665
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:53,752
Come on, I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

666
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:56,588
She's just infatuated. I can't help that.

667
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:03,887
Look, Leigh, I'm scared.

668
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:06,848
This whole thing has...

669
00:48:08,808 --> 00:48:12,895
I keep feeling that there
is some animal out there stalking us.

670
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,982
I think he wants to hurt us
in the worst way...

671
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:19,735
...and that's got me frightened to death.

672
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:26,909
-You really are scared, aren't you?
-Yeah.

673
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:29,120
Somebody finally got to you.

674
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:32,498
Look, I think...

675
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:37,587
...he beat and raped her because he knew
that she wouldn't testify...

676
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:40,798
...that she wouldn't press charges...

677
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:43,092
...because she knows the system.

678
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:45,053
I mean, she works in it.

679
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:47,263
She knows that she'd be on trial.

680
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:52,810
Then, because she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that...

681
00:48:52,894 --> 00:48:55,563
...there was something
going on between us...

682
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:58,524
...and it would cause a rift.

683
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:03,988
That we'd be much more vulnerable to him.

684
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,415
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.

685
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,253
We can beat that son of a bitch,
the two of us, working as a team.

686
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:23,465
Jesus Christ.

687
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:28,095
Yeah, this is great. This is something else.

688
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,306
Oh, shit!

689
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,862
-Here you go.
-I'm sorry, I haven't ordered yet.

690
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:47,949
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for and all.

691
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:49,032
Who?

692
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:52,327
-Which one?
-That guy who is just leaving.

693
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:57,457
Excuse me.

694
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:00,670
Cady, come here.

695
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:02,421
Wait up a second.

696
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:06,007
I've been in a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

697
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,970
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

698
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:11,055
-No.
-Get the hell out of here.

699
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:14,516
I don't mean this town,
I mean the whole state.

700
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:18,729
I don't want to see you or hear you
and I don't want to smell you. Leave.

701
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:20,439
Are you my friend?

702
00:50:20,815 --> 00:50:22,232
No, I'm not your friend.

703
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:26,903
I thought maybe you were because I like to
plan my comings and goings with friends.

704
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:30,366
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.

705
00:50:30,448 --> 00:50:34,327
In fact, I'd call it downright rude,
because I ain't your porch-baby, buddy.

706
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:39,375
Gee golly gosh. I'm sorry I offended you,
you white trash piece of shit.

707
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,127
I got the all-over fidgets on that one.

708
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:45,213
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

709
00:50:47,132 --> 00:50:50,302
It's not necessary to lay
a foul tongue on me, my friend.

710
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:53,806
I could get upset.
Things could get out of hand.

711
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:56,725
Then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you...

712
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,811
...that you would not like, right here.

713
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:02,565
-Anytime you feel squirrelly, you just jump.
-You threatening me?

714
00:51:05,317 --> 00:51:06,735
You catch on fast.

715
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:10,281
I'm well within my rights
to be here and you know it.

716
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:14,493
-lf I stay here, what you going to do?
-I don't give a rat's ass about your rights.

717
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,912
Watch your step,
you know what I'm talking about.

718
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:20,123
You going to arrest me?
You a cop? Or were you a cop?

719
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,626
Were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

720
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:25,003
That's the feeling I'm getting here.

721
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:29,591
Hope you enjoyed your breakfast.

722
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:39,726
Ma'am, this belong to you?

723
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,021
-Can I help you?
-I just found it.

724
00:51:42,604 --> 00:51:44,606
Thought you might need it back.

725
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:48,777
Not to frighten you, but if a dogcatcher
comes across a dog without a license...

726
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:52,531
...he's liable to think he's a stray
and do God knows what to it.

727
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:54,616
You know...

728
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:57,243
...our dog is...

729
00:51:57,994 --> 00:52:00,163
-He passed away.
-What a shame.

730
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:03,208
Man's best friend and all. Woman's too.

731
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:07,045
Even without closing my eyes,
I can picture him...

732
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:10,840
...big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet...

733
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:16,263
...keeping you company while you're trying
to finish up those pesky little sketches.

734
00:52:19,224 --> 00:52:21,643
You're Max Cady, aren't you?

735
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:27,440
You better get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

736
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:29,025
I'm not doing nothing.

737
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,070
Just giving back your dog collar.
I'm not on your property.

738
00:52:32,153 --> 00:52:34,405
What'd you come out here for,
to look around?

739
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,824
Go ahead, Mr. Cady, take a good look.

740
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:38,409
Nice house.

741
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,579
It is a nice house.
You satisfied now you've seen it?

742
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:44,749
Or is there more?

743
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:47,753
Is that it?

744
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:50,297
There is going to be more, isn't there?

745
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,674
You won't stop until you're happy.

746
00:52:53,424 --> 00:52:56,469
How can I be happy
when you're not happy?

747
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,598
You don't know anything about me.

748
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:02,350
-I know what I see, ma'am.
-Yeah?

749
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:05,936
I wanted to know what you looked like.

750
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,524
I've been waiting to see your face,
but now that I see you...

751
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,860
...you are just repulsive.

752
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:14,821
-I understand.
-Yeah.

753
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:18,866
I'm not your type.
All that prison time made me coarse.

754
00:53:19,284 --> 00:53:21,578
Guess I'm covered in too many tattoos?

755
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:27,041
But there's not a whole lot
to do in prison but desecrate your flesh.

756
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,919
It didn't have to be that way
for either of us...

757
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:32,671
...if your husband hadn't betrayed us both.

758
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,550
Who knows?
We might have been different people.

759
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,344
We might have been happy, Leigh.

760
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:41,681
-Mom, someone's on the phone!
-Dani!

761
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,725
Don't come out here!

762
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:56,445
Sam.

763
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,490
I thought I'd catch you here.

764
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:03,327
-That little smart aleck made me.
-He what?

765
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:06,122
It wasn't my fault.
He was looking to be covered.

766
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,832
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.

767
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,169
-I told you.
-You know where he was today?

768
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:13,964
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra...

769
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,674
...by Friedrich Nietzsche,
the German philosopher.

770
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,301
-He said that God is dead.
-God is dead. Right.

771
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:22,972
We can keep going this way,
but it's going to get expensive.

772
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:27,977
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.

773
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:30,730
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?

774
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:34,066
-Yes, I'd love to resolve it.
-Then I got a suggestion.

775
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:39,196
There are men that can be hired, by me,
to do a little hospital job on Cady.

776
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:45,036
What are we talking about here?

777
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,538
Two pieces of pipe and a bicycle chain.

778
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:51,876
He won't be so scary after that.

779
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:54,170
I'm a lawyer. Are we agreed on that?

780
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,923
Maybe 2,000 years ago,
we'd have stoned him to death.

781
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:01,843
I can't operate outside the law.
The law is my business.

782
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:11,145
-I'm home! Where is everybody?
-In here.

783
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:15,400
'Evening, ladies. Oh, chicken.

784
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:19,528
How is everything? Is everything okay?

785
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:21,404
-Yeah.
-Good.

786
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,119
He was here today.

787
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:38,381
-Hello?
-Hello, Danielle?

788
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,217
-Is this Miss Danielle Bowden?
-Yeah.

789
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,636
This is your new teacher calling.

790
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,222
-From English or Drama?
-Drama.

791
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:49,183
-So how you doing?
-Fine.

792
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:53,312
I'm just going down the list,
greeting my summer students.

793
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:55,314
You sound kind of down.

794
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,237
There's just been stuff
going on around here, that's all.

795
00:56:01,696 --> 00:56:03,864
-Anything I can do?
-I doubt it.

796
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:07,159
Shit happens, you know,
like the t-shirt says.

797
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,285
Yeah.

798
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:13,624
You know, all that negativity,
you can use that.

799
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,793
What do you mean?

800
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:20,714
I'm the kind of teacher that takes
a very personal interest in his kids.

801
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,927
Don't mind me. Everything you're
going through, it's okay, go with it.

802
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,638
The awkwardness you feel,
walking down the street...

803
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:30,808
...and some leering fool is
making fun of your sexuality...

804
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:35,020
...the turmoil you feel, extra bad when
that time of the month comes around...

805
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,398
...the anger you feel
that your mom and dad...

806
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,693
...won't let you grow up
and be yourself, be a woman.

807
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:45,572
Don't suppress or deny it.
Use it in your life and work.

808
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,325
Okay. I mean...

809
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,830
I'll have to think about all that.

810
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:58,751
Class is tomorrow in Room 110, right?

811
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,755
No, it's been changed to the theater.

812
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,091
-What better place for Drama, right?
-Yeah.

813
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:12,140
And remember, Danielle, you can use
all those fears to draw upon and learn.

814
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:14,976
You know this little tune?

815
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,230
"If you want a do right

816
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:20,899
"All days

817
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,860
"woman

818
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:27,739
"You've gotta be a

819
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:30,116
"do right

820
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:34,038
"All night man"

821
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:41,711
You can trust in me,
because I'm a do right man, okay?

822
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,465
Okay, 'night now.

823
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,594
Okay. Good night.

824
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,391
Honey, I think maybe I should walk you in.

825
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:58,936
No, it's okay, Mom.
There are a lot of people here.

826
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,147
I'll be right here at 4:00 to pick you up.

827
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:03,275
-Okay.
-'Bye.

828
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:08,155
I didn't think summer sessions
would be so crowded.

829
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,034
They're just having a big meeting
about next fall's chorus program.

830
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,870
-I have to go downstairs for Drama.
-Okay, 'bye.

831
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:02,792
Hello.

832
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,756
Nadine?

833
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:25,898
I'm here for the Drama class.

834
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:36,283
Am I busted?

835
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:38,619
-No.
-I hope not.

836
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:41,622
You can't smoke grass in school.

837
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:43,791
Privilege of the profession.

838
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:47,378
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

839
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:48,713
Yeah.

840
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:51,257
Are you the Drama teacher?

841
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,676
And you're, let me guess.

842
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:58,181
Cecile James?

843
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:02,143
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

844
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:04,728
Danielle. Oh, we spoke last night.

845
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:06,397
Yeah.

846
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:09,067
Oh, I'm sorry. How rude.

847
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:11,694
It's okay.

848
01:00:17,324 --> 01:00:19,535
"I think we're alone now"

849
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,040
Okay.

850
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,388
Thanks. Here.

851
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:41,724
I'm going to give this to you.

852
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:48,480
Little trick I learned. Take it.

853
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:54,820
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

854
01:00:56,405 --> 01:00:58,658
You really made sense to me.

855
01:01:01,243 --> 01:01:02,911
I thought a lot.

856
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:05,748
Those are human truths.
That's what it's all about.

857
01:01:05,873 --> 01:01:08,000
And that's what we deal with here.

858
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:10,794
See the book you have, Thomas Wolfe?

859
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:14,131
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

860
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,301
I like the end...

861
01:01:19,136 --> 01:01:22,389
...where Eugene's journey was really...

862
01:01:23,015 --> 01:01:24,809
...mystical, you know?

863
01:01:25,434 --> 01:01:28,311
It was almost like a pilgrimage.

864
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:31,481
Almost like a cop-out, if you ask me.

865
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:34,193
Though those were the facts of Wolfe's life.

866
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:38,196
The novel is what you would call
a roman ŕ clef.

867
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,906
You know what that is?

868
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,410
Sure.

869
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:47,414
Well, nonetheless, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

870
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,251
Although writers do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

871
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,962
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read his trilogy?

872
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:56,172
Plexus, Nexus and Sexus?

873
01:01:57,507 --> 01:01:59,426
-You haven't read that?
-No.

874
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:02,137
You're missing something.

875
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:07,434
You know what?
I did read Tropic of Cancer.

876
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:09,602
Just parts of it, though...

877
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:13,565
...because I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

878
01:02:15,442 --> 01:02:19,196
His descriptions are pretty vivid,
I would say.

879
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:21,615
In one of the novels, I don't recall which...

880
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,327
...he describes an erection
as a piece of lead with wings on it.

881
01:02:25,661 --> 01:02:29,372
-I didn't read that part.
-Of course not. You're not allowed.

882
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,542
Your parents don't want you
to achieve adulthood.

883
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,796
They know the pitfalls of adulthood,
all that freedom.

884
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:37,756
They know it only too well.

885
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:41,927
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt and anger onto you...

886
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:45,430
...for a crime that's not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

887
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:52,646
Wait a second.

888
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,607
Where are you from?

889
01:02:56,942 --> 01:02:57,985
Where am I from?

890
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:00,237
-Yeah.
-Where do you think I'm from?

891
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,406
I don't know, but...

892
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,908
If I told you, you going to get mad at me?

893
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:14,835
I'm from the black forest.

894
01:03:18,547 --> 01:03:20,298
That's funny.

895
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:24,011
You're not the Drama teacher, are you?

896
01:03:25,053 --> 01:03:26,846
Maybe I'm the big bad wolf.

897
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:35,354
So you're that guy that's been
hanging around the house?

898
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:38,441
You're the one that killed my mom's dog?

899
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:42,194
-Your mom's dog was killed?
-Yeah.

900
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:45,323
I didn't even know anything about that.

901
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:47,074
That's a shame.

902
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:49,619
That's a damn shame.

903
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,496
Yes, it was.

904
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,539
What kind of dog was it?

905
01:03:54,499 --> 01:03:56,417
I don't know. He was just...

906
01:03:56,877 --> 01:03:59,671
He was fluffy, and...

907
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:01,714
Fluffy?

908
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,304
So you didn't do that?

909
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,682
Of course I didn't do that.

910
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:18,105
-Okay.
-I wouldn't do that.

911
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:21,693
So why... What are you doing here, then?

912
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:25,154
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

913
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,327
-Why? I mean...
-Because...

914
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,873
...I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

915
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,168
I see you're a nice person. That's all.

916
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:46,175
-You're not going to hurt me, are you?
-I'm not going to hurt you at all.

917
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:48,428
There's no hurting here, Danielle.

918
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:53,642
Between us there's no anger, nothing.
Just a search for truth.

919
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:00,273
Did you judge me, get angry at me
when you caught me smoking the grass?

920
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:02,525
No.

921
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:07,946
But your parents judged you.
Got plenty angry at you, didn't they?

922
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,781
Yeah.

923
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,368
They punished you for their sins.

924
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:14,913
What did they do?

925
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:21,001
My dad...
They just yelled a whole lot and...

926
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:23,420
...my mom cried...

927
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:26,840
...and my dad said
I couldn't drive the Cherokee.

928
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:30,761
I'd say they punished you
for their sins, and you resent that...

929
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:32,764
...and you should resent it.

930
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,768
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

931
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:39,854
You shouldn't damn them.
Don't judge them.

932
01:05:39,938 --> 01:05:42,815
Just forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

933
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,570
Why do you hate my father?

934
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:51,365
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

935
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,492
I'm here to help him.

936
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,162
We all make mistakes, Danielle.

937
01:05:57,705 --> 01:06:00,332
You and I have. At least we try to admit it.

938
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,001
Don't we?

939
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,627
Yeah.

940
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:06,005
But your daddy, he don't.

941
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:11,094
Every man carries a circle of hell
around his head like a halo.

942
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,554
Your daddy, too. Every man...

943
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:18,059
...has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

944
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,227
You know what paradise is?

945
01:06:21,104 --> 01:06:22,687
-No.
-Salvation.

946
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,275
'Cause your daddy's not happy.

947
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:28,069
Your mommy's not happy.

948
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,489
And you know what? You're not happy.

949
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:35,367
-Are you?
-No, I'm not.

950
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:42,875
You thought about me last night,
didn't you?

951
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:49,131
Yes, I did.

952
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:50,882
I know.

953
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:56,805
You know, I think
I might have found a companion...

954
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,851
...for that long walk to the light.

955
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,648
Do you mind if I put my arm around you?

956
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:21,455
It's okay.

957
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,251
No, I don't mind.

958
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,627
Okay.

959
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:59,177
Kersek, where the hell have you been?
He came at my daughter at school.

960
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,680
You asked me to watch him nights.
I'm watching nights. What happened?

961
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:06,601
My wife, Leigh, found some marijuana
in one of Dani's schoolbooks.

962
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,354
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or what happened.

963
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:11,564
She's scared and she won't talk about it.

964
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,025
But this has gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

965
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:16,819
-You phone the cops?
-No, I didn't phone the cops.

966
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,031
What did you call them?
"Slow, skeptical pathetic, even."

967
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,493
No, Leigh, that's all right.
Just hold on a minute.

968
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:26,621
Kersek...

969
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:30,666
...I want to hire those three guys,
you remember, the hospital job.

970
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,628
Consider it done, the sooner the better.

971
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,796
Three men are going to cost you a grand.

972
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,758
It's not chicken feed
but you don't go with less than three.

973
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,551
It's better to overdo it.

974
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,720
You'll have the money in the morning.

975
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,348
We'll be on for tomorrow night.
And Sam...

976
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,768
...you'll feel good about this.

977
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,605
All right.

978
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,829
Do you notice these young people?

979
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,622
They don't look very happy.

980
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:13,876
They're committed to their professions
and ambitions but not to each other.

981
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,711
Cady, shut up and listen.

982
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,215
If you don't leave...

983
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:23,511
...my family alone
and you don't get out of here...

984
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,056
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

985
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:31,060
-Could you repeat that?
-I said...

986
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,312
...if you don't get out of here...

987
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:36,524
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

988
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,109
-A threat?
-Yeah.

989
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,152
You bet your ass that's a threat.

990
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,987
I have thought of relocating...

991
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,991
...where I'd be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

992
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:47,868
...I could teach earthquake preparedness.

993
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:51,997
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex, Counselor.

994
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,627
I mean, where else could I just
casually confer with an old colleague?

995
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,963
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?

996
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:02,758
-You think you're better than me.
-No, I don't.

997
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,510
That's not the goddamned point.

998
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,347
Good. If you're not better than me
then I can have what you have.

999
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,642
-What do I have?
-A wife, a daughter.

1000
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,022
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1001
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:21,736
Fourteen years ago, I was forced to make
a commitment to an eight-by-nine cell...

1002
01:11:21,818 --> 01:11:24,947
...and now you're going to be forced
to make a commitment.

1003
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,241
You could say I'm here to save you.

1004
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,537
Fine.

1005
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,041
Check out the Bible, Counselor...

1006
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:37,501
...the book between Esther and Psalms.

1007
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,304
You all right?

1008
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,683
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

1009
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,731
This isn't going to work, you know.

1010
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:03,027
-What isn't going to work?
-Locking us in, hiding us from the world.

1011
01:12:03,109 --> 01:12:04,987
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dani.

1012
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,991
-Making me stay out of school.
-You're going back to school tomorrow.

1013
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,577
And put some clothes on.
You're not a kid anymore.

1014
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:15,623
Why am I going back to school tomorrow?
What are you going to do?

1015
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,874
That's none of your concern, Dani.

1016
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,419
Dad...

1017
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,382
...he didn't force himself on me, you know.

1018
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,343
I know you'd like to think that he did.

1019
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,222
But I think he was...

1020
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,975
I think he was just trying
to make a connection with me.

1021
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:36,852
-You know?
-Now, Dani...

1022
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,145
...I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,523
No. Do you understand?

1024
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:46,987
There will never be any connection
between you...

1025
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,905
...and Max Cady.

1026
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,034
You understand that?

1027
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,462
Did he touch you?

1028
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:08,049
What are you laughing about?

1029
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:09,885
Why are you smiling?

1030
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,595
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1031
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,556
Dani, wipe that smile off your face!

1032
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,726
I'm asking you did he touch you?

1033
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,485
Oh, wait, Dani. I'm sorry.

1034
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,865
Wait, honey. I'm sorry.

1035
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,784
Get out of here!

1036
01:14:41,309 --> 01:14:43,018
Come on.

1037
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,468
Counselor?

1038
01:15:20,348 --> 01:15:21,807
Is that you?

1039
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:28,565
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1040
01:15:42,912 --> 01:15:44,914
I ain't no white trash piece of shit.

1041
01:15:44,997 --> 01:15:47,249
I'm better than you all.

1042
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:52,088
I can out-learn you.

1043
01:15:53,172 --> 01:15:55,132
I can out-read you.

1044
01:15:55,216 --> 01:16:00,137
I can outthink you,
and I can out-philosophize you.

1045
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:02,598
And I'm going to outlast you.

1046
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:06,978
You think a couple whacks to my
good-old-boy gut will get me down?

1047
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:09,731
It's going to take a hell of a lot
more than that...

1048
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:12,149
...to prove you're better than me!

1049
01:16:14,318 --> 01:16:18,530
"I am like God, and God like me.

1050
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:21,325
"I am as large as God.

1051
01:16:21,408 --> 01:16:24,412
"He is as small as I.

1052
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:29,083
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be."

1053
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,338
Silesius, 17th century.

1054
01:16:46,183 --> 01:16:48,102
Could you be there?

1055
01:17:05,703 --> 01:17:07,621
I wonder if you're here.

1056
01:17:16,839 --> 01:17:18,424
Ah, fuck it.

1057
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:22,594
If you're here,
what the fuck is the difference?

1058
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,014
Fuck it!

1059
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:38,235
-I've got Mr. Kersek on one.
-Good. I'll take it.

1060
01:17:39,736 --> 01:17:41,821
Sam, you look tired. You get that writ?

1061
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:44,741
No, we have to get into that.
Let me just grab this.

1062
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:47,285
-Kersek.
-I'm damn sorry about last night.

1063
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:49,955
That son of a bitch could survive
a nuclear strike.

1064
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,248
Hang on a second.

1065
01:17:51,331 --> 01:17:53,750
Tom, I'm not doing it. I pulled a fast one...

1066
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:56,170
...and it's come back and bit me on the ass.

1067
01:17:56,252 --> 01:18:00,465
What you did was dumb. What I'm asking
is no big deal. This is my daughter!

1068
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:04,177
No, it's perjury.
It's bullshit and I'm not doing it!

1069
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:06,471
-All right?
-I'll be in my office.

1070
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:08,390
Who was that top criminal lawyer?

1071
01:18:08,474 --> 01:18:10,851
Lee Heller. We need to talk.

1072
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:13,729
If word gets out how Cady
bushwhacked those bastards...

1073
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:15,647
...it'll be hard to get three new guys.

1074
01:18:15,731 --> 01:18:18,066
I don't want three new guys.
You hear me?

1075
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:22,362
Mr. Heller, it's Sam Bowden
from Broadbent and Denmeyer.

1076
01:18:22,446 --> 01:18:26,659
Tom speaks very highly of you. He says
you're the best, and that's what I need.

1077
01:18:26,741 --> 01:18:30,245
We froze our butts together in Korea.
How can I help you, Sam?

1078
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:34,916
It's a petition for a restraining order,
but there have been complications.

1079
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,461
I know this is short notice,
but I need this injunction.

1080
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:42,466
There's an ex-convict named Max Cady
who's been harassing my family.

1081
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:45,886
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue this conversation.

1082
01:18:45,968 --> 01:18:50,348
-Is there a more convenient time?
-The damn thing is, I have a conflict.

1083
01:18:50,432 --> 01:18:52,142
-What would that be?
-You see...

1084
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:55,145
...Mr. Cady retained my services yesterday.

1085
01:18:55,228 --> 01:18:58,273
-He what?
-In fact, I see on my phone sheet...

1086
01:18:58,356 --> 01:19:01,526
...Mr. Cady called this morning,
so I'm sure he'll fill me in...

1087
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:04,821
But wait a minute, Lee.
This man is a psychotic.

1088
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:08,491
It appears I'll be seeing you
at that hearing after all.

1089
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,288
-Could you repeat that?
-I said, "If you don't leave...

1090
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:18,877
"...my family alone
and if you don't get out of here...

1091
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:22,130
"...you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed."

1092
01:19:22,756 --> 01:19:27,468
-A threat?
-You bet your ass that's a threat.

1093
01:19:27,552 --> 01:19:31,556
You need only glance
at my client to know...

1094
01:19:32,557 --> 01:19:38,062
...that Mr. Bowden made good
on his heinous and cowardly threat.

1095
01:19:38,729 --> 01:19:42,776
Just as God arose to judgment
to save all the meek of the earth...

1096
01:19:42,984 --> 01:19:45,821
...I hope and pray you will do the same, sir.

1097
01:19:45,903 --> 01:19:47,488
Your honor...

1098
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,534
...Mr. Cady wouldn't have
surreptitiously taped our meeting...

1099
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:53,578
...unless he knew that he'd...

1100
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:59,417
This court does not condone...

1101
01:20:00,126 --> 01:20:04,047
...feuds, vendettas or vigilantism.

1102
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:09,594
Let me quote our great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1103
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:14,557
"I will let no man drag me down so low...

1104
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:18,353
"...as to make me hate him."

1105
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:19,479
Yes.

1106
01:20:20,272 --> 01:20:22,899
I will grant the restraining order...

1107
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:26,569
...not to validate the malice between you...

1108
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:31,699
...but in the interest of Christian harmony.

1109
01:20:33,243 --> 01:20:36,329
You may not come within 500 yards...

1110
01:20:36,412 --> 01:20:41,042
...of Mr. Maximilian Cady...

1111
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:46,882
...until such time as the court
may lift the injunction.

1112
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:52,137
King Solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely, your honor.

1113
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:57,475
I am so offended by the Philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden...

1114
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:01,479
...I petitioned the A.B.A.
for his disbarment...

1115
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:04,482
...on the grounds of moral turpitude.

1116
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:07,777
Now, if you will excuse us, my client...

1117
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,738
...is due back at the hospital...

1118
01:21:13,324 --> 01:21:17,745
...for the results of his numerous x-rays.

1119
01:21:20,248 --> 01:21:21,749
Kersek, I want a gun.

1120
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,335
-I need a gun. I want a gun.
-You want a gun?

1121
01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:25,920
Yeah, I need a gun.

1122
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:29,715
-Know anything about guns?
-I don't believe in them. Not in the house.

1123
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:32,635
I'll get you a gun. What kind?
Now, calm down.

1124
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:36,221
-Something simple I can handle.
-Let me see what fits you.

1125
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:39,058
Forty-five...
Let me see your hands.

1126
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:43,563
-A .38 snub-nosed special.
-All right. Good.

1127
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:45,648
I can teach you how to use it.

1128
01:21:45,731 --> 01:21:47,941
-Great.
-The first lesson is this...

1129
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:50,444
...don't think of it as trying to kill a man.

1130
01:21:50,528 --> 01:21:52,571
-Right.
-It's an extension of your fist.

1131
01:21:52,655 --> 01:21:54,824
You're just reaching out
and knocking him down.

1132
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:56,534
Boom. All right.

1133
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,245
Later on we'll shoot some trees, okay?

1134
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:01,039
That'd be great. Good.

1135
01:22:03,624 --> 01:22:05,417
What is it? What?

1136
01:22:05,501 --> 01:22:07,086
-Well, Sam...
-Yeah?

1137
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:09,714
I give you a gun. You pull it on Cady...

1138
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:13,884
...it will dawn on you that shooting
a man is different than shooting a tree.

1139
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,970
Next thing, you know, Cady has the gun.

1140
01:22:16,054 --> 01:22:20,140
You'll teach me. I could handle a gun.
He won't take it away.

1141
01:22:20,432 --> 01:22:23,269
Best-case scenario:
you kill Cady dog-dead.

1142
01:22:24,436 --> 01:22:27,565
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that, Counselor?

1143
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:36,324
Oh, Jesus! It's all fucked up, Kersek!

1144
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:40,620
I mean, the law considers me
more of a loose cannon than Max Cady!

1145
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:45,040
Some big-shit attorney has whipped the
A.B.A.'s ethics committee into a frenzy.

1146
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,627
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1147
01:22:48,711 --> 01:22:50,462
How did they link that to you?

1148
01:22:50,546 --> 01:22:54,883
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was the decent thing to do.

1149
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:58,262
Maybe I'd scare him. He was wired.

1150
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,600
Goddamn fools.

1151
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:08,355
This hearing, it's real important?

1152
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:14,528
Only if I want to continue to practice law.

1153
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:16,780
Cady isn't expected there, is he?

1154
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,575
Mr. Cady, he's beyond reproach.

1155
01:23:19,741 --> 01:23:22,161
-But you're required to be there.
-Yeah.

1156
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:25,706
-When is this hearing?
-It's Thursday morning, 9:00.

1157
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:28,792
The torture begins and lasts for two days.

1158
01:23:29,877 --> 01:23:32,128
You have to fly up the night before?

1159
01:23:32,253 --> 01:23:33,422
Right.

1160
01:23:34,297 --> 01:23:38,134
Cady's an opportunist.
If he thinks you're gone for two days...

1161
01:23:38,218 --> 01:23:41,346
...that's going to be as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

1162
01:23:41,597 --> 01:23:43,389
If Cady breaks into your home...

1163
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:45,017
...he can be killed.

1164
01:23:45,099 --> 01:23:46,309
Justifiably.

1165
01:23:48,269 --> 01:23:51,814
But he won't show unless
he's sure you won't be there.

1166
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,262
-Have a good trip.
-All right. Bye-bye.

1167
01:25:03,344 --> 01:25:05,513
-Call us tonight, okay?
-All right.

1168
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:20,278
-I didn't miss the 9:20 to Raleigh?
-I'm afraid you did. There's a 10:20.

1169
01:25:20,403 --> 01:25:24,408
It's not that. I have some
important papers for Samuel Bowden.

1170
01:25:24,949 --> 01:25:26,451
Was he on the 9:20?

1171
01:25:27,035 --> 01:25:29,538
We can't give out that information, sir.

1172
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,330
Well, it's just...

1173
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:33,959
...I guess I could send it to him overnight...

1174
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:37,838
...but he might be back, for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and I...

1175
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,506
See, I...

1176
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:44,010
My wife and I have been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

1177
01:25:44,094 --> 01:25:48,181
If I don't get in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

1178
01:25:48,264 --> 01:25:50,975
We've already lost our little daughter Dani.

1179
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:53,561
Is...

1180
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:59,316
Is there any way to know if he was
on that flight and when he's returning?

1181
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,277
It'd really help us.

1182
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:14,206
He'll be back the day after tomorrow, sir.

1183
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:15,709
Bless your heart.

1184
01:26:31,682 --> 01:26:33,017
Go on in.

1185
01:26:35,477 --> 01:26:36,729
Get down, Sam.

1186
01:26:43,486 --> 01:26:44,987
Give me a cigarette.

1187
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:49,284
Slow down. You're outpacing me
two-to-one since you started again.

1188
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:51,743
Just keep track of how many I owe you.

1189
01:26:53,746 --> 01:26:56,332
-How'd it go at the airport?
-We did our thing...

1190
01:26:56,415 --> 01:26:59,543
...but we don't know if he saw us,
or if he was there.

1191
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:02,212
Set the trap and we'll see.

1192
01:27:02,963 --> 01:27:04,423
What if we don't want to see?

1193
01:27:04,507 --> 01:27:05,925
-Dani!
-What?

1194
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,136
Maybe he poisoned the dog.

1195
01:27:08,218 --> 01:27:10,262
Sam, watch out for the windows.

1196
01:27:10,346 --> 01:27:12,890
You're not allowed to stand up, remember?

1197
01:27:19,938 --> 01:27:22,441
-Didn't Cady go after her?
-You don't know Dani.

1198
01:27:22,525 --> 01:27:26,195
If she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom,
she takes it outside.

1199
01:27:26,487 --> 01:27:28,740
You know, she could never kill anything.

1200
01:27:28,822 --> 01:27:30,783
Even a six-foot palmetto bug?

1201
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:34,828
Oh, God.

1202
01:27:43,503 --> 01:27:44,754
What is that?

1203
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:49,093
It's monofilament line.
I got it from Sam's fishing gear.

1204
01:27:49,384 --> 01:27:51,971
I stretch it across the windows
and the doors...

1205
01:27:52,054 --> 01:27:54,139
...and tie it to Dani's teddy bear here.

1206
01:27:54,223 --> 01:27:59,228
If the bear moves a quarter of an inch,
I know if the holy ghost is sneaking in.

1207
01:28:29,383 --> 01:28:31,009
What are you reading?

1208
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,017
-Why? Did Kersek quit?
-No.

1209
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,644
It's just that Cady said...

1210
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:42,438
You want some answers.

1211
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:45,565
Me, too.

1212
01:28:47,609 --> 01:28:50,195
I'd like to know just how strong we are...

1213
01:28:51,197 --> 01:28:52,489
...or how weak.

1214
01:28:55,075 --> 01:28:58,620
But I guess the only way
we're going to find that out is by...

1215
01:28:58,829 --> 01:29:00,455
...going through this.

1216
01:29:04,209 --> 01:29:08,004
It's just that Cady said to read the book
between Esther and Psalms.

1217
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:10,549
Which is which one?

1218
01:29:11,049 --> 01:29:12,425
The book of Job.

1219
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:18,431
Job was a good man. He believed in God...

1220
01:29:19,558 --> 01:29:21,476
...and God tested his faith.

1221
01:29:22,144 --> 01:29:24,313
He took away everything he had...

1222
01:29:26,023 --> 01:29:27,608
...even his children.

1223
01:29:44,124 --> 01:29:46,793
It's hideous, this plan. I mean, barbaric.

1224
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:50,214
They're crazy.
My dad's turned into some kind of...

1225
01:29:50,546 --> 01:29:51,756
I don't know what.

1226
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,049
Barbaric.

1227
01:29:56,470 --> 01:30:00,808
Listen to your father.
Do what they say. What else can you do?

1228
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:02,893
Leave. We could go to the houseboat...

1229
01:30:02,976 --> 01:30:05,479
...you know, and get lost in any inlet.

1230
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,901
Dani, come on.

1231
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,112
Don't stay outside.

1232
01:30:21,202 --> 01:30:23,789
Do you want to know
what really disturbs me?

1233
01:30:24,456 --> 01:30:26,041
Killing this guy.

1234
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,919
I mean, taking a man's life.

1235
01:30:30,879 --> 01:30:33,215
I don't know if I can live with that.

1236
01:30:33,881 --> 01:30:35,341
You may have to.

1237
01:30:35,884 --> 01:30:38,636
-Sam, just remember the plan.
-I know the plan.

1238
01:30:38,845 --> 01:30:41,347
Damn, it's premeditated.

1239
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:45,101
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1240
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:47,645
It's also excessive force.

1241
01:30:47,729 --> 01:30:50,399
The only thing excessive
we could do to Cady...

1242
01:30:50,481 --> 01:30:53,026
...would be to gut him and eat his liver.

1243
01:30:53,192 --> 01:30:54,611
That might be excessive.

1244
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:56,821
Jesus Christ, Kersek, I'm serious.

1245
01:30:57,155 --> 01:30:59,240
No, you're scared.

1246
01:30:59,573 --> 01:31:00,950
But that's okay.

1247
01:31:01,451 --> 01:31:03,452
I want you to savor that fear.

1248
01:31:04,078 --> 01:31:06,163
You know, the South evolved in fear...

1249
01:31:06,247 --> 01:31:08,666
...fear of the Indian, fear of the slave...

1250
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,543
...fear of the damn Union.

1251
01:31:11,502 --> 01:31:14,338
The South has a fine tradition
of savoring fear.

1252
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,900
What's the matter?

1253
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:36,277
Don't look over!

1254
01:31:37,153 --> 01:31:38,863
She's making me nervous.

1255
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,991
What would she normally do...

1256
01:31:42,074 --> 01:31:44,327
...if Sam wasn't around to run her home?

1257
01:31:44,411 --> 01:31:46,246
-She'd stay...
-She'd stay over.

1258
01:31:46,328 --> 01:31:48,164
Well, then, she stays over.

1259
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:26,196
-What?
-Leigh.

1260
01:34:26,696 --> 01:34:28,406
I know how the dog died.

1261
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:31,660
-Sam, are you dreaming?
-No!

1262
01:34:31,744 --> 01:34:35,205
I just had the weirdest feeling
he was already in the house.

1263
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:52,139
Can't sleep, Miss Graciela?

1264
01:34:52,597 --> 01:34:53,932
Yeah. It's hot.

1265
01:34:55,517 --> 01:34:59,312
You know, I think it's the humidity
that makes us all so thirsty.

1266
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:02,816
Excuse me.

1267
01:35:03,692 --> 01:35:05,610
My pop was a cop.

1268
01:35:06,361 --> 01:35:07,612
Twenty years.

1269
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,866
This was his favorite drink on a stakeout.

1270
01:35:30,218 --> 01:35:32,637
I learned that in prison. You like?

1271
01:35:33,096 --> 01:35:34,890
White trash piece of shit.

1272
01:35:44,191 --> 01:35:45,608
Stay here, Leigh.

1273
01:35:51,907 --> 01:35:52,949
Kersek?

1274
01:36:08,673 --> 01:36:11,051
Dani, go back to your room.

1275
01:36:11,134 --> 01:36:12,386
Lock the door.

1276
01:36:19,267 --> 01:36:22,019
-Don't go down there, Sam.
-No, it's all right.

1277
01:36:50,339 --> 01:36:51,840
Dani, don't look.

1278
01:36:52,342 --> 01:36:54,385
Oh, my God, Graciela!

1279
01:36:57,638 --> 01:36:58,807
Oh, my God.

1280
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:26,750
It's the piano wire.

1281
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:35,218
I'm going to get this son of a bitch!

1282
01:37:43,893 --> 01:37:45,394
Tell him to stop!

1283
01:37:47,563 --> 01:37:49,524
God, he might be out here!

1284
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:32,900
Listen, I've got Kersek's gun with me...

1285
01:38:32,984 --> 01:38:36,529
...and you'll find the piano wire
that Cady used in the house.

1286
01:38:36,612 --> 01:38:38,864
Yeah, I know how this looks.

1287
01:38:39,072 --> 01:38:41,492
You're not supposed to flee
a murder scene.

1288
01:38:41,575 --> 01:38:43,869
Listen, Lieutenant.
You may not know this...

1289
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:46,997
...but in the law there's something
called force majeure.

1290
01:38:47,081 --> 01:38:49,500
It means an unforeseeable act of God...

1291
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:52,336
...and it cancels all promises
and obligations.

1292
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,839
So, legally speaking, all bets are off.

1293
01:38:55,256 --> 01:38:58,383
You find Max Cady and we'll come back.

1294
01:39:01,011 --> 01:39:03,305
-What did he say?
-He said we're fugitives.

1295
01:39:03,388 --> 01:39:05,891
-What's that mean?
-It means we're doing something right.

1296
01:39:34,127 --> 01:39:37,131
Where's that old mongrel dog of yours,
Mrs. Bowden?

1297
01:41:58,229 --> 01:42:00,273
Tomorrow, I'll catch some fish.

1298
01:42:00,815 --> 01:42:04,861
Oh, you know, you don't have to.
I've got enough food to last us a week.

1299
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:14,745
But it'd be nice.

1300
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:17,247
Good.

1301
01:42:26,716 --> 01:42:28,885
It's only rain. A sheet of rain.

1302
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:35,557
-What was that?
-It's just a squall.

1303
01:42:37,185 --> 01:42:39,770
-I'll go check the anchor.
-Wait, Dad. Don't go out.

1304
01:42:39,854 --> 01:42:42,649
No, Danielle. Everything is okay. All right?

1305
01:42:42,732 --> 01:42:46,486
-Yeah. We're on the river now, baby.
-It's just a squall kicking.

1306
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:13,555
Graciela has a brother.

1307
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:17,767
I mean, she had a brother.

1308
01:43:18,767 --> 01:43:19,936
Oh, sweetie.

1309
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,982
We'll get in touch with him right away.

1310
01:43:28,277 --> 01:43:29,987
We're making some tea.

1311
01:43:40,706 --> 01:43:42,833
I can't hear you. It's windy out.

1312
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:25,376
What's that?

1313
01:44:25,834 --> 01:44:27,169
Are we moving?

1314
01:44:32,174 --> 01:44:33,551
'Evening, ladies.

1315
01:44:35,136 --> 01:44:37,054
You know my husband has a gun?

1316
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:38,347
Not this gun?

1317
01:44:38,805 --> 01:44:41,015
-Is it this gun?
-Where is he?

1318
01:44:41,099 --> 01:44:43,727
Resting up. He had a long difficult day.

1319
01:44:44,562 --> 01:44:48,983
Danielle, I told you, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

1320
01:44:50,067 --> 01:44:51,234
I didn't.

1321
01:44:52,194 --> 01:44:54,613
-My parents brought me here.
-Of course.

1322
01:44:55,572 --> 01:44:56,823
Where's Sexus?

1323
01:44:57,615 --> 01:45:00,202
-Back at the house.
-Shame.

1324
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:03,539
I had hoped we could
read aloud from it together.

1325
01:45:05,624 --> 01:45:08,043
Well, I...

1326
01:45:08,544 --> 01:45:11,047
-...memorized some for you.
-Did you?

1327
01:45:11,129 --> 01:45:12,839
-Yeah.
-Did you?

1328
01:45:16,302 --> 01:45:17,844
Well, I'm impressed.

1329
01:45:19,095 --> 01:45:20,264
Which part?

1330
01:45:22,515 --> 01:45:24,184
The part...

1331
01:45:25,519 --> 01:45:27,604
...you know what part, you know.

1332
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:32,191
-I don't think you did your homework.
-I did.

1333
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,694
What parts were they?

1334
01:45:36,989 --> 01:45:38,240
The good parts?

1335
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,200
Yeah. They were...

1336
01:45:40,284 --> 01:45:42,535
-Were you a good girl?
-I was.

1337
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:44,663
I knew you'd follow me here and...

1338
01:45:44,746 --> 01:45:46,665
You know me pretty well, don't you?

1339
01:45:46,748 --> 01:45:48,916
Yeah. I do.

1340
01:45:49,418 --> 01:45:51,961
You're going to know me a lot better, too.

1341
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:59,719
Are you offering me something hot?

1342
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:03,473
Let's get something straight here.

1343
01:46:05,475 --> 01:46:09,438
I spent fourteen years
in an eight-by-nine cell...

1344
01:46:09,521 --> 01:46:12,399
...surrounded by people
who were less than human.

1345
01:46:13,691 --> 01:46:16,820
My mission in that time was
to become more than human.

1346
01:46:18,487 --> 01:46:19,531
You see?

1347
01:46:21,157 --> 01:46:23,744
Granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church.

1348
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:25,454
Granny drank strychnine.

1349
01:46:25,536 --> 01:46:28,540
You could say I had a leg-up,
genetically speaking.

1350
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:40,010
I'm going to forgive you, Danielle, honey.

1351
01:46:40,426 --> 01:46:43,137
I know that wasn't the real you,
the true you.

1352
01:46:43,221 --> 01:46:45,765
But I would like you to wait in the hold.

1353
01:46:48,977 --> 01:46:51,229
Danielle, get in the hold.

1354
01:46:54,982 --> 01:46:56,317
-Stop!
-No!

1355
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:07,203
Ready to be born again, Mrs. Bowden?

1356
01:47:11,332 --> 01:47:15,378
A few minutes alone with me, darling,
and you'll be speaking in tongues.

1357
01:48:34,248 --> 01:48:35,792
Excuse me, Mrs. B.

1358
01:48:36,126 --> 01:48:37,711
Please don't take umbrage...

1359
01:48:37,793 --> 01:48:40,420
...but in the plan that I have formulated...

1360
01:48:40,797 --> 01:48:44,174
...there's much more to it
than just you and I making love.

1361
01:48:44,258 --> 01:48:46,302
I mean, that's just so...

1362
01:48:47,094 --> 01:48:48,888
...commonplace and dreary.

1363
01:48:50,764 --> 01:48:52,808
Here and now, we have an opportunity.

1364
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:54,977
"What is that opportunity?" you ask.

1365
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:57,604
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity...

1366
01:48:57,688 --> 01:49:00,733
...to depict and dramatize...

1367
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:05,947
...both the heights and the depths...

1368
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,702
...of a mama's true love of her daughter,
if you get my meaning.

1369
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,495
Come on out, babe.
Come on, darling. Let's go.

1370
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,332
Get out. Get up here.

1371
01:49:16,707 --> 01:49:19,668
This is between you and me.
Leave them out of it.

1372
01:49:19,752 --> 01:49:23,714
This is my night, Counselor.
Don't you step on my lines.

1373
01:49:25,215 --> 01:49:26,092
Stop!

1374
01:49:28,385 --> 01:49:29,553
Yes, Leigh?

1375
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,473
Listen to me, Max.

1376
01:49:35,809 --> 01:49:38,813
You know, Max, since all this started...

1377
01:49:39,021 --> 01:49:41,065
...I've thought about you all the time.

1378
01:49:41,148 --> 01:49:46,236
I've tried to imagine
what it must have been like for you...

1379
01:49:46,611 --> 01:49:48,864
...all those years, locked up in jail.

1380
01:49:48,948 --> 01:49:54,119
I've tried to imagine you
and even your crimes...

1381
01:49:54,286 --> 01:49:57,956
...and how you must have felt
in those moments that you did them.

1382
01:49:58,624 --> 01:50:02,294
See, I know about loss, Max.

1383
01:50:02,378 --> 01:50:07,008
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1384
01:50:07,925 --> 01:50:11,970
And I know it doesn't compare to jail, but...

1385
01:50:12,888 --> 01:50:14,640
...I can understand...

1386
01:50:15,099 --> 01:50:17,309
...and I could share this with you.

1387
01:50:17,434 --> 01:50:22,230
Because of that whatever it is
that you've got planned...

1388
01:50:22,522 --> 01:50:24,859
...I want you to do it just with me...

1389
01:50:26,401 --> 01:50:27,945
...not with her...

1390
01:50:28,779 --> 01:50:30,030
...because...

1391
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:33,951
...we have this connection.

1392
01:50:45,462 --> 01:50:47,464
What do you think, Counselor?

1393
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:54,971
That was real eloquent, Leigh.

1394
01:50:57,265 --> 01:50:58,600
Brave, too.

1395
01:50:59,184 --> 01:51:03,146
I want to thank you for conveying to me
your most powerful emotions...

1396
01:51:04,231 --> 01:51:05,357
...because...

1397
01:51:11,196 --> 01:51:13,490
...I'm going to enjoy this all the more.

1398
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:24,751
Oh, my God!

1399
01:52:22,433 --> 01:52:25,771
The people call Samuel J. Bowden!

1400
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:32,694
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1401
01:52:32,777 --> 01:52:35,781
-Somebody's got to man the boat.
-Did you swear?

1402
01:52:35,906 --> 01:52:37,407
-I'll do it.
-Sit, Danielle.

1403
01:52:37,491 --> 01:52:40,577
Don't make light of your civic duty.
You're the jury.

1404
01:52:41,744 --> 01:52:44,873
All right, I swear to tell the truth.
What do you want to know?

1405
01:52:44,955 --> 01:52:48,960
Was a prior sexual history ever prepared
in connection with my defense?

1406
01:52:53,464 --> 01:52:54,465
It's...

1407
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,719
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
That was argumentative.

1408
01:52:58,803 --> 01:53:02,682
An investigator did prepare a prior
sexual history on the alleged victim...

1409
01:53:02,765 --> 01:53:03,975
...true?

1410
01:53:04,058 --> 01:53:07,645
I can ask leading questions, Your Honor.
He is a hostile witness.

1411
01:53:07,729 --> 01:53:11,524
Would you care to tell the court
what the gist was of this report?

1412
01:53:11,608 --> 01:53:14,193
It was fourteen years ago.
I can't remember that.

1413
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:17,655
How can he answer
when you're hitting him?

1414
01:53:18,364 --> 01:53:21,825
Because he's perjuring himself.
He knows damn well what it said.

1415
01:53:21,909 --> 01:53:24,745
-Don't you?
-It said that she was promiscuous.

1416
01:53:24,829 --> 01:53:28,208
It said she had three different lovers
in one month.

1417
01:53:28,415 --> 01:53:31,753
At least three! And did you show
this report to the D.A.?

1418
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,761
I found it when I started representing
myself six years into my sentence!

1419
01:53:40,928 --> 01:53:42,846
But there it was in the court file.

1420
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:45,433
Back in '77, you buried it, Counselor.

1421
01:53:45,516 --> 01:53:48,185
Would you care to tell the jury why?

1422
01:53:49,813 --> 01:53:52,189
Would you care to tell the court why?

1423
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:57,320
Because I know he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

1424
01:53:57,403 --> 01:53:59,446
Talk to me! I'm standing here!

1425
01:54:00,364 --> 01:54:03,493
Just because she was promiscuous
doesn't justify you raping her!

1426
01:54:03,576 --> 01:54:07,288
You bragged that you beat two prior
aggravated rapes. You were a menace!

1427
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:08,914
You were my lawyer!

1428
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:13,335
That report could have saved me
fourteen years.

1429
01:54:13,419 --> 01:54:16,296
-You're probably right.
-You self-righteous fuck!

1430
01:54:21,176 --> 01:54:24,514
I'm Virgil and I'm guiding you
through the gates of Hell.

1431
01:54:24,596 --> 01:54:28,142
We are now in the 9th circle,
the circle of traitors.

1432
01:54:28,601 --> 01:54:31,687
Traitors to country,
traitors to fellow man...

1433
01:54:32,021 --> 01:54:33,856
...traitors to God!

1434
01:54:34,106 --> 01:54:38,360
You, sir, are charged with
betraying the principles of all three!

1435
01:54:38,777 --> 01:54:41,155
Can you please quote for me the A.B.A.'s...

1436
01:54:41,239 --> 01:54:43,950
...Rules of Professional Conduct, Canon 7?

1437
01:54:45,451 --> 01:54:47,745
"A lawyer should represent his client..."

1438
01:54:47,829 --> 01:54:51,457
"Should zealously represent his client
within the bounds of the law."

1439
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:54,335
And I find you guilty, Counselor...

1440
01:54:54,419 --> 01:54:56,712
...guilty of betraying your fellow man...

1441
01:54:56,795 --> 01:54:58,797
...guilty of betraying your country...

1442
01:54:58,881 --> 01:55:01,050
...guilty of abrogating your oath...

1443
01:55:01,134 --> 01:55:03,761
...guilty of judging me and selling me out!

1444
01:55:04,052 --> 01:55:07,431
And with the power vested in me
by the kingdom of God...

1445
01:55:07,765 --> 01:55:12,061
...I sentence you to the 9th circle of Hell!

1446
01:55:12,143 --> 01:55:14,897
Now you will learn about loss...

1447
01:55:15,147 --> 01:55:18,901
...loss of freedom, loss of humanity.

1448
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:23,280
Now you and I will truly
be the same, Counselor.

1449
01:55:23,447 --> 01:55:25,573
Danielle, get down on your knees.

1450
01:55:25,657 --> 01:55:26,867
Take off your clothes!

1451
01:55:26,951 --> 01:55:28,661
Down on your knees now!

1452
01:55:31,163 --> 01:55:33,873
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!

1453
01:55:36,835 --> 01:55:38,503
Don't!

1454
01:55:41,006 --> 01:55:44,342
Now, off with your clothes!

1455
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:49,097
You, Leigh, take off your clothes. Now!

1456
01:55:50,932 --> 01:55:53,435
Come on!

1457
01:55:55,103 --> 01:55:57,022
Tonight, you'll learn to be an animal...

1458
01:55:57,106 --> 01:55:59,817
...to live like an animal and to die like one.

1459
01:56:03,444 --> 01:56:05,072
Give me your hand!

1460
01:56:39,314 --> 01:56:40,523
Go!

1461
01:59:06,169 --> 01:59:09,214
Did you forget about that
restraining order, Counselor?

1462
01:59:09,296 --> 01:59:11,632
You're well within 500 yards!

1463
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,516
Well, here we are, Counselor...

1464
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,226
...just two lawyers...

1465
01:59:22,393 --> 01:59:23,852
...working it out!

1466
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:39,452
I'm going to kill you!

1467
01:59:39,618 --> 01:59:42,538
You already sacrificed me, Counselor.

1468
02:00:28,251 --> 02:00:31,169
"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand

1469
02:00:31,378 --> 02:00:33,589
"Oh who will come and go with me

1470
02:00:34,256 --> 02:00:37,634
"I am bound for the promised land"

1471
02:02:39,756 --> 02:02:42,091
We never spoke about what happened...

1472
02:02:42,467 --> 02:02:44,469
...at least not to each other.

1473
02:02:45,554 --> 02:02:47,472
Fear, I suppose...

1474
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:51,267
...that to remember his name
or what he did...

1475
02:02:51,642 --> 02:02:54,229
...would mean letting him into our dreams.

1476
02:02:55,187 --> 02:02:58,525
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

1477
02:03:00,444 --> 02:03:03,905
Still, things won't ever be
the way they were before he came.

1478
02:03:04,614 --> 02:03:06,324
But that's all right...

1479
02:03:06,616 --> 02:03:10,579
...because if you hang onto the past,
you die a little every day.

1480
02:03:11,455 --> 02:03:12,872
And for myself...

1481
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:15,375
...I know I'd rather live.
