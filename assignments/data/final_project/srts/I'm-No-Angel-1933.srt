1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,299
Right this way, folks!

3
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:15,377
Gather round. That's right.
You gotta hear me.

4
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,219
All right. You will see a show of amazing...

5
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,261
stupendous and cataclysmic proportions.

6
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,256
Your two bits will do the work of a sawbuck.

7
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:26,782
From the inside, folks, you're gonna see,
right before your very eyes...

8
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:29,220
without the aid of cheaters or a microscope...

9
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,944
- Joe, the Turtle Boy.
- That's it, the picture.

10
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,664
Jail me, folks, if I ain't telling the truth.

11
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,901
He walks, eats and sleeps just like a turtle...

12
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,419
but talks the English language
as well as you and I.

13
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,224
<i>And shaves himself with a safety razor.</i>

14
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:45,696
<i>And as an added attraction folks,</i>
<i>Joe plays the zither.</i>

15
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,419
<i>Believe it or not, folks, he plays the zither.</i>

16
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,575
<i>That's what you'll see when you go inside.</i>

17
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,860
What did you get?
Not much.

18
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,855
Them birds have to work for a living.

19
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,343
These tickers look like a lot of heirlooms.
Look at them.

20
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,900
And that, folks, is only a sample
of what you're gonna see for the one price.

21
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:11,136
Now look, folks, you've got to give me
your undivided attention...

22
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,741
because I want you to hear
each and every word that I'm going to say.

23
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:19,782
Over there, Tira, the beautiful Tira!

24
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,021
Dancing, singing marvel of the age!

25
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,858
Supreme flower of feminine pulchritude!

26
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:28,415
The girl who discovered
you don't have to have feet to be a dancer.

27
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:31,702
Boys, just push right in there,
you're gonna have a better view.

28
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:34,618
All right, boys, the lumber. Drag it out!
Pull ahead, men!

29
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:17,143
If I wasn't a married man,
I could go for you, baby.

30
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,783
No wisecracks, now.

31
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:26,264
A penny for your thoughts.

32
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,295
Tira, boys! Tira!

33
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,057
Just look at those eyes.

34
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:37,104
I dig those eyes.

35
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:42,304
Boys, she can assume shapes
that will astonish a chiropractor!

36
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,821
<i>And next to her</i>
<i>a wiggling worm looks paralysed.</i>

37
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,702
Get the idea, boys?

38
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,902
I can say
without fear of contradiction...

39
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:55,014
that if Tira had played the town at the time...

40
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,016
Noah would have missed the boat.

41
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,777
You follow me?

42
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:02,296
Boys, with the right kind of encouragement...

43
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,182
she'll throw discretion to the winds...

44
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,415
and her hips
to the north, east, south and west.

45
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,463
It's the only show on earth
where the tickets are made of asbestos.

46
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:14,175
And now inside, Tira,
the girl who makes your dreams come true.

47
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,937
Step right up, men.

48
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,422
Does she do her stuff?
You bet she can do it.

49
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,064
Oh, mama!

50
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,782
I know just how you feel, honey.

51
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,977
- Is that elegant or is that elegant?
- Elegant.

52
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:15,974
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

53
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,784
<i>I've got the face of a saint</i>

54
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,618
<i>On the level, it ain't paint</i>

55
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,425
<i>Beware of these eyes</i>

56
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:29,062
<i>I'm a devil in disguise</i>

57
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,542
<i>And they call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

58
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,183
<i>Get over dirty</i>

59
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:37,302
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

60
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:18,856
<i>Just play a passionate strain</i>

61
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:21,903
<i>And I'll be low down again</i>

62
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,021
<i>It's fire and it's flame</i>

63
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:27,495
<i>So be careful of this dame</i>

64
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:31,021
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

65
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,982
<i>I got to scram now</i>

66
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,581
Am I making myself clear, boys?

67
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,214
Suckers.

68
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:57,224
Tomorrow night at the same time: Tira!

69
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,254
Tira, you're gonna be a good girl
and work them lions tonight, ain't you?

70
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:05,098
No, I'm gonna be a bad girl
and go home to bed.

71
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,301
- No.
- I'm tired from tossing my hips.

72
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:10,263
- I know, but...
- Besides the cat act's on too late, anyway.

73
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,939
I'll work them tomorrow night
if you put them on earlier.

74
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,255
Sometime you'll ask me
to do you a favour and I'll...

75
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:16,414
So what?

76
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:21,299
- Hello, honey.
- I've just been working on you.

77
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:22,898
Oh, yeah?

78
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,057
- What have you got to tell me tonight?
- I have your horoscope.

79
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,739
- I hope you got some good news in it.
- Good and bad.

80
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:30,617
Go ahead, I got my fingers crossed.

81
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,661
You were born in August.

82
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,703
- Yes, one of the hot months.
- It was on the 17th...

83
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,334
under the sign of Leo, the lion.

84
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:40,575
King of the beasts, huh?

85
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,414
Today is not lucky for you.

86
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,735
I can't complain. So far it's been perfect.

87
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,214
Tomorrow will be very lucky.

88
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,700
But tonight, be careful.

89
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,459
Something told me not to work
that lion act tonight.

90
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,103
You are very wise.

91
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:58,494
I profit by my experience.

92
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,936
Now listen, honey,
you just tell me about my future.

93
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,260
You see, I know all about my past.

94
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,894
You have a wonderful future.

95
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,579
I see a man in your life.

96
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,504
What, only one?

97
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:19,259
But this is one very particular man.

98
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,497
He is very wealthy. Enormously wealthy.

99
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:25,861
You mean a millionaire.
What does he look like?

100
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,263
I see he has brown eyes.

101
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,541
In fact, I see two men.

102
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,304
You don't mean twins?

103
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,180
No. Two different men.

104
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,981
In the near future I see a change.

105
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:45,137
What, a change of men?
Not yet.

106
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,944
<i>I see a change of position.</i>

107
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,983
Sitting or reclining?

108
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:54,656
But it's all left me.

109
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:58,461
I can't help you anymore tonight. I can't.

110
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,425
Thanks, Rajah.
It's all right, I'm in a hurry anyway.

111
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,814
- Give me my thing.
- Horoscope.

112
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,453
Keep this where you may
consult it frequently.

113
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:09,934
All right, I'll take it to bed with me.

114
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,418
What are you playing me the chill for
all of a sudden, baby?

115
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,097
Because I ain't exactly in the mood.

116
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,255
Seems like I can't put you
in the mood, lately.

117
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:19,664
I guess you're right.

118
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,735
Barton wants you to get in the cage
and wrestle them lions tonight.

119
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,894
Not tonight. I told Barton.

120
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,375
Tira, you've got to. The show is walking
on its heels in this town.

121
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,944
What's the rush?

122
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,019
You seem awful anxious to get somewhere.

123
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:40,382
- Pulling something funny, if you ask me.
- I ain't asking you.

124
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:41,944
I'm asking you.

125
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,016
What do you want to stay
in a hotel in town for?

126
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,573
Why don't you stay on the lot,
same as the rest of us?

127
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:48,542
'Cause I ain't the same as the rest of you.

128
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,934
I'm sick of people worrying about what I do.

129
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:57,783
I get about as much privacy around here
as a goldfish.

130
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,657
Getting high hat, huh?

131
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,895
What did you do? Got you a haircut
or have your ears moved down?

132
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,658
It's a wonder you noticed.

133
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,303
Miss Tira.
Come in, honey.

134
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,813
A gentleman gave me this note for you.

135
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,213
What's your name?

136
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,978
My name is Frederick, but they calls me Otto.

137
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:25,419
All right, honey,
you tell the gentleman it's okay.

138
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:26,574
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,215
- Who's the boyfriend?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

140
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:32,297
I tell you, you go mixing up with any guy
and I'll bust his jaw.

141
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:35,058
I'll break him in two, you hear?
I'll give him the works.

142
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,613
If you ain't careful,
you're liable to hurt somebody.

143
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,737
Take that as a warning.

144
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,259
You take it and bury it,
maybe it will grow lilies.

145
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,024
- I'll see you later.
- The later, the better.

146
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,179
Tira, can I come in?
Come on in.

147
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,855
See, I just felt I had to talk to somebody.

148
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,175
I'm in a rush, but go ahead and talk.

149
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,701
You look terrible. What's the matter?

150
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,345
Everything is the matter, with me anyhow.

151
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,177
- Barton again?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,943
That guy is a habit with you, honey.

153
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,300
Why don't you step out?
A change will do you good.

154
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,580
- That's what I'm doing.
- What about Slick?

155
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:12,453
He's all right. If he kept his hands
out of other people's pockets.

156
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,740
What is it gonna get me
hanging around him?

157
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,099
I got ideas.

158
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:21,214
Somewhere there's a guy with a million
waiting for a dame like me.

159
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,784
Rajah said so.

160
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:27,259
Tira, you always have such swell things.

161
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,336
How do you do it on your salary?

162
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,302
It's a gift, honey.

163
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,256
Them beads is pretty.

164
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:34,937
They are kind of pretty.

165
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,703
He gave me them. Genuine amber.

166
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,264
The beads, I mean.

167
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:45,697
And these here handkerchiefs,
genuine Madeira.

168
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,097
No, he gave me the pillows.

169
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,653
Here, here's the baby.
He gave me them.

170
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:57,743
And this here sailor,
he gave me this here jade set...

171
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,379
he got in Shanghai, genuine jade, he said.

172
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:03,779
Here.

173
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,858
Tira, they're beautiful.

174
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:09,617
- You like them?
- Yes.

175
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,538
Try them on. If they do something to you,
you can have them.

176
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,422
Thanks.
Don't mention it.

177
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:19,023
I'd like to stick around and show you
the rest of my stuff, but I got a heavy date.

178
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,143
I gotta be leaving you.

179
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,183
- Tira, how can I ever thank you?
- Don't.

180
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:27,256
Why, you look better already.

181
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:30,458
Say, you're a good-looking dame.

182
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:33,463
There is a lot of guys
that would go for you in a big way.

183
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,343
Always remember, honey, a good motto is:

184
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:39,462
"Take all you can get
and give as little as possible."

185
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,463
Don't forget, honey,
never let one man worry your mind.

186
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:45,218
Find them, fool them, forget them.
Thanks again.

187
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:47,614
Hello, how's the joints tonight?
Fine.

188
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,616
Swell, Tira.
Hello, Tira.

189
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,384
This is the first chance
I've had to talk to you.

190
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:55,975
- When are we going out again together?
- Almost anytime you say, Harry.

191
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,817
I got to see you more often.

192
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,022
- You know, I'm kind of crazy about you.
- Oh, yeah?

193
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,380
- Can't get you out of my mind.
- That's bad.

194
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:06,741
Better not be thinking about me
when you're up there in the flying rings.

195
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,941
- Something's liable to happen.
- Not a chance.

196
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,414
How about us going somewhere
after the show tonight?

197
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,063
Not tonight, I gotta see my aunt.

198
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,898
Tira, us fellows are worried
about Harry here.

199
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,704
He don't eat enough,
won't even sleep enough.

200
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,663
Love, you know, is bad for an acrobat.

201
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:24,618
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt him.

202
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,661
I only wanna feel his muscles.

203
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:28,858
Bye, Harry.

204
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:43,181
I never met anybody
just like you before. You're different.

205
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,984
Anything different always costs more
but it's worth it.

206
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:49,137
By the way, you married or single?

207
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,500
Married five times.
Five times.

208
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,819
Wedding bells must sound
like an alarm clock to you.

209
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,339
I don't' suppose
you believe in marriage, do you?

210
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,699
Only as a last resort.

211
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:01,536
What do you do for a living?

212
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,696
I'm sort of a politician.

213
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,981
I don't like work, either.

214
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,060
I like to get around and travel.

215
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,137
Believe me, I've been places and seen things.

216
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,136
I've been things and seen places.

217
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,341
That sort of evens us up, eh?

218
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:22,899
Sit down.

219
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,298
I didn't get your name.

220
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,145
I don't give my name to everybody,
but it's...

221
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,295
Don't tell me it's Smith.
No.

222
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:36,104
- Brown. Ernest Brown.
- That will do.

223
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,973
What colour are you eyes?
I don't know.

224
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,896
You like them?
Lovely.

225
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,177
Where did you say you are from?

226
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,904
Don't think I've said,
but I'm from Dallas, Texas.

227
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,464
Dallas, huh?

228
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:53,941
I see. Pardon me.

229
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,344
Dallas, huh?

230
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,421
There we are.

231
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:17,104
Dallas, huh?

232
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:34,180
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

233
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,938
Bet your life no one loves you
like that Dallas man.

234
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,743
<i>Kisses sweet like honey</i>

235
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:39,814
Oh, yeah?

236
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,260
<i>Smiles that big and sunny</i>

237
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:46,020
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

238
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,623
<i>Why, folks, he's got backbone</i>

239
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,538
<i>He's a Texas cyclone</i>

240
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,095
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

241
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:02,184
<i>Why, brother, he's a wild-horse trainer</i>

242
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,344
<i>With a special whip</i>

243
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:08,623
<i>Gals, you'll go insaner</i>

244
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,339
<i>When he gets you in his grip</i>

245
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:14,895
<i>Strong arms made for loving</i>

246
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:17,977
<i>Heat like from an oven</i>

247
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:21,819
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

248
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:44,141
You just put your heart and soul
in your dancing, don't you, honey?

249
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,814
You've certainly given me
the time of my life, baby.

250
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,499
Don't say "given,"
I don't like that word "given."

251
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,776
Do pretty well for yourself, don't you?

252
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,298
That's nothing.

253
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:07,779
Ever take a crack at show business?
That's one business I never tried.

254
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,776
You ought to do great in that racket.

255
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:13,221
In front of the tent, the big boss.
You mean with a cigar?

256
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:14,977
You catch on.

257
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,264
Maybe I can fix it up with Mr. Barton
to sell you an interest in the show.

258
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:22,462
Then I can take the leading lady out
all the time, huh?

259
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,694
That's the angle.

260
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,503
We'll talk that over later.

261
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,257
Remember your five wives.

262
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:31,098
You're the baby that can make me
forget them. Kiss Papa.

263
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,497
Give me a long one.

264
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:37,053
You ain't the only girl I've ever kissed.

265
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,659
You got a lot to learn even at that.

266
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,298
What do you mean
by busting in here like this?

267
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:51,301
What are you doing here with my wife?

268
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,660
Your wife?
He's lying, I ain't his wife.

269
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:56,418
You can't get away with this.
Listen, you're in a tough spot.

270
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:59,417
Wait, let me get this straight.
You got it straight.

271
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,542
It's gonna be just too bad for you
when I call the cops.

272
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,777
You can't shake this guy down.

273
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:11,823
Here I am about to promote him
for dough, you come in to spoil it.

274
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:13,179
Don't give me that.

275
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:17,258
I get it. You all don't have to talk it over.
I reckon I'm leaving right now.

276
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:21,105
No, you ain't.
There's a business matter to settle first.

277
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,743
I won't give you a nickel.

278
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:26,615
You picked the wrong one.
I got connections in this town.

279
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:28,980
I'll see that you get
what's coming to you.

280
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:30,134
Now wait a minute.

281
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,178
I've laid out bigger chumps
than you, you mug.

282
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:44,375
- Now try and get out of this.
- You're in it with me.

283
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,416
As fast as you pick them up, I'll drop them.

284
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:49,815
Yeah? He ain't doing so good.
You better look him over.

285
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,622
- I think he's croaked.
- Ain't that nice.

286
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:01,617
I told you them barroom tricks of yours
will get us in trouble.

287
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:02,933
Come on, we gotta lam.

288
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:05,744
What? Leave him here in my place
for the cops to find?

289
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:08,259
I ain't taking any rap
for something you've done.

290
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,621
You like me to get sent up,
so you can have a free hand with the boys.

291
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,058
What a good time you'd have.

292
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:17,343
Listen, you may be tired of me,
but I ain't tired of you.

293
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:22,943
There ain't no time for that now.
Get him out of here.

294
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,936
Where am I gonna put a stiff in this joint?

295
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,461
Put him out in the hall.
They can't tell who did it then.

296
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,136
Hey, lay off.
Ain't you got no respect for the dead?

297
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,903
Come on, let's blow.

298
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,215
Is he dead?
He's coming around.

299
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:56,454
Got a crack on his head.

300
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:57,694
Wonder how.

301
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,138
Did you people hear any noise?

302
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,897
Sure, I heard a phonograph playing.

303
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,897
That's it. Take it easy, partner.
Got any idea who did this?

304
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,898
It's one of them circus fellows.

305
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:09,055
- Pick him out?
- Sure I can pick him.

306
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,943
- Say, I've been robbed!
- Are you sure?

307
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,141
I had a diamond that big
in a ring on my finger.

308
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:17,183
We'll get some of the boys to pick him up
if he ain't left town.

309
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:18,584
- Can you make the grade?
- Sure.

310
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:19,814
Right this way.

311
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:31,774
That's him.
Through the tent.

312
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,776
Move, boys.
That's him.

313
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,537
<i>That's him, men, hurry up.</i>

314
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:37,942
<i>There he goes. Don't let him get away.</i>

315
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>Catch him, men.</i>

316
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:42,262
You're not going to pull that on me.

317
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:43,824
Help!

318
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,136
None of that. Don't start no riot.

319
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:49,500
- That's him.
- Go ahead, frisk him.

320
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:57,540
Come on.

321
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,263
That's it.
You sure?

322
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:01,495
I can prove it.
Take him along.

323
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:04,941
- But it's mine.
- It's evidence, give it here. Come on.

324
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,781
- Our phone working?
- Yeah.

325
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,093
Thanks.

326
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,457
- Hello. Give me long distance.
- Long distance?

327
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:25,661
- Ain't you never heard of it?
- Anything wrong?

328
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:29,420
Cops picked up Slick for knocking over
a guy and lifting his diamond ring.

329
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,860
He pulled that job here?
Don't worry.

330
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,901
You're safe. It's me that they...

331
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,816
Hello. Long distance?

332
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:38,062
I want to talk to Benny Pinkowitz.

333
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:42,377
New York City. I don't know. He lives
around 88th Street and Riverside Drive.

334
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:45,858
Pinkowitz.

335
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,263
Pinkowitz, I said.

336
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,261
All right, I'll spell it for you.

337
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:55,095
"P" like in pansy.

338
00:22:56,345 --> 00:23:00,384
I- N-K-O-W...

339
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,417
"W" like in witch.

340
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:04,583
No, witch!

341
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:06,822
Dame misunderstood me.

342
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,819
I- T...

343
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,898
"T" like in tomato.

344
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:13,933
"Z."

345
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,424
Put them all together, they spell "Pinkowitz."

346
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:19,575
All right, you'll ring me?

347
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,020
Okay.

348
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:22,618
Why are you calling that shyster?

349
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,821
He helped me beat one rap,
and he can do it again.

350
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,054
How're you mixed up in this?

351
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:27,294
Like an olive in a martini.

352
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:35,054
Hello.

353
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,738
That's service.

354
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:42,224
Hello, Benny?

355
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,704
Benny, this is Tira.

356
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:45,901
Hello, Tira.

357
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,985
It's all right. You didn't disturb me.

358
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:50,657
What is this time?

359
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,415
Can that be the truth?

360
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:58,225
All right, I'll catch the first train out.

361
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:00,375
Maybe for you, Tira, I can do something.

362
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:03,099
But as for Slick, I ain't so sure.

363
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:05,063
Say, have you got any money?

364
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:08,421
It will take a nice piece of change
to square up everything.

365
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:10,382
About myself, I ain't asking a nickel.

366
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:14,140
Don't worry, Benny. I'll have the money
when you get here. Only work fast.

367
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:17,103
Leave it to me. Goodbye. See you later.

368
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:23,455
Hey, operator, listen...

369
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,703
I don't accept reverse charges. Yeah.

370
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,822
Bill, you gotta let me have some dough.

371
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,941
You're asking favours of me now?

372
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:34,585
All right, you win. Give me a light.

373
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,862
If you'd been nicer to me
and worked the way I wanted you to...

374
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,378
why then...

375
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:43,057
It's either one thing or the other.

376
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:45,898
You fix me up with dough
or I gotta get out of town.

377
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,055
If Slick goes up,
he's gonna drag me with him.

378
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:51,217
<i>I want the dough,</i>
<i>and I'll pay you back as soon as I can.</i>

379
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:54,103
<i>I wanna help around here.</i>

380
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,938
I'm willing to do my share,
more than my share.

381
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,300
I'll work them cats
like they've never been worked.

382
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:02,775
If it'll make you happy,
I'll even stick my head in the big cat's mouth.

383
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:04,423
Think it over.

384
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:08,895
She'll stick her head in the big cat's mouth?

385
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,383
This is big. If she'll do that,
your fortune's as good as made.

386
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,695
The Big Show would grab that act
in a minute.

387
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:18,583
They've been all season
looking for an attraction like that.

388
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:21,702
They've been wanting something big.
This is it. Can't you see it?

389
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:25,334
The 24 sheets, "Dame Sticks
Her Beautiful Head in a Lion's Mouth."

390
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:28,497
The jaws of death! I mean, it's stupendous!

391
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:32,339
<i>Don't you realise you'd be a chump</i>
<i>not to cash in on it? Give yourself a break.</i>

392
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:36,498
<i>If I can't sell that act to the Big Show</i>
<i>in 10 minutes, my name ain't Flea Madigan.</i>

393
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,974
Tell them we can handle them cats
like nobody else.

394
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,262
She's safer in that cage than in bed.
I don't doubt it.

395
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:49,821
- Tira, I've changed my mind.
- Does it work any better?

396
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,743
I've got your money.
It's a drop in the bucket to what you'll get.

397
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:55,975
There is a Santa Claus,
but why the great joy?

398
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:59,421
We can sell the act to the Big Show.
That was a great idea you got.

399
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:02,417
- What idea was that?
- Sticking your head in the lion's mouth!

400
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,780
Who's sticking whose head in whose mouth?

401
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:09,214
You! It's marvellous, it's stupendous!
It's lousy.

402
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:12,701
You can't back out on me.
What do you think I am, screwy?

403
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:14,662
Sticking my head in a lion's mouth.

404
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,656
Don't make me laugh, I ain't in the mood.

405
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,975
He'll let you stick your hand in,
why not your head?

406
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,943
You're crazy if you don't grab this chance.
It means a fortune.

407
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:25,540
Think of it, all the dough you can use!
What is the proposition?

408
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,901
The Big Show, playing big cities.
Your name in 1,000-watt Mazdas.

409
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:31,863
<i>No more worrying, no more doubling,</i>
<i>all the clothes you want.</i>

410
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:34,254
What good will clothes do me
without a head?

411
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:38,782
It's a cinch for you, Tira.
Big Boy will never hurt you.

412
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,254
He's young, you'll never have to use
another cat.

413
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,381
The Big Show, playing in all the big cities.

414
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:45,660
The silk hats, the Rolls-Royce cars...

415
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:48,259
the clothes, the jewels, the smart money.

416
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,540
Meeting the swells, huh?

417
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:53,416
Boys, I think you got me sold.

418
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,456
The only trouble with a trick like that...

419
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:58,457
if it don't work the first time,
you don't get a second chance.

420
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,456
- How much dough you got?
- A couple of grand.

421
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:01,864
Let's have it.

422
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:07,017
I may need more later.
Here, sign.

423
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,177
What's the matter, don't you trust me?

424
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,574
I wouldn't trust my own mother,
you know that.

425
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:21,063
I'll hop that first plane
in the morning and I'll...

426
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,778
Joe, open up this cage. I'm going in.

427
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:46,060
All right.

428
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:51,301
Now listen, honey, there's a little something
I wanna talk over with you.

429
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:53,023
Now this is what you got to do.

430
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:37,297
- When does this lion tamer appear?
- Few minutes.

431
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:40,822
- 9:45, to be exact.
- How do you know?

432
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,533
Why, it's here on the programme.

433
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:58,060
Ladies and gentlemen...

434
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:01,662
I take great pleasure in introducing to you...

435
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:04,659
Tira, the million-dollar beauty!

436
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,704
You see her?

437
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:40,179
She is something special, isn't she?

438
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:42,654
I'll say, she's fascinating.

439
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,903
Where were you last night?

440
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:19,453
Give me a peek.

441
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,182
Come on, talk to me.

442
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:29,618
Come on, get up.

443
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,540
Come on, speak up for yourself.

444
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:40,584
What's the matter with you?
You gotta be sitting? Get up.

445
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,185
Yeah, you'll end up as a rug.

446
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:50,420
Come on, you're holding up the works,
you mug.

447
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:51,984
<i>Come on, get up there.</i>

448
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,738
Give us a peek.

449
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:06,178
Romeo, what's the matter with you?
Come on, get up there, that's it.

450
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,575
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

451
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:35,497
for the first time
since Nero threw the Christians to the lions...

452
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:40,504
you will see feminine beauty,
triumphant and unafraid.

453
00:32:40,745 --> 00:32:45,375
Miss Tira will defy death
by placing her head...

454
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:48,380
in the jaws of the king of beasts.

455
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:50,258
Miss Tira!

456
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:16,620
If them lions don't show some sense,
I'm going down and bite her myself.

457
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,659
Come on, handsome, say, "Ah."
Come on, big guy.

458
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,544
That's it.

459
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:31,254
Remember my contract, baby.

460
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:55,622
- That was great, wasn't it?
- I didn't see anything great about it.

461
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:58,173
Look here, I happen to know
her publicity man.

462
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,495
- How would you all like to go back...
- I'm for that.

463
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:01,654
Oh, no.

464
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:05,260
Let's do, Alicia. We don't care
about seeing the rest of the show, do we?

465
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,495
- No.
- And it'll be a lot of fun knowing her.

466
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:10,736
It's absurd to make such a fuss
over an ordinary circus performer.

467
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:13,385
- Are we going, or aren't we?
- We certainly are.

468
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:14,693
Well, let's go.

469
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:16,378
Very well.

470
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,457
I suppose I must bow
before the general enthusiasm.

471
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:26,493
Beulah, that's another performance
under my belt and I still got the face.

472
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,894
Bless you, child,
I hopes you always keeps it.

473
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,021
It's my fortune.

474
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:34,337
When I was born with this face,
it was the same as striking oil.

475
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:35,864
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:42,023
You sure do believe in that horoscope,
don't you, Miss Tira?

477
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,858
It tells me everything.
I wouldn't make a move without it.

478
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:48,418
Yes, indeed, Tira enjoys meeting people.

479
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,224
You'll find her a regular fellow.
She has to be in the mood.

480
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:54,980
That is, her work is very strenuous
and stars will be temperamental at times.

481
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:58,023
- Yes, so I've heard.
- Yes.

482
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,220
Excuse me just a moment.

483
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:02,938
See who that is.

484
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:07,823
Evening, Mr. Madigan.
May I see Miss Tira, please?

485
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,894
Yes, sir.

486
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,338
Come in, Flea.

487
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,698
- Are you in the mood?
- For what?

488
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:13,934
Silk hats.

489
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:16,737
I can get that way.

490
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:18,864
Okay, Beulah.

491
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:22,056
Step right in, please.
Thank you.

492
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:25,217
Just make yourself right at home.
Miss Tira'll be out directly.

493
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,535
That's nice. Appreciate it.
Thank you.

494
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,503
Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher, Mr. And Mrs. Bond.

495
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:33,145
How do you do?
Mr. Lawrence and Miss Hatton.

496
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:34,977
Pleased to meet you, won't you sit down?

497
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,054
Thank you.

498
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,340
Won't you sit down?

499
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:42,700
If you don't mind,
I'd rather wait in the lounge.

500
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:44,503
Pleased to have met you, anyway.

501
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,501
Now, let's see, where were we?

502
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:57,260
I was about to say, we really came back
to tell you what a thrill you gave us.

503
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:00,337
Thank you, I'm glad you liked my act.
It is kind of unusual.

504
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:04,384
I don't see how you get up enough courage
to thrust your head in that beast's mouth.

505
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:06,183
I often wonder myself.

506
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,097
It seems terribly dangerous.

507
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:11,382
It is, that's why I have to carry a rod,
I mean a gun.

508
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:12,784
I had to shoot a lion once.

509
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,821
Really, was he mad?

510
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:17,300
He wasn't exactly pleased about it.

511
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:20,460
Would you be so good
as to autograph my programme?

512
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,534
Love to.

513
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,059
I should think
you dread every new performance.

514
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,982
It is kind of wearing on the nerves.

515
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:28,420
Of course, I don't intend to do this
all my life.

516
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:29,858
- Thanks.
- And mine?

517
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:35,294
I don't believe after all this excitement,
that you'd enjoy being idle.

518
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:37,177
I'll be doing something.

519
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:41,618
Say, I've got a great idea.
Why don't you have supper with us?

520
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,138
We'd love to have you.

521
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:45,420
Thanks, but I've previous engagements.

522
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:46,540
That's too bad.

523
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,423
- It's been such a great pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

524
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:52,013
Permit me to say,
I think you're perfectly wonderful.

525
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:54,460
Coming from a woman,
that's a big compliment.

526
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:56,300
Delighted.

527
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:58,615
It's been charming to meet you lovely people.

528
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:01,265
Have a lovely evening.
Good night.

529
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:09,022
Anyway, you've been awfully kind.
I'll never forget you.

530
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:10,663
No one ever does.

531
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:13,143
- Good night.
- Good night.

532
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,737
Swell person, isn't she?

533
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,178
I'm so glad we met her.

534
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:20,495
How about taking a look at the lion
she works with?

535
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:23,258
Good idea.
We'll wait for Alicia.

536
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:25,939
Yes. We'll join you later.
Until then.

537
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:28,255
Don't be long.
All right.

538
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:34,335
Beulah, remind me to tell Flea Madigan
to get that blue book in here...

539
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,735
with the 400 in it. So I'll know who's who
and what's what in this town.

540
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,258
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,577
Mr. Lawrence, huh?

542
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:46,336
Did you have a nice visit
with your lion tamer?

543
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:49,497
Alicia, she's marvellous.
You really should've stayed.

544
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,462
- Such good fun.
- Nonsense.

545
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:54,742
I can't see why everybody's
so absolutely gaga about her.

546
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,975
<i>She's obviously a person</i>
<i>of the commonest sort.</i>

547
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,293
Not at all.

548
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,660
Of course,
she would impress the men.

549
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:05,063
<i>They all have low minds. And she's certainly</i>
<i>low enough to appeal to them.</i>

550
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:06,817
Alicia, how can you say that?

551
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:10,215
We all have a right
to our own opinion and I think she's cruel...

552
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,897
and a very ill-bred person.

553
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,698
I've never been so...

554
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:19,821
I must get out of this place before I scream.

555
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:23,582
Can you imagine that broad
discussing me in that manner?

556
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:27,100
Say, I like them brocades.

557
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:29,859
- Order me six more pair in the morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

558
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:40,060
- Is you in to anyone else?
- I'm meeting all comers tonight.

559
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,664
Sorry, I believe I left my cane inside.

560
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:52,298
He says he left his cane.
Come in, Mr. Lawrence. Let's find it.

561
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,939
It isn't necessary, I know right where I left it.

562
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:58,301
- You got a good memory.
- I ought to, since I left it here on purpose.

563
00:38:58,425 --> 00:39:01,098
You mean you planted that stick?
Sure.

564
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,065
Had to find a way to see you alone.

565
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,463
I've seen your show three times
and I think you're wonderful.

566
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,935
- You're dazzling, beautiful, gorgeous...
- Wait a minute, take it slower.

567
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:15,019
What I mean is, let's get better acquainted.

568
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:18,934
You know, we can have a lot of fun together.
You'll like me when you know me.

569
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,174
I'm not half bad.

570
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:23,860
If you're half the man I think you are,
you'll do.

571
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,375
- I am.
- Oh, well.

572
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,104
Come on, let's go out tonight.
I'll ditch the crowd.

573
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:33,217
- I told you I have a previous engagement.
- Break it.

574
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,935
- You'll never regret it.
- No.

575
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:39,697
I'd love to, but I've got to meet my aunt.

576
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:42,255
These relatives are a nuisance at times.

577
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:45,178
What about tomorrow?
For breakfast, lunch, dinner, anything.

578
00:39:45,265 --> 00:39:47,017
Let me see.

579
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,014
Breakfast I have in bed, so that's out.

580
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:53,258
I don't eat lunch, and dinner...

581
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:55,820
We'll make it supper tomorrow night.

582
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,101
That's a date, then we'll go out.

583
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:00,775
I like sophisticated men to take me out.

584
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,060
I'm not really sophisticated.

585
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:06,580
You're not really out yet, either.

586
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:14,218
You got me.

587
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:16,698
Have I?

588
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,821
I guess I'd better be going
before they come in here and get me.

589
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,135
- Tomorrow night, then.
- That's the night.

590
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:28,617
Beulah, bring me my horoscope.

591
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:31,094
- Here it is.
- That's service.

592
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:33,176
That man sure is crazy about you, ain't he?

593
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,382
Crazy about me?
The guy's a pushover for me.

594
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:50,695
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence.
That will be delivered to Miss Tira today.

595
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,573
We will deliver the card to Miss Tira
on Wednesday.

596
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:03,022
All right, Miss Tira,
Mr. Lawrence has arranged for the account.

597
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,380
Yeah? Now let me see.

598
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,223
My, oh, my! Look at that.

599
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,544
<i>I always love to be in bright lights</i>

600
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,895
<i>My streets are paved with gold</i>

601
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,860
<i>I found myself a new kind of man</i>

602
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:23,934
Sing it, honey.

603
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,344
<i>He's mine to have and hold</i>

604
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:26,460
And how.

605
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,820
<i>I'm in my glory when he's around</i>

606
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:29,940
Yes, ma'am.

607
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,255
<i>Found a new way to go to town</i>

608
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:38,981
- Miss Tira, you got something.
- Something not bad, huh?

609
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:40,134
Not bad?

610
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,695
I've never seen such presents as this here
Mr. Kirk Lawrence done give you.

611
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:46,504
You sure skinned him pretty.
You only knowed him a week.

612
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:48,337
Yeah, but what a week!

613
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:51,781
He's crazy about you, same as all the rest.

614
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:53,981
I don't see how any man
could help loving you.

615
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:56,579
I don't give them any help,
they do it themselves.

616
00:42:57,105 --> 00:43:00,222
You do keep me busy
keeping track of your gentleman friends.

617
00:43:00,305 --> 00:43:02,102
I want to make it easy for you, Beulah...

618
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:04,904
I'm thinking about putting in a filing system.

619
00:43:05,385 --> 00:43:06,500
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,940
Men don't mean a thing to me.

621
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,856
Be careful with that million-dollar foot.

622
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:14,062
I don't know, but me and men
do pretty well together.

623
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:16,102
What kind of men do you like, Libby?

624
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,460
I'm just crazy about dark men.

625
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:22,424
Dark men?
You ought to have a big time in Africa.

626
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:24,416
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,742
Don't get those nails too short,
or they'll think I bite them.

628
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:32,182
Miss Tira, I've been under the impression
you is a one-man woman.

629
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:34,261
I am, one man at a time.

630
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:36,584
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

631
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:38,462
Fetch me that importation.

632
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:40,024
You mean this one?

633
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:42,905
Yes, that Parisian one.
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,823
<i>I play to win the game of romance</i>

635
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:56,698
<i>With high cards in my hands</i>

636
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:59,618
<i>But I've been trumped by an ace of hearts</i>

637
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:02,173
<i>That feeling's oh, so grand</i>

638
00:44:02,745 --> 00:44:05,782
<i>Give me my parasols and fancy gowns</i>

639
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:07,981
<i>I found a new way to go to town</i>

640
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,100
<i>I'm high</i>

641
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:10,220
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:11,340
<i>I'm low</i>

643
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:12,744
<i>Takes a good man to break me</i>

644
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:13,814
Sure does.

645
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:15,020
<i>No man can shake me</i>

646
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:16,538
<i>Until I let him go</i>

647
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:18,499
<i>Oh de lum</i>

648
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:19,574
Come on.

649
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:31,783
Is it a flash or is it a flash?
That's beautiful.

650
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:34,504
I know it's beautiful,
but I'm asking you is it a flash?

651
00:44:34,585 --> 00:44:35,779
It's a flash, all right.

652
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:37,901
- Kind of daring, huh?
- Not for you, it ain't.

653
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:39,816
That's all I want to know.

654
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:44,578
If that's that house detective, tell him I'm...

655
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:47,014
I never will get used to this joint.

656
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:48,777
- Show the gentleman in.
- Yes, ma'am.

657
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:49,934
Get me my beads.

658
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:52,414
You mean that pretty necklace
you just had give to you?

659
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:54,939
Yeah, the necklace. I will say beads.

660
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:58,456
- Pretty, ain't it?
- I'll say it is.

661
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:00,297
I just wonder how much money that costs?

662
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,819
I couldn't tell you right now,
but I have an idea...

663
00:45:02,905 --> 00:45:06,136
It ain't no he, it's a she.
Says her name is Miss Hatton.

664
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:08,216
- Miss who?
- Miss Hatton.

665
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:13,257
- Pardon me.
- Yes, ma'am.

666
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:19,856
So it's you.

667
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:21,823
You know why I'm here.

668
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:24,658
Hardly. You see I'm a lion tamer,
not a mind reader.

669
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:28,175
Then it might refresh you to know
that I'm Kirk's fiancée.

670
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,136
Nothing refreshing about that.

671
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:33,697
- I want to know just what you intend to do.
- What do you mean?

672
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:35,582
You know you're making a fool of him.

673
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:39,260
He ain't any different than
when I first met him, not much.

674
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:42,781
Everyone knows we're engaged
and yet you're deliberately interfering.

675
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,378
I ain't interfering with nothing.

676
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:48,253
- If Kirk prefers my company to yours...
- No, he doesn't, he only imagines he does.

677
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,984
I'll admit the boy has got a great imagination.

678
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:54,383
It's perfectly obvious
what your intentions are.

679
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,819
<i>Kirk has lots of money...</i>

680
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:58,817
Wait a minute.
Whatever you're thinking, you're wrong.

681
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:02,295
I only like him like a brother.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

682
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,262
- You're a liar!
- Say, listen you...

683
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,381
a better dame than you
once called me a liar...

684
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:09,025
and they had a sew her up
in 12 different places.

685
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:12,063
You're lucky I'm a little more refined
than I used to be.

686
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:14,261
And if you were as much a lady as I am...

687
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:16,654
you'd get out of here before I get real sore.

688
00:46:16,745 --> 00:46:20,658
- You haven't a streak of decency in you.
- I don't show my good points to strangers.

689
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,856
I'll trouble you to scram.

690
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:28,139
Just a minute.

691
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:33,023
I realise there's only one thing
that will influence you to leave Kirk alone.

692
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:35,020
How much?

693
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,057
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:47,579
Peel me a grape.

695
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,576
I can't wait any longer.
You'd better go.

696
00:46:53,665 --> 00:46:56,702
- I'm not going to Texas. That's final.
- You're being ridiculous.

697
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:59,094
This mad infatuation of yours for this...

698
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,814
lion tamer, will ruin your life
and Alicia's, too.

699
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,418
Don't you worry about Alicia.

700
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:05,735
You seem to forget
that you're an engaged man.

701
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:08,214
Jack, it's no good arguing.
I'll handle my own affairs.

702
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,944
- You're gonna continue with this woman?
- Indefinitely.

703
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,663
- You're mad.
- Right.

704
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:27,057
Leave that where you found it.

705
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,457
Well, hello, baby.

706
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,978
Here I am.
So I see.

707
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:34,056
When'd did they open
the pearly gates for you?

708
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,624
Yesterday. Glad to see me?

709
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:37,263
Sure, don't I look it?

710
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:39,939
- And you ain't sore.
- Why should I be?

711
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,056
You've done the time, not me.

712
00:47:42,785 --> 00:47:44,298
How did you happen to come up here?

713
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:46,740
The show was laying off this week,
so I looks up Barton.

714
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:48,781
He tells me what a swell joint you got here.

715
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,699
You've done pretty nice for yourself.
From a tent to a penthouse.

716
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:58,382
Yeah, this is a great layout.

717
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:01,105
This is one place
you ain't laying out in, honey.

718
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:05,501
I guess that sort of means
I don't exactly fit in around here.

719
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:07,303
I wouldn't say that.

720
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:09,820
The whole trouble with you,
you got nervous fingers.

721
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,657
I'm all washed up with that.

722
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,895
What are you figuring on doing for a living?

723
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:17,978
I don't know. I'm sort of up against it.
I thought maybe you might...

724
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,703
Pulling the sob on me?

725
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:20,774
No, I...

726
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,093
I'll do something for you...

727
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:24,653
if you promise to keep your hands
in your own pockets.

728
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,259
- Baby, I'd promise you anything.
- But would you keep it?

729
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:30,178
- Do you want me to swear?
- Never mind, I can do that myself.

730
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:34,053
Listen, go see Barton. Tell him I said
to find something for you to do over there.

731
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,262
And here, take this.
But don't make a habit of it.

732
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:40,064
Get yourself some clothes
so you start looking normal again.

733
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,578
Say, you're a pal.

734
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:45,097
- You know there never was a dame like you.
- Forget that.

735
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:48,416
Okay, but I just want you to know
I'm still warm for you, baby.

736
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:51,815
- Maybe I'll be seeing you.
- Make it soon, will you?

737
00:48:52,025 --> 00:48:53,538
Get going.

738
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:58,135
That guy would show up now.

739
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:01,173
Excuse me.

740
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:10,576
- Miss Tira's apartment?
- Yes, sir.

741
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:14,135
Just say if she can spare the time,
Mr. Clayton would like to see her.

742
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:17,541
I will if I can remember it,
if not, I'll just say he's here.

743
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,378
Perhaps that will do as well.

744
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:23,219
Take the gentleman's hat and coat.
Thanks.

745
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:24,897
I hope I haven't disturbed you.

746
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,179
Not so far.

747
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,576
Anything I can do for you?

748
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:33,305
Yes, there is,
but first I better introduce myself.

749
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:36,138
That's not necessary, I know who you are.

750
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:38,256
I've heard Kirk speak of you.

751
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,017
Good, that simplifies matters.

752
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,221
It's on Kirk's account I'm here.

753
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:44,023
I see.

754
00:49:46,585 --> 00:49:49,338
Let's sit down and be comfortable about it.

755
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:55,420
I hope I can come right to the point.

756
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,741
About this situation between you and Kirk...

757
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:00,259
he's neglecting important business
on your account.

758
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:03,303
And there's Miss Hatton, his fiancée,
to be considered.

759
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,376
She's a novel twist.

760
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,534
Of course, I know you have no liking
for Miss Hatton.

761
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,458
She came in here, got nasty,
I had to put her in her place.

762
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:14,977
Yes, I heard you had
some slight misunderstanding.

763
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:17,823
Do you mind if I get personal?

764
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:20,783
Go right ahead.
I don't mind if you get familiar.

765
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:23,063
It's all in the family.

766
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:27,624
Well, then, do you really care for Kirk?
I mean, do you love him?

767
00:50:28,145 --> 00:50:30,978
I don't know. See, my horoscope says so.

768
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,977
I'm afraid I don't understand.

769
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:35,659
I'm afraid
I don't understand it myself sometimes.

770
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:39,775
You see, it describes a guy,
I mean, a man like Kirk.

771
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:42,017
Surely you're not being serious.

772
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,859
Why, I certainly am.
My whole life is ruled by astrology.

773
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:47,974
Well...

774
00:50:49,985 --> 00:50:51,816
What colour eyes have you got?

775
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,978
I don't know.

776
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:57,894
Fine.

777
00:50:58,145 --> 00:51:00,420
Well, as you were saying...

778
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,218
You're telling me simply because Kirk fits
some description in your horoscope...

779
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:09,422
that you'd deliberately break up things
between him and Miss Hatton?

780
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,655
Maybe it would be a good break for him.

781
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:15,021
Surely you wouldn't let personal dislike
destroy their engagement.

782
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,380
Unless, of course,
you have serious intentions.

783
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:19,023
What if I have?

784
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,662
I'm afraid that's impossible.

785
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:25,101
Listen, with me nothing is impossible.

786
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:27,253
That may be.

787
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:31,657
But I'm here to tell you, if you're thinking
of marrying Kirk, you better not count on it.

788
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:35,181
Kirk sent you up here with that line?
He doesn't know I'm here.

789
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:39,259
I get it. You figure the family honour
needs protecting.

790
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:43,374
A circus dame would be sort of
a red leaf on the family tree, is that it?

791
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:45,979
Please understand
that it's been difficult for me...

792
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:50,024
to come here and talk to you about what you
no doubt consider is none of my business.

793
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:51,777
That's all right, I don't care.

794
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:55,096
If someone's got something on their mind,
I like them to get it off.

795
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:59,174
- You're an unusual sort of person.
- I've been accused of that.

796
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:03,344
As a matter of fact, I'd much rather have
met you under pleasanter circumstances.

797
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:05,097
Same here, there's no hard feelings.

798
00:52:05,185 --> 00:52:08,336
Of course not. I shouldn't want you
to feel unfriendly toward me.

799
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,781
I shouldn't want you to get the impression
that I'm just an adventuress.

800
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,095
- I didn't think that.
- What did you think?

801
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:17,063
I had no definite idea
what you would be like.

802
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:18,863
I've seen newspaper pictures of you.

803
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,379
Yeah? Ever seen this one here?

804
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:23,577
There's one of my favourites.

805
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:28,577
- It looks just like you.
- It should, I posed for it.

806
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:31,703
- You like it?
- Yes.

807
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:32,979
You can have it.

808
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:35,861
No, thanks, I wouldn't want to deprive you...

809
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,142
It's all right, I get them by the hundreds,
frame and all.

810
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:40,983
Well, in that case...

811
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:43,101
Won't you stay? I'll ring for tea.

812
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,575
No, thanks, really, I must be going.
You've been wonderful.

813
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,694
You've been kind of wonderful yourself.

814
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:51,414
Thank you.

815
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,976
Now you'll consider all I've said
and try and bring Kirk to his senses.

816
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:05,983
I can't promise anything right now, but...

817
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:09,537
you have started a new train of thought
in my mind.

818
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,378
I'll think it over and let you know
what I decide.

819
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:15,537
- You'd be doing a fine thing.
- Yeah? Fine for who?

820
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,094
For all of us.

821
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:20,021
You're kind of unusual yourself.

822
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:22,216
I've been accused of that.

823
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:26,661
Now you can reach me there at any time.

824
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,339
And I want to thank you
for the way you received me.

825
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:31,859
And you can reach me there at any time.

826
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:35,620
You'll hear from me.

827
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:39,178
That will be fine.

828
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,823
You fascinate me. You'd better go.

829
00:53:45,545 --> 00:53:46,819
Good night.

830
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,456
Hello.
<i>Miss Tira calling.</i>

831
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:11,974
Good. Put her on.

832
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:14,703
Mr. Clayton?

833
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,945
I've been thinking over
everything you said and...

834
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,253
I've made my decision.

835
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:21,421
Good. I'm glad you made up
your mind quickly.

836
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:23,860
I'm very quick in a slow way.

837
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:28,582
You see I can't discuss it over the phone.

838
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,462
It's got a lot of angles to it.

839
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:32,581
You better come up and see me.

840
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:34,424
I'll be glad to.

841
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:37,417
In fact, I'll come over right away
if it's convenient for you.

842
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:39,097
Most convenient.

843
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:41,097
I'll tell you this much...

844
00:54:41,185 --> 00:54:43,653
you're gonna like what I got in mind.

845
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:46,699
I'll be ready.

846
00:54:47,185 --> 00:54:48,413
Goodbye.

847
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:17,017
- Hello, honey.
- Good evening, Miss Tira.

848
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,256
If anyone should call, I'm indisposed.

849
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:21,573
Yes, ma'am.

850
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,502
You know what I mean, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.

851
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:27,300
Come here, dear.

852
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:30,582
I haven't had you alone all evening
with all those people.

853
00:55:30,905 --> 00:55:32,702
My public.

854
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:36,220
Let me take a good look at you.

855
00:55:39,825 --> 00:55:41,781
You were wonderful tonight.

856
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:44,015
I'm always wonderful at night.

857
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:46,859
Yes, but tonight you were especially good.

858
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:48,742
When I'm good, I'm very good.

859
00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:50,053
But when I'm bad...

860
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:51,544
I'm better.

861
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:55,215
Don't go away, I'll be right back.

862
00:55:58,305 --> 00:56:01,183
<i>No one loves me</i>
<i>like that New York man</i>

863
00:56:01,265 --> 00:56:03,574
You must've had a good time,
you seem so happy.

864
00:56:03,665 --> 00:56:06,623
If I wasn't, you'd know it.
Get me another gown, Beulah.

865
00:56:06,705 --> 00:56:09,697
I've danced this one around all evening.
I gotta give it a rest.

866
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:10,900
Yes, ma'am. Which one?

867
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:12,737
- That lucky one.
- Yes, ma'am.

868
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:50,013
- That guy's got rhythm, eh?
- Yes, I know what you means.

869
00:57:01,745 --> 00:57:04,976
Bring out a couple of drinks
and then you two dames can retire.

870
00:57:05,065 --> 00:57:07,021
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

871
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:08,373
Open up that door.

872
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,543
Here goes my big moment.

873
00:57:18,825 --> 00:57:21,498
Don't stop, honey, you put me in the mood.

874
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:24,618
It's good to be here alone with you, dear.

875
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,343
I kind of like it, too.

876
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:30,025
The only thing I've got to be jealous.

877
00:57:30,105 --> 00:57:33,700
- Of course, if I could only trust you.
- You can, hundreds have.

878
00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:38,257
Do you know I'm mad about you?

879
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:41,223
I could tell you'd be, the first time I saw you.

880
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:44,822
Say, I must be transparent.

881
00:57:44,905 --> 00:57:47,465
Honey, you're just wrapped in cellophane.

882
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,693
Come on, darling.

883
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,855
- Be serious.
- You want me to?

884
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:54,937
- Sure I do.
- All right, now I'm very serious.

885
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,784
I adore you.

886
00:57:59,265 --> 00:58:01,495
Yes, ma'am.

887
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,496
How am I doing, Beulah?

888
00:58:03,585 --> 00:58:06,053
You're doing fine, you're doing grand.

889
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:09,898
I'll do better when you are gone,
you rascal, you!

890
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:12,221
Yes, ma'am,
I know you will, ma'am.

891
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:20,663
Great gals, huh?

892
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:26,780
Honey, I wonder if you realise
just how much you mean to me.

893
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,303
- I've never been so happy in my life.
- You mean that?

894
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:32,742
I guess love is a wonderful thing.

895
00:58:32,825 --> 00:58:34,816
Yes, I've heard it highly praised.

896
00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:40,380
<i>No one could be</i>
<i>half as nice as you</i>

897
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:47,102
<i>What have you done to me</i>

898
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:51,494
<i>You're simply grand</i>

899
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:54,383
<i>You worked your spell on me</i>

900
00:58:55,305 --> 00:58:58,422
<i>So make your demand</i>

901
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:02,261
<i>I want you, I need you</i>

902
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:06,142
<i>Your love must be mine</i>
<i>oh, baby, baby</i>

903
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:11,539
<i>To have you would be paradise divine</i>

904
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:14,378
- Move over, honey, and don't stop.
- I'll never stop.

905
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:17,457
<i>Want you, need you</i>

906
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,580
<i>To call you my own</i>

907
00:59:21,665 --> 00:59:23,940
<i>To have you would be</i>

908
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:26,494
<i>paradise I know</i>

909
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:29,296
<i>Please won't you believe me</i>

910
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:32,183
Darling, you can never guess
how much I love you.

911
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:34,540
I'll never guess, you've got to you show me.

912
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:37,093
- Just give me the chance.
- You'll get it.

913
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:38,854
<i>To have you</i>

914
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:41,095
I could be your slave.

915
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,376
I guess that could be arranged.

916
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:47,702
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

917
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,019
<i>You're simply grand</i>

918
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:52,663
What have you done to me?

919
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:54,179
You ought to know.

920
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,256
<i>So make your demand</i>

921
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:02,741
<i>I want you, need you</i>

922
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:06,695
<i>Your love must be mine</i>
<i>oh, baby, baby</i>

923
01:00:07,225 --> 01:00:10,820
<i>To have you would be paradise</i>

924
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:13,777
What are you gonna do about it?

925
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:32,336
What's this in the paper
about you marrying this rich guy, Clayton?

926
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:35,337
If it's publicity it's great,
and if it ain't, it's no good.

927
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,104
I'm quitting the show.

928
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:39,904
- You're quitting?
- Yeah, I'm sick of this racket.

929
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,779
I found the right man, I'm gonna get married.

930
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:44,184
You can't quit.

931
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:47,457
- You got a five year contract with me.
- Yeah?

932
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,660
Did you ever read it?

933
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,498
It says for a good cause
you could give a two week's notice.

934
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:54,622
- I'm giving you that notice now.
- But you ain't got no good cause.

935
01:00:54,705 --> 01:00:56,855
Marriage is a good enough cause
for anything.

936
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,220
You can't do that to me
and get away with it.

937
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:00,294
No?

938
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,581
What's my picture doing by that skunk?

939
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:12,144
I figured it belonged there.

940
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:14,898
What do you mean?
Everybody used to call me "The Bull."

941
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:18,136
You may be the bull to them,
but you're just plain skunk to me.

942
01:01:21,305 --> 01:01:22,579
I got everything set.

943
01:01:22,665 --> 01:01:25,020
<i>You get to the apartment</i>
<i>and see everything's clear.</i>

944
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:26,220
All right.

945
01:01:26,305 --> 01:01:28,421
But suppose Tira gets back
before we spring it.

946
01:01:28,505 --> 01:01:29,938
I got the chauffer fixed...

947
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:32,459
so there'll be trouble with the car
on the road.

948
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:34,501
Now, get going. Every minute counts.

949
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:41,262
Can't you hurry and get that thing fixed,
I gotta get back.

950
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,301
I'm expecting Mr. Clayton at the apartment.

951
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:45,023
Doing the best I can, ma'am.

952
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,777
Your best is no good, try your worst.

953
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:47,854
Yes, ma'am.

954
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:50,861
Say, where are we?
I thought we were in Jersey.

955
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,264
We're in Jersey, ma'am.

956
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:55,098
You sure you didn't take
the wrong road and land in Brazil?

957
01:01:55,185 --> 01:01:56,220
No, ma'am.

958
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,094
Come on.

959
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,700
Yes, ma'am.

960
01:02:24,665 --> 01:02:25,654
Tira.

961
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:29,977
What do you want?

962
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:35,097
You're Clayton.

963
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,855
I know all about you and Tira.

964
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:39,464
But that's all finished.

965
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:43,458
I've been away, but I'm back again
and she ain't wanting no change.

966
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,934
We're going on just the same as before.

967
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:48,255
- Get it?
- No, I don't get it.

968
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,381
- Where's Miss Tira?
- She ain't here now.

969
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:52,854
She knew you was coming
and she didn't want to see you.

970
01:02:52,945 --> 01:02:54,458
What're you talking about?

971
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,015
She didn't like to tell you herself,
so I'm doing it for her.

972
01:02:58,105 --> 01:02:59,538
<i>Ain't that enough?</i>

973
01:03:01,065 --> 01:03:02,737
Yes, I guess that's enough.

974
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:11,017
This is the right thing to do, Jack.

975
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:14,256
With a woman of her type,
this would have happened sooner or later.

976
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:16,859
If you ask me, I think you're lucky.

977
01:03:16,945 --> 01:03:18,583
Maybe you are right.

978
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:23,498
Frank, get a messenger
and send that at once, will you?

979
01:03:23,585 --> 01:03:25,860
I'm gonna be out of town
for three or four weeks.

980
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:28,698
In the meantime, I'm out to all callers.
Everybody, understand?

981
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,423
Is that message for Miss Tira, too?

982
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,340
Yes.

983
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:35,656
But I understood
you were to be married this month.

984
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:37,943
We're both mistaken.

985
01:03:38,425 --> 01:03:39,653
Yes, sir.

986
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:44,625
<i>What have you done to me</i>

987
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:47,458
<i>You're simply grand</i>

988
01:03:47,705 --> 01:03:50,219
<i>You worked your spell on me</i>

989
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:52,899
<i>So make your demand</i>

990
01:03:53,145 --> 01:03:56,137
<i>I want you, I need you</i>

991
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,854
<i>Your love must be mine</i>

992
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:01,698
You sure gonna make a gorgeous bride.

993
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:04,260
I know I'm gonna make a nervous bride.

994
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,097
I ain't never done this before.

995
01:04:06,185 --> 01:04:08,221
Marriage is a new kind of racket for me.

996
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:10,741
I've been married four times.

997
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:14,260
You ought to do well
in the wholesale business.

998
01:04:16,705 --> 01:04:18,502
I don't wanna see anyone but Mr. Clayton.

999
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:19,779
Yes, ma'am.

1000
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:23,219
That Mr. Clayton is sure a wonderful man.

1001
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:24,938
I'll say he is.

1002
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:28,378
I never knew I could go for anyone
like I have for him.

1003
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:30,456
He made me feel like a different dame.

1004
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:32,695
I ain't just a "Sister Honky Tonk" no more.

1005
01:04:33,145 --> 01:04:34,737
You're a lady now.

1006
01:04:34,985 --> 01:04:35,974
Thank you.

1007
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,824
Some messenger gave me
this note to give you, Miss Tira.

1008
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:40,054
Yeah?

1009
01:04:48,945 --> 01:04:50,139
You can go.

1010
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,735
This is Miss Tira speaking.

1011
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:02,780
I'm sorry, madam, Mr. Clayton's gone away.

1012
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,379
Gone away? When is he expected back?

1013
01:05:05,465 --> 01:05:08,298
I couldn't say definitely
but I'm sure not for several weeks.

1014
01:05:08,385 --> 01:05:11,741
- Is that the only message he left for me?
- Yes, that's all.

1015
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:14,980
Thanks.

1016
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:23,738
Hello, Tira darling.
Benny.

1017
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,334
How are you?
You look so marvellous.

1018
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:30,657
Come right in, sit right down
and make yourself at home.

1019
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:34,778
Let me look
at that beautiful smile of yours.

1020
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:38,141
You know about me getting married?
Sure. Congratulations.

1021
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,374
Too late. It's all off.

1022
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:42,502
Sue the guy for breach of promise.
Certainly.

1023
01:05:42,665 --> 01:05:44,940
- The lowlife.
- No, he ain't, Benny.

1024
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:47,143
The first guy I ever really loved.

1025
01:05:47,305 --> 01:05:50,103
- I thought he loved me, too.
- What a tragedy.

1026
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,298
We start proceedings immediately.

1027
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:55,296
How much is he worth?
Millions.

1028
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,899
Millions? We sue him for damages.

1029
01:05:58,185 --> 01:05:59,413
I ain't damaged.

1030
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:03,024
I just want you to sue him
for breach of promise.

1031
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,457
I got all the proof you want, letters, wires,
newspaper stories, even my trousseau.

1032
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:10,013
For that trousseau alone we collect plenty.

1033
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:12,858
It's a cinch.
When do you want the case tried?

1034
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:14,419
Let me see.

1035
01:06:14,665 --> 01:06:16,542
I go on the road with the show and...

1036
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,458
I'll be back in a few months.

1037
01:06:18,785 --> 01:06:21,697
- Better start then.
- Easy. Got the case.

1038
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:25,460
Darling, you give me a few details
and I'll serve him with papers right away.

1039
01:06:25,545 --> 01:06:28,218
Okay. First, I'll tell you how I met the guy.

1040
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:32,101
But remember in anything I say
I ain't got any real animosity for him.

1041
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:33,538
Of course.

1042
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,817
- If I was a home girl, I'd be heartbroken.
- Yes.

1043
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:47,334
Miss Tira, I understand you've had
a rather colourful past.

1044
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:52,260
I gotta admit I've been the love interest
in more than one guy's life.

1045
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:57,101
I don't see what my past
has got to do with my present.

1046
01:06:57,425 --> 01:07:00,383
We shall show that
to the satisfaction of the court, I believe.

1047
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:03,140
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that you've been on...

1048
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:04,863
friendly terms with several men.

1049
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:07,784
All right, I'm a sweetheart of Sphigma Psi,
so what?

1050
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:18,815
You must answer questions directly, please.

1051
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:21,784
Pardon me, Judge.

1052
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:29,300
Proceed.

1053
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:31,421
Do you know a man named Wiley...

1054
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:33,496
generally called Slick?

1055
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:35,621
Yes, I know the... The gentleman.

1056
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:38,458
And you recall the man you see there?

1057
01:07:40,385 --> 01:07:43,297
If I'm not mistaken,
you mean that Dallas man.

1058
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:47,495
And you are also acquainted,
aren't you, with Mr. Kirk Lawrence?

1059
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,222
Yes, I had the pleasure.

1060
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:53,344
And no doubt you recall
those five gentlemen...

1061
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:56,144
seated in the first row
right inside the railing?

1062
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:59,535
<i>Mr. Blake, Mr. Larson, Mr. Willard...</i>

1063
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:03,815
Mr. Foster, Mr. Harris.

1064
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:08,899
I do recall their faces
but them ain't the names they gave me.

1065
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:18,338
Pardon me again, Judge.

1066
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:20,253
It's all right.

1067
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:22,184
That's all, Miss Tira.

1068
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,018
Does the plaintiff's attorney
wish any further questions?

1069
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,824
I would like to request recess
for about 10 minutes.

1070
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:30,294
Is that agreeable to the defence?
Perfectly.

1071
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:32,416
This court's adjourned for 10 minutes.

1072
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:43,495
Why did you admit
that you knew all these men?

1073
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,974
I do know them.
You don't want me to commit perjury?

1074
01:08:46,065 --> 01:08:48,977
Yes, why didn't you tell me
there was so many men in your life?

1075
01:08:49,065 --> 01:08:50,498
Why shouldn't I know guys?

1076
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,019
I've been around. I travel from coast to coast.

1077
01:08:53,105 --> 01:08:57,223
A dame like me can't make trips like that
without meeting any of the male population.

1078
01:08:57,305 --> 01:09:00,695
Listen to me, Tira.
You know me, I'm a smart lawyer.

1079
01:09:00,985 --> 01:09:03,818
Give me that much loophole
and I'm through it like an eel.

1080
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,624
With what all those guys,
all those riffraffs, pardon me...

1081
01:09:06,705 --> 01:09:09,856
going up to the judge and telling
all they know about you and them.

1082
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,175
- It's curtains for us.
- You mean we're finished?

1083
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:13,823
Yeah, sure, drop it.

1084
01:09:13,985 --> 01:09:15,100
You had enough publicity.

1085
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:18,814
What those guys are gonna tell the judge
won't read so nice in the newspapers.

1086
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,133
I ain't gonna drop it.

1087
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:22,944
Listen, Benny, have I a right
to question witnesses myself?

1088
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,140
Yeah, sure but...

1089
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,261
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- You don't mean it.

1090
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:30,704
Now Mr. Brown, just tell the jury
in your words, what took place.

1091
01:09:31,785 --> 01:09:34,583
I was watching her dance
and I seen her looking at me.

1092
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:38,819
I kind of looked back
and she flirted and made a date with me.

1093
01:09:39,865 --> 01:09:42,095
So, I took her out for a ride in my car...

1094
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:45,058
and she asked me up to her hotel room
where she was living.

1095
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:46,783
We had a couple of drinks...

1096
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,658
and she put on a phonograph record
and we danced.

1097
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,055
And while we was dancing, she kissed me.

1098
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:59,096
And how long were you
with Miss Tira in her hotel room?

1099
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:02,781
- Close to a couple hours, I should say.
- That's all, Mr. Brown.

1100
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:03,974
Cross-examine.

1101
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,775
My client begs
the permission of the court...

1102
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:08,742
to question the defence witness herself.

1103
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,815
It's a little unusual,
but quite within the plaintiff's right.

1104
01:10:12,985 --> 01:10:15,863
She may question the witnesses.
If you please...

1105
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,220
the court should warn
the jury not to be swayed...

1106
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,296
by any theatricalism by the plaintiff.

1107
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:24,219
The jury in weighing the evidence
will bear in mind the defence's warning.

1108
01:10:24,425 --> 01:10:25,494
<i>Proceed.</i>

1109
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,104
Lovely tie.

1110
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:35,464
Mr. Brown, aren't you the man
that had the five wives?

1111
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,254
Yeah.

1112
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:40,178
And you was married to one
when you were with me, wasn't you?

1113
01:10:40,265 --> 01:10:41,983
- Yes.
- Cheating.

1114
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,819
You made it sound nasty
the way you spoke about us two...

1115
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:46,657
being alone together in my place.

1116
01:10:46,745 --> 01:10:50,420
And you know nothing happened that
you couldn't tell your grandchildren about.

1117
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:51,540
Well, I...

1118
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:54,941
In other words, it was just
a harmless little social date, wasn't it?

1119
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:56,976
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm through with you.

1120
01:10:58,145 --> 01:10:59,260
How am I doing?

1121
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:03,544
Any further questions?

1122
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:07,135
You're excused, Mr. Brown. Next witness.

1123
01:11:07,545 --> 01:11:08,614
Mr. Kirk Lawrence.

1124
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:10,616
Mr. Kirk Lawrence, take the stand.

1125
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:12,457
Quiet, please.

1126
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:21,544
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth...

1127
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,422
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1128
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:25,063
I do.
Take the stand.

1129
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:27,864
Aren't you well-acquainted
with the plaintiff?

1130
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:30,505
- Yes.
- In fact, you were intimate friends.

1131
01:11:30,985 --> 01:11:31,974
Yes.

1132
01:11:32,065 --> 01:11:35,694
Isn't it true that you once seriously
contemplated asking her to marry you?

1133
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,134
Yes.

1134
01:11:37,265 --> 01:11:39,938
Now, I understand
that after knowing you only a week...

1135
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:43,574
the plaintiff accepted several thousand
dollars worth of gifts from you.

1136
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:45,542
Such as a diamond bracelet...

1137
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,695
Gowns, a fur coat...
That's correct.

1138
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:50,345
And almost immediately
after accepting these gifts...

1139
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:52,734
she became engaged to Mr. Clayton,
isn't that so?

1140
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,294
Yes.

1141
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:58,060
And after becoming engaged she refused
to talk to you, even on the telephone.

1142
01:11:58,225 --> 01:11:59,214
Yes.

1143
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:01,985
Mr. Clayton has more money
than you have, hasn't he?

1144
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,134
That's true.

1145
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:06,622
What construction did you place upon
this woman's treatment of you?

1146
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:10,262
In plain words, I felt she simply
played me for a good thing.

1147
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:11,704
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence.

1148
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:16,340
Your witness.

1149
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:27,581
You're not looking to get
those presents back, are you, Mr. Lawrence?

1150
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:28,859
No, of course not.

1151
01:12:29,105 --> 01:12:32,381
- I don't expect you to return them, anyway.
- You're right, I wouldn't.

1152
01:12:33,705 --> 01:12:37,823
You gave me those presents
because you liked me a little, didn't you?

1153
01:12:37,905 --> 01:12:39,099
Yes.

1154
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,897
I didn't ask you for them, did I?

1155
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,783
I don't regret giving them to you,
if that's what you mean.

1156
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,935
Thanks, I didn't think you did.

1157
01:12:46,065 --> 01:12:48,340
Now, you was engaged to marry a girl...

1158
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:51,383
just at the time you started
running around with me, wasn't you?

1159
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:52,500
Yes.

1160
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:55,019
And you know your fiancée
came up to me to see me...

1161
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,141
to ask me to break it off with you, don't you?

1162
01:12:57,225 --> 01:12:58,214
I heard so.

1163
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:00,865
All right, I broke it off.
So what are you crying about?

1164
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:07,063
Your Honour, this sort of questioning
is most irregular.

1165
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:09,978
The plaintiff, not being
a practicing attorney...

1166
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:12,181
may put her questions as best she can.

1167
01:13:12,265 --> 01:13:13,698
Thanks, Judge, you're regular.

1168
01:13:13,785 --> 01:13:15,855
I'm doing my best to be legitimate.

1169
01:13:15,945 --> 01:13:16,980
That's all with you.

1170
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,619
Any further questions?

1171
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:24,219
Defence is ready for the next witness.
Excused.

1172
01:13:24,305 --> 01:13:26,296
Proceed.
Miss Beulah Thorndyke.

1173
01:13:28,305 --> 01:13:31,502
They had nerve enough
to call my own maid to squeal on me?

1174
01:13:31,585 --> 01:13:33,735
You are Miss Tira's personal maid,
aren't you?

1175
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:36,419
I was, but I ain't sure now.

1176
01:13:36,665 --> 01:13:39,941
As her personal maid, it was your duty
to answer telephone calls...

1177
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:41,743
and admit visitors to the apartment?

1178
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,463
Yes, ma'am... Yes, sir.

1179
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:46,863
Miss Tira often had
gentlemen callers, didn't she?

1180
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:47,974
Quite some.

1181
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:50,898
During the time Miss Tira
and Mr. Clayton were engaged...

1182
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:52,543
did she have other men visitors?

1183
01:13:54,345 --> 01:13:55,539
Not that I recall.

1184
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,141
You have a very convenient memory.

1185
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,023
That's all. Cross-examine.

1186
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:06,816
Shadow, what are you doing here?
I don't know.

1187
01:14:07,105 --> 01:14:09,175
They done subpoenaed me.

1188
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,613
- Beulah, tell the boys the truth.
- Yes, ma'am.

1189
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:14,582
After Mr. Clayton and me became engaged...

1190
01:14:14,665 --> 01:14:16,815
did you ever hear me talk
about any other man...

1191
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:18,941
or did you ever see me with any other man...

1192
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:21,175
- outside of my manager, Mr. Barton?
- No, ma'am.

1193
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:24,143
Did you ever hear me make any cracks
about Mr. Clayton's money?

1194
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,944
- No, ma'am.
- Did you hear me talk about Mr. Clayton?

1195
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:28,174
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1196
01:14:29,185 --> 01:14:30,413
What did you hear me say?

1197
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:32,302
- You said...
- Just a minute.

1198
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:36,294
Tell the jury.

1199
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:38,694
- Is that all right with you, Judge?
- Yes.

1200
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,339
Proceed.

1201
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:44,464
You said that you never knew
you could love a man like you love him.

1202
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:47,778
I kind of forgot I said that.

1203
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:50,982
And you said you had fallen
so hard for him that it hurt.

1204
01:14:51,065 --> 01:14:52,544
Wait a minute.

1205
01:14:53,345 --> 01:14:55,017
Answer one question at a time.

1206
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:57,414
I just telling the truth like you told me to.

1207
01:14:57,505 --> 01:14:59,416
Yes, but you're telling too much of it.

1208
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:02,903
I ain't never seen nobody
so brokenhearted as you was...

1209
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:04,976
when you and Mr. Clayton done bust up.

1210
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,139
That's enough, Beulah.
You're ruining my character.

1211
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:12,055
I object, Your Honour.
This witness' testimony is entirely irrelevant.

1212
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:13,498
I move to strike it from record.

1213
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:14,574
Motion denied.

1214
01:15:14,665 --> 01:15:16,223
Any more questions?
No.

1215
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,421
You're excused. Next witness.

1216
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:20,297
Call Mr. Slick Wiley to the stand.

1217
01:15:20,465 --> 01:15:22,933
Mr. Wiley, Mr. Slick Wiley,
please take the stand.

1218
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:28,578
- Bob, do you have to question this man?
- Of course, Jack.

1219
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:31,259
He'll win our case for us.
She can't laugh him off.

1220
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:33,984
Don't mention the night
I found him at her apartment.

1221
01:15:34,065 --> 01:15:35,862
I've got to ask him about that.

1222
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:39,221
That's what I'm depending on.
I don't want you to mention it.

1223
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:41,899
All right, I'll keep it as clean as I can.

1224
01:15:44,705 --> 01:15:47,299
When he gets through with Slick,
we haven't got a chance.

1225
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:50,934
Mr. Wiley, you know the plaintiff,
Miss Tira, very well, do you not?

1226
01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:54,023
Sure, we've been like that.

1227
01:15:54,665 --> 01:15:56,337
During the time...

1228
01:15:56,545 --> 01:15:59,343
the plaintiff was engaged
to the defendant, Mr. Clayton...

1229
01:15:59,425 --> 01:16:00,778
were you friendly with her?

1230
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:03,023
Never better.

1231
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:07,462
Isn't it true the plaintiff used to give you
sums of money at times for your own use?

1232
01:16:07,545 --> 01:16:11,174
Yeah, sure. She was always a good
for anywhere from $10 to a C-note.

1233
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:12,414
Isn't it also a fact...

1234
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:15,577
that you kept personal belongings
in the plaintiff's apartment?

1235
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:19,578
<i>And that on at least once you were seen</i>
<i>in her apartment only partly dressed?</i>

1236
01:16:19,665 --> 01:16:21,383
You mean in pyjamas?
Yes.

1237
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:23,979
Yeah, I always kept two pair there.

1238
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:25,373
Silk ones.

1239
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:27,695
One green and one purple
with yellow stripes.

1240
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:33,779
Mr. Wiley,
did the plaintiff ever suggest to you...

1241
01:16:33,865 --> 01:16:37,096
her interest in the defendant
was principally because of his wealth?

1242
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:38,334
Yeah, sure.

1243
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:41,258
She always looked to hook
some guy with a lot of dough.

1244
01:16:41,425 --> 01:16:44,064
That's all, Mr. Wiley. Cross-examine.

1245
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,420
Where were you
on the night of June 7?

1246
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:54,658
I don't remember.

1247
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:59,057
All right, I'll give you a choice, where were
you any night last June, July, or August?

1248
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:02,181
Come on, make up your mind.

1249
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:03,814
In stir.

1250
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:06,100
That's it, speak up so they can hear you.

1251
01:17:06,185 --> 01:17:07,459
He was in stir.

1252
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:11,379
That means, in other words,
gentlemen of the jury, he was in jail.

1253
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:16,098
Tell the gentlemen how many other jails
you been in the last 10 years.

1254
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:18,697
I don't remember.

1255
01:17:19,505 --> 01:17:20,494
He can't remember.

1256
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:22,860
<i>And what's this</i>
<i>about you owning silk pyjamas?</i>

1257
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,379
<i>You know it's a lie.</i>

1258
01:17:24,585 --> 01:17:26,303
You forgot to tell these good people...

1259
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:29,218
the only time I gave you money
was when you got out of jail...

1260
01:17:29,305 --> 01:17:31,102
you were broke, and walking on your heels.

1261
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:32,300
You heel.

1262
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:36,053
As for you sitting in my apartment
in silk pyjamas...

1263
01:17:36,145 --> 01:17:38,454
you never sat around my apartment
in nothing.

1264
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:39,773
And you know it.

1265
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:42,777
Answer me, did you?

1266
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:44,938
Sure, I did.

1267
01:17:45,185 --> 01:17:47,824
- And I was seen there, too.
- Why you...

1268
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:49,454
You perjurer.

1269
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,775
I object to the witness
being harassed this way.

1270
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:53,617
Who's harassing who?

1271
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:57,180
I'm just asking for a square deal, that's all.

1272
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:59,984
I'm asking good, honest,
and intelligent people not to take...

1273
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:03,296
the word of an ex-convict
against a good, honest and innocent woman.

1274
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:05,023
I object, Your Honour.

1275
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:07,420
Objection overruled.
You're right, Judge.

1276
01:18:12,505 --> 01:18:13,654
There you are.

1277
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:15,815
She's got the jury and the judge
under her arm.

1278
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:17,941
They'll hand her the case on a silver platter.

1279
01:18:18,025 --> 01:18:19,902
- Don't be unfair.
- Unfair?

1280
01:18:19,985 --> 01:18:22,658
You've got so much money,
you don't mind losing this case.

1281
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,622
But my reputation means something to me.

1282
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:26,935
If ever there was a case I wanted to win,
this is it.

1283
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:29,778
I told you not to put the man on the stand
in the first place.

1284
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:32,015
You'll have to take stand and tell your story.

1285
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:33,857
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1286
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:37,142
If you feel that way about it,
why did you contest the case at all?

1287
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:41,376
I'm sorry I did.

1288
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,219
If any right-thinking man will believe
what a crook and a jailbird will say...

1289
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,422
then there's nothing I could say
that'll make any difference.

1290
01:18:49,545 --> 01:18:51,183
I'm through with this guy, Judge.

1291
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:53,616
Do you wish to question the witness further?

1292
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:56,822
Yes. I have a few questions
I should like to ask.

1293
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:59,140
- Mr. Wiley...
- Stop. Sit down.

1294
01:19:00,465 --> 01:19:02,535
That's enough. Call it off.

1295
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:06,061
- I'll settle for the amount asked.
- You're absolutely mad.

1296
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:09,465
I don't want it to go any further,
do you understand?

1297
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:11,743
All right, have it your own way.

1298
01:19:11,865 --> 01:19:15,221
If you want to make a fool of yourself
over this woman, I can't stop you.

1299
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:16,579
Don't try to.

1300
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:18,700
Your Honour...

1301
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:21,862
my client has requested me,
for some peculiar reason of his own...

1302
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:23,458
to cease contest of this suit.

1303
01:19:23,545 --> 01:19:26,013
He's prepared to settle
for the full amount of the case.

1304
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,300
How extraordinary.
I'll say it is.

1305
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:31,661
- What is this, Benny?
- Don't ask me, I'm paralysed.

1306
01:19:31,825 --> 01:19:33,144
Sounds like a trick.

1307
01:19:33,225 --> 01:19:36,820
Does the plaintiff accept this motion
as satisfaction of this suit?

1308
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,021
Okay, the plaintiff accepts it with pleasure.

1309
01:19:39,105 --> 01:19:41,335
In view of the agreement
between the parties...

1310
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:43,780
the jury is discharged with thanks.

1311
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:46,979
Case dismissed. Court's adjourned.

1312
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,576
I'm glad you won your case,
Miss Tira.

1313
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,104
That's our pleasure.

1314
01:19:54,945 --> 01:19:58,062
Wait a minute. Boys, now, take it easy.

1315
01:19:58,145 --> 01:20:00,784
I'll give you all the breaks in the worid
but don't crowd.

1316
01:20:00,865 --> 01:20:02,059
Pictures first.

1317
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:05,496
Miss Tira,
would you stand up?

1318
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:07,303
Of course, if it'll make you happy.

1319
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,296
Look this way, please.

1320
01:20:09,385 --> 01:20:11,580
Wait a minute boys, one at a time.
I'm not twins.

1321
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:14,663
Hold that pose, please.

1322
01:20:14,785 --> 01:20:16,457
That's it. All right.

1323
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,137
Hold for me, please.

1324
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:19,578
Thank you.

1325
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:23,580
- Will you answer a few questions, Miss Tira?
- Of course.

1326
01:20:23,705 --> 01:20:25,696
You've won the case.
What do you intend to do?

1327
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:27,457
Carry on the same as before.

1328
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:30,105
Why did you admit knowing
so many men in your life?

1329
01:20:30,505 --> 01:20:33,941
It's not the men in your life that counts,
it's the life in your men.

1330
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:36,336
Do you feel you've done right?

1331
01:20:36,425 --> 01:20:38,097
Show me a woman who can do better.

1332
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,143
You were right, Judge.

1333
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:47,100
- It was nice of you to come up.
- Thank you.

1334
01:20:47,185 --> 01:20:49,938
You've been charming, my dear.
Very charming.

1335
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,459
- I'm glad you found that out.
- Of course.

1336
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:54,297
Well, goodbye.

1337
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:57,221
I see you've that hand trouble, too, huh?

1338
01:20:58,705 --> 01:21:01,139
- Goodbye again.
- Goodbye.

1339
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,414
Hello?

1340
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:11,742
Juror Number 4.

1341
01:21:12,425 --> 01:21:14,256
Yes, I remember you.

1342
01:21:14,465 --> 01:21:16,774
You were the one with the nice, kind face.

1343
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:20,097
I know you were for me.

1344
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:26,740
I wanna thank you
for those beautiful flowers.

1345
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:28,060
They were lovely.

1346
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:31,424
And don't forget,
come up and see me sometime.

1347
01:21:32,505 --> 01:21:34,416
Mr. Clayton, how is you?

1348
01:21:36,265 --> 01:21:37,744
Yes.

1349
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,543
All right, goodbye.

1350
01:21:44,705 --> 01:21:48,618
You said things in the courtroom
that led me to believe you loved me.

1351
01:21:48,785 --> 01:21:50,935
That you still love me. Did you mean them?

1352
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:55,054
- What difference does it make now?
- All the difference in the worid.

1353
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:56,453
You didn't believe me before.

1354
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,582
Because I didn't understand
about Slick being up here that night.

1355
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:02,417
So that's it.

1356
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:06,420
I didn't understand it myself
till I found out it was all a big frame-up.

1357
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,097
To keep me from leaving the show.

1358
01:22:08,185 --> 01:22:10,904
Then let's forget the whole thing
and go on together.

1359
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:13,943
- You sure you want it that way?
- You know I do.

1360
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:15,219
Sit down.

1361
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:18,302
You're everything to me.

1362
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:21,698
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

1363
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:23,662
Bring me my jewel case.

1364
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:27,734
- You're more fascinating than ever.
- I get better as I go along.

1365
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:29,093
Here, Miss Tira.

1366
01:22:29,185 --> 01:22:30,743
Got something for you.

1367
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:34,573
I'm glad to know
it wasn't the money you wanted.

1368
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:37,816
You got a lot of other things
it takes to make a woman happy.

1369
01:22:39,785 --> 01:22:41,298
I'm crazy about you.

1370
01:22:41,385 --> 01:22:43,535
I did my best to make you that way.

1371
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:46,458
Look, darling, you need a rest, and so do I.

1372
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:49,975
- Let me take you away somewhere.
- Would you call that a rest?

1373
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:54,743
- What are you thinking about?
- The same thing you are.

1374
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:06,813
<i>Baby, I can warm you</i>
<i>with this love of mine</i>

1375
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:10,697
<i>I'm no ángel</i>

1376
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:14,780
<i>Oh, let me feel my fingers</i>
<i>running through your hair</i>

1377
01:23:15,425 --> 01:23:18,064
<i>I can give you kisses till you</i>

1378
01:23:19,305 --> 01:24:19,378
