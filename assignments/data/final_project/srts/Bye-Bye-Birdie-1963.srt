1
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:24,969
Bye, bye, Birdie

2
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:28,569
I'm gonna miss you so

3
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,889
Bye, bye, Birdie

4
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,729
Why'd ya have to go

5
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:38,489
Bye, bye

6
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:42,929
- No more sunshine
- Sunshine

7
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,529
- It's followed you away
- You away

8
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:50,689
I'll cry, Birdie

9
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:54,169
Till you're home to stay

10
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:58,169
I'll miss the way you smile
as though it's just for me

11
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:00,209
And each and every night

12
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,329
I'll write you faithfully

13
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,049
Bye, bye, Birdie

14
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,529
It's awful hard to bear

15
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,929
Bye, bye, Birdie

16
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,929
Guess I'll always care

17
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,929
Guess I'll always care

18
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,729
Guess I'll always care

19
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,969
Look! Look! Hey!

20
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,769
We love you, Conrad

21
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,449
Oh, yes, we do

22
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,089
We love you, Conrad

23
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,689
And we'll be true

24
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,609
When you're not near us

25
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,689
We're blue

26
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,249
We're blue

27
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:25,449
Oh, Conrad, we love you

28
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,609
This is John Daly reporting
with the CBS mobile unit...

29
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,049
in front ot
the nation's capitol...

30
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,689
bringing you on-the-spot coverage
of our current teenage crisis...

31
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:40,169
over the drafting
of Conrad Birdie.

32
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:43,969
Sociologists agree
that Birdie is a phenomenon.

33
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,809
For those few music lovers who have
never attended one of his concerts...

34
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,729
here are some news photos
tracing his meteoric rise.

35
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:36,089
And that... that is
our army's newest weapon.

36
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,649
Private Birdie reports
for his induction in ten days.

37
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,689
His income drops
from $2 million a year...

38
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,929
to $78 a month.

39
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,409
It could only happen in America.

40
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,129
Why?

41
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,969
Why did they have to dratt him?

42
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,609
Just when I tinally write a song
he's gonna do.

43
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,889
The title song
of his next picture.

44
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:04,689
"Mumbo Jumbo Gooey Gumbo."

45
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,529
Now there's no picture.
There's nothing.

46
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:17,969
Albert, I have your tinancial statement,
it you really want to hear it.

47
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:21,569
"Total assets: $312.08.

48
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:25,009
Liabilities: $4,030."

49
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,449
You...

50
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,609
Contidentially,
you're a fiscal tiasco.

51
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,569
Good-bye, Albert. It's a sad ending
to a long association.

52
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,489
Yeah. Oh, don't you want
to say good-bye to Pidge?

53
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,049
Almaelou's busted, Pidge. You better
get yourself another meal ticket.

54
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,769
In six years
I never sold one lousy song.

55
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,209
Maybe they weren't lousy enough.

56
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,369
I don't care
so much about myselt...

57
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,849
but I'm my mother's sole support.

58
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,929
I've wasted every cent
my father lett Mama...

59
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,969
It's not your tault. Your mother
wants you to be a songwriter.

60
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,249
You can make a good living
as a biochemist.

61
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,649
That's a wonderful profession,
but Mama wants...

62
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,809
Just because she was
once in vaudeville...

63
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,809
doesn't mean you
belong in show business.

64
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,129
Confidentially, I respect my mother,
but I do what I want.

65
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,769
Well, Mama's sensitive.
When I upset her, she faints.

66
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,729
Why, with your ideas, you can
make a tortune in chemistry.

67
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,169
Chemistry.

68
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,849
Chemistry. Chemistry?
You sound like Rosie.

69
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,809
- Where is she? Where's Rosie?
- Oh, she phoned.

70
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,169
She heard about Birdie being dratted.
She's going to see Ed Sullivan.

71
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,729
Sure, to get another job.
Oh, a fine secretary!

72
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,009
Why, we have been practically engaged,
just waiting tor an okay trom Mama.

73
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,729
Now when I hit bottom,
Rosie deserts me.

74
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:02,609
Quits betore my body's even warm.

75
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,569
Ed Sullivan!

76
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,329
Would you send in
Rosie DeLeon, please?

77
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:15,169
Is it yes, Mr. Sullivan?
It's just got to be yes.

78
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,769
- Rosie, it is yes.
- Oh, hallelujah!

79
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,129
Oh, I love you. Oh, that's marvelous.
Oh, I love you too! I'm so glad!

80
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,849
Miss DeLeon, I'd like you
to meet our producer, Bob Precht.

81
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:28,449
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- Well, it's my pleasure.

82
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,609
If you can overcome
your shyness, tell me...

83
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,209
what's our using Birdie
on the show got to do with you?

84
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,209
Let's face it,
I'm a scheming woman.

85
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,369
I have a promotion idea
that'll knock you out.

86
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,809
It you buy it,
I want a little tavor.

87
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,049
All right.
Let's try it on for size.

88
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,129
How'd you like a territic buildup
betore the show...

89
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,409
that'll have every TV set
tuned into you next Sunday?

90
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:51,489
We will have. After all,
we've got the Moscow Ballet and Birdie.

91
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,969
- This is bigger.
- Bigger?

92
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,049
Betore Conrad Birdie
goes into the army...

93
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,729
he bestows a farewell kiss
on all the swooning girls...

94
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,449
who worship him on your TV show.

95
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,009
Atter all, it's only an hour show,
and Birdie only gets four minutes.

96
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:06,689
He kisses them all symbolically.

97
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,649
- What'd you say?
- Symbolically.

98
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,969
- Actually, he'll only kiss one girl.
- He kisses only one girl?

99
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:14,529
Can't you see it? Birdie,
their idol, their leader...

100
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:17,089
kissing one tabulously
lucky teenage Tessie?

101
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,409
- Yeah! Yeah!
- It'll melt every bobby pin in America.

102
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,769
It's gigantic. The newspapers will eat
it up. Think of the advance publicity.

103
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,849
Get the Birdie's
fan club file right away.

104
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,089
- Get us a girl trom Ohio.
- Gotcha!

105
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,209
We'll do it from the outdoor theater,
Columbus, Ohio, right after the ballet.

106
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,369
- I'll get the girl.
- The network will handle the details.

107
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,409
And atter the kiss,
Birdie sings a big song.

108
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:40,689
- That's where Rosie gets her payoff.
- I don't get it.

109
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,489
- The song is "One Last Kiss."
- Never heard of it.

110
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,369
- Hasn't been written yet.
- Who is going to write this classic?

111
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,689
Oh, who else, but my tuture husband,
Mr. Albert F. Peterson?

112
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,769
Birdie's been wanting
to give Albert a break tor six years.

113
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,009
I know he'll use the song,
if you say so.

114
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,289
Any song will do even though it's
written by your ever-lovin' Albert.

115
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,569
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

116
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,729
With a plug like this, that song
will sell a million records.

117
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,129
- Man, what royalties!
- We can sure use the money.

118
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,849
Any day now Albert and I
will have another mouth to teed.

119
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,129
Rosie, you're not even married yet.

120
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,089
His mother! Bye.

121
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,209
Carmine, get me
the publicity department right away.

122
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,689
This batch will do. Get them
ready for mailing right away.

123
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,649
Oh, hi, Marge. I need
one of your fans trom Ohio.

124
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,889
You can have them all.
Try file number six.

125
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,529
Okay. Six, here we go.

126
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:34,169
I'm about to make
some gaga little goof a queen.

127
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,769
Hey, cute.

128
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:45,889
Long distance? I want Miss Kim McAfee,
Sweet Apple, 135, Sweet Apple, Ohio.

129
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,969
Marge, isn't it amazing what a woman
has to do to get a man to marry her?

130
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,889
You mean you doped
Albert's mother?

131
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:54,489
No, but if this doesn't work,
that's my next move.

132
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:57,329
What, Operator?
Oh, the line's busy.

133
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,289
Never mind. I'll try later.
Thank you.

134
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:04,449
Oh, Marge, right now there's a kid
named Kim McAtee in Sweet Apple, Ohio...

135
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,049
gabbing on the telephone.

136
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,129
Little does she realize
I'm about to make her immortal.

137
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,849
- Hello?
- Hello, Urse. This is Kim.

138
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,449
It I don't tell somebody,
I'm just gonna burst.

139
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,809
So, Ursula, you are
the very tirst to know.

140
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,729
I just got pinned
by Hugo Peabody.

141
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,169
Oh, no! Kim McAfee, you didn't!
You really got pinned?

142
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,049
You mean you and Hugo have
a permanent understanding?

143
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,649
Uh-huh. Oh,
it's Hugo and I forever.

144
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:41,369
Crazy! Crazy!

145
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,969
Tell me, Kim,
how do you absolutely feel...

146
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:48,809
in your deepest secret soul?

147
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,369
It's like...
It's like I've been reborn.

148
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:56,769
It's like all of my lite until
this very moment I was nothing.

149
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,489
Kim, I must use the phone.
I've got to call Grandma.

150
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,729
In a second, Mom.
Hey, listen, Ursula.

151
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,969
I'm gonna have to get off.
Where was I?

152
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,449
- You were nothing.
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,849
And now I'm alive, tultilled.

154
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,609
Now I know what
it means to be a woman.

155
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,769
It should only happen to me.

156
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,529
Kim, where did he pin you?

157
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,329
On the backseat. Oh, bless
that lovely yellow school bus.

158
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,209
- Kim, hurry, please.
- Hang up, so I can spread the word.

159
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,089
Okay, bye, Urse.

160
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:45,049
- Hi, Nancy
- Hi, Ursula

161
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,609
What's the story, morning glory
What's the tale, nightingale

162
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,249
Did you hear about Hugo and Kim

163
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,769
- Hi, Margie
- Hi, Alice

164
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,449
- What's the story, morning glory
- What's the word, hummingbird

165
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,449
Have you heard about Hugo and Kim

166
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,009
Did they really get pinned
Did she kiss him and cry

167
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,609
Did he pin the pin on
or was he too shy

168
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,529
- Well, I heard they got pinned
- Yeah, yeah

169
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,449
- I was hopin' they would
- Uh-huh

170
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,809
- They're livin' at last, goin' steady
- He's gone

171
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,369
Hello, Mr. Henkel

173
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,329

174
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,009

00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,729

179
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,969
- It won't last
- Not at all

180
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,889
- He's too thin
- She's too tall

181
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,449
Hello, Mrs. Miller
This is Harvey Johnson

185
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,409

- You'd get pinned if you could

186
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,329
- Lost your marbles

187
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,769
- Are you nutty

188
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,129
Hello, Mrs. Garfein

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,089
If ya gotta go

193
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,489
When they got ya hooked

194
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,409

What ya gonna do

195
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,489
- Well, I heard they got pinned
- Oh, man

196
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,449
- I was thinkin' they would
- Oh, man

197
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,849
Now they're livin' at last
Goin' steady for good

198
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,329
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

199
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,609
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

200
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,689
He's in love with Kim
Kim's in love with him

201
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,969
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

202
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,529
That's the way it should be

203
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,449
- Oh, yeah
- They'll be happy, I know

204
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,369
- Oh, yeah
- Goin' steady for me

205
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,809
- Oh, yeah
- That's the way it should go

206
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,049
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

207
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,769
Poor Pidge. He'll starve.

208
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,929
Here, Pidge. Here, Pidgie.
Here, boy.

209
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,209
Don't jump! Don't jump!
Albert, it's all right!

210
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:38,049
Everything's all right!
Come on back! Don't worry.

211
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,329
Honey, come on.

212
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,729
- Thank heavens I got here in time.
- You almost pushed me out.

213
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,969
It's all right.
I just came trom Ed Sullivan's otfice.

214
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,129
- Sullivan?
- Yes, Ed Sullivan.

215
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:53,209
Go to work for Sullivan. Leap from the
sinking ship while the house is on fire.

216
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,969
But hear this, Miss DeLeon.
I was loyal.

217
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,889
All the years I employed you, I never
looked tor a job behind your back.

218
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,609
- I went to Ed Sullivan's otfice...
- Don't explain.

219
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:05,249
You owe me nothing,
even though you were molded by me.

220
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,649
- Molded?
- Like Eliza Doolittle from Pygmalion.

221
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:11,649
- I was molded?
- What were you when I tound you?

222
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,289
Hostess at La Casa Enchilada
Taco and Tamale Shop.

223
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,809
Well, sorry I interrupted you.

224
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,609
A man of my ilk
does not commit suicide.

225
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,849
I've had just about enough
of your kind ot ilks too.

226
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,609
Suicide is for cowards.
I don't desert the woman I love.

227
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,929
Oh, Albert, I'm sorry.

228
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,129
- I should have known.
- Mama would never get over it.

229
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,689
Mama?

230
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,769
What's the matter?

231
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:56,049
I'm the prize dope ot all time...

232
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,329
thinking I could pry you away
from your mama's ever-lovin' tentacles.

233
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,009
I will thank you
to leave my mother out of this.

234
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,929
- Maybe she does influence me slightly.
- Slightly?

235
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:08,249
- She is old and frail.
- Which I will be, too, at this rate.

236
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,969
I don't blame you.
I was living in fantasy...

237
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,289
telling myselt you were serious.

238
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,849
Oh, Rosie, I was.

239
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,769
I am. In here.

240
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,009
I've thought and thought
about marrying you...

241
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,729
every day, a lot of nights too.

242
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,769
I've spent six years
on Project Albert.

243
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,929
Well, now I haven't got the right.

244
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,409
I can't otfer you security.

245
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,129
A wonderful girl like you...

246
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,609
you deserve more trom a husband
than just personality and good looks.

247
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:57,889
But I'll always love you, Rosie.

248
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:07,169
You'd better always
love me, you nut...

249
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,849
because you're stuck with me.

250
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,129
Now, you've always worried
about repaying your mother, right?

251
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,249
Well, trom now on,
she'll be set for lite.

252
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,369
She can sit around on her big tat trust
fund. We'll have our own little house...

253
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,609
I don't care what Sullivan pays you.
No woman is supporting Albert Peterson.

254
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,729
- You're not listening, darling.
- I am not a gigolo.

255
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:33,849
Will you get to that piano
and start composing?

256
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,449
- Mary, I want Kim McAtee, Ohio.
- I'm through composing.

257
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,449
I was always through,
but now I know it.

258
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,649
That's right. You're a biochemist,
but this is one song you can sell.

259
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,609
- Huh?
- Okay, call me back.

260
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,129
- As I was saying, huh?
- Gee, you're slow today.

261
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,649
Now, you are going to write
a song called "One Last Kiss."

262
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:53,249
Is this Albert's floor
or is it the one below?

263
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:57,329
"One Last Kiss." Now.

264
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,809
Oh, one last kiss
There never was such bliss

265
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,729
I love your dentifrice

266
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,529
- A little too clinical, I think.
- Yeah, you're right, honey. Let's see.

267
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,769
Mama? She's never been to the otfice
since she discovered canasta.

268
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,249
Well, now's the perfect time
to tell her about dissolving Almaelou.

269
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,329
Yeah.

270
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,569
- And about us.
- Yeah.

271
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,369
Sonny!

272
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,489
- Mama!
- Baby!

273
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:34,049
What a nice surprise, and you're
just in time tor some wondertul news.

274
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,129
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, son.

275
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,409
I just tainted in the subway.
That's all.

276
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,369
But I didn't tall down.
It was too crowded.

277
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,649
- I keep tellin' ya, take a taxi.
- Taxis?

278
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,649
Taxis are for my successful son.

279
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,609
A dirty crowded subway
is good enough for a mother.

280
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:52,089
Mother's nothin' nowadays.

281
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,289
- Who's that?
- Mommy, you know Rose DeLeon.

282
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:00,569
- And guess what.
- This is that pretty Rose DeLeon?

283
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:03,689
Oh, I don't believe it.

284
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,689
Rose, what happened to ya?

285
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,369
You had a fatal sickness
or somethin'?

286
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,369
It's nice to see you again.

287
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,209
Always on the job.
She's a credit to the firm.

288
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,529
Look at her, son.

289
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,969
I wonder some older man
hasn't snatched her away.

290
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,329
Personable matron.

291
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:26,009
- Speaking ot marriage.
- A wonderful institution.

292
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,049
Your poor father and I...
That was a marriage.

293
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,289
May he rest in peace.

294
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,009
Don't worry, Lou.

295
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,729
- Our only child is taking care ot me.
- Tell her.

296
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,329
He'd never do anything to break
my heart. What about marriage?

297
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,409
It it was good enough
for you and Papa, it's good enough...

298
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:44,969
In time. You're just a baby.

299
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,689
Hello. Yes, Operator.
I'll hold on.

300
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,809
And another thing, Mama,
I'm thinking of dissolving Almaelou.

301
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:58,489
Wait, Lou. I'm comin'.
I'll be right up there.

302
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,649
We can play canasta again.

303
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,009
Mama? Mama, forget it.
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,089
- You're sorry?
- Good-bye, sonny.

305
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,609
Take care of yourself.
Think of me on Mother's Day.

306
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,529
- Good-bye, Rosie.
- Good-bye, Mae.

307
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,009
Call me Mrs. Peterson.
Wear your rubbers.

308
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,809
That's right, Operator.
Miss Kim McAfee.

309
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,009
I'll tell her, Rosie, tonight.

310
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,129
It's entirely up to you, Albert.
The line is still busy?

311
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,889
Yes, Hugo.

312
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:34,369
Well, of course
I'll always wear it on everything.

313
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:38,289
Oh, except my gym blouse.
Miss Turgnisht won't allow it.

314
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,129
Tonight?
Well, I have no plans.

315
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,849
I think I can get out
till about 10:00.

316
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:46,809
Oh, you have to be in by 9:00.

317
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,009
Well, c'est la vie.

318
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,489
Until tonight then, mon amour.

319
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:52,969
Bye.

320
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,729
When you're a skinny child of 15

321
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,089
Wired with braces from ear to ear

322
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,569
You doubt that
you will ever be appealing

323
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:19,809
Then, hallelu jah, you are 16
and the braces disappear

324
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,369
And your skin is smooth and clear

325
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,409
And you have that happy grown-up

326
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,569
Female feeling

327
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,569
How lovely to be a woman

328
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:42,609
The wait was well worthwhile

329
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,729
How lovely to wear mascara

330
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:48,929
And smile a woman's smile

331
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,249
How lovely to have a figure

332
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:55,249
That's round instead of flat

333
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,449
Whenever you hear boys whistle

334
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,049
You're what they're whistling at

335
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:04,089
It's wonderful to feel

336
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,089
The way a woman feels

337
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:11,009
It gives you such a glow
just to know

338
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,569
You're wearing
lipstick and heels

339
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,569
How lovely to be a woman

340
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,569
And have one job to do

341
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:23,729
To pick out a boy
and train him

342
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,849
And then when you are through

343
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,929
You've made him
the man you want him

344
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,969
To be

345
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:36,409
How lovely to be a woman

346
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,849
Like me

347
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,889
How wonderful to know

348
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:45,049
The things a woman knows

349
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:48,649
How marvelous to wait
for a date

350
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,849
In simply beautiful clothes

351
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,129
How lovely to be a woman

352
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,329
And change from boys to men

353
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,409
To go to a fancy nightclub

354
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:04,689
And stay out after 10:00

355
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,809
How lovely to be so grown up

356
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,929
And free

357
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:19,409
Life's lovely
when you're a woman

358
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:25,089
Like me

359
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:43,649
Hello? Oh? Well,
hold on, Operator.

360
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,809
Kim, it's for you.
She says it's long distance.

361
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,969
- Thank you, Doris.
- Who could be calling Kim...

362
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,649
- Did you say "Doris"?
- It's the modern way, dear.

363
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,529
Makes mother and daughter
more like friends.

364
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:57,209
Harry, I think you took the news
about Hugo and I awtully well. Hello?

365
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,169
- She called you "Harry."
- Yeah.

366
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:02,529
- Yes, this is Miss Kim McAfee.
- Yesterday I was a mother.

367
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,249
- Today I'm a friend.
- Yes, I'll hold on.

368
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:09,129
Well, maybe you could call me Mom.
That's modern.

369
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:14,489
Times are changing. You go along
or else you're out ot it.

370
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,729
Harry, do you have a cigarette?
I've run out.

371
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:19,489
Oh, so have I.
How about my pipe?

372
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,929
- Hello?
- Hello?

373
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:23,969
- Kim McAfee? I have a great prize.
- Harry? Kids.

374
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,249
You have been selected from all
the teenagers in the United States...

375
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:31,129
to be kissed by Conrad Birdie on
The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night.

376
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,249
We'll be in touch. Good-bye!

377
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,209
Conrad Birdie?

378
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:40,209
To kiss me?

379
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:47,609
Mother!

380
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:50,409
- Mommy!
- Baby! What happened?

381
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,369
Conrad Birdie's
coming here to kiss me!

382
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,489
- Isn't that nice?
- You don't understand!

383
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,849
Conrad Birdie's coming
to Sweet Apple to kiss me!

384
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,249
Oh, Mommy!

385
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:05,049
I never thought I'd say it,
but God bless Conrad Birdie!

386
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:13,089
Conrad Birdie's
coming here to kiss me!

387
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:25,929
Now, listen. Now,
the absolute instant he appears...

388
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:28,769
now I'll introduce Kim to him.

389
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:33,009
Then we'll all recite our pledge
of everlasting loyalty.

390
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:35,409
The plane!
The plane's almost landed!

391
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,569
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

392
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:47,169
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

393
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:50,729
When you're not near us
we're blue

394
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,049
Oh, Conrad, we love you

395
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:57,769
We hate you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

396
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:01,489
We don't hate anyone
as much as you

397
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:05,089
Your singing makes us say, P.U.

398
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:08,449
Oh, Conrad, we hate you

399
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:12,289
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

400
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,689
We don't hate anyone
as much as you

401
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:19,489
When you're not near us
we're blue

402
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:25,609
- We love you
- We hate you

403
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,729
Hugo wants to talk to Kim.

404
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,969
That's if it's okay with Kim.

405
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,449
- Certainly, Hugo.
- Well, Kim...

406
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,569
Yes?

407
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,049
Hugo, what do you want?

408
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:58,169
Gee, Kim, the tellows
are makin' me do this.

409
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,769
But just the same, they're right.

410
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,929
Kim, you can't
go through with this.

411
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,089
Hugo, please be mature.

412
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:08,009
Doesn't gettin' pinned
mean anything these days?

413
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,329
It means everything.
It's sacred.

414
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,929
Well, then how can you let
another man kiss you and in public?

415
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,129
- I assure you I won't even feel it.
- Huh?

416
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,169
- I'm just a symbol.
- A symbol?

417
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,129
Don't you see?
This is bigger than us.

418
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:31,609
Why, all this publicity
for Sweet Apple.

419
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:34,209
Thousands of people
will move here.

420
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,569
We'll have
a population explosion.

421
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,129
And just think what this will do
for your father's undertaking business.

422
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,649
- Hey, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

423
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,969
But you really don't go
tor that Birdie creep, do you?

424
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,409
What do my eyes tell you?

425
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,129
No, you don't.
I can see you're all mine.

426
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:10,689
Forever...

427
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:13,129
starting right atter
The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday night.

428
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:18,529
Right atter The Ed Sullivan Show
on Sunday night.

429
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,889
Hey, we'll be late!

430
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,409
One, two, three!

431
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:25,809
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

432
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:29,169
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

433
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,969
When you're not near us
we're blue

434
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:41,609
Well, I told her otf, guys.

435
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,169
- She knows where I stand.
- But she's leaving.

436
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:47,849
- That's to make the population explode.
- Anyone tor the reception, kids?

437
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:51,449
Gee, Mr. Paisley, we think you're okay
even if you are the English teacher.

438
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,369
It should be
a tascinating experience.

439
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:56,049
- Yeah, but are you with them?
- "With them?"

440
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:58,769
Yeah, that Birdie creep...
He's poisoned our women.

441
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,609
It's bad enough the mayor's a fink,
but you, Mr. Paisley...

442
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:05,249
Well, you see, fellows, as a teacher
and a brand-new American citizen...

443
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,169
with an unquenchable thirst
tor knowledge...

444
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:11,409
I feel I should witness this
unique sociological phenomenon, hmm?

445
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:16,649
Yeah, guys, suppose
I do let Kim kiss him?

446
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:22,049
I only want to see
a unique so... so...

447
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,009
phenomenon.

448
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:28,449
- Hugo, the fink!
- So long, fink!

449
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,049
- Fink!
- Oh, what a tink!

450
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,889
Here are the gentlemen trom the press.
I'll handle them. You go tind the mayor.

451
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:50,769
We want him! We want him!

452
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,209
Here's your speech.
Learn it and hurry!

453
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:56,369
We want him! We want him!

454
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:04,569
- Look this way, please.
- What's your name?

455
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,689
- Conrad Birdie.
- No, no, your name.

456
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,729
She doesn't even know her name.

457
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,649
"We want him!"

458
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:34,769
I beg your pardon.
May I add a welcome from Sweet Apple?

459
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:37,609
I'm Claude Paisley.
Kim McAfee's my student in English.

460
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:40,889
- How do you do? I'm Rose DeLeon.
- Nice to know you.

461
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,769
- And you're?
- Hugo.

462
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,849
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

463
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:50,449
- Hugo Fink.
- Hello, Mr. Fink. How are you?

464
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:53,049
Now, please
don't think me forward.

465
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:56,009
But it you do have any spare time
during your visit...

466
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,169
I'd appreciate discussing
Mr. Birdie with you.

467
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:03,929
Well, I'm afraid
I'll be very busy...

468
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,889
but thank you.

469
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,969
Watch it, Rube.
Don't bend the fur.

470
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,409
He's coming! Look, everybody!
He's coming! Here he comes!

471
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,729
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

472
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,529
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

473
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:39,849
When you're not near us
we're blue

474
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,849
Oh, Conrad, we love you

475
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,169
Betore you hear
from the girl upon whom...

476
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:27,089
you have chosen to bestow
your final kiss upon...

477
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,849
we will now recite
the Conrad Birdie pledge.

478
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:36,609
I, being ot
sound mind and body...

479
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,609
do hereby promise...

480
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:43,169
to be loyal, courteous,
steadtast and true...

481
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:47,489
to Conrad Birdie
and the United States of America...

482
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:52,009
both indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

483
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,449
As the tortunate girl
whom you have selected...

484
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:04,809
to represent all my fellow girls,
I welcome you.

485
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,569
Now, Mayor, now.

486
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:30,809
Speech here.

487
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:35,569
And now I present this key
to our city to our honored guest...

488
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,729
Conrad Birdie.

489
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:42,689
He said it!
He said the name!

490
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,209
What happened?
All I said was Conrad Birdie.

491
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:54,889
Girls, you're going to have to stop that
or I can't finish my speech.

492
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,609
Who cares about your speech?

493
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:00,529
We want to hear Conrad!

494
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,209
He's not so much.

495
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:16,129
You gotta be sincere

496
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:18,289
Edna, what's wrong?

497
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,369
You gotta be sincere

498
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,049
Birdie, what are you doin'?

499
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,329
You gotta feel it here

500
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,929
'Cause if you feel it here

501
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,489
Well, then you're gonna be

502
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:36,569
Honestly sincere

503
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:43,529
If what you feel is true

504
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,649
You really feel it
You make them feel it too

505
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:52,289
Write this down now
You gotta be sincere

506
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,529
Honestly sincere

507
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,289
Man, you've gotta be

508
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:02,569
Sincere

509
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:07,489
If you're really sincere
If you're really sincere

510
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:10,369
If you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

511
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,209
Oh, baby

512
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:14,129
Oh, honey

513
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:16,089
Hug me

514
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:18,649
Ah, suffer

515
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:25,449
In everything I do

516
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:28,849
Why, my sincerity shows through

517
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,729
Yeah, when I look you in the eye
I don't even have to try

518
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,729
It's automatic
I'm sincere

519
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:41,769
When I sing about a tree

520
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,089
Listen, why
I really feel that tree

521
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,689
Yeah, when I sing about a girl

522
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,609
I really feel that girl

523
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,089
I mean, I really feel

524
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:57,409
Sincere

525
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,969
Why, if you're really sincere

526
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,889
If you're really sincere

527
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,689
If you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

528
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,609
Oh, baby

529
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,409
Oh, honey

530
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:11,369
Hug me

531
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,089
Ah, suffer

532
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:16,169
Yeah, here we go now

533
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:19,289
Why, you gotta be sincere

534
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:23,009
Oh, you gotta feel it here

535
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,809
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby

536
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,609
Oh, yeah

537
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:31,089
Oh, my baby, oh, yeah

538
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,569
Go, girl, go

539
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,129
Ursula! What are you doing?

540
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:40,289
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

541
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,569
Yeah

542
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:43,889
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

543
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,209
Yeah

544
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:56,729
We love you, Conrad

545
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:00,529
Oh, yes, we do

546
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:04,529
We love you, Conrad

547
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,489
And we'll be true

548
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,769
When you're not near us

549
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,449
We're blue

550
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:21,769
Oh, Conrad, we love you

551
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,249
Randolph, your father's warned you.

552
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,689
It you make another bomb,
you'll get spanked.

553
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:32,329
- It was an accident, Mom.
- Now, get this stuft out ot here.

554
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,449
Doris! Doris!

555
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:42,849
Doris, what's going on here?

556
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,889
Harry, where have
you been since supper?

557
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,329
In plenty of trouble, that's where.
But I'm not now. No, sirree.

558
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,609
You kids go home before
I sick the constable on ya!

559
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,609
Go on! Get that carnival
oft my front lawn!

560
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:54,289
I'll show them who's boss.

561
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,689
Harry McAtee's not going to be
pushed around by any roll and rocker.

562
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,649
- Harry, they'll hear you.
- Let 'em hear me!

563
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:04,449
- Put those chemicals away and go to bed.
- Yes, Papa.

564
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:10,689
We're in trouble.
He can't stand Conrad living here.

565
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,809
Especially around
his pretty young daughter.

566
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:21,569
She's still under the magic spell.

567
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:29,009
Dear little Conrad certainly
has a devastating impact.

568
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,609
He might make a territic soldier.

569
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:33,169
Turn him loose and the enemy
will twitch itselt to death.

570
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,489
I don't care.
I've changed my mind.

571
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:39,089
My daughter is not going to be
publicly kissed by that... that wiggler.

572
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,489
The deal is ott.

573
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:43,369
But, dear, you know these adolescents.
Kim will lose tace.

574
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:46,529
It I don't get rid of that Birdie,
that's not all she'll...

575
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:53,089
Hear this. I have decided that bunch
of grafters is getting out ot here.

576
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:56,969
That is the unshakable decree that
I have made as head of this household.

577
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:59,169
- So you go upstairs and tell them.
- Me?

578
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:01,889
How can I tell Mr. Peterson
and that nice Miss DeLeon?

579
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:06,049
Nice? I know that show business crowd...
probably living in sin.

580
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:08,289
Harry Lionel McAtee!

581
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,809
I never told you, but one summer
I worked tor the circus.

582
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:13,289
- Oh, those midgets, wild.
- Not another word.

583
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,049
She's been engaged to Peterson
tor six years. Don't tell me they...

584
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:20,009
- We were engaged for tive years.
- He's not as stupid as I was.

585
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,409
- Are you stupid, Pop?
- Find out for yourselt!

586
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,369
That's the trouble
with kids today! Lazy!

587
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:27,729
Will you go up? Get up to bed!

588
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:31,489
Oh, Harry, they'll be gone
day atter tomorrow.

589
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:34,889
I'm a peace-loving man,
a good father and husband.

590
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:36,969
And the result?

591
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:41,769
The home I hewed out of this wilderness
with my bare hands is no longer mine.

592
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:44,929
Tonight I had to wait
until 6:00 tor my supper.

593
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,529
And that Peterson grafter, running up
my phone bill with long-distance calls!

594
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,609
- He oftered to reimburse you.
- I don't take Diners Club cards!

595
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:57,929
Then that snake in a gold suit insists
on parking in my beautiful living room.

596
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:02,209
- Do you know where I've just been?
- No, dear.

597
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,929
To a meeting with the big boys,
Kelsey, Judge Blanch, Joe Kipp.

598
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:09,009
My biggest customers. They don't approve
ot this kind ot notorious goings-on.

599
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,929
Darling, they put pressure on you?

600
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:15,929
If I don't cancel this whole Birdie
deal, they'll starve me out of business.

601
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:19,369
- Oh, my heavens!
- It's them or us.

602
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:29,089
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

603
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,089
- What's wrong?
- It was just Randolph's chemicals.

604
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:35,449
No, a mixture ot iron sultide
plus two parts H2SO4.

605
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:37,929
Smart boy you have there. It isn't
every lad who can make a stench bomb.

606
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:41,649
- Which brings me to Mr. Birdie.
- Mr. Peterson is really a biochemist.

607
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:44,209
- I couldn't care less.
- I have one tormula, a secret.

608
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:47,809
It's miraculous because it increases
the work output of domestic animals.

609
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:50,249
- Now about this Birdie.
- It speeds up the reflexes.

610
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:52,169
An ox, for instance,
could outrun a racehorse.

611
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:55,449
By adding in his tormula,
a hen will lay three eggs a day.

612
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:57,969
Three eggs a day? It that's so,
you could make a million times...

613
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,209
I've been nursing
this compound for years.

614
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:03,209
- Still needs more tests, but it works.
- Aren't you in farming?

615
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,409
- He's McAtee Fertilizer.
- Oh, yes.

616
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,329
- Been in it tor 20 years.
- Really?

617
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:08,849
But I may be out if...

618
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:12,609
It you and Albert got together,
you could revolutionize farm production.

619
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:14,769
Would you like a demonstration?
Do you have a hen?

620
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:18,569
- How about trying it on that?
- A tortoise? I don't know.

621
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:21,369
Sure! It won't bite.
Here. Let me.

622
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:27,529
Ot course, there isn't
much demand for turtle eggs.

623
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,209
But if it really works
on tarm animals...

624
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,249
maybe you and me
could do some business.

625
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:39,089
I'll sure need something it I let Kim
go through with this Birdie stutf.

626
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:41,489
Some of Harry's customers
are against it.

627
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:44,129
Yeah, and so I've decided
it's absolutely out of the question.

628
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:46,329
Your neighbors are just
going to be thrilled...

629
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:50,489
when they see the two of you
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

630
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,489
The Ed Sullivan Show.

631
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:56,569
- We were saving that as a surprise.
- Yes, a surprise.

632
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:58,569
Me on Ed Sullivan?

633
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:00,569
Oh, I'd die. What would I wear?

634
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,529
- We'll find something.
- Gee, Ed Sullivan.

635
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:04,129
He's my favorite human.

636
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,489
That's why I decided to let Kim go on
in the first place.

637
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:09,769
Me on The Ed Sullivan Show?

638
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,089
Ed Sullivan

639
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:17,249
Me, Harry McAfee appearing with

640
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,009
Ed Sullivan

641
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:51,609
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

642
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:57,649
How could any family be

643
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:01,729
Half as fortunate as we

644
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:05,369
We'll be coast to coast

645
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:08,729
With our favorite host

646
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:26,489
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

647
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:32,849
I've got a wonderful wife

648
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:37,089
Two swell kids
a good business and now this

649
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:41,209
Someday we'll recall

650
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:45,209
The greatest day of all

651
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:47,129
Ed, I love you.

652
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,529
Hello?

653
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:09,569
Oh, yes. Harry,
it's the mayor. He sounds mad.

654
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:12,449
I'II handle this.

655
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:16,089
Yes? Yes, Mayor?

656
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:18,369
Yes, the boys talked to me.

657
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:22,569
Yep, I've decided.
Birdie stays right here...

658
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:24,649
and Kim's on TV.

659
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:26,209
And what's more...

660
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:30,289
I'm gonna be on the show, too,
with Eddy Sullivan.

661
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:35,009
Now, listen, Harry. You saw what
that crazy galoot did at the reception.

662
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,929
It was a disgrace.

663
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:43,209
Look, Mayor,
you're gonna be on TV too.

664
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:45,889
They want you to make a speech.

665
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:50,889
They want me on Ed Sullivan?

666
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,689
A short speech.
Why, sure!

667
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:00,689
I could become
a statewide tace.

668
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:02,689
It's a deal, Mayor.

669
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:05,409
Sure I'll plug you up tor governor.

670
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:07,729
Bye, Sam.

671
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,169
What a hambo.

672
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:13,969
Well, it's been a long day,
so I think we'll...

673
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:25,689
I'm thinking of calling them "Speed Up."
You like it, Mr. McAfee?

674
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:28,449
"Feed up with Speed Up."
I love it, partner.

675
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:32,369
- How will Randolph catch his tortoise?
- Just give him one of these.

676
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,169
Hi, Mr. McAfee.
Gee, I just wanted to thank you.

677
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,489
My dad said you're not letting Kim
go on TV and kiss that... that.

678
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:45,209
It can't be true. You wouldn't
destroy Kim, your own tlesh and blood!

679
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:47,969
Sure he would.
A tather has a right, right?

680
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:51,169
Hugo, my daughter's old enough
to make her own decisions...

681
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,649
so I've decided to let her do it.

682
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:58,569
Well, in that case, your daughter
is the tormer future Mrs. Hugo Peabody.

683
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,929
Oh, Hugo,
stop acting like a child.

684
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:03,489
Kim! Where is he?
Can I see him?

685
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,409
Conrad's asleep, poor dear.

686
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,449
You may peek through
his keyhole while I...

687
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:11,169
while I discuss this tempest
in a tea bag with Hugo.

688
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,769
You're lucky people.

689
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:30,209
What'd we ever do
to deserve such a daughter?

690
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:32,129
We got married.

691
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:34,729
Marriage.

692
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:35,849
- But, Kim...
- Hugo...

693
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:38,009
- Yeah, but, Kim...
- I don't have time tor a debate.

694
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,529
Ursula's waiting. I've got to learn
my speech tor tomorrow's rehearsal.

695
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:44,409
Wait a minute, Kim.
Don't go yet, please.

696
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:48,209
You don't know what I've been through
with all the guys buggin' me...

697
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,649
well, about you
and that Birdie creep.

698
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,609
Oh, that.

699
00:47:52,649 --> 00:47:54,129
Yeah, that!

700
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:58,169
Why, that's silly.
He means nothing to me.

701
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,209
One boy

702
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,209
One special boy

703
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,129
One boy to go with

704
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:16,289
To talk with and walk with

705
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:18,769
One boy

706
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,489
That's the way it should be

707
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:27,129
Yeah, yeah,
that's the way it should be.

708
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,169
One boy

709
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:31,649
One certain boy

710
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:34,249
One boy to laugh with

711
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,849
To joke with, have Coke with

712
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,489
One boy

713
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:45,329
Not two or three

714
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:50,889
One day

715
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,049
You'll find out

716
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:58,809
This is what life is all about

717
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:02,249
You need

718
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:05,329
Someone who

719
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,849
Is living

720
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:11,529
Just for you

721
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:14,849
One boy

722
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,089
One steady boy

723
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:19,649
One boy to be with

724
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:23,009
Forever and ever

725
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:25,889
One boy

726
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:31,009
That's the way it should be

727
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:33,929
That's the way

728
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:37,969
It should be

729
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:49,089
Now is that the kiss of a woman
interested in any other man?

730
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:54,969
I don't know.
How do I tell?

731
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:02,609
- Ah, but he made you taint.
- Oh, he did not!

732
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:06,209
I was just exhausted,
cramming for my English exam.

733
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:14,929
You've got to try
to understand me as a woman.

734
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,169
Now, I might like
Conrad as a friend...

735
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,449
but when it comes
to the real thing...

736
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:24,929
the grand passion...

737
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:28,809
well, that's something
special, Hugo.

738
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:30,649
That's you.

739
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,369
One day you'll find out

740
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:39,769
This is what life is all about

741
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:44,289
You need someone who

742
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:50,769
Is living just for you

743
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:55,329
One boy, one steady boy

744
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,649
One boy to be with

745
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:00,249
Forever and ever

746
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:03,009
One boy

747
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:07,889
That's the way it should be

748
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:12,129
That's the way

749
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:17,809
It should be

750
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:24,409
Homework!
Hey, I got homework to do.

751
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:42,889
When will he find out

752
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:47,649
This is what life is all about

753
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:53,689
Will he ever see

754
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:58,369
I need him

755
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,409
And he

756
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:04,929
Needs me

757
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:08,929
- One boy
- One special boy

758
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:12,529
- One special boy
- One boy to be with always

759
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,689
One boy to be with

760
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:19,409
- Forever and ever
- Forever

761
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:23,329
- I love him
- One boy

762
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:26,809
- Love him, I love
- That's the way

763
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:31,329
- Him so
- It should be

764
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,329
That's the way

765
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:39,609
It should be

766
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:47,489
That's the way

767
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:54,249
It should be

768
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:14,169
Hello, Sweet Apple Drive-in?

769
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:16,849
I'm looking tor my mother,
Mrs. Peterson.

770
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,889
Are you sure there's no one left
in your drive-in? Okay, thank you.

771
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,569
Don't worry, partner.
Your mother will get along tine.

772
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:25,929
Sweet Apple's
full ot friendly folk.

773
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:28,769
It anything happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

774
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:30,889
- What kind of a dump is this?
- "Dump"?

775
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:33,249
Conrad. Let's humor him, partner.

776
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:35,489
If he walks otf
the Sullivan show, we're sunk.

777
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:36,929
Gotcha.

778
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,929
I can't tind no church key
in my room.

779
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:45,249
Church key? We've had
a church here, but it's open.

780
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:49,569
A can opener, man.
You're from nowherelike.

781
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:03,329
That's my tavorite brand.

782
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,569
Well, it's bedtime, huh, Conrad?

783
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:12,809
Okay for tonight,
but tomorrow's Saturday...

784
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:16,169
and that's my real tense night.

785
00:54:24,169 --> 00:54:26,969
Thanks, Mr. McAtee.

786
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:31,009
The next time I have a daughter,
I hope it's a boy.

787
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:33,009
I am a lucky man though, Albert.

788
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:35,409
Meeting up with
a biochemical wizard.

789
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:38,689
Peterson and McAfee
are going right to the moon.

790
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:42,649
I've got to, not just
tor my mother, for Rosie.

791
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,889
Well, I guess I'll get
a little air and turn in.

792
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,049
Take all the air you want, chum.

793
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:11,649
Hi, Rosie.

794
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:17,569
Rosie, you don't have
to worry about Mama. She'll show up.

795
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:20,369
- I'm certain she will.
- Then you ought to be happy.

796
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:23,009
Kim's on the show.
Conrad does my song...

797
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,729
and I promise
I'll tell Mama about us.

798
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,249
Come on.

799
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:43,649
Why look so awfully tragic

800
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:46,209
Put on a happy face

801
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,889
Smiling can work like magic

802
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,449
Put on a happy face

803
00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:54,449
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy

804
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:56,689
It's not your style

805
00:55:56,769 --> 00:56:01,889
You look so good that
you'll be glad ya decided to smile

806
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:04,529
Pick out a pleasant outlook

807
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:07,049
Stick out that noble chin

808
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:09,929
Wipe off the full of doubt look

809
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:12,809
Slap on a happy grin

810
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:16,929
And spread sunshine
all over the place

811
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:21,249
Just put on a happy face

812
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:27,569
Flowers?

813
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:30,209
Put on a happy face

814
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,009
Put on a happy face

815
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:37,729
Why do you mope around so sourly

816
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,889
It's such a strain

817
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,689
I always try to chuckle hourly

818
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:45,209
It clears the brain

819
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,889
I knew a girl so gloomy

820
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:51,969
She'd never laugh or sing

821
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:54,649
She wouldn't listen to me

822
00:56:54,689 --> 00:56:56,849
Now she's a mean old thing

823
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:59,169
So spread sunshine

824
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,929
All over the place

825
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:04,889
Put on a happy

826
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:17,849
So put on a happy

827
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:22,489
Face

828
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:42,689
Well, like I said,
you're a genius, Dr. Peterson.

829
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,929
Oh, honey,
you sure have put up with a lot.

830
00:58:45,009 --> 00:58:46,849
But this time we're gonna make it!

831
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,049
Let's live in a small town
like this.

832
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,569
- Anything you say, dear.
- Okay?

833
00:58:51,649 --> 00:58:54,289
Wow, the last time
we were alone together...

834
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:56,609
last summer at Palisades Park.

835
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:59,729
- We went through the tunnel ot love.
- Your mother sat between us.

836
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:02,649
Oh, honey, I told you. From now on,
things are gonna be ditferent.

837
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:06,849
- Yoo-hoo! Albert!
- It's Mama.

838
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:08,769
Mama?

839
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:15,649
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl...

840
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:17,569
boy gets mother.

841
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:26,089
- Mama, where have ya been?
- Neglected! That's where I've been.

842
00:59:26,169 --> 00:59:28,929
I tried to tind ya.
Have you had any dinner?

843
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:33,249
A mother doesn't need tood. Besides,
I'd rather be with my famous son.

844
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:35,929
Albert, what is it?
Oh, it's your mother.

845
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:38,409
- Oh, good evening!
- How are ya, ma'am?

846
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:43,129
How can I be... ripped trom
my native land, alone in this jungle?

847
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:45,689
Gosh, Albert, I wish we had room
to put up your mother.

848
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:49,809
Thanks. A motel mattress full of lumps
is good enough tor me.

849
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:52,209
Comtort is tor my loving son.

850
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:00,129
I just came to tuck ya into bed.

851
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:03,009
See, Mama's got a condition.
She won't tell me what it is.

852
01:00:03,089 --> 01:00:05,769
Why worry a growing boy?

853
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,849
Okay. You insist?

854
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:12,449
I got, maybe,
one tenth a normal heart.

855
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,689
A mother doesn't need a heart.

856
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:17,409
Well, soon as Albert and I get
our new deal a-rollin'...

857
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,809
you'll have the finest doctors
in the country.

858
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:23,409
Deal? What deal, Albert?

859
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:28,169
Well, Mama, I'm quitting the music
business and goin' back to chemistry.

860
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:32,009
That Rosie!
She's finally turned you against me!

861
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,049
Oh, please, Mama. She didn't.

862
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:36,209
Albert, go... desert me.

863
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:38,929
But when I was expecting him
in the maternity ward...

864
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,009
three days I waited...
did I desert him?

865
01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:45,689
No. I stayed right there so
he wouldn't be alone when he was born.

866
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:48,809
Mama, please don't excite yourself.
Mama, you know I love ya.

867
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:51,529
- It's just Rosie and I have plans.
- Okay!

868
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:55,849
Lou, I'll be right up.

869
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:57,769
Start dealing.

870
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:04,449
Just bury me on your tront lawn
so Rosie can walk all over me!

871
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,729
Mama! Mama, please!

872
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:11,929
It's not gas. It's electric.

873
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,369
Doris!

874
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:20,409
Doris, how do you like it?
Isn't it exciting?

875
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:24,049
No! I told you
not to dye your hair!

876
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:26,649
Oh, but I wanted to!
Isn't it a gas?

877
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:30,929
- You dare dety your mother?
- But it's my hair.

878
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:34,129
- Not till you're 21.
- What's the matter, Papa?

879
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:37,249
Young lady, you stay in your room
till it changes back! Do you hear?

880
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:40,129
- I won't!
- I demand respect around here.

881
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,849
- It's my hair!
- Respect. Do you hear? Respect.

882
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:46,689
- I respect you, Papa.
- I don't want your respect.

883
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:50,209
Who wants respect
trom a ten-year-old kid?

884
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,329
Kids, I don't know what's wrong
with these kids today

885
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:58,609
Kids, who can understand
anything they say

886
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:02,529
Kids, they are disobedient
disrespectful oafs

887
01:02:02,609 --> 01:02:05,809
Noisy, crazy, sloppy, lazy loafers

888
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,729
And while we're on the sub ject, kids

889
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:10,849
You can talk and talk
till your face is blue

890
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:14,889
Kids, but they still do
just what they want to do

891
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,089
Why can't they be like we were

892
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:19,289
Perfect in every way

893
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:22,409
What's the matter with kids today

894
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:27,169
Kids, I've tried to raise you
the best I could

895
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:31,729
Kids, all the things I've done
were for your own good

896
01:02:31,809 --> 01:02:35,969
Kids, can't you once appreciate
how I've sacrificed

897
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:38,969
Working, slaving, scrimping
saving pennies

898
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:41,049
And livin' with your father, kids

899
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:44,329
No one knows the burdens I've had
to bear, and in my condition

900
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:47,329
Kids, I'm a poor, sick woman
and does he care

901
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:50,489
Ha!
Go on, go on and kill me

902
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:52,529
That's what it's coming to

903
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:55,809
When a mother has kids like you

904
01:02:57,089 --> 01:02:59,889
- Kids
- All the chicken soup I made for you

905
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:01,889
- Mama, take it easy.
- Kids

906
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:05,289
- Now you throw me out like a worn shoe
- Not in front of everybody.

907
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:09,249
Mom, after all, I haven't been
such an awful son

908
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:12,609
I never sass you back
or leave a ring around the bathtub

909
01:03:12,649 --> 01:03:14,609
- And don't I always phone you
- Kids

910
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:17,769
You can give your life to 'em
night and day

911
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:20,209
- Kids, then they go get married
- Married?

912
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:22,169
- And go away
- Who's gettin' married?

913
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:24,289
Why do we have these children

914
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:27,649
Better to have a pet
You know where you stand with a pet.

915
01:03:30,129 --> 01:03:32,249
I never asked for nothin'

916
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:34,169
Nothin' is what you'll get

917
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:37,129
What's the matter with kids to...

918
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,089
I tried, Lou, but I failed.

919
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:40,969
Oh, ya didn't, Mama.
Ya didn't.

920
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:43,809
Don't try to pay me back, sonny.
I forgive you.

921
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:46,609
So what if you're an ingrate?
So long as you're happy.

922
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,529
- I don't want to be happy.
- Don't feel guilty.

923
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:52,289
Just make believe I'm an old used car.
Junk me. Leave me in the gutter.

924
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,609
- I'll never leave ya. Never.
- You heard him.

925
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:56,449
- You're a witness.
- I promise, Mama.

926
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:59,169
- I never broke promise to my mama.
- Good boy.

927
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:01,209
Why can't they be like Albert

928
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,129
Perfect in every way

929
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:05,489
What's the matter with kids

930
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:07,449
Yeah, what's the matter with kids

931
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:11,329
Nothing's the matter with kids today

932
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,569
Mr. Paisley, this is Rose DeLeon.

933
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:19,009
You asked me to call
it I had any tree time.

934
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,329
Well, I'm free.

935
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,649
- Very tree.
- Rosie!

936
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:27,289
Ten minutes?
I'll be waiting tor you.

937
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:32,889
Don't worry, sonny.
You can always get another secretary.

938
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:42,049
Can you see him?

939
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:45,049
- No. Babette, can you see him?
- I can't see him.

940
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:48,689
All I can see is the basketball hoop.
Hey, Gretch, can you see him?

941
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:51,449
Conrad Birdie in our gym!

942
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:55,649
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

943
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:58,289
One last kiss

944
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:01,969
Oh, one more time
Mmm, baby, one more time

945
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:06,049
It really is sublime
Ah, baby, so sublime

946
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:08,289
You know I need your love

947
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:12,129
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

948
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,369
One last kiss

949
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:18,809
Baby

950
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:22,849
Give me one last kiss

951
01:05:22,929 --> 01:05:27,489
Baby

952
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:31,009
Give me one last kiss

953
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:36,289
Oh, one last kiss

954
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:38,369
Give me one last kiss

955
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:40,289
It never felt like this

956
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,569
Nah, baby, not like this

957
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:44,609
You know I need your love

958
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:47,289
- Oh, oh, oh
- Okay. Cut.

959
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:49,889
We'll rehearse
the song later, Conrad.

960
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:54,689
- Al, what's the exact length?
- Oh, uh, 1:20.

961
01:05:54,729 --> 01:05:58,129
Check. That gives us 2:40
for Sullivan's intro to Kim...

962
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:00,049
Kim's good luck speech to Conrad.

963
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:02,369
Then Conrad socks over a plug
tor army enlistments...

964
01:06:02,409 --> 01:06:05,649
bangs into the song, and we top it off
with the big kisseroo.

965
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:08,249
- Kim?
- Yes, sir.

966
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:12,569
Beg pardon,
but when do I make my speech?

967
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:14,489
Speech? What speech?

968
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:18,089
I promised Mr. McAfee he could say a few
words. After all, he's Kim's father.

969
01:06:18,169 --> 01:06:21,449
- Yes, he is.
- Kind of a hello from a proud parent.

970
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:23,369
All right,
but ya can't have much time.

971
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:26,009
In tact, all you can have is 20 seconds
on the nose.

972
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:29,129
Gotcha. I'll just say a few words,
get some big laughs.

973
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:31,809
- And introduce the mayor.
- The mayor?

974
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:36,209
- Ah, come on, Al. What is this?
- I... We had a problem.

975
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:39,009
I had to give the mayor a spot
to humor McAfee.

976
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:42,969
All right, but we'll have to take
ten seconds away from McAtee.

977
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:45,249
I imagine songwriting must be
quite a lucrative profession.

978
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:49,089
- Oh, yes it is.
- How many records will they sell?

979
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:51,129
Oh, about one or two million.

980
01:06:51,209 --> 01:06:54,129
You know, Claude, I had a pertectly
wondertul time last night.

981
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:56,529
- You really are a wonderful dancer.
- Oh, I don't know.

982
01:06:56,609 --> 01:06:59,009
When one's heart sings,
one's feet take wings.

983
01:06:59,089 --> 01:07:01,329
Oh, how lyrical.
Is that Shelley or Keats?

984
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:03,649
- That, my dear, is Paisley.
- Really?

985
01:07:03,689 --> 01:07:05,649
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

986
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,529
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

987
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:14,289
Okay, everybody. Take your places.

988
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:16,609
Now come on, Kim.
Just move right over there.

989
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:18,849
Just read it like
you normally would. Okay.

990
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:22,449
And we, your admirers, are proud that
our military leaders have called upon...

991
01:07:22,529 --> 01:07:24,369
- Conrad, honey!
- Please, Mrs. Peterson.

992
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:26,289
We're rehearsing.

993
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:28,609
All right now, Kim.

994
01:07:28,689 --> 01:07:31,009
Could you move over one, please?

995
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:35,809
Kim, you're talking too fast.
Now once more, dear, but slower.

996
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:40,009
- To express to you...
- Tell me, Mrs. Peterson.

997
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:43,009
- What does your husband do?
- I don't know. He's dead.

998
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:47,449
And, and, and I want to say...

999
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:52,689
on behalt of all the girls
who are your devoted admirers...

1000
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,609
- Oh, I torgot what's next.
- Come on, man. Let's go.

1001
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,129
- Hi, Hugo.
- They don't want all this jazz.

1002
01:07:58,209 --> 01:07:59,729
- Yeah.
- They want Conrad.

1003
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:03,329
Look. There's the camera.
I bail in, I sing up a storm...

1004
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:05,569
I give this chick the message...

1005
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:10,209
This is my best side.

1006
01:08:10,249 --> 01:08:11,609
- Applause.
- She's tainted.

1007
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:14,529
- I'll dig you later.
- Hey, enough! I'm puttin' my foot down!

1008
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:16,769
My baby!

1009
01:08:16,809 --> 01:08:18,849
Now I'm puttin' my foot down.
She's not goin' on that show!

1010
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,769
Oh, yes, she is.
You're not wreckin' my career.

1011
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:24,049
- Oh, what happened?
- Tell him you're through...

1012
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:27,609
because you do not wish to humiliate
your steady in this sordid fashion.

1013
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:29,929
Hugo Peabody, you take that back!

1014
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:32,089
I will not,
but I will take my pin back.

1015
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:34,489
Oh, with pleasure.

1016
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:45,609
Conrad, I know you're tense,
but we haven't tinished.

1017
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:48,129
- The number's not ready.
- Conrad's a trooper, like I was.

1018
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:50,889
- Us troopers get tense.
- Yeah. Like she said, like.

1019
01:08:50,969 --> 01:08:54,009
Conrad, why don't you and I
go tor a nice ride in the country?

1020
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:57,689
Uh-uh. Man, I hope
I never get that tense.

1021
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:03,129
I never should have said that
to Rosie.

1022
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:06,569
- Who does he think he is anyway?
- AI, I got a wire here trom Ed Sullivan.

1023
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:09,729
"Russian Ballet switching to different
dance requiring additional four minutes.

1024
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:13,129
Therefore, the entire Birdie spot
must be cut to less than 30 seconds."

1025
01:09:13,209 --> 01:09:15,049
- Cut?
- "Tell Peterson and Rosie...

1026
01:09:15,129 --> 01:09:17,969
I'm sorry song is out,
but no choice."

1027
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:20,449
No. They can't do this.
They can't cut the song.

1028
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:24,289
They've already done it, kid. In 30
seconds all Birdie can do is take a bow.

1029
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,209
I'm awtully sorry.

1030
01:09:27,489 --> 01:09:29,289
The Russians!

1031
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:32,889
First they take Czechoslovakia,
and now they take my tour minutes.

1032
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:35,169
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, baby!

1033
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:39,809
Well, that's, that's show business.

1034
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:09,889
There are chicks just ripe
for some kissin'

1035
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:14,049
And I mean to kiss me a few

1036
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:18,369
Man, those chicks don't know
what they're missin'

1037
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:22,369
I got a lot of livin' to do

1038
01:10:22,449 --> 01:10:26,609
Sizzlin' steaks
all ready for tastin'

1039
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:30,689
And there's Cadillacs
all shiny and new

1040
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:35,329
Gotta move
'cause time is a-wastin'

1041
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:39,129
I got a lot of livin' to do

1042
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:41,889
There's music to play
places to go

1043
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:43,929
People to see

1044
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:47,729
Everything for you and me

1045
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:51,849
Life's a ball
if only you know it

1046
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:56,089
And it's all
just waitin' for you

1047
01:10:56,129 --> 01:11:00,129
You're alive
so come on and show it

1048
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:04,009
Yeah, we got a lot of livin' to do

1049
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:06,969
There are men

1050
01:11:07,049 --> 01:11:10,969
With childhood behind them

1051
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:13,929
Handsome men

1052
01:11:14,009 --> 01:11:17,849
From Yale or Purdue

1053
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:20,929
Older men

1054
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:24,449
And I'm gonna find 'em

1055
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:29,009
I got a lot of livin'

1056
01:11:29,089 --> 01:11:31,809
To do

1057
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:34,929
I'm a-gonna have fun

1058
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:36,849
Gonna be wild

1059
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:39,729
Have my own way

1060
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:42,849
I may break

1061
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:46,449
A heart a day

1062
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:49,729
Drink champagne

1063
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:52,729
As if it were water

1064
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:56,929
Pink champagne

1065
01:11:56,969 --> 01:11:59,809
And after a few

1066
01:12:00,809 --> 01:12:04,209
Daddy dear

1067
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:07,289
You won't know your daughter

1068
01:12:08,769 --> 01:12:12,449
She's got a lot of livin'

1069
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:14,009
To do

1070
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:20,729
Think I'll be

1071
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,809
A ring-a-ding drummer

1072
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:24,809
Make each week

1073
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:27,169
A thousand or two

1074
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:29,089
Gorgeous girls

1075
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:31,129
Will beg for my number

1076
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:35,449
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do

1077
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:38,169
Yes, I'm gonna break out
Gonna take off

1078
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,249
Gonna be free

1079
01:12:40,329 --> 01:12:43,729
This town is awfully square
for a cat like me

1080
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,969
Or I'll be

1081
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:48,249
A super jet pilot

1082
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:50,169
Fly me high

1083
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,249
Way out in the blue

1084
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,329
And then they'll see

1085
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:56,769
I'm no shrinkin' violet

1086
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:59,969
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do

1087
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:29,609
I got a lot of livin'

1088
01:15:29,689 --> 01:15:31,529
To do

1089
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:54,249
- There's music to play
- Places to go

1090
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:56,169
People to see

1091
01:15:56,249 --> 01:16:00,289
Ah, everything for you and me

1092
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:02,249
Life's a ball

1093
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:04,489
If only you know it

1094
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:08,769
Yeah, and it's all
just waitin' for you

1095
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:10,769
Oh, you're alive

1096
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,969
So come on and show it

1097
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,929
Yeah, we got a lot of livin'

1098
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:17,649
Such a lot of livin'

1099
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:19,969
Tonight's the night
we're gonna fly

1100
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,449
Let's kick this hick town
into high

1101
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:28,609
I want a taste of everything

1102
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:31,289
Let's live it up and really swing

1103
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:35,169
Got a lot of livin', livin'

1104
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:36,889
Livin', livin'

1105
01:16:36,929 --> 01:16:38,769
Livin' to do

1106
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,209
Live!

1107
01:17:27,049 --> 01:17:30,529
But you needn't bite my head otf.
I only ask a civil question.

1108
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:32,049
Ten times you've asked me.

1109
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:34,729
I don't know why they've changed
to this slow dance tor the TV.

1110
01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:36,649
But if Albert can't get him
to cut it shorter...

1111
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:38,569
tomorrow night
I won't be on Ed Sullivan.

1112
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:40,929
Neither will Kim.
You know how much it means to her.

1113
01:17:40,969 --> 01:17:42,529
- How about m...
- Well, anyway...

1114
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:45,249
Albert's still in with the managers,
so that's a good sign.

1115
01:17:45,289 --> 01:17:48,529
If Eisenhower couldn't handle
the Russians, how is Albert?

1116
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:03,249
Long live Joseph Stalin.

1117
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:05,569
I mean, Stalin lived too long.

1118
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:07,489
Long live Khrushchev.

1119
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:27,569
Save your lite? Me?

1120
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,169
My triend,
it you are sick, see a doctor.

1121
01:18:31,049 --> 01:18:34,769
If you're sick, see a doctor.
You speak English?

1122
01:18:34,849 --> 01:18:37,449
It saves time.

1123
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:41,369
What can I do tor you,
uh, Mr. Peterson?

1124
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:44,769
Sir, I have come to appeal to you.

1125
01:18:44,849 --> 01:18:47,289
That ballet... the one
that you're doing on TV tomorrow night...

1126
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:49,489
Da, for Mr. Ed Sullivan.

1127
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:53,729
Yeah. That's the one.
Could you just cut that four minutes?

1128
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:58,369
Well, it's beautiful. I love it,
but my life depends on it.

1129
01:18:58,449 --> 01:19:00,809
Desecrate this classic?

1130
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:03,609
I need the time
for Conrad Birdie to sing my song.

1131
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:08,129
Who sent you here?
Senator Goldwater?

1132
01:19:08,209 --> 01:19:11,129
Will you cut three minutes?

1133
01:19:11,169 --> 01:19:13,209
Two minutes?

1134
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,849
A minute and a halt.

1135
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:18,849
To cut even ten seconds
would be artistic sabotage.

1136
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:21,569
This ballet
has historic significance.

1137
01:19:21,609 --> 01:19:24,569
It was performed the same day
as the tuneral of the czar.

1138
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:27,409
Lenin himself made the arrangement.

1139
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:30,569
- Lenin arranged music?
- No! Funerals!

1140
01:19:36,969 --> 01:19:40,889
- Hello, Rose.
- Oh, hi, Kim. You still up?

1141
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:43,809
Oh, I'm so miserable, Rose.

1142
01:19:43,889 --> 01:19:47,289
I've lost Hugo, and now I'm not even
going to be on TV.

1143
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,929
Why not?

1144
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:54,289
The ballet's taking tour extra minutes,
so Birdie's song and the kiss are out.

1145
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,409
Oh, serves Albert right.

1146
01:19:57,489 --> 01:19:59,889
Oh, now come on. Relax.

1147
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:01,769
Faithless men like Albert and Hugo...

1148
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:04,369
they're all alike...
trom puberty to stupidity...

1149
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:06,689
from Benedict Arnold to Mussolini.

1150
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:10,009
Men. We laugh at them, right?

1151
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:15,449
It's easy tor you to pick up
the pieces ot your shattered dream.

1152
01:20:15,529 --> 01:20:18,329
You've tound a compensation.

1153
01:20:18,369 --> 01:20:22,329
Ah, that Claude Paisley
is just too much.

1154
01:20:24,289 --> 01:20:28,289
He's too much, all right.
But I won't mention of what.

1155
01:20:28,369 --> 01:20:31,089
All that charm... so genteel...

1156
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:34,249
so educated, so underhanded!

1157
01:20:37,009 --> 01:20:39,849
You mean Mr. Paisley's like
all the rest?

1158
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:41,849
I thought he was the marrying type.

1159
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:43,809
Oh, he is.

1160
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:45,849
He wanted to elope tonight.

1161
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:48,649
And you know what?
He'd like to live in New York.

1162
01:20:48,729 --> 01:20:51,009
Uh, not to teach...
to be a songwriter.

1163
01:20:51,049 --> 01:20:52,449
A songwriter?

1164
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:56,289
He's all the things
I want to get away trom.

1165
01:20:56,369 --> 01:20:58,209
Oh, I'm sorry.

1166
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:01,689
I never dreamed that Mr. Paisley,
of all men...

1167
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:06,089
Oh, well. Men.
They're only out to use us, Kim.

1168
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:08,929
I know. Hugo's used me
since we were treshman.

1169
01:21:08,969 --> 01:21:11,929
All those years I wasted
on Albert.

1170
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:14,009
Rosie the dependable one,
Rosie the patient one...

1171
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:16,329
Rosie the good girl.

1172
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:20,129
I know it sounds old-tashioned,
but I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1173
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:22,289
- I'm still a good girl.
- Rose?

1174
01:21:22,369 --> 01:21:25,209
- Hmm?
- So am I.

1175
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:28,569
No kidding?

1176
01:21:29,769 --> 01:21:32,609
Well, you won't be sorry.

1177
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:38,689
- Are you going out so late?
- Mm-hmm.

1178
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:43,009
My farewell to Sweet Apple... a night
to remember. I'm going to Maude's Cate.

1179
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:47,049
Maude's? That's a wild place.

1180
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:49,529
You're not gonna do anything rash?

1181
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:51,489
Whatever you hear about me, Kim...

1182
01:21:51,529 --> 01:21:54,129
just tell them that
she loved not wisely, but too well.

1183
01:22:07,129 --> 01:22:09,529
This is the place, Albert...
hottest spot in the county.

1184
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:12,169
- How do you know?
- Oh, I heard... only heard.

1185
01:22:13,209 --> 01:22:15,489
Albert, don't go in that place.

1186
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:19,009
- I must. It's the only way.
- But drinking won't solve anything.

1187
01:22:19,089 --> 01:22:21,089
He's frustrated.

1188
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:25,889
Good-bye. Thanks.

1189
01:22:25,929 --> 01:22:28,289
I'd go in there with ya
it I weren't a happy family man...

1190
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:30,249
and not allowed to enjoy myself.

1191
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:32,809
Oh, please, Mister, I...
Oh, my arm!

1192
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:34,969
- I just want to...
- I'm telling you tor the last time!

1193
01:22:35,009 --> 01:22:38,369
- All I want is a drink.
- No drinks! Now get lost!

1194
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:42,249
Well, just a pint ot bourbon?
Gin? Scotch?

1195
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:44,289
Well, how about a malted
with a little vodka?

1196
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:46,689
Come back when you're 21.

1197
01:22:46,769 --> 01:22:50,849
Oh, well, I'm way over 21. I only
look young trom too much drinkin'.

1198
01:22:57,409 --> 01:22:59,849
Oh, look at me.
Look at the shell of a human being...

1199
01:22:59,929 --> 01:23:01,809
the monster you've created.

1200
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:06,009
Oh, I'm sorry about... Uh, Hugo,
don't worry. You'll get Kim back.

1201
01:23:06,049 --> 01:23:08,809
No, thanks.
The bloom is oft the rose.

1202
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:13,449
Rose. Little Rose...

1203
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:15,889
a precious flower
that I trampled on.

1204
01:23:31,769 --> 01:23:33,289
There you go.

1205
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:36,609
A toast to Mae. She's okay.

1206
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:38,649
I'm a songwriter too, huh?

1207
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:42,369
Would you call the McAfee house again
and see if my Al... Sonny!

1208
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:44,369
Mama, what are you doin'
in a place like this?

1209
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:46,289
We're playin' canasta.
I got lonesome.

1210
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:48,649
- Did you cut the Russians?
- And why are you consorting with him?

1211
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:50,889
- Glad to meet you.
- Now looks ain't everything.

1212
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:54,249
Besides, Mr. Maude
is 100% gentlemen and a widower.

1213
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,929
Three times. Sit down, Albert.

1214
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:59,009
Any son ot Mae Peterson is a triend
of mine. Come. Sit down. Go on.

1215
01:23:59,089 --> 01:24:01,889
Mama, get your things. We're taking
the bus to New York tonight.

1216
01:24:01,929 --> 01:24:04,449
Your song! It's all off?

1217
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:07,369
- It's dead, like I am. Let's go.
- You ain't going, Mae. Say you ain't!

1218
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:11,049
- You unhand her. Come on, Mama.
- Okay, buster. Set 'em up!

1219
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,409
Double scotch and gin on the side
and, uh, a bourbon chaser.

1220
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:18,689
Make that a triple chaser,
and bring on the dancing boys!

1221
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:21,769
Well, come on. Make me the drinks,
Meyer. We gotta put out this tire.

1222
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:25,329
Everything is Rosie

1223
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:26,889
Cha, cha, cha

1224
01:24:26,969 --> 01:24:29,209
- 'Cause my name is Rosie
- Oh, the poor thing.

1225
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:31,489
- Fifi, huh
- She can't get over me.

1226
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:34,569
- She's singing the song I wrote tor her.
- You wrote her a song?

1227
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:38,009
Well, only eight bars, Mama.
Somehow I never could tinish it.

1228
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:41,089
Hey, what's with the red cap?
You got a train inside?

1229
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:49,249
Where are you goin'?

1230
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:52,089
I'm gonna go down and see what
the boys in the back room will have.

1231
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,049
Albert, where are you going?

1232
01:24:54,129 --> 01:24:58,569
To save her trom herselt... to save her
for me. She might get in trouble.

1233
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:02,969
Report on the charity bazaar we ran
for the benetit ot the old tolk home...

1234
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:08,609
to wit net cash receipts, $840.06.

1235
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,489
Valuable goods contributed,
two milk cows, live...

1236
01:25:13,569 --> 01:25:15,929
eighty lugs ot tresh fruit...

1237
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:18,809
forty-five young cumquat trees...

1238
01:25:18,849 --> 01:25:21,409
one ton of fertilizer...

1239
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:37,049
And now,
betore the recording secretary...

1240
01:25:37,089 --> 01:25:39,609
reads the minutes
trom last week's meeting...

1241
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:41,529
I wish to bring up a subject...

1242
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,449
that I know is on everybody's mind...

1243
01:25:45,489 --> 01:25:46,809
tonight.

1244
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:48,969
As I was saying, gentlemen...

1245
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:19,809
Yeah!

1246
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:52,009
Yeah!

1247
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:47,449
No. Listen, fellas...
Watch out!

1248
01:29:44,609 --> 01:29:46,489
Rosie, baby.

1249
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:54,489
Good morning, darling.

1250
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:57,129
Way past noon. Sleep okay, honey?

1251
01:29:57,209 --> 01:30:00,249
Mm-hmm. I tried not to.

1252
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:02,849
I wanted to keep reliving
that wonderful moment...

1253
01:30:04,849 --> 01:30:07,129
when my shining knight...

1254
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:09,689
rushed into the sultan's cave...

1255
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:11,649
and carried me oft.

1256
01:30:13,329 --> 01:30:15,489
Oh, that's just the beginning.

1257
01:30:15,529 --> 01:30:18,929
Pack. We're takin' the bus
to Niagara Falls.

1258
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:20,849
Oh, yes, dear.

1259
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:32,089
You never saw me
in pajamas betore.

1260
01:30:32,129 --> 01:30:33,529
You disappointed?

1261
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:35,449
Mm-mm.

1262
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:40,609
Are you?

1263
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:53,609
Let's take a plane to Niagara Falls...
a jet!

1264
01:30:58,129 --> 01:31:01,889
Albert, we came here
to get your mother set tinancially...

1265
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:04,569
and our marriage
wouldn't have a chance...

1266
01:31:04,609 --> 01:31:07,049
if we started off feeling guilty
about deserting her.

1267
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:10,809
That's right. It may be a long time
betore I make any money.

1268
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:12,889
Not if Birdie sang
your song tonight.

1269
01:31:12,929 --> 01:31:15,169
No chance. I pleaded.

1270
01:31:15,209 --> 01:31:18,049
They won't shorten the ballet...
not even ten seconds.

1271
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:21,049
It's the slowest dance I ever saw.
They move like turtles.

1272
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:27,929
- What?
- Randolph!

1273
01:31:33,409 --> 01:31:35,329
Boys, those are really showstoppers.

1274
01:31:35,369 --> 01:31:38,289
Frank, Dean and Sammy,
come on out here and take a bow.

1275
01:31:40,929 --> 01:31:45,369
Frank, Dean and Sammy McWilliams.
Thank you, boys.

1276
01:31:45,449 --> 01:31:49,209
Right now, here on our stage,
the magnificent orchestra...

1277
01:31:49,249 --> 01:31:52,289
of American composer-conductor
Ray Block.

1278
01:31:52,369 --> 01:31:54,049
Now, really. Let's hear it.

1279
01:31:54,129 --> 01:31:55,969
Well, that ought to do it.
Any questions?

1280
01:31:56,049 --> 01:31:58,329
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Okay. I'm going backstage.

1281
01:31:58,369 --> 01:31:59,769
Right.

1282
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:05,969
Don't know why I let that Albert
drag us here.

1283
01:32:06,049 --> 01:32:08,129
Rosie said she might have
a big surprise for us.

1284
01:32:08,209 --> 01:32:11,569
Maybe they'll show us sitting here
on TV. I bet that's it.

1285
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:16,009
- Where did you get all that money?
- I sold Mr. Peterson my chemical set.

1286
01:32:18,209 --> 01:32:22,409
- Two minutes, maestro.
- Borov will be there.

1287
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:25,889
Have never been late
for performance in whole career.

1288
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:30,809
- You say you from magazine?
- Uh, yes. American Ballet magazine.

1289
01:32:30,889 --> 01:32:34,689
We want a picture of the world's
greatest conductor, Maestro Borov.

1290
01:32:34,769 --> 01:32:38,809
You flatter me.
So, shoot me quick.

1291
01:32:38,889 --> 01:32:41,569
Uh, drinking this milk.

1292
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:43,729
- Milk?
- Yes.

1293
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:46,409
We drink vodka, little tlower.

1294
01:32:46,489 --> 01:32:50,089
Oh, well, no, thank you.
Please, maestro. This milk.

1295
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:53,089
You see, our president
has asked us to drink more milk...

1296
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:55,009
and it would be
a goodwill gesture.

1297
01:32:55,049 --> 01:32:56,449
- President?
- Yes.

1298
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:59,209
Oh, won't you, please, maestro...

1299
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:01,129
to improve our relations?

1300
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:04,569
You are pretty enough
to be un-American.

1301
01:33:06,769 --> 01:33:10,169
All right. Here we go.
Drink up. That's it.

1302
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:15,209
Now keep drinking until I frame you...
Uh, frame you pertectly. All right.

1303
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:17,569
Bottoms up. That's it.

1304
01:33:22,289 --> 01:33:23,609
Very good.

1305
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,649
You've got it. I mean, gotcha!

1306
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:32,289
See you atter, could be?

1307
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:35,649
- I'll catch up with ya.
- And for you I do not go too fast.

1308
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:38,089
We shall see.

1309
01:33:39,129 --> 01:33:41,209
Good-bye. Thank you.

1310
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:54,209
Mission accomplished.

1311
01:33:54,249 --> 01:33:55,689
- He drank it?
- Yeah.

1312
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:57,609
My formula works on chickens
and Randolph's turtle...

1313
01:33:57,689 --> 01:33:59,049
but I don't know about humans.

1314
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:01,129
Well, it it doesn't,
we're no worse otf...

1315
01:34:01,209 --> 01:34:03,369
but if it does, this will be
the shortest ballet in history.

1316
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:05,689
And now, ready America and Canada?

1317
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:08,609
Because here we go out
to Columbus, Ohio...

1318
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:11,689
where the Moscow Ballet dances
"The Rose Adagio"...

1319
01:34:11,769 --> 01:34:13,689
from Tchaikovsky's
Sleeping Beauty...

1320
01:34:13,729 --> 01:34:16,409
conducted by Maestro Borov.

1321
01:34:16,449 --> 01:34:19,609
Take it away, CBS Columbus, Ohio.

1322
01:34:19,649 --> 01:34:21,529
We're on. Up on one.

1323
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:31,289
Lights.

1324
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:38,409
Camera two, can you move to your right
just a couple of teet?

1325
01:36:07,969 --> 01:36:10,049
Magniticent.

1326
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:32,969
It's not gonna work.

1327
01:37:16,209 --> 01:37:18,809
This is crazy. That's not the way
it was rehearsed.

1328
01:37:20,729 --> 01:37:23,129
What is it, sabotage?

1329
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:21,929
We'll have to fill some time.
Put the Birdie song back in.

1330
01:38:22,009 --> 01:38:23,369
Gotcha, Ed.

1331
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:25,369
Take over.
Be prepared tor the Birdie spot.

1332
01:38:32,729 --> 01:38:35,849
Albert, "One Last Kiss" is back in.
Find Conrad. Rosie, get Kim.

1333
01:38:35,929 --> 01:38:38,729
- Right.
- Put the Birdie spot on stage. Let's go!

1334
01:38:49,609 --> 01:38:52,089
McAtee, hurry up! Come on.
Let's go. The song is back in!

1335
01:38:52,129 --> 01:38:55,169
- A miracle happened! Let's go!
- What? Come on!

1336
01:39:18,089 --> 01:39:20,289
Are you crazy, Borov?

1337
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:47,409
I've never seen such speedin' dancers.
Thank you, Moscow Ballet...

1338
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:49,889
for that brilliant
and unexpected bit of burlesque.

1339
01:39:49,969 --> 01:39:51,649
And now, another great treat...

1340
01:39:51,729 --> 01:39:54,209
Conrad Birdie.

1341
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:24,769
On behalt of all the members...

1342
01:40:24,849 --> 01:40:29,049
ot the Sweet Apple chapter
of the Conrad Birdie Fan Club...

1343
01:40:33,089 --> 01:40:34,969
We wish to express to you...

1344
01:40:35,009 --> 01:40:37,729
our great pride in your brave deed.

1345
01:40:37,769 --> 01:40:40,449
- Hiya, Ed.
- Oh, no.

1346
01:40:43,049 --> 01:40:44,929
Oh, hi. How are ya?

1347
01:40:51,729 --> 01:40:54,129
I wish to convey our deep pride...

1348
01:40:54,209 --> 01:40:56,089
in your brave deed, namely...

1349
01:40:56,129 --> 01:40:58,969
As a citizen,
I'm proud to have Conrad...

1350
01:40:59,009 --> 01:41:02,729
defend my family
and the McAfee Fertilizer Company.

1351
01:41:04,209 --> 01:41:06,169
Conrad, sing!

1352
01:41:07,249 --> 01:41:10,929
Oh, one last kiss

1353
01:41:11,009 --> 01:41:13,049
Give me one last kiss

1354
01:41:13,089 --> 01:41:14,969
It never felt like this

1355
01:41:15,009 --> 01:41:17,409
Nah, baby, not like this

1356
01:41:17,449 --> 01:41:19,609
You know I need your love

1357
01:41:21,329 --> 01:41:23,849
Give me one last kiss

1358
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:26,289
One last kiss

1359
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:28,089
Oh, one more time

1360
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:30,169
Mmm, baby, one more time

1361
01:41:30,249 --> 01:41:32,129
It really is sublime

1362
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,529
Ah, honey, so sublime

1363
01:41:34,609 --> 01:41:36,729
You know I need your love

1364
01:41:39,209 --> 01:41:40,889
Give me one last kiss

1365
01:41:40,929 --> 01:41:43,369
One last kiss

1366
01:41:44,409 --> 01:41:48,289
Baby

1367
01:41:48,369 --> 01:41:51,929
Give me one last kiss

1368
01:41:52,889 --> 01:41:56,809
Baby

1369
01:41:56,889 --> 01:41:58,849
Give me one la...

1370
01:42:07,409 --> 01:42:10,489
Yoo-hoo! Albert!

1371
01:42:13,569 --> 01:42:16,769
I saw it all on TV.
"One Last Kiss" was a disaster.

1372
01:42:16,849 --> 01:42:18,929
Who wants to buy a record
of a guy with a glass jaw?

1373
01:42:19,009 --> 01:42:21,609
Now will you take Mama's advice
and get out of show business?

1374
01:42:21,689 --> 01:42:25,529
I am! My song may be dead, but
my chemical formula works... on people.

1375
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:27,969
Shh. The Russians
may have this place bugged.

1376
01:42:28,049 --> 01:42:31,929
It was Albert's formula that made
the orchestra leader go that tast.

1377
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:33,689
My genius!

1378
01:42:33,729 --> 01:42:36,729
You gotta work on my cleaning woman.
She gets a dollar an hour.

1379
01:42:36,809 --> 01:42:39,169
Yeah. Mama...

1380
01:42:42,009 --> 01:42:44,329
Rosie and I are going
to Niagara Falls.

1381
01:42:45,809 --> 01:42:47,489
Well...

1382
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:51,969
it's about time.

1383
01:42:55,609 --> 01:42:58,849
Oh, Mae!
You have to come with us!

1384
01:42:58,889 --> 01:43:02,049
No. I'm one mother
doesn't mix in. Maude!

1385
01:43:02,129 --> 01:43:03,969
Don't tall in the pit, Maude.

1386
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:07,129
- Albert?
- Yes.

1387
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:09,369
I would like to do things proper.

1388
01:43:09,409 --> 01:43:12,249
So I would like the honor
of becoming your steptather.

1389
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:15,449
Is it all right, Albert?

1390
01:43:16,289 --> 01:43:18,249
Mama, with my blessing!

1391
01:43:18,329 --> 01:43:21,729
- I'm glad because we just got married.
- Yes.

1392
01:43:23,889 --> 01:43:28,049
- What a surprise!
- How exciting! It's beautitul!

1393
01:43:28,129 --> 01:43:30,049
- Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

1394
01:43:30,129 --> 01:43:33,489
Let's go, Maudie!
We're leavin' for Akron.

1395
01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:36,169
Hubby has to open a new bar and he wants
me to throw out the first beer can.

1396
01:43:36,249 --> 01:43:39,849
- Yeah! Good-bye, son!
- The falls are wet. Take your rubbers!

1397
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:42,009
- Bye!
- Yes, Mrs. Maude.

1398
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,969
How about that?
Maude and Mrs. Peterson.

1399
01:43:44,049 --> 01:43:46,169
- Oh, ready here, Albert.
- Be right with you.

1400
01:43:46,249 --> 01:43:48,449
No hurry, partner.

1401
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:50,369
I promise you one thing, snookums.

1402
01:43:50,409 --> 01:43:52,609
No matter how many millions I make
sellin' "Speed Up"...

1403
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:55,809
I'll still be the same,
humble, lovable guy.

1404
01:43:55,849 --> 01:43:58,689
And it any ot those hicks try
to push me around, I'll break 'em.

1405
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:06,129
Everything is Rosie

1406
01:44:06,209 --> 01:44:08,929
Since I found my Rosie

1407
01:44:08,969 --> 01:44:10,369
Same old words.

1408
01:44:10,409 --> 01:44:13,889
With a girl like Rosie

1409
01:44:13,969 --> 01:44:16,089
How could I be blue

1410
01:44:16,129 --> 01:44:17,849
Same eight bars. Now what?

1411
01:44:17,889 --> 01:44:21,449
Hand in hand, we'll mosey

1412
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:24,929
Me and little Rosie

1413
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:27,369
We will be so cozy

1414
01:44:27,449 --> 01:44:30,449
By a fire built for two

1415
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:32,769
Oh, Albert, you're too much.

1416
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:36,689
Oh, I once heard a poem that goes

1417
01:44:36,769 --> 01:44:40,249
A rose is a rose is a rose

1418
01:44:40,289 --> 01:44:42,169
But I don't agree

1419
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:44,089
Take it from me

1420
01:44:44,129 --> 01:44:47,609
There's one rose sweeter
than any that grows

1421
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:50,369
And that's my Rosie

1422
01:44:50,449 --> 01:44:54,209
I'm so glad she chose me

1423
01:44:54,249 --> 01:44:56,929
Life is one sweet

1424
01:44:57,009 --> 01:44:59,769
Beautiful song to me

1425
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:03,489
Everything is Hugo

1426
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:07,129
I will go where you'll go

1427
01:45:07,209 --> 01:45:11,009
With a boy like Hugo

1428
01:45:11,089 --> 01:45:14,169
How could I be blue

1429
01:45:14,209 --> 01:45:18,569
We will be so cozy

1430
01:45:18,649 --> 01:45:22,529
Just like Al and Rosie

1431
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:25,009
But we're gonna mosey

1432
01:45:25,089 --> 01:45:28,209
In a hot rod built for two

1433
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:33,849
- And that's my Rosie
- Gee, how delighted we'll be

1434
01:45:33,889 --> 01:45:37,849
- I'm so glad she chose me
- When you are cozy with me

1435
01:45:37,889 --> 01:45:41,889
Life is one sweet beautiful song

1436
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:45,969
When love is right
then what could be wrong

1437
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:48,289
Life is one sweet

1438
01:45:48,369 --> 01:45:52,609
Beautiful song to me

1439
01:45:56,449 --> 01:45:58,369
Bye, bye

1440
01:45:58,449 --> 01:46:00,809
Birdie

1441
01:46:00,889 --> 01:46:04,409
The army's got you now

1442
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:06,449
I'll try

1443
01:46:06,529 --> 01:46:08,769
Birdie

1444
01:46:08,809 --> 01:46:12,249
To forget somehow

1445
01:46:13,889 --> 01:46:16,289
No more

1446
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:18,649
Sighing

1447
01:46:18,689 --> 01:46:22,169
Each time you move those lips

1448
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,249
No more

1449
01:46:24,289 --> 01:46:26,649
Dying

1450
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:29,889
When you twitch those hips

1451
01:46:29,929 --> 01:46:32,089
Your swivel and your sway

1452
01:46:32,129 --> 01:46:34,009
Your super-duper class

1453
01:46:34,049 --> 01:46:36,049
There's nothing left to say

1454
01:46:36,129 --> 01:46:39,249
But, Conrad, you're a gas

1455
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:42,369
Bye, bye

1456
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:44,729
Birdie

1457
01:46:44,769 --> 01:46:48,369
Ta, ta, ol' sweetie pie

1458
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:50,369
Bye, bye

1459
01:46:50,449 --> 01:46:52,609
Birdie

1460
01:46:52,689 --> 01:46:55,169
Time for me to fly

1461
01:46:56,689 --> 01:47:00,849
Time for me to fly

1462
01:47:00,929 --> 01:47:05,769
Time to say good-bye

1463
01:47:05,849 --> 01:47:06,809
Bye, now
