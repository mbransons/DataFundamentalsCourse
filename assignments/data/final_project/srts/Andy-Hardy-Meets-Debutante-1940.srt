1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,700


2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,074


3
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:53,501
Andrew! Andrew Hardy!

4
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:56,302
If you're not down to breakfast
in 1 minute, I'll come up and get you.

5
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:00,160
I've been taught
never to come to breakfast...

6
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,020
...before doing my morning ablutions.

7
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:05,200
You know, Mrs. Hardy,
cleanliness is close to godliness.

8
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:23,301
Milly! Milly, come down here,
will you? Hurry!

9
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,902
Coming, Emily.

10
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:47,003
- Why Emily, dear, what's the matter?
- Milly, I think I'm going insane.

11
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, nonsense.
Now what is it, what's wrong?

12
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,400
Well, there you are.

13
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,200
Recipe for a chocolate pudding.
Read that.

14
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,900
Remove the mixture from the icebox,
add four eggs and...

15
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,100
Continued on next page, column two.

16
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,200
Pour it down the sink.

17
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:04,130
- Pour it down the sink?
- Add four eggs and pour it down the sink.

18
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,500
Now, am I insane or not?

19
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,300
Oh, somebody's cut out
a picture or something.

20
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,500
And we've been reading
'How to clean clogged drain pipes.'

21
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,600
Well, I thought that was a silly way
to make a chocolate pudding.

22
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,401
There's something very funny
going on around this house.

23
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:29,700
Only this morning I found two pages
cut out of the Home Fashion Guide.

24
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:32,950
I'm trying to finish this dress
without the pattern.

25
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,900
Maybe some pictures of flowers
on the other side and Andy cut them out.

26
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,450
What's happened to that boy?
I've called him twice.

27
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,700
Andrew Hardy, for the third time.

28
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:43,331
I'm practically there, Mom.
Gee, where's the fire?

29
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,100
- Fire?
- The way you expected me to get dressed...

30
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,450
...and downstairs I figured
maybe you thought I was a fireman.

31
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,200
Good morning.
Good morning, Aunt Milly.

32
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:52,600
Good morning, dear. Oh, Andy,
the pins! Did you prick yourself?

33
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,171
I'll get it, Mother.

34
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,000
Andy, how many times
have I told you?

35
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,200
Now sit down and wait
till I'm ready.

36
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,970
Not this morning. I'm botanizing.

37
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,300
I've got to collect 20 specimens
of wild flowers.

38
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:06,701
On Saturday? Is Mother's little lamb
feeling all right?

39
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,270
My dear mother, I'm studying Botany.

40
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,771
It's apparent you've never known
what it is to commute with nature.

41
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,672
Commune with nature.

42
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:17,700
Andy, stop eating that donut.

43
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,150
Botanically speaking, this isn't eating.
This is osmosis.

44
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,800
As in plants, so in human beings.
Eating is just osmosis on a larger scale.

45
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,530
Now take Dianthus careophyllus
or Rubus idaeus...

46
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:29,100
What kind of language is that
for a nice boy to use?

47
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,400
It's all right, Mom,
it just means raspberries.

48
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,650
Polly Benedict's father on the phone.

49
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,840
He wants Dad to meet him at orphan's
home positively before 1 o'clock.

50
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh, dear, and your father's
gone fishing.

51
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,400
Calm yourselves, ladies,
I'll get the message...

52
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,700
...to the good Judge Hardy
while doing my botanizing.

53
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,221
I know his favorite place to fish.

54
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,900
And if you hurry, maybe you can find him
before he catches anything.

55
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,600
Then we won't have to have
fish for dinner.

56
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,700
- All right, Mom.
- Let's see your Botany specimens...

57
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,130
...maybe I can help you classify them.

58
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:55,000
Marian, Marian,
would you have me cheat?

59
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,700
Why, do you know that it's dishonorable
for a student to accept help?

60
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,481
Andy! Andy!

61
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:06,042
Oh, that boy!
Now he's gone without his breakfast.

62
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,540
Don't worry, Mother.
Nature feeds its own.

63
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,841
Don't be silly.
Andy can't eat wild flowers.

64
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:44,000
Of course, Daphne, there's no chance
of me ever meeting you.

65
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,601
But oh, boy. They can't put you
in jail for dreaming.

66
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:47,300
Well...

67
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,000
what are you doing here?

68
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,200
I was looking for you, Dad.

69
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,300
In the back of a log?

70
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:58,800
No, sir.
I'm collecting Botany specimens.

71
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,300
What you want me for?

72
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh, Mr. Benedict wanted you to meet him
at the orphanage at one o'clock.

73
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,300
Sounds like trouble.

74
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,000
I hardly got my line wet.

75
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,650
Why don't you fish a little longer and...

76
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,800
Andy, it's taken me
two thirds of a lifetime...

77
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,680
...to learn that when there's
trouble ahead...

78
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,600
...there's no use trying to find
entertainment in the meantime.

79
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,101
So, come on to the orphanage.

80
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,400
Dad, I've been wanting to talk to you
for quite some time now.

81
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,600
Well, I've been around.

82
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:31,999
Shoot.

83
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,700
You want me to be a success in life,
don't you?

84
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,900
I certainly do.

85
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,600
Well, is it true
that all successful men...

86
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,801
...marry sophisticated women,
you know...

87
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,502
...women of the world.

88
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,903
I hardly think so.

89
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,904
But it'd help, though, wouldn't it?

90
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:53,700
Have a wife that could handle
chauffeurs and footmen...

91
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,900
and be at home as in a nightclub
as well as in a kitchen?

92
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,600
I see your point.

93
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,700
You know, you're a swell guy, Dad,

94
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,060
but I've often wondered how far
you'd have gone in this world...

95
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,300
...if you'd have married a woman
like Cleopatra.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,701
I don't dare think of it.

97
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:14,400
What about the nice old-fashioned girls
like Polly Benedict?

98
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:17,800
I've been going around too steadily
with Polly Benedict.

99
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm gonna have a little talk
with her about it.

100
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,000
I see.

101
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,501
Take the first turn for the orphanage.

102
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,102
Now wait for me.

103
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,750
In the meantime you might
cogitate on the fact...

104
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:37,350
...that Cleopatra brought disgrace,
disaster and death...

105
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,200
...to every man who ever
fell in love with her.

106
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:43,401
Death, where is thy sting?

107
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,800
Well, hello there!

108
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,001
You're new here, aren't you?

109
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,700
Please, yes, sir.
My name's Francis, please.

110
00:08:57,701 --> 00:09:00,201
I'm glad to know you, Francis.

111
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:14,200
- Hello, little girl.
- I'm a boy, please.

112
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,800
Hm, you talk like a little girl.

113
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,500
How do you ever expect to grow up
and be a big he-man?

114
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,800
Like you?

115
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,661
Yes, son.
Now look, my boy.

116
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:25,750
If you go through life
the way you're starting,

117
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,700
people are always going to be taking
your marbles away from you.

118
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,101
Let me give you a little
man-to-man advice.

119
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,502
Now...

120
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:35,970
The default of the bonds
in your trust fund...

121
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:40,971
...absolves the Cyrus Carvel estate
of any further financial responsibility.

122
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,900
Default of bonds?

123
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,700
Why, Cyrus Carvel left millions.

124
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:49,331
Yes, and he left a good half million of it
to maintain his old home for our orphans.

125
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:52,650
Sixteen homeless orphans
where the founder of Carvel...

126
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,100
...wouldn't want that to happen
any more than we do.

127
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,850
As my son Andrew would say,
'They can't do this to us!'

128
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:02,500
But that letter, Jim. Those big
New York lawyers can't be wrong.

129
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:05,850
No? I drew up the trust fund
legal papers myself.

130
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,950
They're absolutely foolproof,
I made sure of that.

131
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:10,551
Are you positive?

132
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,852
I'll stake my legal reputation on it.

133
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm so positive I'll go
to New York myself...

134
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,320
...and personally handle Messrs...

135
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,850
uh, Dabney, Court and Underwood.

136
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,950
Now what's your name?

137
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,200
My name's Butch and what
do you want to make of it?

138
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,000
There, that's swell, that's swell.

139
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:28,800
Now don't forget anything
that I told you.

140
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,000
Andy!

141
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,001
Hello, Polly.

142
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,300
Just run along and play
with your little bicycle, my little man.

143
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,800
Your uncle Andrew has a very
painful duty to perform.

144
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:48,301
I'm waiting for my father.

145
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,800
Say, Polly, I'd like to have
a little talk with you.

146
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:53,700
I'd like to have a little talk
with you too, Andy.

147
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,150
I don't think we ought to go
together so steadily.

148
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:00,999
What?

149
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,600
Well, relationships like ours sometimes
grow into more serious things.

150
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:09,601
And a girl of seventeen is always older,
and more mature,

151
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,200
more sophisticated than a boy
of the same age.

152
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,730
Why, you're crazy...
you're crazy, Polly.

153
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,900
- The situation isn't fair to you.
- Fair to me?

154
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:22,501
Who was it that failed in Geometry
the year I got B+?

155
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:24,350
And who was it said only last Sunday...

156
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,551
...that the Epistles were the wives
of the apostles?

157
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:33,652
As Mark Anthony said,
'Et tu, Brute!'

158
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:37,400
It wasn't Mark Anthony,
it was Julius Caesar.

159
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:44,000
Wouldn't you be happier with somebody
who could look up to you?

160
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,340
Look up to me?

161
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,800
Oh, my gosh!

162
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,700
Miss Benedict,

163
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,880
there are some girls of 17
that make you seem like a mere child.

164
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:55,901
A backward child at that.

165
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:58,052
Good day, Miss Benedict.

166
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,153
Well, I suppose I'll have to see you
at the editors' meeting.

167
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:04,100
But kindly continue to address me
as Miss Benedict!

168
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,800
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

169
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:21,260
Well, young fellow,
do you like it here?

170
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,561
You said a mouthful, toots!

171
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,500
The editor-in-Chief
of the Carvel High Olympian...

172
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,800
...requests the gentleman associate
editor to kindly pay attention!

173
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, I've got more important things
on my mind, Beezy.

174
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,001
Botany, for instance.

175
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,892
Say, Andy, can I borrow
your Botany book?

176
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,170
You cannot!

177
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,580
He probably has Botany confused
with Mother Goose...

178
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,250
...and he won't go to bed without it.

179
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,650
Okay, you rat!

180
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,700
The meeting will come to order
to approve the cover for the next issue.

181
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:02,700
Oh, here it is.

182
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,050
What?

183
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,680
Why, Beezy, you're not gonna put
Cynthia Potter's picture on the cover...

184
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,800
...and call it the most beautiful girl
in the world, are you?

185
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,600
Well, if she isn't, who is?

186
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,300
Maybe the most beautiful girl in the world
don't even live here in Carver.

187
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:19,200
Andy, please, I practically promised
Cynthia she'd be on the cover.

188
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,500
All in favor of Cynthia's picture.

189
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,540
- No!
- No!

190
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
Oh...

191
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,140
I vote for a cover with the most...

192
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:27,541
...interesting achievement
of the month by a student.

193
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,200
And I don't mean boyish pranks.

194
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,800
I hate to agree
with Miss Benedict, but...

195
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:36,000
- ...I vote for the same thing.
- Oh, I'm ruined.

196
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,601
Well, meeting's adjourned.

197
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,150
Thanks, Andy,
I'll give this back Monday.

198
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,540
Hey, you lay that down, Beezy,
that's my property!

199
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:44,141
Why, Andy, he doesn't mean
any harm.

200
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,100
Hey, look at this!

201
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:51,500
Daphne Fowler, Princess Royal
of the 400.

202
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:54,900
Look, Polly, the book's filled
with pictures of that dame.

203
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,380
Well, of all the ridiculous
little-boy exhibitions.

204
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
Andy's got a crush
on Daphne Fowler!

205
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:05,100
Collecting pictures of a perfectly
awful girl that he's never seen.

206
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:11,201
I have so seen her.
I... I met her about two years ago.

207
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:15,000
The first time I met her even,
she liked me more than she ought.

208
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:18,200
Why, Daphne Fowler goes around
with grown men.

209
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,500
She wouldn't even look twice
at a small-town schoolboy.

210
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:22,550
Oh, yeah?

211
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,980
Well, she was so crazy about me...

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,900
...she asked me to come back
and have the first dance with her...

213
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,240
...when she made her debut.

214
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:28,650
Then why don't you go?

215
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,100
Well, I have been begging my father
to let me go to New York.

216
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,650
- You could always run away from home.
- Sure, you can hop a freight.

217
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,070
Yeah, maybe you do things like that
and break your mother's heart.

218
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,100
But I've been brought up better.

219
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,800
Furthermore, I doubt if I could even
get away from New York...

220
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,900
...without having to marry her.

221
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:48,400
But of course he can't possibly
get to New York.

222
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,600
Of course it would be great
if I could get to New York.

223
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:55,201
But I suppose we all have our crosses
to bear in this unhappy world.

224
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:07,352
Well, good evening, everybody.
Here it comes.

225
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,400
Here what comes?

226
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,801
What you've been dying to tell us
ever since you got home.

227
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:13,700
Can't fool me, James Hardy.

228
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,901
I give up.

229
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:19,802
Well,

230
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,403
to make a long story short,

231
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:25,000
we're all going to New York City
for a visit.

232
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:28,000
- New York, all of us?
- How wonderful!

233
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,300
New York?
But we won't know how to act.

234
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:33,401
There's always Grandmother's book
on etiquette.

235
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,200
New York!

236
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:40,180
Yes, I've got to lick a big New York
law firm for the orphanage.

237
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,300
How's that sound, Andy?

238
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:46,600
Uh... why... I can't go to New York.

239
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,700
Well, miracles never cease.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,800
- Why?
- Why, I can't go and I won't go.

241
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,400
Here, here, here, wait a minute.

242
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:58,100
Why do we have to go to New York?
Why did we have to pick that place?

243
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,800
Why, in New York vice and corruption
forage rampant!

244
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,101
They'll tell you so in the paper.

245
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:07,200
New York's a sink of...of..
well, it's a sink.

246
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:09,801
I don't want to go,
I wouldn't be safe there.

247
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,602
Well, I've got to go to New York.

248
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,740
If the mountain won't come
to Mohammed,

249
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,480
Mohammed has to go to the mountain.

250
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,410
What would he want
with a mountain anyway?

251
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,201
You may never have another chance
to see New York.

252
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:22,200
What has New York have
that Carvel hasn't?

253
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:23,900
Just a lot of tall buildings.

254
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,900
And what do people do
when they get in tall buildings?

255
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,000
They jump out of windows,
that's what they do.

256
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,900
I tell you New York is a den of evil.

257
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,700
Well, son, New York is evil
in some of its aspects.

258
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,301
But so is every village and city
in the world.

259
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:41,780
But the fact remains,
we're leaving for New York.

260
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,781
James, you don't really
want me to go.

261
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
Why, there's my school,
and the expense.

262
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:51,400
Milly, when I married your sister
I said whither thou goest I will go.

263
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,700
And I might also have added
'I'll take your sister too.'

264
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:59,400
As regards your school,
I've already spoken to your principal.

265
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,760
And what about my school, Dad?
I'll miss my classes,

266
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll get behind, and I won't graduate.

267
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:08,601
I'll end up a homeless derelict
in the gutter

268
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,350
Aunt Milly is going to give you
your lessons...

269
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,000
...every day until we get back.

270
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,350
And I've wired Martha Booth
to find accommodations.

271
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,700
Then Andy can have Betsy Booth
for a playmate.

272
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:21,000
She must be 15 now,
a nice old-fashioned girl, too

273
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:23,551
I think it's wonderful.

274
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:27,100
Well, dinner's getting cold.
Come on, Andrew, eat your dinner.

275
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,970
A guy's world comes crashing down
around his shoulders...

276
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,302
...and you offer him corned beef
and cabbage.

277
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:41,800
Something tells me we have Mr. Andrew
Hardy right where we want him.

278
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:51,800
Hello!

279
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:54,240
This is Miss Polly Benedict speaking.

280
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:57,700
Oh... hello, Miss Benedict.

281
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,050
Yes, I've read the morning papers.

282
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:06,651
Well, it's not positive that I'm going
to New York with the family.

283
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,802
I don't feel so well.

284
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,003
Oh, you'll feel better just as soon
as you're on the train...

285
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,100
...speeding to the side
of your loved one.

286
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,860
You'll be glad to know
that we're printing the story...

287
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:21,570
...of your flaming romance with Daphne
Fowler in the high-school magazine.

288
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,800
You're gonna what?

289
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:27,001
But you mustn't print
anything about me and Daphne.

290
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,540
It's a secret.

291
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,100
Listen, Hardy, Cynthia Potter ain't ever
gonna speak to me again,

292
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,400
so you'd better make good
with that debutante.

293
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:37,700
Cause when you get home
you'll be the talk of the town.

294
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,401
Talk of the town, huh?

295
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:44,100
We just know you're going
to send us back a photograph...

296
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:47,100
...of darling Daphne and you
to illustrate the story.

297
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,300
You what?

298
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:54,300
You... and Beezy... agreed...

299
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,300
...you're gonna put it
on the cover too, huh?

300
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:03,201
Yeah... yeah...

301
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,300
Goodbye.

302
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,499
Andrew, we'll meet you
and your father at the station.

303
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,300
Be there early because the engineer
may be in a hurry to start.

304
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,600
And don't forget to turn the gas out
under the coffee pot...

305
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:23,499
...when your dad's had his last cup.

306
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,300
Well, did you tend to everything
on your mother's list?

307
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,200
Everything but the kitchen stove.

308
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:32,100
You better do that now.
I don't want any more coffee.

309
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,800
Now what was it Mother
wanted me to do?

310
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,301
Oh, yes, I know...

311
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm sure that's what Mother
wanted me to do.

312
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,101
Andrew!

313
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:58,902
Ugh...

314
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:01,703
Uuugh...

315
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,304
For goodness' sake,
what's the matter with you?

316
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:10,905
Don't worry about me, Dad.
Just go on and catch your train.

317
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:15,400
- Oh, what's wrong?
- I've had a complete nervous breakdown.

318
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:20,300
One minute I had my health,
the next minute I collapsed.

319
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:24,401
- Collapsed?
- I saw purple spots in front of my eyes.

320
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:27,402
Then everything went black.

321
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,400
I think I've got heart trouble.

322
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,930
I've just read a new treatment
for heart trouble.

323
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:37,700
It consists of grabbing the patient
violently by the back of the neck...

324
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, no, no, no, Dad, please
just leave me alone...

325
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:44,450
...just let me lie here
and die peacefully.

326
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:47,999
Andrew Hardy, if you aren't
up on your feet in 3 seconds, I'll...

327
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,101
Ohh...

328
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh, well, it was worth trying.

329
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,901
You... you come along.

330
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,250
Andrew, I don't want to pry
into your secrets,

331
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:02,400
but all this to-do about going
to New York has me worried.

332
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,200
Dad, I can't tell you about that.

333
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:08,500
But maybe if we sat down
and talked life over carefully...

334
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,500
...for, say, about half hour or so...

335
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,300
And carefully miss the train?
No, Andrew, we're leaving this minute.

336
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:17,400
- Come on.
- That's, uh... final?

337
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,001
That is final.

338
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,750
Well, we'd better get
a move on then, Dad, because I...

339
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:26,300
...set the clock back 10 minutes.

340
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,100
You did...
You what?

341
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:30,901
Come on!

342
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,500
It's stupendous!

343
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:50,100
- It's unbelievable.
- Even if I see it, I don't believe it.

344
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:51,700
- James.
- Hm?

345
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,201
- That building.
- What?

346
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:54,350
It's on fire!

347
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,151
Oh, Mother, that's steam escaping.

348
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,452
I guess I'm nervous about fire.

349
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,550
Andrew, are you sure you turned out
the gas underneath the coffee pot?

350
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:06,150
Mom, don't I always do
everything you tell me to?

351
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,820
James, Martha Booth's husband
is a rich man.

352
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:12,250
Suppose she reserves rooms
in some very expensive hotel.

353
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:16,250
Don't you worry, Mother, I got a telegram
on the train this morning from Betsy.

354
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,200
Her mother and father are out of town,
but everything's okay.

355
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:23,100
1057 East 49th.

356
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,800
This is what New York City
calls a maisonette.

357
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,130
An apartment remodeled
from one floor...

358
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,250
...of an old brownstone residence.

359
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,151
James, I smell coffee.

360
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:41,200
Of course you smell coffee.
There's a general housework girl here.

361
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,850
Why, it's Betsy Booth!

362
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,800
Sure, I'm Betsy.
I hope you didn't mind my answering...

363
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:50,201
...your telegram the way I did.

364
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:55,050
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hardy!
Do you like the apartment?

365
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:57,351
Isn't it cute? The servant girl
can't come until tomorrow...

366
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:58,800
...so I'm making some coffee.

367
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:00,801
Hello, Andy, gee it's wonderful
to see you!

368
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:02,500
Will somebody please help me
get out of this apron?

369
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:04,701
You know, I didn't think you'd get here
for half an hour yet.

370
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,200
Oh, Andy, it's so wonderful to see you.

371
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,900
I guess I said that before,
though, didn't I?

372
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,401
You know... well, welcome
to New York, everybody.

373
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,900
I'm all out of breath, ain't I...
aren't I?

374
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:16,800
Well, I'm a little out of breath
myself, Betsy.

375
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:19,600
Don't tell me you got this apartment
and hired a girl all by yourself.

376
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,601
Uh-huh, I sure did.

377
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:21,850
There, you see, Andy.

378
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:25,500
Even in New York a nice girl thinks more
about growing up to be a good housewife...

379
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,440
...than dancing the rumble.

380
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:28,900
Ma, rhumba!

381
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,101
I smell the coffee burning.
Oh, Andy...

382
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:33,500
I brought my own radio over
for you to listen to.

383
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,950
You see, Mrs. Hardy,
it's only common gratitude,

384
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:39,400
after all, back in Carvel Andy took me
to my first grown-up party.

385
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,201
Son, how do you do it?

386
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:48,100
Oh, Dad, she doesn't mean anything.
It's...

387
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,200
Well, it's hero worship, that's all.

388
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,301
Well, my little hero,
let's get unpacked.

389
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:59,150
Mother, I'll bet this will be one
of the most exciting times in our lives.

390
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,351
Why, I could lick my weight
in wildcats in this town.

391
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:07,252
Emily, don't tell me you actually
brought this book of etiquette.

392
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,900
Why, darling, that's the way people
conducted themselves...

393
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:12,780
...way back in the eighties.

394
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,881
Nice people never change.

395
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:18,000
James, do you think it's all right
for Andy to walk home with Betsy?

396
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:20,700
- Hm?
- Well, I mean, there are gangsters.

397
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:24,600
They might take Andy for a ride,
or put him on the spot.

398
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:29,999
Well, Betsy's a New Yorker,
so of course she carries a gat.

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,300
Oh, of course...

400
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:35,701
Oh, my goodness!

401
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,760
And what I don't know
about New York...

402
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,480
...I've been reading in the guide book
and I can show you everything.

403
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,240
Like the Statue of Liberty,
and Grant's Tomb...

404
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,500
- ...Rockefeller Center...
- Kid's stuff.

405
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:50,300
Yes, I... I suppose so.

406
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:53,000
Even if it is a little hard
around Rockefeller Center.

407
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:57,600
Oh, and here's Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

408
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,200
I was here at a wedding last week.

409
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,900
Aren't weddings wonderful?

410
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,700
I'll never know. I expect
to live and die a bachelor.

411
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,201
Here's where we live, see?

412
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,100
Way up on the top floor.

413
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:15,801
Sure, very interesting for tourists.

414
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,602
Yeah, I suppose so.

415
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:20,600
Well, gee, Andy, it was swell of you
to bring me home.

416
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:23,000
- Oh, nothing at all, Beth.
- Won't you come in?

417
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,101
No, thanks, I've got
to be going home, I...

418
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:27,700
I've got a desperate problem
on my hands...

419
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:29,350
It's me against the city of New York...

420
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:31,450
...and one of us is going to be ruined
in the struggle.

421
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:34,800
Say, maybe it would help you
if you used Mother's car...

422
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,500
...and chauffeur while the folks
are away.

423
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,200
Say, that would help a lot, thanks.

424
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,320
Only I think that...

425
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,300
...maybe she'd like me to stay
right with the car.

426
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,100
You know, to see that it'd be safe.

427
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,100
Well, sure, that's all right...

428
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,500
I don't mind you riding around with me,

429
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:49,500
providing you don't ask
any personal questions.

430
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,550
Oh, I won't. I'll just snuggle up
in the corner.

431
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,051
You won't even know I'm there.

432
00:25:53,072 --> 00:25:54,520
What time shall I bring
the car tomorrow?

433
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,340
What time do New Yorkers
usually get up?

434
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,150
What do you care? If there's anybody
you want to see, we'll wake them up.

435
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,600
All right, then let's get an early start.
Say about 6:30?

436
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,601
Oh, well...

437
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:04,860
I think there might be just
a few people in New York...

438
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,600
...that even we couldn't get up
that early.

439
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,001
Why don't we start about nine?

440
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:10,090
All right, nine it is.
Goodbye, Beth.

441
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,391
Goodbye, Andy.

442
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,300
Good afternoon, Miss Booth.
Lovely day, isn't it?

443
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,000
Kid's stuff.

444
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,101
Good afternoon, Miss Booth.
And how are you today?

445
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,502
I'll never know.

446
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:34,000
Good afternoon. There's some mail
on the drawing-room table.

447
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,800
Very interesting...

448
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,700
...for tourists.

449
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,200
Good afternoon, Miss.

450
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,100
Will there be anyone for dinner,
Miss Booth?

451
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:54,900
I expect to live and die a bachelor.

452
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,500
Mom.

453
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:05,700
Yes, dear?

454
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:11,200
If I asked you something
very confidential,

455
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,350
you wouldn't betray me
to your husband, would you?

456
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:16,700
My husband?
Why, my husband's your father.

457
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:17,701
Yes...

458
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,502
Oh, I see what you mean.
No, dear, no.

459
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:24,600
Look, Ma, if you were a stranger
in a strange city,

460
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:28,101
and you wanted to meet someone
that you'd never met before...

461
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:31,100
how would you go
about meeting them?

462
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:35,701
- Them?
- Say one or two, or just one person.

463
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,350
Well, I'd write them
a nice little letter.

464
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:40,900
Let's look at Grandmother Hardy's
book of etiquette.

465
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:43,901
That's it, Mom.
Saturate me with etiquette.

466
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:49,600
Of course a letter like this
couldn't be sent through the mail.

467
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,450
It would have to be delivered
in person.

468
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:54,251
Gosh, Mom, you must have been
reading my mind.

469
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,600
A letter introducing a young man
still unknown to fame...

470
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:02,800
...to a lady of fashion
or of distinguished social position.

471
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:08,401
'Dear Madam, permit me
to present to you my friend...'

472
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,102
'Mr. John Smith,'

473
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,500
Who's John Smith?

474
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,900
It would be you, dear.

475
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,301
Where was I?

476
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:22,502
'...to present to you my friend,
Mr. Andrew Hardy,'

477
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:26,450
'a gentleman whose polished manners
and irreproachable character,'

478
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,600
Boy, Mom, that's me all over.

479
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:39,770
Now, you wait here, Betsy...
and don't follow me.

480
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,700
No, I'll even keep my eyes shut.

481
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,451
- Oh, and don't you look, Prentiss.
- No, Miss Betsy.

482
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:10,952
Is she in?

483
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:14,453
- She?
- I mean, is Miss Fowler in?

484
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:15,900
I have a letter for her.

485
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,680
I'll see that Miss Fowler gets it.

486
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,781
Not this letter. This has to be
delivered personally.

487
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:24,582
Come in, please.

488
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,470
I'll speak to Mrs. Hacket
as soon as she's free...

489
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,000
...and you can give your letter to her.

490
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:37,800
- Who's Mrs. Hacket?
- Miss Fowler's secretary.

491
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm afraid you won't be able to see
Miss Fowler herself.

492
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh...

493
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:43,201
Won't you sit down, please?

494
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:46,102
Thanks.

495
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,350
- Oh, Mrs. Hacket.
- Yes, Miss Fowler?

496
00:29:59,451 --> 00:30:00,700
Telephone the fashion show,

497
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:03,360
say I'm sorry to be late
but I'm leaving here immediately.

498
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:04,900
I'll attend to it, Miss Fowler.

499
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:27,200
I know, you get paid by the picture,
that's why you take so many.

500
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,860
I get paid by the job, Miss Fowler,
but my boss wants 20 new poses.

501
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,661
Can we have the head a little more
to the left, please?

502
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:35,999
Thank you.

503
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,550
Mother.

504
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,100
What is it, young man?

505
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:46,801
Oh... I have a letter here
for Miss Fowler.

506
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:51,002
It's a very special letter
and it has to be delivered in person.

507
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,200
I'll take it, please.

508
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,301
No...

509
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, there's nothing in it
that a girl's mother shouldn't read,

510
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,100
so I guess it's all right.

511
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,100
What is it, Mother?

512
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,701
Nothing, my dear.

513
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:14,102
Come with me, please.

514
00:31:15,203 --> 00:31:17,703
- With you?
- This way.

515
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:24,250
You know, Mrs. Fowler,
it's going to be a real pleasure...

516
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,150
...to make your daughter's acquaintance.

517
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,500
Well, I'm afraid it won't be
as simple as that, you see...

518
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:31,470
my daughter has a great many demands
on her time and energy.

519
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,651
She can't accept
all the friendship offered.

520
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:38,200
And... well, friendships aren't
established by letters of introduction.

521
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,260
- They aren't?
- No. You see...

522
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:44,120
Friendships come as a result
of knowing the same people,

523
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:45,700
liking the same things,

524
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,500
having common bonds
of mutual interests.

525
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:53,451
You mean that I couldn't have
a mutual interest with your daughter?

526
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:55,452
I'm afraid not.

527
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:58,053
You mean I'm not her social equal?

528
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,500
Well, let us just say that your paths...

529
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,500
...seem to go in different directions.

530
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, you know, me... that is,
my family and me...

531
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:09,300
we're very nice people.

532
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:11,401
- Honest we are.
- I'm sure of that.

533
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:14,270
But there are millions
of nice people in the world and...

534
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,641
Well, Daphne can't be friends
with all of you.

535
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:18,700
You see what I mean.

536
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:20,351
Yes... I see.

537
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,300
You mean there's no special reason...

538
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:26,600
...why I should be friends
with your daughter.

539
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:28,700
- That's it.
- And...

540
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,300
...an awfully good reason
why I shouldn't.

541
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,280
I'm sorry, but, you know,
back where I come from...

542
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:39,281
everybody has a mutual interest
in everybody else.

543
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:41,900
Of course.
Goodbye.

544
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:44,000
Goodbye.

545
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,101
Oh... I...

546
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:54,550
- I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.
- Not at all.

547
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,151
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

548
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:19,752
Andy...

549
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,450
Andy, darling, what's the matter?

550
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:25,451
I just aged 50 years.

551
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:28,600
Wh...what happened just now?

552
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:32,400
Oh, that's right, I promised
I wouldn't ask any questions.

553
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:36,600
What happened to me
is a secret I'll carry to the grave.

554
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,240
Where to, Miss Booth?

555
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:39,750
Anywhere.

556
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,850
Anywhere where I can find some peace.

557
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:46,251
Grant's Tomb, Prentiss.

558
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:00,200
'Let us have peace.'

559
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:04,301
General Grant, you and me both.

560
00:34:04,802 --> 00:34:08,802
Well, let's go on inside.
Maybe the coffins'll cheer you up.

561
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:12,203
It's a fine world.

562
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:15,450
Back in Carvel there are people
waiting to laugh at my funeral and...

563
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:19,551
...here in New York they got coffins
to cheer me up.

564
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,152
Oh, I'm sorry...

565
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:26,153
I only meant that maybe the coffins
would make you be glad just to be alive.

566
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:29,354
Hm... there's something in that.

567
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,500
There's something, but not much.

568
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,100
Isn't it impressive?

569
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,901
Now don't you feel glad
just to be alive?

570
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:57,802
I never before really appreciated
the advantage of being dead.

571
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:01,540
Oh, Andy, couldn't you tell me
your problem?

572
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,771
I'm a woman, and maybe I could help.

573
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,772
I can't tell anybody.

574
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,700
Tragedy is gnawing at my vitals...

575
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,600
...but I can't tell anybody.

576
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,001
But you mustn't give up.
Look at Ulysses S. Grant.

577
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:17,200
He didn't give up when things
looked the darkest.

578
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:21,550
He never had trouble like I got.
All he had on his hands was a Civil War.

579
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, then you pretend
that all you have is a Civil War.

580
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,550
Andy, can't you tell me
what your trouble is?

581
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:37,001
Did General Grant talk
or did he act?

582
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:41,000
Then you won't surrender?
You'll plan a new campaign?

583
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:45,101
Betsy, I shall search out
the enemy's weakest point...

584
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:46,800
...and make use of strategy.

585
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:51,280
If I'm late for lunch, all the strategy
in the world won't help me with my dad.

586
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,311
Come on!

587
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,800
- James!
- Oh, hello, Milly.

588
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, how's the big fur coat
deal coming along?

589
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,000
Emily fall for it?

590
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,320
I've got Emily fooled.
She thinks the coat's for me.

591
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:09,800
But so far she says they're all
too young or too expensive.

592
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:14,400
You keep at it. I've wanted her to have
a good fur coat all her life.

593
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:17,100
But don't let on it's for her
until we get home.

594
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,180
Oh, I won't. She'd pop
right back to the store...

595
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,900
...and exchange the coat
for a new kitchen stove.

596
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:24,101
- Oh, James.
- Hm?

597
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:26,700
How's your orphanage business
working out?

598
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:31,101
Wonder if the children are home.

599
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:33,770
Milly,

600
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:37,900
I've been twice to the plush-lined offices
of Dabney, Court and Underwood...

601
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,300
...but it appears that mighty
Mr. Underwood is away on a shooting trip.

602
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:44,060
No one else around the office
seems to know what it's all about...

603
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:45,651
...or even think it's important.

604
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:48,752
So I'm going to court
and force a little action.

605
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:52,300
- Good.
- But don't tell Emily. She'd only worry.

606
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,000
Hello.

607
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,200
Well, who do you think you are?

608
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,401
Ulysses S. Hardy.

609
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,160
In the matter
of the Cyrus Carvel Estate...

610
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:22,500
versus the Carvel County Orphanage, Inc.

611
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:26,200
- Ready for the Orphanage, Your Honor.
- Ready for the Estate.

612
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,970
I'm Underwood.
My office didn't tell me about this...

613
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,900
...until your letter arrived.
Sorry.

614
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,700
Your name is Handy, isn't it?

615
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:38,301
No apologies are needed, sir,
but the name is Hardy.

616
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:40,602
Will you explain your petition, sir?

617
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,710
To force the Cyrus Carvel Estate
to resume supporting our orphanage.

618
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:49,300
If it please the Court, I can save
the taxpayers a lot of money.

619
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:54,700
Obviously you are not aware of this
amendment to the original agreement.

620
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:01,700
1931. Signed by Harland W. Wyatt.

621
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,180
President of the Carvel County's
Orphanage, Inc.

622
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,550
At the worst of the Depression,
Wyatt demanded...

623
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:11,050
...that we switch
the United States Securities...

624
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,700
...in the Orphanage Trust Fund
to European bonds.

625
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:16,901
I see.

626
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:21,202
Recent European developments...
those bonds are worthless.

627
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,400
Those European bonds defaulted.

628
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,800
The Trust has no further obligation.

629
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:30,100
This is Mr. Wyatt's legal acceptance
of the exchange.

630
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:34,900
The Cyrus Carvel Estate requests
that you dismiss Judge Hardy's petition.

631
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:39,200
Your Honor, this is a shocking surprise.

632
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,450
May I ask that this matter
be continued until Monday?

633
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:48,000
Which will give me time
to consider my position.

634
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,101
It is so ordered.

635
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,900
And we are happy therefore
to bring you the voice...

636
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:07,250
... of the glamourous and glowing example
of young American girlhood.

637
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:10,800
She who has been called the number 1
debutante of New York society,

638
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,901
Miss Daphne Fowler.

639
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:15,102
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

640
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:18,770
Ladies and gentlemen, as President
of the Dog Lovers Society,

641
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,660
I invite all dog lovers to a benefit
we are giving at the Club Sirocco.

642
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,060
The entire receipts of the Club Sirocco...

643
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,600
...will go to our fund for homeless dogs.

644
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:30,570
I especially want to meet all the people
who have with me...

645
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,900
...a mutual interest in the welfare
of our little four-footed friends.

646
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:39,999
Betsy!

647
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,900
- Mr. Andrew Hardy.
- Oh, show him in, please.

648
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,441
- Good evening, Betsy.
- Good evening, Andy.

649
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,550
- Did it come? Where is it?
- Yes. It's there in the guestroom.

650
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,943
- Don't move, don't look, just wait.
- All right.

651
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:10,100
Betsy, what you're about to behold...

652
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:12,301
...is something most children
are never privileged to see.

653
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:43,102
# Alone, alone with a sky of romance #

654
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:47,050
# Above, alone #

655
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:51,600
# Alone on a night that was meant #

656
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:53,620
# For love #

657
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,521
# There must be someone waiting #

658
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:02,052
# Who feels the way I do #

659
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:07,250
# Whoever you are #

660
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:13,551
# Are you, are you? #

661
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:17,052
# Alone #

662
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:21,030
# Alone on this night that we two #

663
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:23,453
# Could share #

664
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
# Alone #

665
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:30,100
# Alone with the kiss that could make #

666
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:32,200
# Me care #

667
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:36,801
# And when you come, my promise #

668
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:44,202
# To be your very own #

669
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,260
# Alone #

670
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:54,000
# Alone with a heart meant for you #

671
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,162
I'm ready, Betsy, here I come!

672
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh...

673
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,300
Ain't I something?

674
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:11,901
Andy, you're beautiful!

675
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:19,500
But don't you think there might possibly
be something wrong with the hat?

676
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:22,770
Yeah, I kinda thought
it was small too, Betsy, but...

677
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:26,000
...I didn't know how they were wearing
them this season in New York.

678
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,201
But you got a 6 7.8 didn't you?

679
00:42:28,222 --> 00:42:29,800
Oh, Andy, I got mixed up.

680
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,701
I got a 6 7.8 glove
and a 5 1/2 hat.

681
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:38,102
- Oh... what are we gonna do?
Uh... my Dad's!

682
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,600
Gee, that certainly was
a narrow escape.

683
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:56,501
- New York must be full of midgets.
- Here, try this one.

684
00:42:58,702 --> 00:42:59,802
Oh!

685
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:03,003
Your father must have a noble head.

686
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:04,804
Paper!
We'll stuff it with paper.

687
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,205
We can do it.

688
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:10,506
Oh, that's my dad's too.

689
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,507
I almost forgot all about a stud.

690
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,600
It certainly does look
like the real thing.

691
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:18,601
Andy, I don't want to ask
any questions but...

692
00:43:18,802 --> 00:43:21,800
I've heard that the Club Sirocco
is awfully expensive.

693
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:23,291
Think nothing of it, my child,

694
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:24,830
Even if it's the swellest joint
in New York...

695
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:26,640
...they couldn't charge
more than a buck for dinner.

696
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:28,440
Oh, but they charge much
more than that, Andy.

697
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:30,100
Oh, I've got money to burn!

698
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,550
However, Betsy, there is something
you could tell me.

699
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,300
- What?
- Well, most likely...

700
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,320
...the food in New York is different
than that of Carvel.

701
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:39,600
So maybe you could tell me
how to order a magnificent dinner, huh?

702
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,630
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't.

703
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:43,900
But I heard my dad say once...

704
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,720
...that if you want to go
to a strange restaurant,

705
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,301
and get the best food...

706
00:43:47,302 --> 00:43:50,202
...just ask the waiter
for the specialty of the house.

707
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,000
Specialty of the house, huh?

708
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:56,650
Thanks a lot, Betsy, thanks a million.
You've been simply grand.

709
00:43:56,671 --> 00:43:58,000
It's nothing.

710
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:01,200
You couldn't have done more for me
had you been an adult my own age.

711
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,700
Oh, gosh, I don't want to be late.

712
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:06,101
Where's my coat?

713
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:12,350
Andy, are you sure
you've got enough money?

714
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:14,440
- You know, that Club Sirocco...
- Betsy, please don't worry.

715
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:17,850
Listen, suppose the dinners are $2,
suppose the dinners are $3...

716
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,140
Oh, but Andy...

717
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:22,900
Listen, I've got $8 in my bankroll.
With $8 I could buy the Club Sirocco.

718
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:24,701
- Good night.
- Good night.

719
00:44:56,602 --> 00:45:01,800
# And when you come I promise #

720
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:09,201
# To be your very own #

721
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:14,202
# Alone #

722
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:21,303
# Alone with a heart meant for you #

723
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:28,004
# Alone #

724
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,300
Your check, sir.

725
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,601
Oh... thanks.

726
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:54,300
I beg your pardon, sir.
Have you a reservation?

727
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:55,400
The name, please.

728
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:58,800
Well... I haven't got a reservation
but my name is Hardy.

729
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:01,501
Which Hardy is that, sir,
if you please?

730
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:05,302
- My father's Judge Hardy.
- Oh, Judge, this way, sir.

731
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:11,103
Uh, I'm in the right place, ain't I?

732
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:12,280
This is the Club Sirocco...

733
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,900
...where Miss Daphne Fowler's
having her dog lovers party?

734
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:16,651
That's right, sir.
This is her table here.

735
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,652
Uh...

736
00:46:27,353 --> 00:46:29,553
What time do you expect Miss Fowler?

737
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:31,500
Not until later.

738
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:33,501
Your shirt stud, sir.

739
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,402
Oh...

740
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:39,673
Will you order now, sir?
Some hors d'oeuvres, perhaps?

741
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:42,380
I'll just take the specialty
of the house.

742
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:45,500
That'll be caviar Romanoff aux tortoni.

743
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:47,800
I'll have a double order then.

744
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:58,401
And after this
what will monsieur have?

745
00:46:59,502 --> 00:47:02,402
Just continue, my man,
the specialty of the house.

746
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:10,000
Shall I carve it, sir?

747
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,901
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:18,450
Say, waiter, isn't it pretty near time
for Miss Fowler to arrive?

749
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:19,900
Later, I believe.

750
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:23,000
For dessert, sir, may I suggest
another specialty?

751
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:25,701
Your judgement is beyond reproach.

752
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:35,000
We call this bombe ŕ la Corsican.

753
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:37,301
Ice cream with a French accent.

754
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:45,202
You look like a man
who needs a dog very badly.

755
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:47,503
A dog?
A worthy charity.

756
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:49,000
I'll buy one.

757
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,600
Each one autographed
by Miss Fowler in person.

758
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,500
Miss Fowler! Is she here?

759
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,201
Not until later, I believe.

760
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:57,802
$20, please.

761
00:47:59,703 --> 00:48:01,500
- $20?
- Yes, sir.

762
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:05,500
Oh, no, thank you, I mean...

763
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:07,101
That is, I just noticed
that the little dogs...

764
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:10,300
...they were made of fur and I'm
very allergic to fur, no thank you.

765
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:13,030
Imagine charging $20
for a little 10c dog like that.

766
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:15,760
At that rate they'd charge you...
Well...

767
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:30,361
Waiter.

768
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:31,780
Excuse me.

769
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,000
Something else, sir?

770
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,001
How much is it costing me
for this dinner?

771
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:41,102
Um...

772
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:44,000
$3.75, $4, $12...

773
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:46,101
in between $35 and $40, sir.

774
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:51,802
30 or 40?

775
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:54,003
Yes, sir.
Anything else, sir?

776
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:55,704
Yes...

777
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:59,405
You can take me to see the proprietor.

778
00:49:00,806 --> 00:49:02,800
He said he was Judge Hardy's son.

779
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:05,500
And I don't want to offend
anyone connected with a judge.

780
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:08,901
I don't seem to recall
any Judge Hardy in this city.

781
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:12,400
My father is Judge Hardy of Carvel.

782
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:14,601
What's Carvel?
Some little hillbilly town?

783
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:19,002
We're not hillbillies.
We wear shoes every day

784
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:21,703
Oh, well that's a big help.

785
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:23,600
And dress suits every night too?

786
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:26,400
I...

787
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,201
I rented this.

788
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,600
Putting on a big front, eh?

789
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,801
You also told Fred here that you were
a friend of Daphne Fowler's.

790
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:38,999
I did not.
I just asked if she was coming.

791
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,600
I've never exactly met Miss Fowler.

792
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:44,501
Just an all-around-four-flusher.

793
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:47,900
You should have seen the way he ordered.
He didn't even glance at the menu.

794
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,600
You could've at least
looked at the prices, couldn't you?

795
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:52,600
Yes.

796
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:54,900
But you wanted everybody to think
you were a big shot.

797
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,401
Yes, I did.

798
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:03,600
Well, what are we going to do
about this $34.75?

799
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:06,701
Well...

800
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,700
I've got $8 and...

801
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:14,500
...maybe I could work out
the balance by...

802
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,231
...washing dishes, or I could...

803
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:19,632
...or I could send you $1 a week...

804
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,300
Please, don't send me
to jail, will you?

805
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,230
You don't want to bring
your poor father...

806
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:28,400
...down in gray hairs
to his grave, eh?

807
00:50:29,701 --> 00:50:31,801
He's pretty gray-haired already.

808
00:50:34,002 --> 00:50:35,800
Well, I know your type.

809
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:39,500
You're just a small-town sport,
not dry behind the years yet.

810
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,360
Because you were king of kids
in your own hometown...

811
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:44,400
...you've got delusions of grandeur.

812
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:49,200
When I was a boy we used to call
your kind 'too big for their britches'.

813
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:52,700
But I don't think you even rate jail.

814
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:55,701
I think you need a good spanking.

815
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,802
Fred, put bub in a taxi.

816
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:04,303
Be sure the driver
gets the right address.

817
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:06,200
Come on, son.

818
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:32,420
- Oh, come in, come in, Betsy.
- Good morning. May I see Andy, please?

819
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:35,661
He must have got in
pretty late last night.

820
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:38,992
- We were asleep.
- Oh, I won't wake him then.

821
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:44,000
Oh, boy, he must have had
a big night last night.

822
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,800
It's time for him to get up.

823
00:51:46,901 --> 00:51:50,800
Andrew.
Andrew! Wake up!

824
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,602
It's Betsy Booth.

825
00:51:57,203 --> 00:51:58,803
Good morning, Betsy.

826
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:00,999
Good morning, Dad.

827
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,600
Good morning, son.

828
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:05,651
Gee, you sure look
like a gorgeous wreck.

829
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:08,252
Come in, please.

830
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:12,700
Tell me all about it.

831
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:17,201
Andy, what's wrong?

832
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,502
I don't care to discuss it.

833
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:24,603
I'm sorry.
I brought back your clothes.

834
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:28,750
Yeah, I packed the dress suit there...
I was going to bring it back.

835
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:32,540
At the present time I don't care
to come in contact with my family.

836
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,620
You've been simply wonderful
to me, Betsy,

837
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:37,721
but I just don't care to talk about
anything now, you know what I mean?

838
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,422
All right.

839
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:45,800
Well, I... I hope I'll be seeing you
when you feel better.

840
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:48,281
Yeah, sure, I'll call you as...

841
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:51,000
...as soon as the world is normal again.

842
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,100
Whenever it is.

843
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:56,700
Oh, my father's shirt stud,
it's in here all right, isn't it?

844
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:02,780
The stud, yeah... well, Betsy,
it was a little loose...

845
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,020
...and I thought that maybe I'd have
it fixed before I brought it back.

846
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:09,200
Oh, fine. My father's very keen
about that stud.

847
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:12,101
He paid $400 for it.
Bye, Andy.

848
00:53:22,102 --> 00:53:24,202
$400!

849
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:28,503
Bye, Judge Hardy. And don't be worried
about Andy and me being mysterious.

850
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:30,900
What I'm worried about isn't Andy.

851
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,300
Bye.

852
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:36,301
Or maybe it is.

853
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:52,000
Some mail for you.

854
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,800
It's from Polly Benedict
and F. Bacon Anderson.

855
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,601
F. Bacon Anderson, I presume,
is Beezy?

856
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,302
Bad news?

857
00:54:54,303 --> 00:54:57,343
Andy, I have problems of my own but...

858
00:54:57,999 --> 00:54:59,999
...but I can help you if I could.

859
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,300
- You can't help with this.
- Help with what?

860
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:12,700
Oh, it's not your fault, Dad,
more than it is mine,

861
00:55:12,731 --> 00:55:14,501
you being born what you are and...

862
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,700
...and me what I am.

863
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:18,701
What are you?

864
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:21,180
Dad,

865
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,802
why couldn't I have had a family
who had money,

866
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:28,540
family trees and, you know,
that kind of stuff?

867
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,341
You have a family tree.

868
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:32,180
You have parents, and grandparents,

869
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:35,600
and great-grandparents
like every living soul in the world.

870
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:38,082
- That's not what I mean.
- Well, what do you mean?

871
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,200
Why couldn't we have had class,
money, and social position?

872
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:44,000
Why couldn't we have been
somebodies instead of nobodies?

873
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,650
Gee, for the first time
in my life I've realized...

874
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,501
... I'm not as good
as somebody else.

875
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:51,650
You do, eh?

876
00:55:56,751 --> 00:56:01,250
You get your hat and coat...
and come with me.

877
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:09,151
What's this place?

878
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:14,000
This is the Hall of Fame
of New York University.

879
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,661
Dedicated in humble tribute...

880
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:22,400
to mighty men which were of old
men of renown.

881
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,501
I brought you here
to show you some nobodies...

882
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:33,902
...that turned out to be somebodies.

883
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:38,500
I never thought I'd hear you,
my own son,

884
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,801
...deny the very soil you walk on.

885
00:56:41,302 --> 00:56:43,002
The soil that was earned for you...

886
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:47,403
...by the blood and tears of men
who said that all men in America...

887
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:48,900
...should be equal.

888
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:50,501
Equal.

889
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,102
That's funny.

890
00:56:54,003 --> 00:56:57,900
Well, equal in that they shall all have
equal opportunity.

891
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,300
Alexander Hamilton.

892
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,501
Patrick Henry.

893
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:10,802
Andrew Jackson.

894
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:15,503
They left you a heritage
of freedom and equality.

895
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:18,000
A heritage you should fight to keep.

896
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:21,500
Instead of kicking it around,
sniveling about class,

897
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,700
money and social position.

898
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:25,670
What's all that talk got to do
with the fact...

899
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,870
...that I've got to go back to Carvel...

900
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:29,500
...and face the worse punishment
a guy ever had to take?

901
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,820
Punishment.

902
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,000
There's a man over there.

903
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:41,101
Born a poor boy.
He took quite a bit of punishment.

904
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:47,332
That was fine 100 years ago,
when a guy had a chance but...

905
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,353
Now there's millions
of people like us that...

906
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:54,200
Well, I don't want to talk about it.
You don't understand and you never will.

907
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,401
Oh...

908
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:59,652
- You've reached that age, eh?
- What's age got to do with it?

909
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:06,070
Back in a little tank-town like Carvel
I might be king of the kids...

910
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:07,900
...but here in New York I'm...

911
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,900
...just a small-town hick
with delusions of grandeur and...

912
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:16,900
...and you're just a country judge
that nobody ever heard of.

913
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:27,801
When a boy's stupid,
he's just stupid, that's all.

914
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:30,602
Come on home.

915
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:39,700
Reduced to these basic
chemical elements, therefore,

916
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:42,900
the human body has a commercial value
of about 90c.

917
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:44,601
I'll sell out cheaper.

918
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,802
Name me 5 of those elements, Andrew.

919
00:58:49,203 --> 00:58:55,500
Calcium, sodium, phosphorus, iron...
and misery, I guess.

920
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:02,301
Andrew, have you had a row
with your father?

921
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:05,403
I thought so.

922
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:07,200
That's why I suggested your lessons...

923
00:59:07,221 --> 00:59:10,101
... instead of your going with him
to see the Statue of Liberty.

924
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:17,800
Headache no better, dear?

925
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:23,101
- The orphanage case?
- Yes.

926
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,800
They got me licked.

927
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:31,201
And all because Harlan Wyatt
lost faith in his own country.

928
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,999
Oh, those poor children.

929
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,300
And I was so sure of coming to New York
and showing them a thing or two.

930
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:42,700
I guess this town's too big for me.

931
00:59:42,731 --> 00:59:44,901
Oh don't, dear, please.

932
00:59:46,502 --> 00:59:49,102
Come on, you two,
we can see it beautifully now.

933
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:57,803
In this city that doesn't appreciate
my husband, I don't think much of.

934
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,300
And I wouldn't hesitate to say it
to the mayor himself.

935
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:09,600
Well! I'd think that every man,
woman and child in America...

936
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,800
...would be grateful
to what that stands for.

937
01:00:11,831 --> 01:00:13,700
The flame of liberty.

938
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:15,101
Flame?

939
01:00:15,702 --> 01:00:20,500
James, even if our home is just
a little house in a little town,

940
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:24,000
there'd be something in the New York
papers if it burned down, wouldn't there?

941
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,560
Mother, is the gas
under your coffee pot...

942
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,950
...all that the Statue of Liberty
means to you?

943
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,951
No, James Hardy, it isn't.
It means that...

944
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:37,952
that people can't get together
behind somebody else's back...

945
01:00:38,453 --> 01:00:41,953
...and conspire to take away
their privileges.

946
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:43,954
Not bad, Mother, not bad.

947
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:46,355
Take away their privileges, huh?

948
01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:52,250
Take away their privileges?
Why, of course!

949
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:54,870
- Why didn't I think of that?
- Think of what?

950
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:58,900
Mother, you just said, 'Conspire behind
their back to take away their privileges.

951
01:00:58,901 --> 01:01:01,660
I believe you've saved the orphanage.

952
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:05,100
Now listen. I'm going to hop a plane
and fly back to Carvel.

953
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:08,600
So, Marian, you have Andrew down
at the Courthouse Monday morning at 9:30

954
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:10,660
...with my briefcase and papers...

955
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:15,200
The Cyrus Carvel Estate versus
the Carvel County Orphanage Inc.

956
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:18,800
If it please the court,
I'm Judge Hardy's son.

957
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:22,001
He told me to meet him here
at 9:30 and it's past ten...

958
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,670
He's got to be here soon.

959
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,400
We'll give him every opportunity.

960
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:31,900
I ask the court to pardon
for being late.

961
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:37,800
There is one essential point of law.

962
01:01:37,801 --> 01:01:40,000
An agreement entered into
by two parties...

963
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:41,500
...for the benefit of the third party.

964
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:44,500
...cannot be amended without
the consent of the third party

965
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,041
And the third party
specifically mentioned...

966
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:48,842
...in our original agreement...

967
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,543
...is,

968
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,444
I quote...

969
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:57,555
'The creation and maintenance
of the Carvel Orphan's Home...

970
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:01,400
for the benefit of all homeless
orphans of Carvel...

971
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,301
...under the age of 18 years.

972
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:09,002
I would like to amend my petition
to name a new petitioner.

973
01:02:09,053 --> 01:02:12,000
And who is the new petitioner,
Judge Hardy?

974
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:13,600
Just a minute, just...

975
01:02:25,401 --> 01:02:27,800
Your Honor, this is the new petitioner.

976
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:33,001
One of the homeless orphans of Carvel
under 18 years of age.

977
01:02:33,002 --> 01:02:36,250
With the Court's permission I should like
to question the petitioner.

978
01:02:37,371 --> 01:02:40,800
Francis, did you ever sign...

979
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:43,500
an amendment to the original
trust agreement...

980
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,900
...between the Carvel Orphan's Home...

981
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:49,000
...and the trustees of the estate
of Cyrus Carvel?

982
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:50,601
No, Your Honor.

983
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,002
No, Your Honor.

984
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:56,700
It is our contention that Mr. Underwood...

985
01:02:56,721 --> 01:03:00,091
...is therefore obligated to put back
the United States securities...

986
01:03:00,122 --> 01:03:01,700
...eliminated by the amendment.

987
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:04,160
...and to continue payments
to the orphanage.

988
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,000
If Your Honor please...

989
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,820
...I don't think that I would care
to oppose this new petitioner...

990
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:12,920
...before a jury of 12 good Americans
and truth.

991
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:16,000
And if Your Honor will consent
to a further adjournment,

992
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,880
I am certain that we can work out...

993
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,740
...an arrangement satisfactory
to everybody.

994
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:24,600
- So ordered.
- How does that strike you, Francis?

995
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:27,000
You said a mouthful, toots.

996
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:36,331
Off the record, I should like to remark
that in my opinion...

997
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:38,800
...Judge Hardy has also
said a mouthful.

998
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:43,601
Certainly nobody in this country wants
to see helpless orphans left uncared for.

999
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:45,602
Most admirable, Judge Hardy.

1000
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:48,703
- Thank you, sir.
- Next case!

1001
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:56,800
What about my club for lunch,
Judge Hardy?

1002
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:01,400
- I don't want a club.
- Well, what do you want, sonny?

1003
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:04,401
My name's Butch and I want
to go back there.

1004
01:04:04,422 --> 01:04:07,360
- What for?
- I want to watch His Honor...

1005
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:09,200
...in the black nightshirt.

1006
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:13,560
Well, supposing I take Butch home
for the day?

1007
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:18,780
My wife and I haven't had children
of ours for 30 years.

1008
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,300
- Well, think you'd enjoy him for a day?
- I think I would.

1009
01:04:23,301 --> 01:04:27,300
And, speaking of children,
what's become of your son?

1010
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,200
Forgot all about him.

1011
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,640
Well, I think he went on home.

1012
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:38,800
Well, I'll have the youngster
home by sundown.

1013
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:41,500
- Goodbye, Butch.
- Goodbye, toots.

1014
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:53,601
Dad!

1015
01:04:55,002 --> 01:04:56,100
Yes?

1016
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:00,900
Dad,

1017
01:05:01,341 --> 01:05:04,101
I just wanted to tell you
how proud I am...

1018
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:06,902
You showing up that Mr. Underwood.

1019
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,803
That's not the real point.

1020
01:05:09,804 --> 01:05:12,704
But they say he makes over
a million dollars a year.

1021
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:17,600
Did you notice that the court treated me
with equal consideration?

1022
01:05:17,631 --> 01:05:19,501
Millions or not.

1023
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:21,102
They did, didn't they?

1024
01:05:21,143 --> 01:05:24,600
And the real point is
that I had an opportunity to win.

1025
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:27,130
A small-town judge...

1026
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:30,150
...with no social position
had an opportunity equal...

1027
01:05:30,171 --> 01:05:31,800
...with the big-city lawyer.

1028
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:35,301
An opportunity guaranteed
by the law itself.

1029
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:38,902
The mighty men of old made this
that kind of a country.

1030
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:44,200
And that kind of a country,
God willing, it always will be.

1031
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,301
Dad, you...

1032
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:50,600
...probably won't forgive me.

1033
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,101
You shouldn't ever.

1034
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:56,602
I don't deserve to be your son.

1035
01:05:57,103 --> 01:06:01,400
What I'm wondering is, do you deserve
to be any decent American's son.

1036
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:03,701
Gosh, I don't know what got into me.

1037
01:06:03,702 --> 01:06:07,680
I guess I was led astray when I put
all my faith into General Grant...

1038
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,981
...and he stabbed me in the back.

1039
01:06:11,999 --> 01:06:12,999
Yes?

1040
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,550
It all just goes to show you
what will happen to a man...

1041
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,651
...when he lets love blind him
to the principles of democracy.

1042
01:06:19,252 --> 01:06:21,552
Love again, Andrew?

1043
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,353
Yeah, love.

1044
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,100
I know it doesn't sound very logical
starting out with love...

1045
01:06:26,121 --> 01:06:29,800
... and ending up losing
a $400... pearl stud.

1046
01:06:31,701 --> 01:06:34,300
A $400 pearl?

1047
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:38,430
Well, I think during this subway ride...

1048
01:06:38,451 --> 01:06:41,331
...we'd better have a serious
man-to-man talk.

1049
01:06:41,352 --> 01:06:43,332
- Yes, sir.
- But this time...

1050
01:06:43,363 --> 01:06:46,400
...start at the beginning,
the very beginning.

1051
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:52,250
The beginning was when debutantes
started to wear strapless evening gowns.

1052
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:57,601
Well, that'll do as a beginning.

1053
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:58,702
Go on.

1054
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:05,003
- Hello, Andy.
- Hello, Betsy, come in.

1055
01:07:05,204 --> 01:07:08,700
Andy, you didn't call me
all day today.

1056
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:12,000
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm mad at the world.

1057
01:07:12,001 --> 01:07:15,700
I've got more troubles than anybody
since Job in the Bible.

1058
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:19,401
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if by tomorrow I got boils too.

1059
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh, you and trouble just naturally
gravitate to each other, don't you?

1060
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:29,101
If you're worried about losing
the pearl stud,

1061
01:07:29,302 --> 01:07:32,102
I'm not going to tell anybody
about your wearing it.

1062
01:07:32,403 --> 01:07:34,000
How did you know I lost it?

1063
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:36,401
You weren't a very good
actor, Andy.

1064
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:38,202
Now do you feel better?

1065
01:07:38,203 --> 01:07:42,100
I'm in more trouble than that.
Why, I don't dare go back to Carvel.

1066
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,901
I'd be the joke of the town.

1067
01:07:44,932 --> 01:07:48,200
The little children would follow me
down the street laughing.

1068
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:52,600
Won't you please tell me about it, Andy?
It can't do any harm.

1069
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,940
And besides, sometimes
a woman's intuition...

1070
01:07:54,961 --> 01:07:56,941
...is better than a man's brains.

1071
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,700
Betsy, back home I got a crush on a girl
that lives here in New York.

1072
01:08:05,301 --> 01:08:07,270
Oh, that's bad.

1073
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:10,750
That's nothing. I kind of boasted
around to some people in Carvel that...

1074
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:13,600
...she liked me.

1075
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:15,501
Doesn't she?

1076
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,502
I never even met her.

1077
01:08:17,503 --> 01:08:19,380
And then I got double-crossed.

1078
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,200
I got double-crossed right in the bosom
of my own family.

1079
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,541
My father makes me
come to New York.

1080
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:27,350
I... I don't get it.

1081
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:29,740
I've got to get a picture of her
and take it back home...

1082
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:31,600
...to prove that she's crazy
about me or...

1083
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:36,200
...maybe I can bury myself
on a South Sea island.

1084
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:39,000
I suppose she's awful pretty.

1085
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,800
Yeah, I guess so.

1086
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:45,101
But, you know, Betsy, I don't think of her
as being a real person anymore.

1087
01:08:45,602 --> 01:08:49,100
She's... she's more like a goal.

1088
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:50,901
Do you understand?

1089
01:08:51,202 --> 01:08:53,602
No, I don't, if you've got
a crush on her.

1090
01:08:53,623 --> 01:08:57,503
But I haven't... anymore.
Honest, Betsy, I haven't.

1091
01:08:57,504 --> 01:09:00,999
I've just got to get her blame picture
or I'll be ruined.

1092
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,700
That's all she means to me now.

1093
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:07,000
Yeah, but maybe if you really met her
you'd go crazy about her again.

1094
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:09,800
No, what I've been through
has knocked all that out of me.

1095
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:10,821
No...

1096
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:15,300
- What's her name?
- Daphne Fowler.

1097
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:18,301
Daphne Fowler?

1098
01:09:18,402 --> 01:09:20,550
Yes, the number one debutante.

1099
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:22,780
Oh, wonderful!

1100
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:26,800
Hey, are you nuts?

1101
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:29,580
Why are some men so dumb?

1102
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,400
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Tell you what?

1103
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:36,370
Hello, Stevens? This is Miss Booth.
May I please speak to Miss Fowler?

1104
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:38,171
Thank you.

1105
01:09:38,672 --> 01:09:42,372
- You know Daphne Fowler?
- Of course I do!

1106
01:09:42,373 --> 01:09:44,900
Hello, Daph?
Daph, it's Betsy.

1107
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:46,551
Oh, that's swell, Daph.

1108
01:09:46,572 --> 01:09:50,000
Listen, I want to bring a friend of mine
to your debut Monday night.

1109
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:53,300
Oh, he's a swell guy.
He's an old friend of mine.

1110
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:55,100
Oh, thanks, darling.

1111
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:56,850
Listen, are you gonna wear
that new black strapless...

1112
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:58,700
...evening dress you tried on last week?

1113
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:00,751
Of course, I would. It's stunning.

1114
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:03,652
All right, darling. I'll tell you
all about my friend later.

1115
01:10:03,673 --> 01:10:04,753
Bye-bye.

1116
01:10:04,854 --> 01:10:06,554
Well, that's settled.

1117
01:10:08,355 --> 01:10:10,900
Out of the mouths of babes!

1118
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:12,700
She's a real girl.

1119
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:16,200
Without her makeup on she hasn't
anymore glamour than I have.

1120
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:21,201
- She hasn't?
- Specially when she's not dressed up.

1121
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,992
Like on Botany trips.

1122
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:25,500
Daphne Fowler likes Botany?

1123
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,200
Uh-huh. Only uh...

1124
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:31,200
...she doesn't get much fun out of it
because flowers always give her hay fever.

1125
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,001
Hay fever, huh?

1126
01:10:33,602 --> 01:10:37,202
See, she's kind of susceptible to it
because... she's anemic.

1127
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:41,670
In fact, she's so anemic she has to wear
long woolen underwear.

1128
01:10:43,271 --> 01:10:45,300
Long woolen underwear?

1129
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:50,700
Gosh, it makes me feel kind of funny.

1130
01:10:50,801 --> 01:10:51,881
I know...

1131
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,182
Whenever I get disillusioned
I always get a pain in my stomach.

1132
01:11:00,683 --> 01:11:02,800
Is Miss Betsy Booth here?
They told me at her home she might...

1133
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:05,700
- I'm Betsy Booth.
- I'm from the insurance company.

1134
01:11:05,731 --> 01:11:08,400
Your butler reported a valuable
pearl stud missing.

1135
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:13,500
Oh, well... I loaned it to a friend...

1136
01:11:14,801 --> 01:11:19,100
I'll wire him right away in Chicago
and have him send it back.

1137
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,420
Have your butler let us know
when the pearl is returned...

1138
01:11:21,441 --> 01:11:23,200
...then we won't have to notify
the police.

1139
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:27,771
Police!

1140
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:31,172
So, that's the whole story,
Judge Hardy.

1141
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:33,520
Naturally, I didn't want
the kid's dollar a week.

1142
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,150
I know you don't, Mr. Carrillo.

1143
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:38,670
You'd be doing me a favor.
Oh, no.

1144
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,522
The show was worth
the price of admission.

1145
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:43,423
At two dollars a week
out of his allowance...

1146
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,120
...my son will have reason
to remember...

1147
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:49,540
...New York City for a long,
long time.

1148
01:11:49,924 --> 01:11:52,250
$37.25.

1149
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,700
I get the idea.

1150
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:57,030
Can I send some champagne
around to your wife?

1151
01:11:57,051 --> 01:12:00,531
Oh, no, thanks.
There is one thing.

1152
01:12:00,532 --> 01:12:02,820
Somewhere in his ventures...

1153
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:06,041
...my son lost a very valuable
pearl stud.

1154
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,500
This one?

1155
01:12:14,201 --> 01:12:15,201
Well.

1156
01:12:30,302 --> 01:12:33,600
There she is, Andy.
The Number One Glamour Girl.

1157
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,070
Are you sure she doesn't make
your heart get jittery?

1158
01:12:36,471 --> 01:12:39,750
No. Not a jitter.
I'm kind of fed up on glamour.

1159
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,720
I'm going back to the nice
old-fashioned girls.

1160
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:43,800
You know, the girls who can
look up to a man.

1161
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:47,200
Hello, Daph!

1162
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:50,550
Hello, Betsy, how are you?

1163
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,600
Oh, you're a knockout
on that strapless number.

1164
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,170
I'm freezing in it, you know.

1165
01:12:54,191 --> 01:12:56,050
- This is Mr. Hardy.
- Yes...

1166
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,351
May I present Mr. Andrew Hardy,

1167
01:12:58,372 --> 01:12:59,950
one of nature's noblemen.

1168
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:03,300
I'm most happy to make
your acquaintance, Miss Fowler.

1169
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:06,250
Please, Mr. Hardy,
from one dog lover to another.

1170
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:10,151
Mother, do you remember
Mr. Andrew Hardy?

1171
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,640
- How do you do? I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

1172
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:15,141
Shall we go in, Andy?

1173
01:13:15,162 --> 01:13:16,500
See you later, Daph.

1174
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:20,900
Andy, Betsy's told me
the amazing story of your life.

1175
01:13:20,921 --> 01:13:23,140
So restrain yourself
until the sixth dance,

1176
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,700
lover boy.

1177
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:57,000
There's my pet photographer.
Guaranteed not to let your eyes blink.

1178
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,301
Here's where we annihilate
the unbelievers in Carvel.

1179
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:00,850
Oh, gee, Daph, you're swell.

1180
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:03,930
Remember, the party doesn't get good
until after the mob goes home.

1181
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:05,131
Come on.

1182
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,832
Come on, Betsy, we're going to get
that photograph. Lead on, Andy.

1183
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,450
Betsy, I've been working on Andy,
and he's really crazy about you.

1184
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:16,151
But he doesn't know it yet.
Now, when the party simmers down...

1185
01:14:16,192 --> 01:14:19,150
...I'll arrange it for you to sing
and you turn it on hot.

1186
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:22,440
Oh, listen, I've got a song that
if it doesn't wake up Andy Hardy up,

1187
01:14:22,461 --> 01:14:24,700
he must be made out of concrete.

1188
01:14:29,901 --> 01:14:36,601
# I woke up this morning and the sun #
# was shining but I didn't see it. #

1189
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:40,900
# Think I drank my orange juice #
# But I don't know #

1190
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:45,000
# I wouldn't guarantee it #

1191
01:14:45,703 --> 01:14:49,580
# Wore my yellow dress, #
# or was it blue, oh, what's the use? #

1192
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,281
# I don't remember #

1193
01:14:53,782 --> 01:15:01,442
# Is it Monday, is it Tuesday, #
# Is it June or is it still December? #

1194
01:15:01,743 --> 01:15:06,050
# Sat beside my window #
# watched the couples strolling by #

1195
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,600
# Felt so sorry for myself #
# I couldn't even cry #

1196
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:16,000
# Finally I pulled the shade #
# I couldn't stand the gaff #

1197
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:23,600
# So I sat down #
# and wrote my epitaph #

1198
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:32,600
# I'm nobody's baby #

1199
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:36,500
# I wonder why #

1200
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:40,101
# Each night and day I pray #

1201
01:15:40,152 --> 01:15:43,502
# The Lord up above #

1202
01:15:43,553 --> 01:15:48,803
# Please send me down somebody to love #

1203
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:54,704
# But nobody wants me #

1204
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:58,955
# I'm blue somehow #

1205
01:15:58,999 --> 01:16:04,680
# Won't someone hear my plea #
# And take a chance with me #

1206
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:10,050
# Because I'm nobody's baby now #

1207
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:14,951
# Believe me #

1208
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:24,300
# No, nobody's baby #

1209
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:30,500
# And I've got to know #
# the reason why #

1210
01:16:30,501 --> 01:16:34,000
# Last week I was walking #
# down the street #

1211
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:36,140
# And met a boy and I said #

1212
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:41,141
# Hey, maybe I was meant for you #

1213
01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:44,842
# But he only tipped his hat #
# and shook his head #

1214
01:16:44,843 --> 01:16:49,250
# Kept on walking down the avenue #

1215
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:58,651
# Oh, nobody wants me #

1216
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:05,772
# I'm mighty blue somehow #

1217
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:11,773
# Won't someone hear my plea #

1218
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:16,774
# And take a little chance with me? #

1219
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:26,375
# Because I'm nobody's baby #

1220
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:30,000
# I'm blue somehow #

1221
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:34,550
# Won't someone hear my plea #
# And take a chance with me #

1222
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,700
# There's no denying #

1223
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:41,000
# I'm crying, I'm lonesome #

1224
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:46,101
# On my ownsome #
# I don't mean maybe #

1225
01:17:46,152 --> 01:17:57,002
# I'm nobody's baby #

1226
01:17:59,203 --> 01:18:02,100
- One more song.
- No, please, it's so late.

1227
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:04,200
One more song, just one more.

1228
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:10,800
- Gee, Betsy, you were terrific.
- Oh, thanks.

1229
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:15,000
- Let's get out of here, huh?
- Sure.

1230
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:17,400
I want to show you something
right here in New York...

1231
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:19,880
...that millions of people
never see in their whole lifetime.

1232
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:20,900
What?

1233
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,900
A horse.
Come on.

1234
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:32,140
You don't suppose something
will happen...

1235
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,150
...that'll keep you from going
home tomorrow?

1236
01:18:34,801 --> 01:18:36,700
No, we have our tickets.

1237
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:40,580
Are you sure it's all right
for you to stay out this late?

1238
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,200
You know, it's getting dawn.

1239
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:46,000
I'd stay out even if it wasn't all right.

1240
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:48,301
Well, I wouldn't let you. Your mother
expects me to take care of you.

1241
01:18:49,672 --> 01:18:51,600
It gives me the nicest feeling.

1242
01:18:53,301 --> 01:18:57,000
You know, I...
I wish I wasn't leaving New York.

1243
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:01,300
Oh, we can write to each other.

1244
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:02,601
Yeah.

1245
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:07,802
And every time I get a letter I'll pretend
you're sending me gardenias.

1246
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:09,500
Like these.

1247
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:13,301
Oh... I'm getting too old
for pretending.

1248
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:16,602
I will send you gardenias.

1249
01:19:16,993 --> 01:19:20,703
Only not right away on account of that
allowance trouble that I told you about.

1250
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:24,670
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm not cold. It's...

1251
01:19:25,471 --> 01:19:27,271
...it's just like Indian summer.

1252
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,100
You know...

1253
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:34,280
You know, you've changed a lot since
the last time you were in Carvel.

1254
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:37,881
- I have?
- Yeah, you're more grown up...

1255
01:19:38,682 --> 01:19:41,882
Gee, I completely almost forgot
how swell you were.

1256
01:19:45,483 --> 01:19:48,500
Maybe I wasn't as swell
when I was in Carvel...

1257
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:51,350
Or maybe you just didn't notice.

1258
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:57,651
One thing about me
hasn't changed though.

1259
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,252
No boy has ever kissed me yet.

1260
01:20:04,553 --> 01:20:08,153
You know, I was sitting here
thinking that I...

1261
01:20:08,854 --> 01:20:11,754
I wanted to...
I wanted to kiss you...

1262
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:17,700
Then when I think that I do,
then I'm afraid that I don't.

1263
01:20:18,201 --> 01:20:19,500
Don't want to?

1264
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:23,400
Sometimes wanting to and not wanting to
is better than wanting to.

1265
01:20:25,101 --> 01:20:29,999
I know... I knew you were thinking
about kissing me.

1266
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,400
And I was just as afraid you would
as much as I was afraid you wouldn't.

1267
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:41,001
Gosh, this is much too important
to be monkeying around with.

1268
01:20:42,802 --> 01:20:44,602
I'll remember that too.

1269
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:48,000
Till we can see each other again.

1270
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,201
Betsy,

1271
01:20:51,802 --> 01:20:53,702
I'll come back someday.

1272
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,903
If you mean that...

1273
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:03,104
...maybe you'd better kiss me
even if we both don't want to.

1274
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:12,605
Someday.

1275
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,706
Betsy, hey...

1276
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,607
Don't cry.

1277
01:21:22,908 --> 01:21:24,508
I know why you're crying.

1278
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:27,409
You're crying because...

1279
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:29,910
Because I kissed you.

1280
01:21:32,411 --> 01:21:35,700
It isn't that glamourous to cry.

1281
01:21:38,201 --> 01:21:42,501
It's funny. When a girl cries
because you like her...

1282
01:21:43,802 --> 01:21:47,800
why, even when her nose is shiny
she's glamourous.

1283
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:50,501
Oh, boy, that's what I call glamour.

1284
01:21:52,102 --> 01:21:53,602
I'll bet you...

1285
01:21:53,603 --> 01:21:57,400
I'll bet your Polly Benedict
couldn't be glamourous with a shiny nose.

1286
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:02,101
Polly Benedict? Just you wait
until I get back to Carvel.

1287
01:22:13,002 --> 01:22:16,702
New York is wonderful,
but it's always good to get home.

1288
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:18,570
Excuse me, everybody.
I've got to fix my hair.

1289
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:21,900
Excuse me, too, I've got a couple
of predatory insects to destroy.

1290
01:22:21,921 --> 01:22:25,330
Save me a trip, will you, son?
Drop Francis off at the orphanage.

1291
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:28,100
Oh, Dad, I'm too big to be
carting around babies.

1292
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:30,000
Too big for your britches?

1293
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:33,000
I'm sorry.

1294
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:36,301
Gosh, bub, what a lot of grief you're
gonna go through before you're my age.

1295
01:22:38,402 --> 01:22:41,202
James, I smell coffee.

1296
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:43,203
Now, now, Mother, that's...

1297
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:48,300
Wasn't I silly to worry?

1298
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:51,001
I just remembered what I told Andy
was to cancel the milk.

1299
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:55,000
Don't worry about the milk. I personally
told the milkman not to leave any.

1300
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:05,400
Hello, Polly? Have you seen your
advanced copy of the Olympian?

1301
01:23:05,401 --> 01:23:07,001
No, I haven't yet.

1302
01:23:07,002 --> 01:23:09,852
But it's here. I'll look at it right away.
Hold the wire.

1303
01:23:25,453 --> 01:23:26,800
I saw it!

1304
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:29,001
I... I...

1305
01:23:29,002 --> 01:23:31,202
But how could it ever have happened?

1306
01:23:31,403 --> 01:23:33,703
What are we going to do?

1307
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,104
Listen, I'll meet you
at the school right away.

1308
01:23:46,705 --> 01:23:49,705
Of course Andy had the cover changed,
but how did he dare?

1309
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:53,606
Oh, Beezy, he did know that girl.
What awful idiots we've been.

1310
01:23:53,657 --> 01:23:55,480
Cynthia Potter warned me.

1311
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,450
Andy kissed her the first time
he took her out.

1312
01:23:57,471 --> 01:24:00,051
I should have known better
than to trifle with a man like Andy.

1313
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:04,352
Beezy, maybe he's been secretly married
to that Daphne Fowler all the time.

1314
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:15,353
Andy Hardy, whose baby is that?

1315
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:21,654
I remember you, sister. You're the little
girl that failed in geometry.

1316
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:24,950
It was to protect this innocent babe's
future that we went to New York.

1317
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:25,971
What?

1318
01:24:26,472 --> 01:24:28,572
Oh, the orphanage.

1319
01:24:28,593 --> 01:24:32,703
Polly, look. I thought I was dreaming
but they're all the same.

1320
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:35,904
Of course, you printed up the story and I
supplied you with an exclusive cover.

1321
01:24:35,935 --> 01:24:37,600
And it's not faked either.

1322
01:24:37,631 --> 01:24:40,300
I trust that the younger generation
of this town...

1323
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:42,000
...has learned to respect its elders.

1324
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:45,300
I'm sorry, Andy.
I take back everything I said.

1325
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:47,000
I'll apologize in writing.

1326
01:24:47,031 --> 01:24:49,800
Not necessary at all, bub,
you're just too big for your britches.

1327
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:52,201
Take Francis back
to the orphanage for me.

1328
01:24:52,232 --> 01:24:54,400
Yes, sir...
I mean, yes, Andy.

1329
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:57,801
Come on. You and me we'll stop
at Cynthia Potter's.

1330
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:00,000
She's just crazy about babies.

1331
01:25:00,021 --> 01:25:02,000
You said a mouthful, toots.

1332
01:25:04,501 --> 01:25:07,401
So Daphne Fowler was in love
with you all the time.

1333
01:25:07,432 --> 01:25:08,900
Well, there's our picture there.

1334
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:12,141
Society's Number One Glamour Girl
trying to coax me for a smile.

1335
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:16,442
Swell girl, Daph.
Sort of a.. adolescent Cleopatra.

1336
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:20,743
- Perhaps you are too mature for me.
- No doubt, no doubt.

1337
01:25:21,244 --> 01:25:23,744
But you know, Polly, when I was
in New York I was thinking.

1338
01:25:23,765 --> 01:25:27,885
Sophisticated girls, they make you
appreciate old-fashioned girls.

1339
01:25:28,386 --> 01:25:31,486
You know, the type that starts to cry
when you kiss them.

1340
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:36,100
Are... are you engaged
to Daphne Fowler?

1341
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:39,999
Daphne? Oh, no.
Just another milestone in my career.

1342
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,500
You know, Polly. You used to be
a sweet, unaffected little child.

1343
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:48,100
And I always thought that you
kind of looked up to me.

1344
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,801
I do, Andy.
I think...

1345
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:55,000
I think I should cry right now
if you were to kiss me.

1346
01:25:55,100 --> 01:26:00,500
That's a good idea. But of course
you don't want to go to extremes.

1347
01:26:01,301 --> 01:26:04,000
When you kiss a girl,
as I was telling Betsy,

1348
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:08,500
- Betsy!
- Uh, why, It slipped... it slipped out.

1349
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:12,601
Can I help it
if I have irresistible charm?

1350
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:14,702
That's not charm. That's polygamy.

1351
01:26:14,723 --> 01:26:17,703
But, oh, Andy,
how we women love it.

1352
01:26:39,704 --> 01:26:42,180
- James, it's lovely.
- You really like it?

1353
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,730
It's beautiful.

1354
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:47,182
And since you want us to end up
in the poor house, I'll keep it...

1355
01:26:48,183 --> 01:26:51,100
James, you're the best husband
that ever lived.

1356
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:08,999
Gosh, how one's women
do mount up.

1357
01:27:11,302 --> 01:27:18,002
