00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,785
Here's a napkin,
make a queen of hearts.

165
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,864
Are you crazy?!

166
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,066
No, let Felix do it.

167
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,134
He draws the best.

168
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,268
Here, Felix.
Thank you.

169
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,703
How are you going to play
with a napkin?

170
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,271
Everybody'll know
it's the queen of hearts.

171
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,474
So? We'll all have the same
advantages and disadvantages.

172
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,675
You ought to be able to afford
more than one deck, Oscar.

173
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,933
Well, you're always telling me
to cut down expenses.

174
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,933
SPEED:
Draw, Felix.

175
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,980
Oh, look what Felix is doing.

176
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:45,971
He's drawing

177
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,572
a picture of a queen's face

178
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,285
that looks like Grace Kelly.

179
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,719
FELIX:
She's royalty.

180
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,910
I always liked her in movies,
she was neat.

181
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,614
I'd color the hearts in
if you'd give me a red pencil.

182
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,126
Oh, give me the napkin!
Here, deal, Oscar.

183
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,116
"Deal, Oscar."

184
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,161
How do you shuffle a napkin?

185
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,730
You don't shuffle it.
You stuff it.

186
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,719
Now, deal!

187
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,789
I still think it's ridiculous.

188
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,857
What time is it?

189
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,091
Felix, that soap is nice.

190
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,259
Oh, "what time is it?"

191
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,862
Oscar, here's my watch.
It's brand new, 130 bucks.

192
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,862
It's<i> yours.</i>

193
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,776
Just never ask me
what time it is again.

194
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,744
ROY: Okay, come on,
let's play cards, huh?

195
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,734
You're light, Murray.

196
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,735
What do you do?
Pass.

197
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,736
Felix?
Pass.

198
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,737
Speed?
Out!

199
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,738
What do you have, Murray?

200
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,907
A napkin
with a picture of Grace Kelly.

201
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,487
She's the queen of hearts.

202
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,055
I thought she was
the Princess of Monaco.

203
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,445
She is.

204
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,081
Look, will you stop asking
questions and play poker?

205
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,928
I went to the bathroom.
I come back.

206
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,785
He dealt me a napkin
with Grace Kelly's face.

207
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,265
Wouldn't you ask questions?

208
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,223
I'm out! Felix.

209
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,091
What are you complaining about?

210
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,826
You've got a pair of queens.

211
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,174
Oscar! I'll play
the napkin.

212
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,430
I'm going to turn up the heat

213
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,065
and I'm gonna sweat them
out of here.

214
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,178
They'll know what we're doing.

215
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,280
No, no, no, I'm gonna tell 'em
that one of your allergies

216
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,015
is bothering you
and you have to have it warm.

217
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,216
I would like it warmer.

218
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah, they know
you're a hypochondriac.

219
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,276
They think I'm a hypochondriac?

220
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,644
Makes me sick.

221
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,717
Are you in, Cochise?

222
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,918
How.

223
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,264
What time is it, Vinnie?

224
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,598
I can't see.
My watch is fogged up.

225
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,834
So are my glasses.
I can't see the cards.

226
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,159
Are you sure you need it
this warm for your sinuses?

227
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,627
They're killing me.

228
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,930
All right! Who put the olive pit
on the queen of hearts?

229
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,366
Oh, pits, napkins, heat...
Who cares?

230
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,835
Get the game rolling.

231
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,836
Bet!

232
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,237
Now he puts it on the table.

233
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,816
That's worse.
That's disgusting.

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,806
Murray.

235
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,807
I can't.

236
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,688
My arm's stuck to the table.

237
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:32,722
I'm turning off the heat.

238
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,757
This is no longer an apartment,
it's an incubator.

239
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,547
Roy, a man's health is at stake.

240
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,627
We got to think
of Felix, don't we?

241
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,317
The<i> right</i> thing to do, fellas,

242
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,464
is call off the game,
take back your ante.

243
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,553
(<i> all yelling</i> )

244
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,233
All night long, you've
been asking what time it is

245
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,368
and trying to call
this game off.

246
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,357
What's with you?

247
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,770
Nothing is with me.
I'm perfectly normal.

248
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,760
You're all complaining...

(<i> door buzzer</i> )

250
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,941
Aha, aha! That's probably
the fire department right now.

251
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,230
No, it's the sisters.

252
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,533
What sisters?

253
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,569
Sister... Mary

254
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,702
and Sister Catherine.

255
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,904
They've got a church
on the corner.

256
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,272
See, and I was going

257
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,141
to help them build a, b-ba, a...

258
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:03,742

Softball league.

260
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,746
They're gonna come up and borrow
all my sports books, see.

261
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,592
Fellas, it's only take a minute.

262
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,326
Would you wait in the kitchen?

263
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,562
It's very important.

(<i> all yelling</i> )

265
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,431
It's sacrilegious
to stay out here.

00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,499
The sisters don't want to see...

267

What do I say?

268
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,735
You take them in the bedroom.

269
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,070
I'll try to get rid of the guys.

270
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,060
The bedroom?

271
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,575
Yes, it's the only way
they won't see the guys.

It'll only take a second.

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,770
You know, the kitchen...
It's in the other room.

491
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,539
Because the kitchen isn't dirty.

492
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,719
Well, I think they
want to be alone.

493
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,209
Cecily, I love you.

494
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,043
(<i> giggling</i> )

495
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,444
Gwendolyn, where have you

496
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,080
been all my life?

497
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,392
Hmm.

498
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,951
Well, we lived in Brighton
till I was 11

499
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,454
and then we moved to London.

500
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,956
(<i> giggling</i> )

501
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,626
(<i> vacuum cleaner roaring</i> )

502
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,227
Felix!

503
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,729
What are you doing?

504
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,776
There are ashes working their
way into the nap of the carpet.

505
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,401
My fist is gonna work its way
into the nap of your neck

506
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,769
if you don't stop cleaning!

507
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,804
Let me have a go.

508
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,349
I'll finish, I'll finish.

509
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,606
Thank you, Gwen.

510
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,819
You're welcome.

511
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,753
Well, Cecily's doing the dishes.

512
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,545
(<i> sighs</i> )

513
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,082
I finally have a minute
to sit down.

514
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,149
Felix.

515
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,051
Come with me.

516
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,821
I want to talk to you.

517
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,556
Right now!

518
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,126
Gwen?

519
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,172
Nice job, Gwen.

520
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,662
Thank you.

521
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,766
Look at your room, Oscar.

522
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,279
Where'd you get all
the laundry to do?

523
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,702
Everything you own
is on the floor.

524
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,482
These are my summer clothes.

525
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,549
Sit down, Felix.

526
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,773
Where?

527
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,918
Under there somewhere's a chair.

528
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,908
Feel around!

529
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,209
I'll stand.

530
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,210
Would you do me a favor?

531
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,211
What?

532
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,357
For my birthday,
let me clean up in here.

533
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,381
No.

534
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,856
At least let me empty
this big ash...

535
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,850
That's my jewelry box!

536
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,197
I like my room the way it is.

537
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,423
In my room, you could
eat off the floor.

538
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,703
You can eat off
the floor in<i> my</i> room.

539
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,070
There's some crackers over there

540
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,006
and, and here's a half
a tuna fish sandwich.

541
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,363
Why don't you eat it?

542
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,998
Felix, I didn't come here
to discuss my room.

543
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,569
In the living room
are two gorgeous girls.

544
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,004
Two female sexy animals.

545
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,205
And what are they doing?

546
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,940
They're cleaning
and they're tidying up.

547
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,443
I could get a 60-year-old lady
to do it

548
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,210
for two dollars an hour!

549
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,414
We'll be right with you, girls.

550
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,383
Take your time.

551
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,651
(<i> incoherent muttering</i> )

552
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,887
Felix, I've had it with you.

553
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,432
We're going to have it out
once and for all.

554
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,790
For starters,
stay out of my bathroom.

555
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,926
You know that fancy soap
you hung on a rope in my shower?

556
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,362
With water in my eyes,
I went to wash my neck,

557
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,530
I almost hung myself!

558
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,533
When I moved in here,
your bathroom was<i> filthy.</i>

559
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,936
It would have been condemned
by most gas stations.

560
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,837
I like filthy.

561
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,084
What I hate is you
and your habits.

562
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,220
I cringe every time
you empty your pockets.

563
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,289
You put your change
in neat little piles.

564
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,612
I'm not crazy about the fact

565
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,725
you have shoe trees
in your bedroom slippers.

566
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,727
And I'm not exactly
choked up about the fact

567
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,596
that you hang your underwear
on hangers.

568
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,565
Felix, I took you
into my apartment

569
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,055
because I thought we
could have some laughs.

570
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,935
But your idea of a fun evening

571
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,504
is defrosting the icebox.

572
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,239
Now you've ruined
another evening

573
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,108
with your tidying and your
cleaning and your fussying.

574
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,165
Are you finished?

575
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,599
I don't know.

576
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,670
How's it coming, girls?

577
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,146
(<i> sweetly</i> ):
Take your time!

578
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,843
Shall I proceed?

579
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,177
Go ahead.

580
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,547
It's true that you
took me in here.

581
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,649
It's also true that when I came,

582
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,017
you were huddled in the kitchen

583
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,064
eating gray spaghetti
with a pair of tweezers.

584
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,188
You think it's easy
living with you?

585
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,123
Look around this room.

586
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,925
Looks like somebody blew up
the Salvation Army.

587
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,762
Your closet is a slum.

588
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,298
Your clothes look
as if they're wrestling.

589
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,179
You put out your cigarettes
in your coffee.

590
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,303
Look at this.

591
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,149
There's a little baby logjam
in there.

592
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,784
Did you ever look
under your bed?

593
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,186
There's stuff
<i>growing</i> under there.

594
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,509
You stop exaggerating.

595
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,810
That's a little dust.

596
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,580
Lawrence of Arabia couldn't
make it through such dust.

597
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,048
I'm giving you fair warning.

598
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,749
If you don't let me
clean up in here,

599
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,785
I'm going to pack my things
and I'm leaving.

600
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,721
Now hear<i> this!</i>

601
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,190
Never mind my bedroom.

602
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,670
You better get out
in the living room.

603
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,005
Because I swear, Felix,
if one of those girls

604
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,141
isn't hugging and
kissing me passionately

605
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,464
in the next five minutes,

606
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,533
I'm throwing you out!

607
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,217
Well, everything's
settled, girls.

608
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,207
(<i> chuckling</i> )

609
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,386
Why don't you grab one of them

610
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,654
and hug and kiss her
passionately?

611
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,389
You've only got four
and a half minutes left.

612
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,847
It's a figure of speech, Felix.

613
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,249
It's a very sweet idea, Felix,

614
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,184
but I really think
we ought to be going.

615
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,330
Listen, the party's
just starting.

616
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,753
No, well, we're a bit tired

617
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,932
because we did all the cleaning.

618
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,300
And we've got to
pick up the laundry

619
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,502
and get up early in the morning.

620
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,870
Oscar, it's been
a smashing evening.

621
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,059
And different.

622
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,260
Ta-ta.

623
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,729
Ta-ta, Felix.

624
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,298
BOTH:
Ta-ta!

625
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,770
Ta-ta.

626
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,139
Don't talk, Felix.

627
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,419
Just don't talk.

628
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,477
I'm serious, Felix!

629
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,357
The only word I want
to hear out of you

630
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,624
from now on
is "good-bye."

631
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,860
And that's the word you'll
be saying tomorrow morning

632
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,244
when you and your belongings
are going out the door.

633
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,748
I'm going to pack.

634
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,282
I'm a silly man.

635
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:39,423
Anybody who hangs his underwear
on coat hangers is a silly man.

636
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,994
I belong in a slob hall of fame.

637
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,629
I've always been sloppy.

638
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:50,233
My mother says I used to throw
my diapers all over the floor.

639
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,802
I'm a rotten person.

640
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,537
On my fifth birthday,

641
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,206
my mother asked me
what I wanted.

642
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,476
I said a wastepaper basket.

643
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:04,481
I'll leave as soon
as I finish this wine.

644
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,452
Felix, it's not your fault
the girls left.

645
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,020
I'm too pushy.

646
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,355
I'd scare off Ma Barker.

647
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,157
No, you're not.

648
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,960
It's that I'm too shy.

649
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:16,961
In high school,

650
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,373
the only girl I ever
asked to a dance

651
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,964
was my sister.

652
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,865
You're lucky you had a sister.

653
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,068
She was ten years old.

654
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,549
The only thing she
enjoyed was the balloons.

655
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,573
Felix.

656
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,843
Felix...

657
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,178
maybe if we stay together,

658
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,024
we could help
each other's problems.

659
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,482
Well, failed as husbands.

660
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,851
I certainly don't want
to fail as a friend.

661
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,519
You're absolutely right.

662
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,654
Felix, we're staying together.

663
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,658
Oscar... tomorrow morning,
before I go to work,

664
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,061
I'm going to get us fixed up
with a couple of girls.

665
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:53,963
To us!

666
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,265
And the girls.

667
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:57,867
Hmm.

668
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,369
Watch me.

669
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,073
I can't...

670
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,808
Try it, Felix!
Go ahead!

671
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,632
Good night, Felix.

672
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,533
Good night, Oscar.

673
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,701
Oh, Felix?

674
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,702
Yeah?

675
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,704
You can clean my room tomorrow.

676
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,946
God bless you, Oscar.
