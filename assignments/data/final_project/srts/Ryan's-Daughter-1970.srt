1
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,694
Sir, what's that there?

2
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,695
What's that?

3
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:02,252
Well, that's not the cuttlefish
that I told you to look for.

4
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:05,256
That's for a start.
That is an insulator.

5
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,540
Aye, an insulator, that is.

6
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,055
Probably off a German battleship.

7
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:13,261
I'm sure there's no German
battleships coming here, sir.

8
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:16,575
- You don't know, there might be.
- No, Timmy's right.

9
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,177
Now, tell me this.

10
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,494
Why is there so much
stuff around Killins Bay?

11
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:24,259
It's a tide... Tidal
eddy around the head.

12
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,017
Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good.

13
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:30,259
All right, come on,
now. Go on looking.

14
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,222
The tide's going
down. Go on, hurry up.

15
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:46,414
Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others.

16
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:51,623
You never know, you might
find a diamond tiara.

17
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,061
Sir, sir.

18
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,616
Aye, that's a cuttlefish.

19
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,254
- Good lad.
- I'll try and find a bigger one.

20
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,697
You do that, Tim.

21
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:32,139
Come on.

22
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,376
What is it, sir?

23
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,417
No, it's nothing. Nothing.
'Tis all right, Kathy.

24
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,373
Come on.

25
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,934
Time we had lunch.
We're eating at Barrow.

26
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,616
It's a long way to Barrow, sir.

27
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,298
Step off, then. That's
where we're eating.

28
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,181
Tide's coming in, sir.

29
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,218
So it is.

30
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:16,503
Hey, would you look at Michael?

31
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,099
Michael.

32
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,740
It's the Major.

33
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:38,696
Hey, Tom, will you
have a look at this?

34
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:46,140
He's getting worse, you know.

35
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:50,581
Michael, let's have
a look at your V.C.

36
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,219
- How many Germans did you kill, Michael?
- All right.

37
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:58,421
All right, very entertaining.

38
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,540
Michael, you're a perfect fool.

39
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,299
You ask for trouble. Come on,
now, take the foolish things off.

40
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:13,218
Michael, take them off, now. Come on.

41
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,498
Michael!

42
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,381
What's eating him?

43
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:34,422
- What've you been doing?
- Don't know, Father.

44
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:36,775
We've not done anything.

45
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,543
Come on now, Michael.
What're you up to?

46
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,573
Let go!

47
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,018
Michael, let go, or I'll hit you.

48
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,179
Michael, darling, let go.

49
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:01,775
Major, darling, let me touch your V.C.

50
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:05,698
You see, my husband hasn't got one.

51
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,333
Well?

52
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:50,939
Well.

53
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,339
What was the meaning
of that pantomime?

54
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,623
I don't know.

55
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:58,622
- Where have you been?
- Riding...

56
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:02,695
- with Major Doryan.
- You're bold as brass.

57
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,899
You think that's a suitable
connection for a decent Irish wife?

58
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:09,942
I think that is for my
husband to say, Father Hugh.

59
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,821
- You've told him, have you?
- Yes.

60
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,303
Yes, you would.

61
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,659
Your husband would say anything
you wanted, pretty well...

62
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:18,383
because he loves you
sorely, doesn't he?

63
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,975
- Yes, he does.
- Have you nothing to say to me?

64
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,504
- What should I have to say to you?
- You could say:

65
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:30,814
"Father Hugh, there's nothing
between me and Major Doryan. "

66
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:33,293
- There isn't.
- Say it, then.

67
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,815
There is nothing between
me and Major Doryan.

68
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,462
Look at me, Rosy.

69
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:45,180
Oh, child, what a face.

70
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:51,418
- Rose, tell me now.
- What?

71
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,779
You'll have to tell it in
confessional, you little fool.

72
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,536
I don't have to come...

73
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,979
- to the confessional.
- Child!

74
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:00,663
Child?

75
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:09,017
- Father.
- Hello, then.

76
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,093
Rosy...

77
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,421
was there something?

78
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,659
No, I just...

79
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,019
- Will you take the prayers, then?
- Aye.

80
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:29,779
"Our Father...

81
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,617
"who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

82
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,774
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

83
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,820
"on Earth as it is in heaven.

84
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:40,977
"Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...

85
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:44,181
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

86
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,973
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. "

87
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:51,454
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

88
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,614
All right, children, off with you.

89
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,019
Thank you, Father. Good day.

90
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,101
Glad to help, Charles.

91
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,137
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

92
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,942
No, I don't think so.

93
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,534
Well, I'll be off home, too, then.

94
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,621
- You're late.
- I took them for a nature walk.

95
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:32,736
Up Brandon?

96
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,416
Along the shore.

97
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,415
- For cuttlefish?
- Aye.

98
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,337
For cuttlefish.

99
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:50,016
If you'd come up Brandon,
we might have seen you.

100
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,378
Why?

101
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:53,932
- Did you go to Brandon?
- Aye.

102
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:55,982
I got some heather.

103
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,943
So you did.

104
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,134
You haven't been to the beach, then?

105
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:04,973
No.

106
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,222
Oh, well.

107
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,853
- It's nice up Brandon.
- Aye, it's grand.

108
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,496
Is something the matter?

109
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,461
I don't know, Rose. Is there?

110
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:32,498
There's nothing the matter with me.

111
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:35,260
Nothing's the matter, then.

112
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:51,181
And the jam, and the...

113
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:55,616
The jam...

114
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:58,055
and the soap.

115
00:20:58,144 --> 00:20:59,293
Maggie.

116
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:03,942
That'll be 18 pence.

117
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:07,738
Could it wait to the
end of the week, missus?

118
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:10,338
Aye, to the end of the week.
Not to the crack of doom.

119
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:11,937
Thank you.

120
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:19,500
- What was it, then?
- I want a dishcloth, please.

121
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:21,974
- I've none.
- Oh.

122
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,942
Then I'll just take some
potatoes. Five pound.

123
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,016
I've no potatoes, either.

124
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,860
What's them, then?

125
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:33,900
Aye, them.

126
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:37,454
They're gone. I've no potatoes.

127
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:42,377
Oh, I... I see.

128
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:52,856
The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon, there's
loose women and there's whores...

129
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,254
and then there's
British soldiers' whores.

130
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:46,781
- Coming up fast, Father.
- Aye.

131
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,014
Will you look at those things?

132
00:22:56,824 --> 00:23:00,817
You'd think they was
announcing the coming of Christ.

133
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,698
- Off you go!
- Right.

134
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:20,735
Put her down!

135
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,621
Slowly does it.

136
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,094
All right, now! That's it. Come
on, Joe, there's a good lad.

137
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:05,857
Come on, it's late.

138
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,053
All right. Come on, Sean.

139
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:12,413
Come on, Tom. You've
got to go to sleep.

140
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:15,616
Go on. Good night!

141
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:39,977
Hello, Tom.

142
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:45,542
- You? What are you doing here?
- Come on, now, Tom.

143
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:49,773
Phoenix Park, 1913.

144
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:55,623
Tim O'Leary.

145
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:00,542
Come on.

146
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:05,377
Right, lads.

147
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:08,024
Now, what do you usually
do at this time, Tom?

148
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:09,503
- I go to bed.
- Right.

149
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,256
This is Bernard. Go on up, lads.

150
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,982
- Paddy.
- Paddy.

151
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:14,133
Sean.

152
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,973
Joseph, Peter...

153
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:19,298
Mr. O'Keefe.

154
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:22,299
- And you know Pat.
- Which room?

155
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:23,737
At the back.

156
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:27,263
But, Commandant,
sir, what's happening?

157
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:41,977
Guns, is it?

158
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:45,977
- That's right, Tom. German guns.
- German?

159
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:49,340
Dynamite, grenades. All the
stuff the movement needs.

160
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,378
We tried to launch the boat...

161
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:58,656
- You must get to them somehow, then.
- We can't.

162
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:03,260
But Sean here says there's a good chance
some of it will break away and come to us.

163
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,016
- Float in?
- You're on to it.

164
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,901
But, if it does, we won't know where.

165
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,782
You can't see the nose on
your face out there now.

166
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,582
So we'll wait till daylight.

167
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,303
- Absolute madness.
- Will you shut up?

168
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:15,499
Tom...

169
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:19,097
if it's to be done in
daylight, it's to be done quick.

170
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:21,379
So we must have some
fellows, say a dozen...

171
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:25,173
good, strong fellows, and
that's where you come in.

172
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:31,263
- What if it don't break away?
- Exactly.

173
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,984
Then we'll wait one
hour and go without it.

174
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:35,417
One hour, Tom...

175
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:38,302
and 12 strong men.
That's all I'm asking.

176
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,017
Can you do it?

177
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,734
I could rout out a dozen, yes.

178
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,654
- Do you want them now?
- Not at all.

179
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:48,898
The later they know
we're here, the better.

180
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,259
You let them lie till nearer morning.

181
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,734
Can you find us something to
eat? It's gonna be a long night.

182
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,333
Paddy, Tom.

183
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,494
Take the Constable his breakfast.

184
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:45,140
Jesus and Mary, what a night.

185
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:55,900
Now, do not make one sound, Constable.

186
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:03,860
Right. You.

187
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:05,980
Fat guts, get the handcuffs.

188
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:09,100
- Where are they?
- In the cupboard.

189
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:11,173
Turn around.

190
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,339
- I'm acting under duress.
- Shut up.

191
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,377
Put them on him.

192
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:36,896
Open your mouth, Constable.

193
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,620
Is that a telephone line?

194
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:57,978
Cut it.

195
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,543
Oh, God.

196
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,374
Why have you done this to me?

197
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,136
Hello?

198
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,097
This is Ryan.

199
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,380
- Did you cut the wire?
- I did.

200
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:45,261
You're doing well, Tom.

201
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:50,693
- Where's the Constable?
- In the cellar.

202
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,775
We can put a bullet
in him if you like.

203
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:54,934
Constable... No!

204
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:57,697
- Then get your men.
- Aye, Commandant.

205
00:29:58,784 --> 00:29:59,899
Right.

206
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:45,103
They've gone!

207
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,423
Busted loose!

208
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,254
It's no good, Commandant!

209
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:07,654
Why don't you get up
out of it while you can?

210
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,219
Tim!

211
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:41,693
- Hey, are you Tim O'Leary?
- Yes, son, yes.

212
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:54,217
Father, what the hell
have you done this for?

213
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:56,374
I didn't, they did!

214
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:58,182
Well, do you know what you're doing?

215
00:32:58,264 --> 00:33:00,061
- Do you know what we've come for?
- Aye.

216
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,374
- Have you got it?
- Well, look.

217
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,056
- T'will be on the slabs.
- Where?

218
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,463
The slabs!

219
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:28,892
Tim!

220
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:38,623
Come on.

221
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:48,379
Yes, Kathy?

222
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,853
- Aren't you coming to the beach, sir?
- The beach?

223
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,582
Everyone's at the beach.

224
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:56,533
- And why is everyone at the beach?
- I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck.

225
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:57,818
A wreck?

226
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,735
Now, that's enough, Tom. You're
not as young as you used to be.

227
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,018
Aye, come on!

228
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,292
Oh, God.

229
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,579
Pull!

230
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:26,975
Right, up you get. You, too,
Father. Up. Keep it going.

231
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,102
That's right, darling.

232
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,218
That's right.

233
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:50,856
Hey!

234
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:54,572
Dynamite.

235
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,820
What are you doing here?

236
00:38:55,504 --> 00:38:57,813
- Why shouldn't I be?
- Why?

237
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:03,662
Thank you, ma'am.

238
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,818
You know, we made speeches
about these people...

239
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:09,337
but, by God...

240
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:27,741
Thanks. You're a man!

241
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,500
Come on, then!

242
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:51,423
One!

243
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:52,698
Two!

244
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:54,422
Three!

245
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:26,819
Sean?

246
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:30,054
- I must take a chance.
- Aye.

247
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,213
Good luck.

248
00:41:51,464 --> 00:41:53,534
Thank you. Get down, please.

249
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,103
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

250
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:57,216
You, here. You.

251
00:42:03,464 --> 00:42:06,774
No. No trouble now,
for your own sakes.

252
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:07,933
O'Leary.

253
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,139
That thing could kill
a lot of people, Major.

254
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:13,259
Sir?

255
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:14,533
No.

256
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:25,062
Go on. Run, Tim!

257
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:27,573
Run, Tim.

258
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,222
Make it, Tim. Come on!

259
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:31,623
- Run.
- O'Leary!

260
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,619
Sir.

261
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,300
- No!
- No!

262
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:43,102
- Murderer!
- Don't shoot.

263
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:28,095
What's wrong with the bastard?

264
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:46,656
Boo!

265
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:51,581
Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy.

266
00:43:52,824 --> 00:43:54,018
Careful, man.

267
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:58,294
My God, they're a well-matched pair.

268
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,063
All right, sir?

269
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:05,215
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:38,500
Is there anything you want?

271
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:39,978
Cigarette.

272
00:44:48,664 --> 00:44:51,462
- Anything else?
- Yes.

273
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:55,618
Get out of my country.

274
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:00,182
God bless you, Tim O'Leary!

275
00:45:16,744 --> 00:45:19,781
What are they going to
do with them boys, Father?

276
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:21,742
They'll hang them, dear.

277
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,777
They'll hang them.

278
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:35,663
Bastard!

279
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:48,019
Bastard!

280
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:11,303
Get out!

281
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:29,013
You're very kind to me today.

282
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:30,219
Am I?

283
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:33,374
Yes. Why?

284
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:36,980
Am I not usually kind to you?

285
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:40,577
Yes, you are. Always.

286
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:49,256
Charles, do you know or not?

287
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:52,498
I know.

288
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,624
- Since when?
- The beginning.

289
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:04,860
Don't lower your head, Rose.

290
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:13,902
Why didn't you speak?

291
00:47:15,664 --> 00:47:17,063
I should have, shouldn't I?

292
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,103
I don't know.

293
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:27,012
It was easier not to, I suppose.
I didn't want to know, you know.

294
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:32,063
And then I thought, if I let you
burn it out, the pair of you...

295
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:34,294
you'd perhaps come back to me.

296
00:51:10,144 --> 00:51:11,338
Charles?

297
00:51:11,984 --> 00:51:12,973
Charles?

298
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:13,498
Mr. Shaughnessy has been called
away, so I'm taking class.

299
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:22,177
What's the first lesson today, Danny?

300
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:27,335
- Danny?
- My father says not to speak to you, miss.

301
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,862
- It's right then, he's not here?
- No.

302
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:12,261
I don't know where he is.

303
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:14,653
- You mean he's gone off?
- Yes.

304
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:15,813
When?

305
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:18,023
Last night.

306
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:21,742
You had a row?

307
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,382
I wasn't here.

308
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:24,897
Where were you?

309
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:28,101
Oh, I see.

310
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:32,296
There's nothing I can do tonight,
I'll find him in the morning.

311
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:35,376
- If he turns up, you'll tell me.
- Father?

312
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:39,259
You'd better take his clothes.

313
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:42,975
His clothes?

314
00:53:51,504 --> 00:53:53,654
He was in bed?

315
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:55,621
Yes.

316
00:53:55,704 --> 00:53:58,696
You left his bed and went to...

317
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,902
Rose.

318
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,774
Oh, Rose.

319
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:47,015
Come on, this isn't a picnic.

320
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:49,572
All right, Corp, but
there's nothing here.

321
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:17,656
He's got something there, sir.

322
00:55:17,744 --> 00:55:18,893
Padre.

323
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:30,575
Good morning, padre.

324
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:33,417
I'm sorry, but what is
it you have there, please?

325
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:38,976
A man's clothes.

326
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:41,538
I see.

327
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:44,497
- And where are you taking them, Father?
- To the man.

328
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:46,540
Come on, padre. I don't
suppose you mean any harm...

329
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:49,616
but after the other day, we've
got to be careful. What man?

330
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:53,743
A man whose wife went off two
nights back with her fancy fellow.

331
00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:57,058
And a man I've been looking
for since dawn today.

332
00:55:57,144 --> 00:55:59,419
- A man- -
Excuse me, sir.

333
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:03,895
A man who must be half out of his mind
to have gone off as he did, barefoot.

334
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:08,581
That's right. Charles Shaughnessy.

335
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:24,743
I think we're finished here, sir.

336
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:27,616
Very well.

337
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:22,337
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Father.

338
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:27,579
I've brought your clothes.

339
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:30,974
Thanks, Father. I was
wondering how I should get home.

340
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:34,217
- And something to drink.
- Thanks.

341
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:42,704
- Yourself?
- Aye, I will.

342
00:57:47,824 --> 00:57:50,782
- You seem all right, man.
- Aye, more or less.

343
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:52,775
Well, I'll get dressed now.

344
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,341
Michael.

345
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:32,215
He'll be after catching
a few flounders.

346
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:37,543
So, what have you been
doing down here, Charles?

347
00:58:37,624 --> 00:58:40,092
Oh, thinking.

348
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:42,774
About Rosy?

349
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:45,214
About myself, mostly.

350
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:49,698
Thanks for the clothes. You're
a man in a million, Father Hugh.

351
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,814
The children haven't come today, then?

352
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:36,973
No.

353
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:42,020
Rose, I have something
to say to you. Come in.

354
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:52,056
Sit down, will you?

355
00:59:56,224 --> 01:00:00,456
Rose, I thought I could stand by and
let you two burn it out, like I said.

356
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:02,694
But I find I can't.

357
01:00:04,064 --> 01:00:08,376
I'm not sure I ought to have
tried, but anyway, I can't.

358
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:12,134
So I'm going to leave you.

359
01:00:16,464 --> 01:00:18,819
- Very well.
- Sit still a minute, Rose.

360
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,054
What about you? You and him?

361
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:27,536
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

362
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:29,983
It's over.

363
01:00:31,784 --> 01:00:34,901
Was that because I
went and stayed away?

364
01:00:34,984 --> 01:00:35,973
No.

365
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:38,983
It's over.

366
01:00:40,664 --> 01:00:43,383
- Have you told him?
- No.

367
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:45,978
He doesn't know, then?

368
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:47,975
Yes, he knows.

369
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:49,463
How?

370
01:00:50,224 --> 01:00:51,452
He must.

371
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,173
You're as close as that, are you?

372
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:00,461
We were, yes.

373
01:01:21,104 --> 01:01:23,015
Rose, you must tell me the truth.

374
01:01:23,104 --> 01:01:25,664
Do you think you're
ever gonna forget him?

375
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:28,053
Of course not.

376
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:30,374
He'd be like a ghost about the place.

377
01:01:30,984 --> 01:01:33,020
Rose, am I right?

378
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,980
Yes, you're right.

379
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,901
It's busted, Charles.

380
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,417
I busted it.

381
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,861
Now, have you thought what to do?

382
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:51,253
- No.
- Well, I have.

383
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:55,097
I don't think either of us can
stay in this village any longer.

384
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,173
No.

385
01:01:56,264 --> 01:01:59,859
It's time I moved on anyway. And
you were never worse suited here.

386
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:04,334
I've reckoned up, I've
got about 200 pounds.

387
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:09,853
Take all this, without the
gramophone, fetch another 50.

388
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:12,014
We'll split it down the middle.

389
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:13,742
I can't do it.

390
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:17,303
We're not enemies, Rose.

391
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:21,775
Stop that! There's to be none of that.

392
01:02:32,944 --> 01:02:34,662
But why must it be Rosy?

393
01:02:34,744 --> 01:02:37,417
Because she was
fornicating with the fellow.

394
01:02:40,184 --> 01:02:42,379
So, you're back, are you?

395
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:44,420
What is this? What do you want?

396
01:02:44,664 --> 01:02:47,053
- Not you.
- Well, then get out.

397
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,056
- Go on, get out.
- Shut up, Shaughnessy.

398
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,662
We're waiting for her.

399
01:02:57,304 --> 01:02:58,578
You.

400
01:02:58,824 --> 01:03:02,612
You've been tried and found
guilty. You're the informer.

401
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:07,580
- What?
- Busting at the seams with innocence.

402
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:10,502
Joe, for God's sake, don't
hurt her, Joe. Don't hurt her.

403
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:14,099
If she was a man, Mr.
Ryan, she'd be shot.

404
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:18,820
- What is this?
- Listen, numbskull.

405
01:03:19,224 --> 01:03:21,784
Someone that morning
went up to the camp...

406
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,820
and betrayed Tim O'Leary.

407
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:27,336
Now, who lives near
enough? Who had time enough?

408
01:03:27,664 --> 01:03:30,053
Who would? Who did?

409
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:32,734
That bitch you call your wife.

410
01:03:32,824 --> 01:03:34,098
String her up!

411
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:41,096
But anyone could have, if anyone
did. The whole village was abroad.

412
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,254
No. The village was down on the beach.

413
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:44,857
- Except you.
- You came late.

414
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:48,300
- We came together. We spoke to no one.
- You'd say that, of course.

415
01:03:48,384 --> 01:03:49,658
Young Kathy was with us.

416
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:52,338
Young Kathy would say black
was white if you told her.

417
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:55,063
Then anyone, anyone at all could've
gone into the police station...

418
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:57,942
- and used the telephone.
- That's where you're wrong.

419
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:00,857
They couldn't. Could they, Tom?

420
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:02,821
- No.
- Why not?

421
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:06,453
Because Tom went in there
himself and cut the wire.

422
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:08,614
Didn't you, Tom?

423
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:13,617
Well, you went in there
yourself, didn't you?

424
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,015
- Yes.
- And you cut the wire, didn't you?

425
01:04:22,464 --> 01:04:23,783
Yes.

426
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:35,294
Well, what do you say now?

427
01:04:37,184 --> 01:04:38,742
Nothing.

428
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:40,377
Take her out.

429
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:43,816
No, you're taking her nowhere.

430
01:04:44,544 --> 01:04:46,341
Stop it!

431
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:55,096
- Informer.
- There she is!

432
01:05:08,064 --> 01:05:09,338
Hold him.

433
01:05:24,184 --> 01:05:25,742
Take him by the hands.

434
01:05:36,944 --> 01:05:39,742
Quiet! Get back!

435
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:43,096
Get back!

436
01:05:48,064 --> 01:05:49,213
Do it.

437
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:33,372
Princess...

438
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:48,372
What is it?

439
01:06:59,864 --> 01:07:01,582
There she is.

440
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:05,094
Look here, Father Hugh, the
stripping of her was an accident.

441
01:08:05,184 --> 01:08:06,333
Steady, Joe.

442
01:08:06,424 --> 01:08:08,733
You're taking advantage
of your cloth, Father Hugh.

443
01:08:08,824 --> 01:08:11,543
- That's what it's for.
- Come on, Joe.

444
01:08:12,544 --> 01:08:15,183
It's not right. A
priest is only a man.

445
01:09:09,664 --> 01:09:10,813
Go on.

446
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,495
Go on, Michael, get off.

447
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,376
Get off out of it!

448
01:11:06,024 --> 01:11:07,173
Hello.

449
01:11:39,624 --> 01:11:40,852
Keep it.

450
01:12:31,504 --> 01:12:32,937
What?

451
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:38,215
They really thought...

452
01:12:39,464 --> 01:12:43,298
I was the one who betrayed that man.

453
01:12:43,904 --> 01:12:45,337
Rose...

454
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:48,974
I don't for one moment suppose
that anyone betrayed him.

455
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,453
Why should they? They just...

456
01:12:52,544 --> 01:12:56,253
They just wanted it so, that's all.
And they wanted it to be you, too.

457
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:58,221
For other reasons.

458
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:01,262
Truth was told, they envy
you. They always have.

459
01:13:02,104 --> 01:13:05,255
They've always had a rare,
old contempt for me, too.

460
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:09,416
I tell you, I'm not for letting any
of that lot know we've busted up.

461
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:12,462
We'll just keep up a front
until I'm well and out of it.

462
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:15,377
What?

463
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:18,180
I don't know.

464
01:13:18,264 --> 01:13:20,334
It just seemed funny, that's all.

465
01:16:01,904 --> 01:16:05,101
Michael, give that to me.

466
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:12,893
All right, keep it.

467
01:16:15,224 --> 01:16:17,215
I thought we were friends.

468
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:28,497
That one, too. Give it to me.

469
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,223
No! Look.

470
01:16:54,984 --> 01:16:58,101
For Christ's sake, man,
I'm not going to hurt you.

471
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:53,216
- It'll be the soldiers.
- Soldiers?

472
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:54,783
Aye.

473
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:58,857
The beach was fairly littered with
stuff. They'll be destroying it.

474
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:01,098
Oh, yes.

475
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:42,696
Come on, lads, pick them up.

476
01:19:42,784 --> 01:19:45,662
What about my blisters, Corporal?

477
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:48,816
- Well, they're not mourning long.
- No.

478
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:53,417
Does she think he killed
himself deliberate?

479
01:19:53,504 --> 01:19:54,732
She says...

480
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:59,143
I think he was a man who
suffered, Father Hugh.

481
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,932
You love her sorely,
don't you, Charles?

482
01:20:03,024 --> 01:20:04,059
Yes.

483
01:20:10,024 --> 01:20:12,663
- Ready, then?
- Yes.

484
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:25,099
It's not all your doing, Rosy.
I should not have married you.

485
01:20:25,264 --> 01:20:26,299
No.

486
01:20:28,384 --> 01:20:30,500
You can tell Father Hugh that
we're parting if you like.

487
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:31,619
No.

488
01:21:01,384 --> 01:21:03,261
- Rosy.
- Father.

489
01:21:04,384 --> 01:21:07,182
It'll be a fair day for
the journey, yet, I think.

490
01:21:07,544 --> 01:21:09,660
I hope so, yes.

491
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:14,574
Well, now, how shall we manage?

492
01:21:14,824 --> 01:21:15,939
Margaret.

493
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,219
Come here, Margaret. Come here.

494
01:21:45,824 --> 01:21:47,780
Kathy, come in.

495
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:57,974
Kathy, will I take the belt to you?

496
01:22:26,304 --> 01:22:28,056
Take my arm.

497
01:22:49,744 --> 01:22:51,462
A rousing sendoff.

498
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:54,573
We'll be out of it in five minutes.

499
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:15,539
Dad.

500
01:23:26,464 --> 01:23:28,614
Goodbye, Dad.

501
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:31,136
Bye, princess.

502
01:23:35,664 --> 01:23:37,700
I'm all right.

503
01:23:38,544 --> 01:23:41,616
- Are you, darling?
- Aye.

504
01:23:41,864 --> 01:23:45,573
I'm looking forward
to Dublin and that.

505
01:23:46,344 --> 01:23:48,175
Really.

506
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:50,732
That's your mother speaking.

507
01:23:50,824 --> 01:23:54,180
- Do you remember your mother, Rose?
- A bit.

508
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:58,060
Do you, like...

509
01:23:58,144 --> 01:24:00,783
- remember the rows?
- Aye.

510
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:04,254
- I never raised a fist to her, Rose.
- I know that, Dad.

511
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:09,256
You wouldn't hurt a fly
if you could help it.

512
01:24:15,904 --> 01:24:18,816
- I'll write to you.
- And I'll write to you.

513
01:24:19,624 --> 01:24:22,377
- Well, maybe.
- No. I swear to God, Rose.

514
01:24:22,464 --> 01:24:25,774
- I will write every...
Every- - All right, Dad.

515
01:24:26,904 --> 01:24:28,815
We'll both write regular.

516
01:24:31,424 --> 01:24:32,413
Bye-bye.

517
01:24:32,504 --> 01:24:35,735
Well, wait a minute, I must
say goodbye to your husband.

518
01:24:39,464 --> 01:24:41,341
You know, Rose...

519
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:45,337
when you married him, I thought
you could have done a lot better.

520
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:50,658
Now I'm not so sure
they come much better.

521
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:54,339
Would you tell him that?

522
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:57,177
It's not a thing one fellow
can easily say to another.

523
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:02,058
Shaughnessy.

524
01:25:03,424 --> 01:25:05,301
Mike.

525
01:25:08,344 --> 01:25:09,857
Goodbye, Shaughnessy.

526
01:25:11,144 --> 01:25:13,055
Goodbye, Mr. Ryan.

527
01:25:13,144 --> 01:25:15,704
Are you all right for money,
you two? I have a bit by me.

528
01:25:15,784 --> 01:25:19,413
We're fine for money,
Dad. Thanks. Goodbye.

529
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,258
Good luck.

530
01:26:01,544 --> 01:26:04,661
- Get out and don't come back!
- Get out!

531
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:07,579
Informer.

532
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:52,821
Bus will be here in a minute.

533
01:26:59,264 --> 01:27:02,381
It's brightened for you, like I said.

534
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:03,658
Aye.

535
01:27:04,464 --> 01:27:06,341
Grand day for a journey.

536
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:10,342
Sign of good luck.

537
01:27:44,424 --> 01:27:45,573
Thanks.

538
01:27:47,624 --> 01:27:49,057
Bus is coming.

539
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:58,701
You won't have an address
in Dublin yet, I suppose.

540
01:27:59,344 --> 01:28:00,618
No, Father, we...

541
01:28:00,704 --> 01:28:03,662
I've wrote down here the name
and address of a decent woman...

542
01:28:03,744 --> 01:28:07,180
who'll ask six shillings a week
for a dry room and a clean bed.

543
01:28:09,344 --> 01:28:11,300
Six shillings, the pair of you.

544
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:15,537
You'll not do better
than that, not in Dublin.

545
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:18,420
No, I don't suppose so.

546
01:28:20,464 --> 01:28:22,022
Thanks, Father.

547
01:28:41,264 --> 01:28:42,777
Bye, Michael.

548
01:28:49,864 --> 01:28:53,015
I have a parting gift
for you here, Rose.

549
01:28:53,104 --> 01:28:56,141
It's supposed to be a fragment
of St. Patrick's staff.

550
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,973
I don't suppose it is, though.

551
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,981
God bless you, child.

552
01:29:05,104 --> 01:29:07,823
Come on, now. Come on, get on up.

553
01:29:08,744 --> 01:29:10,541
I'll help you load up.

554
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:27,499
Thanks, Father. Thanks
for a great many things.

555
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:28,903
Charles?

556
01:29:28,984 --> 01:29:32,499
I think you have it in your mind
that you and Rosy ought to part.

557
01:29:33,464 --> 01:29:35,580
Yes, I thought as much.

558
01:29:35,664 --> 01:29:38,542
Well, maybe you're right,
maybe you ought, but I doubt it.

559
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:41,934
And that's my parting
gift to you. That doubt.

560
01:29:46,264 --> 01:29:47,583
God bless.

561
01:30:00,024 --> 01:30:01,457
I don't know.

562
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:06,861
I don't know at all. Come on, Michael.
