1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:23,741
Please rise.

3
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:28,378
Hear Ye. The court of the 22nd Judicial
District of Minnesota is now convened.

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,152
The Honorable Cass Timberlane.
Judge presiding.

5
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:40,865
Be seated.

6
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,722
Olliford versus Olliford.
Continued from yesterday's calendar.

7
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:46,110
Mr Criley.

8
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:48,824
Anything further on
behalf of the plaintiff?

9
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:50,896
We completed our argument
yesterday, Your Honor.

10
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,790
Does the defendant's counsel
have anything further?

11
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,408
No, Your Honor.

12
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:58,455
Mr and Mrs Olliford, will
you step forward please.

13
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,291
I have weighed the evidence in this
case and I have reached a decision.

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,424
In the last few years on this bench.
Particularly since the war ..

15
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:17,636
I am struck so much by the public's
careless attitude toward marriage.

16
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,941
Here in Grand Republic marriage once
meant something permanent and beautiful.

17
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,056
Our parents built their lives
and their happiness on it.

18
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,268
Maybe this is a selfish age.

19
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:31,582
Maybe we have lost the art of
loving deeply and permanently.

20
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,296
If we have, I think it's pretty sad.

21
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,897
Pretty frightening.

22
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,127
I don't know what the answer
is but I do know this.

23
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,705
Marriage is a sacred obligation
not lightly to be entered into.

24
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,754
And as long as I am judge here
not likely to be dissolved.

25
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,691
The evidence here does not warrant
granting the plaintiff's petition.

26
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,543
Divorce denied. Next case.

27
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:54,832
Tilda Hatter versus the
city of Grand Republic.

28
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,497
If it please, Your Honor.

29
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,015
It is our aim to prove the
gross negligence of the city ..

30
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,409
In failing to clear the sidewalk
of its snow and ice.

31
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,459
Thereby causing Miss Hatter to slip
and be thrown prone upon the sidewalk.

32
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,581
In a state of ignominy and sore pain.

33
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:11,290
"<i>A dull case and a duller lawyer</i>."

34
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:15,174
"<i>The State of Minnesota doesn't pay
you to go to sleep, Timberlane</i>."

35
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,292
To prove Your Honor that ..

36
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:20,676
It is the responsibility
of the municipality ..

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,166
To keep the sidewalks
free of snow and ice.

38
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:24,190
And.

39
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:27,689
Had there been an adequate
cleaning of this main thoroughfare.

40
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,117
The unfortunate accident
would not have occurred.

41
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:32,850
.. so help you, God?
- I do.

42
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,275
Your name please?

43
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,142
My name is Tilda Hatter.

44
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,071
Your occupation?
- I keep a boarding house.

45
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,512
Your place of residence?

46
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,842
179 and a half West Flandrau Street.

47
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,728
I was born right in that very
house on the ground floor.

48
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,608
Where the Lilac Lady beauty shop is now.

49
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,412
.. so help you, God?
- I do.

50
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,488
Your name please?

51
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,464
Eino Roskinen.

52
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,927
E-i-n-o R-o-s-k-i-n-e-n.

53
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,587
Your occupation?
- I am a writer.

54
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,359
But at the moment I'm a lathe
operator at the Wargate plant.

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,655
.. the evidence you're about to give
will the whole truth so help you, God?

56
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:17,745
I do.

57
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,324
Your name please?
- Virginia Marshland.

58
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,486
Your occupation?

59
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:26,677
'Artist' I guess.

60
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,198
You guess?

61
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,994
Part of my job is designing
boxes and packages.

62
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,474
And part of it is doing hand lettering.

63
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,577
Mr Recorder, Miss Marshland
is a designer.

64
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,217
Your place of residence?

65
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:42,747
179 and a half West Flandrau Street.

66
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,354
That is also Miss Tilda
Hatter's address, is it not?

67
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:46,748
I room there. Yes.

68
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,759
Now then, tell the court your version
of what happened on the night of the ..

69
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:51,985
Accident.

70
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,834
Well, I had gone to the
movies with Eino Roskinen.

71
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,961
He rooms at Tilda's too.

72
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,569
You see, I ..

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,309
He is on the top floor.
I am on the second.

74
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:08,209
Well, anyway.

75
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,532
Tilda was on the streetcar coming
home so we got off together.

76
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,953
Right in front of the West Side Police
Station she slipped on the ice.

77
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,392
Up went all of her packages into
the air and down came Tilda on ..

78
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,255
On the ice.

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,811
And was I mad.

80
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,382
Why were you mad?

81
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,749
Because a stupid policeman had tried to
make out that Tilda had been drinking.

82
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,910
I see. And that wasn't true?

83
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,182
She was as sober as a ..

84
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:32,660
Achoo!

85
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,000
Miss Hatter was as sober as ..

86
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,689
As sober as a ..

87
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:40,842
Pardon me.

88
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,962
Bailiff.
- Yes, Your Honor?

89
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:46,608
If this cat or any cat comes into this
courtroom once more making me sneeze ..

90
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,177
I'll have it arrested for contempt
of court. Get it out of here.

91
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:50,553
Yes, Your Honor.

92
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,690
It is 4 o'clock, Your Honor.
- So it is.

93
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,267
The court is adjourned until
ten o'clock in the morning.

94
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:56,352
As a judge.

95
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,745
I beg your pardon, Miss Marshland?

96
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,872
That's what Miss Tilda Hatter
was as sober as.

97
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,786
Have you got that, Mr Recorder?
- Yes, Your Honor.

98
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:06,992
Thank you, Miss Marshland.

99
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,604
Come in.

100
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:13,996
Busy?

101
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,413
Come in, Brad.

102
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,157
I'm sorry, Brad. I told you
the case would go against you.

103
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,534
Forget it, Cass.

104
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,591
I can't say I disagree
with you in principle.

105
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,984
Only what exactly did you
accomplish? The ends of justice?

106
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,294
My client goes to Reno tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

107
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:31,988
The homily on marriage.

108
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,797
It was eloquent, Cass.
It was beautiful. I mean that.

109
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:38,022
But it came thirty years too late.
There has been a war, Cass.

110
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,619
There have been a lot of wars, Brad.

111
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:44,914
That's no reason to hop in and out
of marriage like a lot of rabbits.

112
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,655
What is wrong with our people anyway?

113
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,333
Well, we live in a reckless age.
Transitional.

114
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,535
What the heck. I'm not going
to take anything too seriously.

115
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,470
I'll leave that for you and
Chris when you get married.

116
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,369
I haven't said I was going to
marry Chris or anybody else.

117
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,458
But I'll tell you this,
if I do get married again.

118
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:05,696
I will come and let you dance with
the bride on our 75th anniversary.

119
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,806
Not before?
- Not if I can help it.

120
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:10,354
Cass, you are wonderful.
You're the vanishing American.

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,612
You are as obsolete as the crossbow
but you are the hope of the world.

122
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:15,256
I love you. Marry me.

123
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,335
Come in.

124
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,956
What is it, Bert?

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,959
Someone left this in
the courtroom, Judge.

126
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,516
Holy cow, do I look like this?

127
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,493
That's contempt of court, Your Honor.

128
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:31,417
First degree.

129
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,541
Off with this head.
What is the criminal's name?

130
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:38,928
Looking for something, Miss?

131
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,932
Yes. Did you find a small notebook?

132
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,413
A notebook, huh?

133
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,547
The Lost-and-Found
department might have it.

134
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:48,577
Thank you.
- Second door along there.

135
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,487
Thank you.
- Go right in.

136
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,889
Excuse me, Your Honor. Sir.

137
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:58,818
The witness for Tilda Hatter.

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,163
They told me this was
the Lost-and-Found.

139
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,429
That depends on what you have lost.
Come in, Miss Marshland.

140
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,123
It was a little notebook.

141
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,832
A notebook? Do you know
anything about that, Mr Criley?

142
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,030
A notebook?

143
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,241
Come in, come in.
Let's have a description of it.

144
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:18,678
May I take the witness, Your Honor?
- You may not. Thanks for coming, Brad.

145
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,036
It was a pleasure.

146
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:25,089
I feel the young lady needs an attorney.
- No, no. This is an open and shut case.

147
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:28,163
Yes, Your Honor. See you
and Chris tonight, I hope.

148
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:30,344
Tonight? Oh yes, this
is Thursday, isn't it.

149
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,022
Thursday. That's right. Dinner
at the Havocks. Be prompt.

150
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,605
Listen to that 'be prompt'.
He was 20 minutes late last week.

151
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,191
Do you think it is so important
be on time at the Havocks?

152
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:41,079
I wouldn't know. Where I eat, if you
are not on time there's nothing left.

153
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:43,859
Take the witness, Judge.
- Yes. Thank you.

154
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:45,321
Sit down, Miss Marshland.

155
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:47,813
Now.

156
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:50,659
What was in this alleged notebook?

157
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,056
Some alleged drawings.
- Oh? You draw?

158
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,262
What sort of subjects interest you?

159
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:58,986
Uh, people.

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,574
People?

161
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,054
Even judges?

162
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,394
You found my notebook, didn't you?

163
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:10,817
Is this it?

164
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,227
Yes.

165
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,763
You're not going to send me to jail?

166
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,191
No, no. Not a fine day like this.

167
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:20,852
I'd like to have that.

168
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,646
Oh?

169
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,599
An authentic Virginia Marshland.

170
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,555
Compliments of the artist.
- Thank you.

171
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,077
I didn't know when I drew that,
that judges had a sense of humor.

172
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,289
Judges are often mistaken
for human beings.

173
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,733
That's nice to know.
I will tell Miss Hatter.

174
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:35,274
It will cheer her up. You see, she
needs that lawsuit money badly.

175
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:36,713
Dear Miss Marshland.

176
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,796
A judge interprets the law.
He is not Santa Claus.

177
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,096
Of course not.

178
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,094
Thank you, Your Honor.
- You're welcome.

179
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:43,715
I am glad you are not mad at me.

180
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,514
And I am glad that you are ..

181
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:51,737
Really human.

182
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:53,916
Oh, you would be surprised.

183
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:56,734
It's too bad you never
found that out before.

184
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,186
About judges I mean.

185
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,669
Well, it's only natural.

186
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:02,173
Very few judges come down to
Flandrau Street for dinner.

187
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:04,244
Goodbye, Judge.
- Goodbye.

188
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,446
Good afternoon, Judge.
- Hello Tommy.

189
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:20,523
How did you ..

190
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:23,980
Mrs Higbee.

191
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,130
Mrs Higbee.

192
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,172

Mrs Higbee.

205
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,334
There is a cat in my library.

206
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,162
You know Judge, I've been
thinking a lot about you lately.

207
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,873
You are lonely and I ..

208
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,965
Mrs Higbee, I assure
you I am not lonely.

209
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,641
And furthermore, if I <i>were</i>
lonely it would not be for a cat.

210
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,323
Well, for something then.

211
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,006
Maybe it's this big old house.

212
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,200
Maybe you ought to sell it.
- Sell it?

213
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:27,256
Have you no respect for tradition?
- Tradition? Here? Ha.

214
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,904
I come from Massachusetts.

215
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,751
Mrs Higbee, you astonish me.

216
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,289
This town has one of the most colorful
histories in the State of Minnesota.

217
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,580
Of course, we don't have your puritans.

218
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,432
They weren't my puritans.
- But we had Indians here, you know.

219
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,143
We had Sioux and Chippewa.

220
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,628
Why, there used to be
a famous Indian fort.

221
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:48,061
Right down there where the
D & T.C. freight station is now.

222
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,601
Just off Flandrau Street.

223
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:53,516
Just to wander through those streets
when I was a boy would give me a thrill.

224
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,765
Flandrau Street.

225
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:57,885
I think I will ..

226
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,785
I'll be back in an hour.
I need some exercise.

227
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,266
Where are you going, Judge?
- To breathe that historic air.

228
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:08,315
Perhaps recapture for a moment
the spirit of those sturdy pioneers.

229
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:09,720
Who knows?

230
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,121
Come here.

231
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,562
Come here, cat.

232
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:25,558
Come on, cat.

233
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,884
Here, kitty, kitty.

234
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,171
Kitty, kitty.

235
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,596
Do you know who I am?

236
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,239
I am the Green Dragon.

237
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:59,170
There you are, dad.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

238
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,862
Hey. Hey.

239
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:31,971
Oh, hi Judge.

240
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,363
Hello. Hello.

241
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:35,754
I thought it was you but I
couldn't believe my eyes.

242
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,431
You looking for something?

243
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,774
Yes. Indians.
- Well, you've come to the right place.

244
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:42,886
I often walk around down here.
- Looking for Indians?

245
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,493
Sometimes just for exercise.

246
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,800
It's quite a ways.
You must like walking.

247
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,527
Yes, I do. And baseball.

248
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh good. Say, maybe you can help us out.

249
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,446
Well, I haven't played
since college but ..

250
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,115
I meant, would you be umpire?

251
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:56,586
Oh.

252
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,927
You are such a good judge they say.

253
00:15:59,207 --> 00:15:59,992
They say?

254
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:01,931
Come on, Ginny.
You're holding up the game.

255
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:04,540
Oh, they can wait.
Eino, this is Judge Timberline.

256
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,356
Timber<i>lane</i>. Hello Mr Roskinen.
- How are you, Judge?

257
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,105
I hear you don't like Ginny's drawings.

258
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,905
I didn't say such a thing. I'm trying
to get him to umpire the game.

259
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,864
Don't mind her, Judge.
She's a bit crazy.

260
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,733
So are some judges. Come on.

261
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,851
Play ball.

262
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,117
Strike 1.

263
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,873
Strike 2.

264
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,691
Ball 2.

265
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,135
Ball 3.

266
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,278
What was that, Judge?

267
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:53,404
Ball 3.

268
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:03,684
Safe.

269
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,320
Safe.

270
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:19,229
Hey, who asked you to be umpire?

271
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:20,242
You did.

272
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,088
Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy.

273
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,404
I thought you were a friend.

274
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,453
An umpire has no friends.

275
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:37,782
You are out.

276
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,475
Are you sure?
- Positive.

277
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,443
Strike 1.

278
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:09,463
Strike 2.

279
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,329
Run!

280
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,436
Go, Ginny!

281
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:37,016
Run.

282
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,790
Run.

283
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:42,088
You're out.

284
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,365
Out?

285
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,709
O-u-t. Out.

286
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:49,922
But everybody said I was safe.

287
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,720
That is why an umpire has no friends.

288
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:54,825
You got plenty of friends
up on the heights.

289
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,311
Oh, you mean that ..

290
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:03,034
I'd call one of them
safe if he were out?

291
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,698
I don't know you well enough
to answer that, Judge.

292
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,304
Miss Marshland. Three strikes
is out in any neighborhood.

293
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,756
Well, goodbye Judge.

294
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,587
Don't forget. On Thursday you must
be on time for the champagne.

295
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,094
I don't like champagne.
- I'm crazy about champagne.

296
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,933
Of course, I have never had
any but Thursday is coming.

297
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:23,162
Tomorrow night.

298
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,854
Where do you eat on Thursdays?

299
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:26,697
Thursday is beans at the boarding house.

300
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,269
I like beans.
- I hate beans.

301
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,144
So I have spaghetti on
Thursdays at the Café Italien.

302
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:32,482
Well, I ..

303
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:35,374
Say.

304
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,374
You go right by it on your way home.

305
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,798
Look. It only takes a minute to change.

306
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,812
Can you wait please?
- Where are you going?

307
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,724
This is a shortcut to
the boarding house.

308
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:46,894
Will you admit that you were out?

309
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:49,283
I was out a mile.

310
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:01,200
For crying out loud, Boone.
Look who's on time for a change.

311
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,684
Why shouldn't he be on time? Knowing we
serve the best darned food in Minnesota.

312
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,690
Haven't you heard, Queenie?
I have reformed.

313
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:07,690
Hello Brad.

314
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,334
Hello, beautiful.
- He hasn't reformed entirely.

315
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,004
What's the matter, Webb? Can't a
man tell your wife she's beautiful?

316
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,515
What's the matter with <i>my</i> wife?

317
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:16,895
Hello, beautiful.
- That's more like it.

318
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:18,081
See what I mean?

319
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,454
Well, here is the Doc.

320
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:22,801
Hello, Doc. Hello Lillian.

321
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,176
Hello Boone. How are you?

322
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,974
What's all this about being on time?

323
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,064
I may be late for an operation
but never for a free dinner.

324
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,291
Here.

325
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,183
That poison? Never touch it.

326
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,517
Hi, Roy.
- Hello John.

327
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,326
Hello, Roy. How are you?
- Hello, Greg.

328
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:42,573
Herman.
- Yes, sir?

329
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,284
I must be at the hospital by midnight.

330
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,372
What time is it, doctor?
- It's time to eat.

331
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:47,350
Yes, sir.

332
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,009
Another new maid?

333
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:51,657
Yes, Doctor. This is Dagmar.

334
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,243
Good evening, Dagmar.

335
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:59,948
You are not going to tell on me?

336
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,328
No, sir.

337
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:09,158
Doc is a great kidder
if you can take it.

338
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:10,982
His wife takes it.

339
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,594
They call her 'poor dear Lillian'.

340
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:15,021
My goodness.

341
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:17,986
Won't you be fired if
Mrs Havock catches you?

342
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,332
Queenie Havock has fired me
every week for eleven years.

343
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,882
But the chief always takes me back.

344
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,538
A great man, the chief.

345
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,550
You mean that is what
everybody calls Mr Havock?

346
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,530
They call him a lot of other
things but not to his face.

347
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:33,461
Now remember, Dagmar.

348
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:35,928
You are to serve Mrs Wargate first.

349
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,657
What does she look like?

350
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:44,938
There she is.

351
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,537
Louise Wargate and her husband.

352
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,133
King Webb the third.

353
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,229
The young fellow is Crown Prince
Jamie, just back from the war.

354
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:57,699
He looks nice.

355
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,789
Yeah.

356
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,570
And drinks like fish.
- My goodness.

357
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,033
That is his wife Alice.

358
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,149
Chris, where is the judge?

359
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:12,788
I thought Cass was coming with you.

360
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:14,649
So did I.
- Where is your boyfriend?

361
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,723
Couldn't face another
evening with me, I guess.

362
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:18,361
Bunk. Did you call his house?

363
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:20,691
Mrs Higbee said he went
down to Flandrau Street.

364
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:22,536
Looking for Indians.
- Indians?

365
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,155
Hold everything. I'll go find him.

366
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,048
I'll get you something.
- Thanks, Brad.

367
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:31,944
Just a bite.

368
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,366
No. No thanks. It will spoil my dinner.

369
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,476
I'll catch the Dickens alright.

370
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,791
Does it matter an awful lot to you?
- What?

371
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,907
That Mr and Mrs Boone
Havock are angry at you.

372
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:41,894
No, only ..

373
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,953
Are they ever late at you your house?
- Always.

374
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:46,529
Well then.
- I've a reputation for being on time.

375
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,749
You mean you had a reputation.
- That's right.

376
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:52,092
What are you going to tell your friends?

377
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,784
The truth, if anything.

378
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:54,833
Really?

379
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:57,061
That you picked up a girl
from Flandrau Street?

380
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,025
What is wrong with Flandrau Street?

381
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:02,102
Well, I doubt your friends are
going to like it very much.

382
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,477
No look here, Miss Marshland.
- Yes, Mr Judge.

383
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:07,729
There's something we must get straight
about my friends on the heights.

384
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,233
I like them but I have a
great many friends all over.

385
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,124
Some of them are down here.

386
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,009
You have?

387
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:16,278
Certainly. How do you think
a judge gets elected?

388
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:19,584
I didn't think he got elected.
I thought it was an act of God.

389
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,109
Good evening, Judge.
- Good evening, Pete.

390
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,624
Now you are in trouble.
- Am I?

391
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:29,331
The star witness in the
case of Tilda Hatter ..

392
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,275
Versus the city of Grand Republic
dining out with the Judge?

393
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,965
Oh. That is corruption.

394
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,779
It is not corruption if
I don't eat anything.

395
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,165
Would it be corruption if I
have another piece of pie?

396
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,519
Not if you don't have ice-cream on it.

397
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:44,211
Another piece of blueberry pie. Miss.

398
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:45,726
With a scoop of vanilla.

399
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,975
There won't be anything that
good at the Boone Havocks.

400
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,704
Yes, Charlie.

401
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,895
You have? Charlie has located him.

402
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,269
Where?

403
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:57,796
Where is that? On Flandrau Street?

404
00:23:58,518 --> 00:23:59,107
No.

405
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,445
Who is she?

406
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:03,311
Well, I'll be a son-of-gun.

407
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,050
No. Thanks.

408
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,446
That is all. Much obliged.
- What is all this?

409
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,254
Our judge has strayed
off the reservation.

410
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:11,506
No?

411
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:13,910
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

412
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,286
You are sure this doesn't bother you?
- No.

413
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,094
My father smoked a pipe.

414
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,966
I loved my father.

415
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,457
He was so .. so independent.

416
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:32,948
I loved my mother too.

417
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,853
They were a wonderful two people.

418
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,355
They were good together.

419
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:40,115
Poor together.

420
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:42,362
They were very close.

421
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:45,734
One silly thing I remember.

422
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:47,152
What?

423
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,097
They kept their toothbrushes
in the same glass.

424
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,492
Boy. That is marriage, isn't it.

425
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,899
If I ever find a man
like my father, I ..

426
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:06,917
Do you mind being a judge?

427
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:08,470
Mind?
- Uhuh.

428
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,715
No, no. It isn't so bad.

429
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:13,621
As a matter of fact, I am
rather crazy about my job.

430
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:15,715
I wish I was.

431
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,638
Do you know something
I always wanted to do?

432
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:21,330
To go to college.
Find out about things like ..

433
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,927
Like poetry and anthropology and ..

434
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,495
Can you fly a plane?

435
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:26,988
No.

436
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:28,781
Someday I'm going to.

437
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:30,779
Can you play anything?

438
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,288
An instrument, I mean.

439
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,274
Yes.

440
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:36,403
What?

441
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,276
You won't tell anybody, will you.

442
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:44,973
The flute.

443
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:48,654
I promise I won't tell a soul.

444
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,095
Tell me, does your wife know about it?

445
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:55,175
You are married, aren't you?

446
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:56,863
I was married.

447
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,330
You was?

448
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:00,897
My wife died our first year.

449
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:02,444
Gee.

450
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:06,237
Hiya.

451
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:08,294
Hey Ginny, it's time to go bowling.

452
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:10,651
Not now. Maybe later.

453
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:13,575
Aren't you a little
off your beat, Judge?

454
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:15,799
Mr Roskinen.

455
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:20,070
The 22nd judicial district of the state
of Minnesota includes Flandrau Street.

456
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,859
Well, are you coming?
The whole gang will be there.

457
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:25,604
Later. Maybe.

458
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:33,165
Is he your idea of somebody
independent like your father?

459
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:38,805
Are you going to marry him?

460
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:40,254
Any legal objection?

461
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,017
I would fine you fifty dollars.

462
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:43,906
I would have to borrow it from you.

463
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:47,183
Are you engaged to him?
- I object. That's a leading question.

464
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:48,796
Objection overruled.

465
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:52,130
Alright. Eight o'clock.
The court is adjourned.

466
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,923
Time for you to sneeze, Your Honor.

467
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:55,361
You are no cat.

468
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:57,205
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

469
00:26:57,894 --> 00:26:59,707
I guess I could take care of myself.

470
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,909
Grazie, Seńora.

471
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,410
Come again.
- Thank you. Goodnight.

472
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,104
What is this? Are we arrested?

473
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,552
Evening, Judge. Mr Havock
says whenever you are ready.

474
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,064
My friends are having a little fun.

475
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,334
You'd better go before they send
the truant officer after you.

476
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,798
Can I drop you anywhere?

477
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:29,516
Thanks for dinner, Your Honor. And don't
forget we can always use a good umpire.

478
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,184
Thanks. I won't forget.

479
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,834
Yes. Cass has broken off with Chris.

480
00:27:50,654 --> 00:27:52,805
Of course, they weren't engaged.
But we all thought ..

481
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:55,674
Boone told Greg that Flandrau
Street is full of riff-raff.

482
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,369
Of long-haired artists who never pay the
rent and use banisters for firewood.

483
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,363
"<i>A fine thing, even if
they weren't engaged</i>."

484
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:04,635
Okay Queenie, there is no argument.

485
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,105
I am busy. Call me later.

486
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:09,885
Or candidate for the future
Mrs Timberlane has been overruled.

487
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:12,399
All of a sudden, Cass becomes Casanova.

488
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,525
As for me, I'm going to
see him stepping out.

489
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,624
That's a dumb remark for a lawyer to
make about any judge in this district.

490
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:18,560
Right.

491
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,117
Sorry, Boone.

492
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:23,505
But Lillian, she works at Flegans.

493
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,547
She's a stenographer or
even something worse.

494
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:29,662
Don't be silly, Diantha.

495
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,926
Cass and I will always be good friends.

496
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:37,619
Goodbye.

497
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,038
'My candle burns at both ends'.

498
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,898
'It will not last the night'.

499
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:04,379
'But ah, my foes and oh my
friends, it gives a lovely light'.

500
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:05,781
Do you like that one?

501
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:07,600
Should I?

502
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,036
A lot of people do.

503
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,200
They do, do they? Well, I don't.

504
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,877
That's my Ginny.

505
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,499
I'm not your Ginny.

506
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:17,595
Not yet you're not.

507
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:19,475
Why don't you like it?

508
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:22,916
What do you mean 'not yet'?

509
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,322
You will know when you
get older, my girl.

510
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:28,515
No, Ginny. No. Ow.

511
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,543
Whose Ginny am I?
- Your own. Ow.

512
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:32,677
That is more like it.

513
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:34,846
Now fix your hair. It's mussed.

514
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:36,321
You mussed it. You fix it.

515
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,481
That is justice.
- Yes, sure.

516
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:40,584
That is my Ginny.

517
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:42,953
That is your what?
- That's my head.

518
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:53,290
Now, some more poetry please.
If it doesn't bore you.

519
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,227
Who me? I used to write
poetry when I was in college.

520
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:59,482
Really. I would love to hear it.
- Over my dead body.

521
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,183
I was serious then. I was going to do
things about the world. Make it better.

522
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:05,563
Well, aren't you? Being a judge?
- I wonder.

523
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:08,516
Well, you are certainly
making my world better for me.

524
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,863
Do you know what I will
call you, Judge Timberlane?

525
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,648
No. What?
- I will call you 'Timber'.

526
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:16,620
Timber? That's what they yell
when a tree comes crashing down.

527
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,980
That may happen to me but never you.

528
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,549
So I will make it 'Tim'.

529
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,379
Cleopatra, meet Tim.
- Hiya, Cleo. How are you?

530
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,888
There's no reason for you to be against
this poem just because others like it.

531
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,433
I am not against a lot
of things others like.

532
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:34,367
Name one.

533
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:35,891
You.
- No.

534
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:38,597
But that doesn't mean I
have to like your friends.

535
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:41,038
You'll like them when you know them.
- Any bets?

536
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,425
That's just being childish.
- Childish?

537
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:46,926
You with your poetry about candles
burning at both ends and ..

538
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:50,300
I got over that years ago.
- Did you really?

539
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,653
And as for your friends, you are the
most sentimental baby I've ever known.

540
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:54,911
I am, am I?

541
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:57,708
'Good old Boone, dear old Roy'.

542
00:30:57,913 --> 00:30:59,039
'Sweet old Webb'.

543
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,228
Ow! Cass. That tickles.

544
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,333
Who has the best friends
in the whole world?

545
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:04,549
Stop it.
- Come on.

546
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:06,802
Who's got the best friends?
- I take it back. You have.

547
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,051
You have the best friends
in the whole world.

548
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:11,134
Will you be nice to them
when you dance with them?

549
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,008
Dance with them? Where?

550
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:14,639
At the next country club dance.

551
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,240
Who, me?

552
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:17,863
At the country club?

553
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,160
Oh no.
- Oh yes.

554
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:21,613
Not on your life.

555
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:26,350
Besides, I haven't anything to wear.

556
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:28,727
Honest, I haven't.

557
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,450
Alright. Will you compromise?

558
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:33,987
Well, that all depends.

559
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:35,935
What is the compromise?

560
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:37,725
Will you marry me?

561
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,226
You have got the wrong girl, Judge.

562
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,599
No I haven't, Ginny.

563
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,195
Everybody would say so.

564
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:49,765
Everybody but me.

565
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,294
Look, Cass.

566
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,300
Next to my father you're the finest ..

567
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:57,085
I'm not asking to be your father.

568
00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm not even asking you to keep your
toothbrush in the same glass with me.

569
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:05,978
I'm not rich, Ginny. But I could afford
separate glasses for our toothbrushes.

570
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,213
Tim .. it's not that I don't
appreciate you and all you've ..

571
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,726
I don't want your appreciation.

572
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,018
I want you.

573
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:18,018
Very much.

574
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:22,596
No, Tim.

575
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,927
I can't explain it.

576
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:27,291
It is just something.

577
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,338
Something that I will have
to think out by myself.

578
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:37,449
Tim, just now.

579
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:39,890
Just now you called me a wildcat.

580
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,794
Well, maybe you are right.

581
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,614
Maybe I am a cat that
likes to walk alone.

582
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,829
And up there on the
heights with your friends ..

583
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,395
I would just be something
that would make you sneeze.

584
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,946
And that wouldn't be good for you.

585
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:01,707
Shall we go back?

586
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,921
Good evening, Mr Havock.
- Good evening.

587
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:23,234
Good evening, Mrs Havock.
- Good evening, Fred.

588
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,639
Now behave yourself, Queenie.
- I won't.

589
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:28,394
I won't have it. I won't. I won't.
- You will have it and you'll like it.

590
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,221
Has this girl something on you, you rat?

591
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,103
No.

592
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,959
I am doing this for Cass.

593
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:35,484
Has she got something on Cass?
- Not that I know of.

594
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,453
Then I won't.
She is nothing but a thing.

595
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:39,233
Good evening.
- Evening.

596
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:40,776
She's not a thing.
- She is.

597
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,775
Good evening.

598
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,979
Hello, Boone.
- Oh. Good evening.

599
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:47,168
You don't know a thing about her.

600
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:51,056
I know enough to know I'll not allow any
cheap shop-girl marry into our bunch.

601
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,199
Pick up your feet.
She hasn't married him yet.

602
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:02,182
Cass is our friend.

603
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,223
His friends are our friends.

604
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:06,989
That is a very beautiful thought.

605
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:09,009
But tell me. What is on your mind?

606
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:10,691
Cass is a judge.

607
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:13,014
You don't make enemies of judges.

608
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:14,983
You may need them someday.

609
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:17,409
I think I get it.

610
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,749
Smart girl.

611
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:21,036
Oh, here they come.

612
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,193
Hello.

613
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,195
Remember me? I am Brad Criley.

614
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,517
Yes. Of course I do.

615
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:33,607
I thought I wouldn't let you face
that gang of hyenas by yourself.

616
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:34,870
Thanks.

617
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,763
You were right about that dress.

618
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,509
Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Cass.

619
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,556
Don't shoot, girls, until you
see the whites of her eyes.

620
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:01,254
Cass Timberlane is one
of our big intellectuals.

621
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,664
Sure. He has the
biggest library in town.

622
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,021
A heavy thinker.

623
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,476
He subscribes to magazines
that nobody ever heard of.

624
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:08,951
Except the FBI.

625
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:10,902
But when it comes to a woman.

626
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:12,710
He picks a birdbrain.

627
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:14,344
I like her.

628
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:16,266
Well, I mean ..

629
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:19,242
I like Cass and he
likes her, so I like her.

630
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:22,280
How sweet, Lillian.

631
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,098
'Operation climber' has
found another beachhead.

632
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:30,100
If you should ever need a lawyer ..

633
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:31,902
A lawyer? What for?

634
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,194
Oh, to dance with.

635
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,602
You are hired.

636
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:39,263
I might need a lawyer at that.

637
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,239
To defend me against
some of Cass's friends.

638
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:44,189
Oh, but they love you.

639
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:48,824
Well, there's one or two who look as
though they'd like to sue me for living.

640
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,107
The living versus the dead.

641
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,680
I will take the case any time you say.

642
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:57,895
She is charming, Cass.

643
00:35:58,421 --> 00:35:59,131
Yes.

644
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,373
Darn her.

645
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:05,233
Are you very much in love?

646
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:08,248
It's like being in an earthquake.

647
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:11,282
You are not exactly the
earthquake type, Cass.

648
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,856
No. No, but ..

649
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,361
I think this is something
that just had to happen.

650
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:19,142
Earthquakes have been known to do
considerable damage to a community.

651
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,527
And you are a very important
part of the community.

652
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:26,237
All of your friends hope
that she appreciates that.

653
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:28,919
That is up to me.

654
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:30,874
Yes, Cass.

655
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:33,766
I ..

656
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,927
Wish you both every happiness.

657
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:38,868
Thanks, Chris.

658
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:44,114
I don't know that she will have me.

659
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:46,677
She will.

660
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,226
I don't know.

661
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:49,784
I don't know.

662
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,629
Would you like to dance, Chris?

663
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:21,873
You've made a big hit.
Everybody is crazy about you.

664
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:24,314
I don't know. They pretend to like me.

665
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:25,639
Because of you.

666
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:27,355
They know I am wrong for you.

667
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,029
Really Tim, I am wrong for you.

668
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:30,996
Why?

669
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,863
Some girls make good wives like
your friend in there, Miss Grau.

670
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,642
You want me to marry her?
- No.

671
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:37,623
Why not?

672
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:40,130
You know why not.

673
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,105
It couldn't be because you love me?

674
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,393
Is love enough for you, Tim?

675
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:51,936
I will settle for it.

676
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:55,306
Are you sure?
- I'm sure that I love you.

677
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:59,867
And I am sure that marriage can
beautiful and permanent and great.

678
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:03,022
I'm not afraid. You shouldn't
be either if you love me.

679
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:05,879
Oh, Tim. I do.

680
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,875
Hold me, Tim.

681
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:12,902
Always.

682
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,628
Well, that leaves me the
last of the bachelors.

683
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,006
Uhuh.

684
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,412
You know, Roy. I ought to find
a girl like that and settle down.

685
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:00,887
Yes. I know.

686
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:03,510
Marriages always affect you like that.

687
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,260
Other men's marriages.
- No. I really mean it.

688
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,187
You always mean it.
That is your charm, son.

689
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:11,086
But you never do it.

690
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:12,974
That is your protection.

691
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:44,732
Did you enjoy your eggs, ma'am?

692
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:47,423
The best eggs I've ever tasted.

693
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:48,962
The best toast.

694
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,480
The best coffee.

695
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,967
The best evening.

696
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,112
Oh.

697
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,510
Yes, ma'am.

698
00:40:00,307 --> 00:40:02,474
If you're not careful he'll
think we were just married.

699
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:05,001
That would be awful, wouldn't it.
- Awful.

700
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:10,053
That is a nice ring, Mrs Tim.

701
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,892
You like it, Judge?
- It's fine.

702
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,392
It is perfect.

703
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:36,822
In here.

704
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,772
Come on, dear.

705
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:44,871
Let's try it here.
- Where?

706
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,264
No, no. Not in there.

707
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:49,999
Where?
- Around.

708
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,393
Oh, my roses.

709
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,630
Wait. No. Round this way.

710
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,339
Tell you what, let's try it over here.
This will be better.

711
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:03,448
Can we ..

712
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:10,817
We can take this love seat out.
What do you think?

713
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,566
It's stood in that corner
for over 70 years.

714
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:17,714
Would you like to stand
in a corner for 70 years?

715
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:19,753
Darling, with you it
would be a pleasure.

716
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:26,209
Hey, remember me?

717
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,378
Listen, you lovebirds.
Make up your minds.

718
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,309
We know that belongs there.

719
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:37,790
Let's try it back over here.

720
00:41:44,706 --> 00:41:46,093
There. What do you think, Brad?

721
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,302
It is magnificent.

722
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,150
Next week let's try it on the ceiling.

723
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:51,017
I'm a dead duck.

724
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:53,058
Alright boys, rest.
I'll get you something.

725
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:55,764
Something very good for dead ducks.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

726
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,604
Brad, put the ladder here for me please.
- I thought you said 'rest'.

727
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:01,930
You can do it while resting, can't you?
- Oh, fine.

728
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,124
Right there.

729
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:08,289
Oh no, hand me those.

730
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,925
No. That is the wrong side.
- Oh, that's great.

731
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:18,186
Do you think I could have these? I can
have them made into some underdrawers.

732
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:19,274
Drape shaped.

733
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,385
You know, a few accordion
pleats, a little peplum.

734
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:22,880
But a very little peplum.

735
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:24,540
Watch it.

736
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:29,020
Brad, do you think Cass really likes it?

737
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:32,039
Well, you've turned this old mausoleum
into one of the loveliest homes in town.

738
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:33,049
And I quote.

739
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,930
Did Cass say that?
- Cross my heart.

740
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:38,882
Here we are.

741
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,327
The three beers.

742
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,546
Papa beer.

743
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:42,840
Mama beer.

744
00:42:43,173 --> 00:42:44,074
And baby beer.

745
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:51,743
Well. Rest period is over.

746
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,795
Brad, you hang these curtains up.

747
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:55,788
Who is the husband here?

748
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,615
It is her husband's turn to rest.

749
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,389
I'll just sit right down in this chair
and make all the important decisions.

750
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:04,433
Why should he sit and tell us?

751
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,948
Because he is the judge.

752
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:08,801
Yes, ma'am. Objection overruled.

753
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:13,231
Speaking of being a judge, when are you
going to come and watch me in action?

754
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:14,861
Dear, I have been so busy.

755
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,288
But next week for sure.
- No hurry.

756
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:19,461
Brad.

757
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,540
Get it a little more over to the left.

758
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:24,744
Just a little.

759
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:28,635
Just a little more.

760
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:33,786
That's fine. Fine.

761
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,269
Mrs Boone Havock is on the phone.

762
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:42,286
She wants to know if you can play
bridge at the club Thursday afternoon.

763
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:43,627
Well, I don't ..

764
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:46,176
Wait.

765
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:54,677
'Monday. The country club.
Pick up the Drovers'.

766
00:43:55,096 --> 00:43:56,550
'Tuesday. Women's Auxiliary'.

767
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:57,974
'Be nice. Vote'.

768
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:01,546
'Wednesday lunch. Mrs Prout. Thursday'.

769
00:44:02,802 --> 00:44:03,488
Free.

770
00:44:05,668 --> 00:44:07,986
Alright. And ask her for
dinner here Saturday.

771
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:11,305
No, wait. I will talk to her myself.

772
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,021
Well, they have surely
got her in harness.

773
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:16,663
She must love you a lot, Cass.

774
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,507
And that goes both ways.

775
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:21,274
I just hope she is as happy as I am.

776
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:26,295
Next on the calendar.

777
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,206
Joseph Allen on behalf of various
stockholders of the Wargate Corporation.

778
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:34,064
Against Wargate Havock and
other executives and directors.

779
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:35,987
Hearing on a motion by the plaintiffs.

780
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,060
Are you ready, gentlemen?

781
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,525
I represent the plaintiffs, Your Honor.

782
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:45,758
I appear on behalf of the
defendants, Your Honor.

783
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:46,636
Proceed.

784
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,283
As Your Honor may remember ..

785
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,949
This is an action by some stockholders
of the Wargate Corporation ..

786
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:53,162
Against the officers and
directors of the corporation.

787
00:44:53,286 --> 00:44:56,611
For mismanagement and illegal practices
in connection with war contracts.

788
00:44:57,026 --> 00:44:59,526
Yes, I know that. I read the pleadings.
What is your motion?

789
00:45:00,307 --> 00:45:03,687
If the court please, I move that
the trial of this case be ..

790
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:06,001
Transferred to another judge.

791
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:07,904
We strongly oppose the motion.

792
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:11,598
On what grounds is this motion based?

793
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:13,722
On the grounds that ..

794
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:15,751
You, or that this court is ..

795
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:19,389
Is disqualified from giving a just
decision on this case because ..

796
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:21,843
Because of this court's ..

797
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,729
Long friendship with the executives and
directors of the Wargate Corporation.

798
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:32,965
It is the judgement of this court ..

799
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,141
That the charge of prejudice
is without foundation.

800
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,427
And that the accusation is not
in accord with the facts.

801
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:41,586
Or with the past record of this court.

802
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:43,221
The motion is denied.

803
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:45,572
The case will take its regular
pace on the calendar.

804
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:46,977
The court is adjourned.

805
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:49,653
Yes, Brad.

806
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:51,493
He did, eh?
- He did what?

807
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:53,646
Cass is going to stay on the case.

808
00:45:55,278 --> 00:45:56,221
Alright, Brad.

809
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:57,566
He said Cass was okay?

810
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:00,431
He said Cass would judge the case.

811
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,784
Well, that is okay.

812
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:03,566
Then we have nothing to worry about.

813
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,026
Well, at least we have
a friend in court.

814
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,276
Cass doesn't suspect anything.

815
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:11,286
And the stockholders
don't know anything.

816
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,322
We can go on postponing
the case indefinitely.

817
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:14,677
Maybe.

818
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,432
There is always something.

819
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:18,663
There is nothing to this lawsuit anyway.

820
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,189
War contracts created a
lot of these situations.

821
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:23,249
Not like this one, brother.

822
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:25,456
Come in.

823
00:46:27,097 --> 00:46:28,725
Hello, Jamie. Come in. Sit down.

824
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:33,688
Drunk driving again?

825
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:36,202
Not this time.

826
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:37,550
What's the trouble?

827
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:39,810
Everything.

828
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:43,783
You've been out of uniform
quite a while now, Jamie.

829
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,531
You can't blame the war much longer.

830
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:47,802
I don't blame the war.

831
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,986
But is it wrong for a
man to come home ..

832
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,513
And to want things good
again the way they were?

833
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,783
Is it a crime to expect a man's wife ..

834
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:03,908
Alice wants a divorce.

835
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:07,490
That is why I am here, Cass.

836
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:10,985
What are her grounds?

837
00:47:12,185 --> 00:47:14,090
She wants to get away
from Grand Republic.

838
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,283
Live in a big city.

839
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,231
What has she got against Grand Republic?

840
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:24,316
Well, you're not going to
let her get away with it.

841
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,550
I am fed up.

842
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:28,792
Sit down, Jamie.

843
00:47:30,692 --> 00:47:31,999
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

844
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:37,179
In the first place, people just can't
get a divorce because they're fed up.

845
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:39,400
Because their wives
are restless and bored.

846
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:42,352
And in the second place
you are no ordinary Joe ..

847
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:45,290
Who can just pack up and leave because
your wife doesn't like it here anymore.

848
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:49,020
One of these days you are going
to be running Wargate plant.

849
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:51,788
What you do means a great
deal to a lot of people.

850
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,717
This is your town. You are important.
Your future is important.

851
00:47:58,472 --> 00:48:00,383
I have no future without Alice.

852
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:03,603
You do love her, Jamie?

853
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,205
Love her?

854
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:08,710
Love her? I ..

855
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:15,426
I am sorry, Cass.

856
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,310
What about, Jamie?

857
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:23,033
For saying it out loud.

858
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:26,212
That's what threw me, I guess.

859
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:28,963
I thought you might be able
to tell me what do to.

860
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:31,840
Being as, in a way we
are in the same boat.

861
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,968
What do you mean? In what way?

862
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,345
It wasn't anything
Ginny said definitely.

863
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,891
To me at least.

864
00:48:38,477 --> 00:48:39,409
But to Alice.

865
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,876
What about?
- About not liking it here.

866
00:48:42,282 --> 00:48:44,796
Wanting to move to
Minneapolis or Chicago.

867
00:48:45,195 --> 00:48:46,255
Something about ..

868
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:48,236
A cage you were both in.

869
00:48:55,574 --> 00:48:57,666
I guess I had better not
take any more of your time.

870
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:05,907
Jamie, you came home
covered with medals.

871
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:09,094
There are battles to
win in marriages too.

872
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:11,399
They don't give you any medals for it.

873
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:14,359
Good luck, Jamie.

874
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,199
Good luck to you, Cass.

875
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:26,832
Ginny.

876
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:28,977
Ginny.

877
00:49:34,168 --> 00:49:34,840
Ginny.

878
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:47,127
[ Cat miaow ]

879
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,587
So, it's you, huh?

880
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,614
Are you comfortable?

881
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,104
Maybe you would like to go to Chicago?

882
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:01,054
Well, the joke is on you.
You are not going to Chicago.

883
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:04,267
And furthermore, I forgot your cat food.

884
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:06,205
Achoo.

885
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,199
Achoo.

886
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:16,106
Does the judge know yet?

887
00:50:16,398 --> 00:50:18,027
No. I am going to tell him now.

888
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:19,501
Cass.

889
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,027
There you are.

890
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:25,040
Darling, we have to get dressed.
Where have you been?

891
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:26,630
Don't you wish you knew?

892
00:50:27,003 --> 00:50:28,594
We'll be late for dinner.
- Dinner?

893
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:29,519
Where?

894
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:30,665
Where?

895
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:33,072
I told you the just this morning.
- Oh, Your Honor.

896
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:36,094
I can only say that I had something
more important to think about.

897
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:43,457
Ginny. Tell me something, will you.
- Tell you something?

898
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:46,982
You're meant to know everything, Judge.
- Well, it seems that perhaps I don't.

899
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:48,596
Goodness, what could that be?

900
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:50,654
Well, it might be something
or it might not be.

901
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:53,319
But you want to be fair before
you decide, don't you Judge.

902
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,464
Ginny.

903
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,611
Is there something on your mind
you haven't told me about?

904
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:02,850
Guilty, Your Honor.
- Look Ginny, this isn't funny.

905
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,335
Not for me it isn't.
- And certainly not for me.

906
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,593
You will get along alright.

907
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,510
Supposing I don't want to?

908
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:14,907
Well, you will just have to I reckon.

909
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:18,914
Has it ever occurred to that you this
might be nobody's problem but your own?

910
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,374
Well, I wouldn't say that.

911
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,192
Do you think it's Boone's
fault or Queenie's?

912
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:25,979
No.

913
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:27,960
Louise, Webb, Diantha?

914
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:28,843
No.

915
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:30,615
They've all tried to be very friendly.

916
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,234
Oh, that is right. Yes.

917
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,754
Whose fault is it then?

918
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,883
The stork.

919
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:39,728
The what?

920
00:51:43,444 --> 00:51:44,116
Ginny.

921
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:47,774
Ah, Ginny.

922
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,131
Ready for chapter 36?

923
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:20,021
I am ready for something.

924
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,559
Little Tim.

925
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:24,568
Little Tim has been
practising flip-flops.

926
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,155
Well, I'm sorry Cleo.

927
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:29,909
But we mustn't do anything
to disturb the judge.

928
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,487
You see, he's going to become
a father any day now.

929
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,088
Yes, Cleo.

930
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:37,581
When you get older, you'll understand
what a father goes through.

931
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,827
Go downstairs and give
Mrs Higbee a laugh with that one.

932
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,554
If you say 'Gesundheit' you're through.

933
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:47,993
Mrs Higbee thinks it
is going to be a girl.

934
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:49,389
I am sure it is.

The first woman President
of the United states.

937
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:57,533
I don't think Emily would
want to live in Washington.

938
00:52:58,122 --> 00:52:59,938
Emily is going to live
where she wants to.

939
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:02,165
Like her mother.

940
00:53:02,686 --> 00:53:03,648
Like her mother.

Oh, hello.

944
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,105
Fine, Boone. She is fine.

945
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:15,769
She is resting right now.

946
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:18,355
That I will.

947
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:19,902
Thank you very much.

948
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,521
Goodbye.

949
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:25,448
They just wanted to know if
there was anything they could do.

950

That's very nice.

951
00:53:28,194 --> 00:53:30,142
Everybody has been nice to me.

952
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:33,359
There is more interest in this
baby than the world series.

953
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,444
It won't be long now.

954
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,281
Shall I read to you?
- Hmm.

955
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:55,243
Chapter 36.

956
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:00,711
I love you very much.

957
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:05,848
Is that chapter 36?

958
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,231
And 37 and 38 and all the
rest of the chapters.

959
00:54:12,472 --> 00:54:13,488
I like that book.

How does it end?

961
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:18,895
There is no end.

962
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:21,779
I just go on loving you.

963
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:24,802
Trying to make you happy because
you have made me so happy.

I didn't know how really lonely I was.

966
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:36,532
And baby makes three.

967
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:47,058
Tim.
- What?

968
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:50,487
You'd better call the stork club
and tell them to get a bed ready.

969
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,700
Alright. Take it easy now.
I'll get a hold of them.

970
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:55,368
Mrs Higbee.

971
00:54:56,116 --> 00:54:57,990
Hello. Get me the doctor, will you.
Mrs Higbee.

972
00:54:58,252 --> 00:54:59,844
Dr Drover, yes.

973
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,841
Mrs Higbee. Hello. Hello.

974
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:03,691
Mrs Higbee. Mrs Higbee.

975
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:04,773
Hello, hello?

976
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,051
Mrs Higbee.

977
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:07,585
Hello? Mrs Higbee?

978
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:19,749
Oh, nurse.

979
00:55:21,332 --> 00:55:24,209
That doesn't happen to be a young fellow
by the name of Timberlane, does it?

980
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,492
No, Judge.

981
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:27,660
This is little David Smith.
- Oh.

982
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:32,814
Hiya, Smitty.

983
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,228
How are you?

984
00:55:36,204 --> 00:55:38,289
Any word about Mrs Timberlane?

985
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,785
I am afraid you will have
to wait a little longer.

986
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:42,966
Would you like to see our garden?

987
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:44,732
Pardon?
- Come with me.

988
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,305
That's our garden.

989
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,415
Like it?
- Wonderful, Wonderful.

990
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:08,852
You need one more for a baseball team.

991
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:13,203
Save that spot on the outfield
for young Timberlane.

992
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:16,324
Supposing the baby is a little girl?
- That is so much the better.

993
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,866
Mrs Timberlane is a very
fine ball player herself.

994
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:20,539
I'm sure she is.

995
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:54,875
Ginny. Is anything wrong?

996
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:57,083
Ginny is fine.
- Are you sure?

997
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:59,272
She didn't have a bad time at all.

998
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:01,163
You scared the daylights out of me.

999
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:03,391
Is it a boy or a girl?
- A girl.

1000
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:04,684
Emily.

1001
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:05,956
Only.

1002
00:57:08,565 --> 00:57:09,384
Only what?

1003
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:11,249
A bit of bad luck.

1004
00:57:14,693 --> 00:57:15,374
Dead?

1005
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,661
Some internal trouble.

1006
00:57:22,744 --> 00:57:24,900
Come on down the hall.
We'll have some coffee.

1007
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:39,626
Does Ginny know?

1008
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,688
I'll tell her later.

1009
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,758
I'd like to tell her, Roy.
If you don't mind.

1010
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,142
Later, Cass.

1011
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:48,658
I'll let you know when.

1012
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:39,217
Hello daddy.

1013
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,381
Hello.

1014
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,930
I wouldn't stay long.

1015
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:51,469
Where is Emily?

1016
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:54,025
You look fine.

1017
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:57,244
You poor man. Did you have a bad time?

1018
00:58:58,587 --> 00:59:00,196
Roy said it wasn't bad.

1019
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:05,016
Why won't they let me see her?

1020
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,834
Have you seen her?

1021
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:22,006
Tim, tell me.

1022
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:23,843
Ginny.

1023
00:59:25,334 --> 00:59:26,439
Emily is ..

1024
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:32,379
She had bad luck.

1025
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,492
No, no. Wait. Don't tell me.

1026
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:16,385
No.

1027
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,060
Well, what's the matter?

1028
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,341
You can't jump with a queen.
- Why not?

1029
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:22,932
I don't know. Some rule.
Seems they had rules, even for queens.

1030
01:00:23,149 --> 01:00:24,193
Who made the rules?

1031
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:27,060
Some Chinese I suppose.
I don't remember his name.

1032
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,340
And I suppose women aren't
allowed to make rules.

1033
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,134
How do you know this jump won't
make the game more exciting?

1034
01:00:32,394 --> 01:00:34,928
You'd like to bet on what would happen?
- Anything might happen.

1035
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,182
Something new.
Something nobody's ever tried before.

1036
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:38,824
Would you like to see?
- Yes.

1037
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:41,147
Supposing you jumped
with your queen like this.

1038
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,279
That would check my king.

1039
01:00:43,604 --> 01:00:45,201
Then I would have to move my bishop.

1040
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:47,059
That would check your king.

1041
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:50,166
So you would lose your queen.

1042
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:53,406
That would mean stalemate.
And the end of the game.

1043
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:54,874
And who would have any fun?

1044
01:00:58,578 --> 01:01:00,987
Poor little queen. You can't jump. Ever.

1045
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:02,578
Because of a rule.

1046
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,553
A stupid rule made by
some man centuries ago.

1047
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,260
Oh, it ain't right.

1048
01:01:15,063 --> 01:01:15,678
Tim.

1049
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:18,791
Tim darling, have patience with me.

1050
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:20,671
Yes, my queen.

1051
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:24,192
Hey, where is the hot drink?

1052
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:26,514
Where's the others?
- They're coming.

1053
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:28,012
My, don't you look happy.

1054
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,016
Well, you look pretty fit yourself.

1055
01:01:30,569 --> 01:01:31,606
Thank you.

1056
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:34,923
There is nothing like a stiff game
of chess to keep a girl in shape.

1057
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,926
Poor Cass. Alone with me all afternoon.

1058
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:40,054
Listen. I'll take poor Cass's
place any time you say.

1059
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:42,364
And that goes for skiing lessons too.

1060
01:01:43,202 --> 01:01:45,364
I won't learn to ski this year.
It's almost March.

1061
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:48,730
Well, how about flying lessons in the
spring? I'll have my new plane by then.

1062
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:50,131
Me, fly?

1063
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,018
Why not?

1064
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:55,106
Tim.

1065
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:57,101
That would be wonderful.
Let's drink to it.

1066
01:01:57,616 --> 01:01:59,137
To flying, and your wife.

1067
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:00,364
And you.

1068
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:01,926
The best husband in the world.

1069
01:02:02,683 --> 01:02:04,502
Well, let's just drink
to the three of us.

1070
01:02:04,745 --> 01:02:06,066
Right. To the three of us.

1071
01:02:06,284 --> 01:02:07,344
To the three of us.

1072
01:02:15,868 --> 01:02:17,507
See an opening?
- Not yet.

1073
01:02:17,774 --> 01:02:18,732
But don't worry.

1074
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:20,573
Who is worrying?

1075
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:23,696
Shall we take a look upstairs?
- That's a good idea.

1076
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,011
Now we are in heaven.

1077
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,523
Wherever you are is heaven.

1078
01:02:52,303 --> 01:02:55,104
You sound exactly like a fellow
I used to know named Brad Criley.

1079
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:56,590
Whatever became of him?

1080
01:02:56,764 --> 01:02:58,846
He fell out of an aeroplane.
Or was pushed.

1081
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:00,395
Poor fellow.
- Poor fellow.

1082
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,087
Now that we've found heaven,
where do you suppose earth is?

1083
01:03:05,211 --> 01:03:05,999
Who cares?

1084
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:07,709
Who cares? Not I. Aim for the sun.

1085
01:03:08,097 --> 01:03:09,871
No. The sun is too hot.
How about the moon?

1086
01:03:10,094 --> 01:03:11,982
The moon is too dark. For us.

1087
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,037
Well, where?

1088
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,704
What is your idea of a good destination?

1089
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:21,576
I don't know about you but I am
rather partial to New York.

1090
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,273
New York?
- Hmm.

1091
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,819
What's good about that?

1092
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:26,216
You mean you've never been?

1093
01:03:26,873 --> 01:03:27,517
Well.

1094
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,834
First, we go to a restaurant called 21.
Very hard to get a table.

1095
01:03:31,355 --> 01:03:33,417
But we would get one.
- The corner table upstairs.

1096
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,364
Mr Criley's table.

1097
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,751
Should we start with a little
vichyssoise or a melon with prosciutto?

1098
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:40,670
Prosciutto?
- Ham to you.

1099
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:42,922
Oh. Prosciutto, by all means.

1100
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:46,479
Then after that a little
Medayone Danielle.

1101
01:03:48,602 --> 01:03:49,945
Hello Kit. How are you?

1102
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:52,640
That is Kit Cornell.
You know, the actress.

1103
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,305
Katharine Cornell?
- Uhuh.

1104
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:56,069
You really know people like that?

1105
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:58,325
Sure. Authors, actresses, what have you.

1106
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,736
You must come with me some time.

1107
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,746
I wanted to go on the stage once.

1108
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,313
You would be darned good.

1109
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:08,805
Why don't you try out for the
Heather Club show next week?

1110
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,004
I bet you and I could get
a couple of good parts.

1111
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:12,652
Do you think so?

1112
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:15,573
It's in the bag. Louise and Queenie
are going to be on the committee.

1113
01:04:16,163 --> 01:04:18,491
Cass will let you do it.
- Sure he will.

1114
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:22,399
And speaking of Cass, he'll be awfully
sore at me flying in this weather.

1115
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:26,528
MC-503-H calling Wargate Field.

1116
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:29,772
MC-503-H calling for
landing instructions.

1117
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:31,415
Come in, please. Over.

1118
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,077
"<i>Wargate field replying</i>."

1119
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:35,011
"<i>Better not try to come
in, Mrs Timberlane</i>."

1120
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:37,009
"<i>The ceiling is lifting
but it would be risky</i>."

1121
01:04:37,181 --> 01:04:38,511
"<i>Minneapolis might be safer</i>."

1122
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,097
Thank, Mac.

1123
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:42,240
Well.

1124
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,027
They have very good
prosciutto in Minneapolis.

1125
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:04,866
It looks pretty thick, doesn't it?

1126
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,239
You think she will be alright?

1127
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:09,624
I see.

1128
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,017
Thanks, Mac.

1129
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:43,496
You haven't played that
lonesome flute for a long time.

1130
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:45,388
I haven't been lonesome for a long time.

1131
01:05:45,512 --> 01:05:46,690
Where is the missus?

1132
01:05:47,191 --> 01:05:49,408
She went to Minneapolis.
She may not be back until morning.

1133
01:05:49,765 --> 01:05:50,437
Alone?

1134
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:52,276
Why?

1135
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:53,848
Why?

1136
01:05:54,276 --> 01:05:55,835
Because maybe you should be with her.

1137
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:58,030
Now, Mrs Higbee.
This isn't a radio serial.

1138
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,049
The green dragon doesn't
live in Minneapolis.

1139
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:02,831
There's all kinds of dragons when
a woman is looking for something.

1140
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:05,414
What is she looking for?
- The green pastures.

1141
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:08,348
Are you going to have
another baby, Judge?

1142
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:10,328
What do you mean, the 'green pastures'?

1143
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:12,409
Someplace that ain't.

1144
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:15,304
Cass.
- Ginny.

1145
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:17,367
Cass.
- Well.

1146
01:06:18,285 --> 01:06:20,060
Ginny, you didn't go to Minneapolis.

1147
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:22,737
No. Of course not. We made a
forced landing in Anderson's farm.

1148
01:06:22,861 --> 01:06:24,324
You could have stayed the night.

1149
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:26,401
I couldn't. Brad doesn't
know how to play chess.

1150
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:27,611
Well, that is tough.

1151
01:06:27,963 --> 01:06:29,254
You sure had him worried.

1152
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,929
What's for dinner? I'm starved.

1153
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,696
Fried chicken and waffles, Mrs Higbee.

1154
01:06:32,882 --> 01:06:34,646
The prodigal returns
to the green pastures.

1155
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:36,939
Make if for three.
I've asked Brad to stay for dinner.

1156
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,713
Is that alright?
- Sure. Fine.

1157
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,300
Brad is bringing a copy of the
<i>Barretts of Wimpole Street</i>.

1158
01:06:41,424 --> 01:06:43,412
He wants me to try out for
the Heather Club's show.

1159
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:44,888
I think that is a good idea.

1160
01:06:45,963 --> 01:06:46,936
Do you mean it?

1161
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,603
Yeah. Louise told me about the trials.
I think you would be wonderful.

1162
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:53,419
Well, Brad is going to try out too.

1163
01:06:54,938 --> 01:06:56,182
Brad is a very good actor.

1164
01:06:57,996 --> 01:06:58,611
No.

1165
01:06:59,496 --> 01:07:00,082
No.

1166
01:07:01,114 --> 01:07:02,788
What's up?
- He's talking to Washington.

1167
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:03,828
Yes.

1168
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,389
Alright. Goodbye.

1169
01:07:10,428 --> 01:07:11,907
False alarm. We are safe so far.

1170
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,362
That's great.
- Shut up.

1171
01:07:13,486 --> 01:07:15,560
I won't shut up and if my
father has to go to jail ..

1172
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:17,572
Nobody is going to jail.
Especially myself.

1173
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,065
You didn't know anything about this.
- I do now.

1174
01:07:20,306 --> 01:07:21,750
Your father thought you ought to.

1175
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,614
The stockholder's
committee knows nothing.

1176
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:26,461
Washington doesn't know anything.
Nobody knows anything except us.

1177
01:07:28,489 --> 01:07:31,012
Jamie, what we did during
the war wasn't a crime.

1178
01:07:31,245 --> 01:07:32,558
I know, dad. You said that.

1179
01:07:33,036 --> 01:07:34,368
But it was against the law.

1180
01:07:34,671 --> 01:07:37,898
It was what lots of smart men have
done before and will do again.

1181
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:38,761
Sure.

1182
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,264
Right now, the important thing
is to hold Cass's friendship.

1183
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,920
And keep postponing the
case until it blows over.

1184
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,638
Now, let's get back to the drama.

1185
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:52,971
Very well. Then I will say nothing.

1186
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,602
You tell me I don't understand.

1187
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,310
You are quite right. I don't.

1188
01:07:56,835 --> 01:07:58,280
You tell me he is devoted to you.

1189
01:07:58,656 --> 01:08:02,950
I don't understand devotion that demands
duty and respect and obedience and love.

1190
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:05,062
Demands all and takes all.

1191
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:07,948
I don't understand devotion
that grudges you ..

1192
01:08:08,072 --> 01:08:09,849
Any ray of light or a
glimpse of happiness.

1193
01:08:10,963 --> 01:08:13,758
Even before I passed through that door
and our eyes first met across the room.

1194
01:08:13,974 --> 01:08:14,942
I loved you.

1195
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:17,060
And I have gone on loving you.

1196
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:19,480
And I love you know more
than words can tell.

1197
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:22,737
For pity's sake, leave me.
- No.

1198
01:08:23,586 --> 01:08:25,161
We must never see each other again.

1199
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:27,132
I shall never let you go.

1200
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:29,990
Robert, have mercy on me.

1201
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:32,153
Elisabeth, my darling.

1202
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:33,614
Robert.

1203
01:08:34,845 --> 01:08:35,942
I love you.

1204
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:38,004
I love you.

1205
01:08:38,932 --> 01:08:39,747
I love you.

1206
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:41,110
Great stuff, Brad.

1207
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:42,911
Now let everybody come and eat.

1208
01:08:44,492 --> 01:08:45,908
We hadn't quite finished, chief.

1209
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:47,894
That was swell acting.

1210
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,299
Why, you old square-head.

1211
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:53,250
You've got an actress in the family.
Why didn't you let us in on it?

1212
01:08:53,374 --> 01:08:55,398
You can never tell about
things like that, can you.

1213
01:08:55,704 --> 01:08:57,418
It's Katherine Cornell herself.

1214
01:08:57,649 --> 01:08:59,618
You were wonderful, darling.
- Thank you so much.

1215
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,952
You were fine, Ginny.
- What about our leaving man?

1216
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:04,377
Give me that kiss that Boone
interrupted and I'll tell you.

1217
01:09:04,501 --> 01:09:06,546
How is this?
- You get the part.

1218
01:09:06,746 --> 01:09:08,924
I thought I was pretty good myself.
What about it, chief?

1219
01:09:09,221 --> 01:09:11,658
Fine. Let's have some of my
special brandy to celebrate.

1220
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:12,802
Good.

1221
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,339
A great performance.
- Oh, it was nothing.

1222
01:09:17,463 --> 01:09:18,669
That's what you think.

1223
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,292
Close the door will you.

1224
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,419
This must be very special brandy.

1225
01:09:36,827 --> 01:09:38,359
Very special. Yeah.

1226
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:44,688
Well.

1227
01:09:45,245 --> 01:09:48,139
Here is to our new legal
representative in New York.

1228
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,075
New York?

1229
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:52,757
A great place, New York.

1230
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,134
Listen here.

1231
01:09:54,258 --> 01:09:56,529
If you think there was anything ..
- You will like New York.

1232
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:18,154
Just let me ask you one thing.
If you're convinced I'm guilty ..

1233
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:21,760
I'm convinced of nothing. I just say
to you that Brad has gone too far.

1234
01:10:22,194 --> 01:10:24,982
Oh, when a judge raises his voice
the boys go out and get the rope.

1235
01:10:25,182 --> 01:10:28,007
Now look, Ginny. I will be firm about
this. I'm going to be as tough as nails.

1236
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:30,047
It's not easy for me because I love you.

1237
01:10:30,254 --> 01:10:31,491
But you don't trust me.

1238
01:10:31,615 --> 01:10:33,444
When you fool around
with a buzz-saw, no.

1239
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:36,330
Brad is a buzz-saw, is he?
Are you criticizing your best friend?

1240
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:38,436
Brad is a great guy on a golf course.

1241
01:10:38,641 --> 01:10:40,635
He'd steal a man's wife
and think nothing of it.

1242
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:42,765
He would think he was doing
him a favor. And her.

1243
01:10:43,196 --> 01:10:46,405
What Brad might think was perfectly
casual could destroy you and me.

1244
01:10:46,696 --> 01:10:49,102
Just let me tell you one thing.
Brad is different.

1245
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:52,087
Different from all those other friends
of yours and he has got courage.

1246
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:54,440
If he wanted to get out
of this place he'd go.

1247
01:10:54,721 --> 01:10:56,791
If he were here right now
and you dared to hint ..

1248
01:10:57,009 --> 01:10:59,004
He'll have a chance for all
that in a few moments.

1249
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,739
He is coming here?
- Any minute.

1250
01:11:02,629 --> 01:11:03,616
Does he know why?

1251
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:06,402
No, but he will. And I'd like you to
hear what I'm going to say to him.

1252
01:11:06,713 --> 01:11:09,239
I wouldn't think of it.
- Now Ginny, hold that temper.

1253
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:11,385
I've got a temper too, Ginny.

1254
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:13,419
I hope you never have
to see it in action.

1255
01:11:13,754 --> 01:11:14,622
[ Doorbell ]

1256
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,527
Ginny, I want you to stay.

1257
01:11:16,864 --> 01:11:18,246
I most certainly will not.

1258
01:11:27,127 --> 01:11:28,127
Hi.
- Come in.

1259
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:30,254
Where is the great actress?

1260
01:11:30,459 --> 01:11:32,218
She is upstairs.
Let's go into the library.

1261
01:11:32,846 --> 01:11:34,598
Who else is dropping in?
- Nobody.

1262
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,601
Good. I haven't had a real get-together
with you for some time.

1263
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:54,454
Brad, I want you to be careful how you
answer what I am going to say to you.

1264
01:11:54,655 --> 01:11:57,058
Because I want to keep your
friendship if it's possible.

1265
01:11:57,294 --> 01:11:59,368
This sounds serious, Judge.
If it's about that suit ..

1266
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,687
It's about Ginny.

1267
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:08,930
You and she and I drank a toast
together not long ago up in my cabin.

1268
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:10,836
To the three of us, wasn't it?

1269
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:12,557
To the three of us.

1270
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,977
I meant that then and I mean it now.

1271
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:18,769
But I am calling you on the toast.
What have you got?

1272
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:21,252
Now, just as minute, Judge.
- I'm not judging. I'm asking.

1273
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:24,518
If I may do a little asking myself.
What suddenly started all this?

1274
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:27,173
Being forced to admit tonight
what I already knew.

1275
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:30,113
That means to intimate
the preposterous idea that ..

1276
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:31,196
Yes.

1277
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:34,066
What?
- I said yes.

1278
01:12:35,381 --> 01:12:36,568
What proof have you got?

1279
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:39,880
I didn't have any until
you asked that question.

1280
01:12:40,769 --> 01:12:42,524
You call that proof
you are not asking me?

1281
01:12:42,804 --> 01:12:44,829
I'm telling you not to go any further.

1282
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,379
Look, Cass.

1283
01:12:47,965 --> 01:12:49,790
I have faults and you have exaggerated.

1284
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,206
But I think Ginny is the most
wonderful girl I ever met.

1285
01:12:52,677 --> 01:12:55,275
But nobody knows more than
I do that she is your wife.

1286
01:12:57,636 --> 01:12:59,171
Here's to the three of us. Still.

1287
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:03,719
I'll drink to that.

1288
01:13:13,157 --> 01:13:14,952
I wish now I had told you something.

1289
01:13:15,139 --> 01:13:17,144
About a month ago I
decided to get out of here.

1290
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:18,203
Why?

1291
01:13:18,673 --> 01:13:21,642
I don't know why, Cass. I've always
wanted to take a crack at New York.

1292
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,460
A freelance?

1293
01:13:24,102 --> 01:13:26,870
Not at first. I asked Webb to let me
represent them there for a while.

1294
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:28,755
Does Ginny know about this?

1295
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,260
No. I wanted to be sure.
It may not work out.

1296
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:35,816
One thing I do know.
I will never find better friends.

1297
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:38,997
Want to come up and tell that to Ginny?

1298
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:41,750
You tell her for me. Goodnight, Cass.

1299
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:43,145
Goodnight, Brad.

1300
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:21,712
Hey. You are in the wrong room.

1301
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:23,107
Are we?

1302
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,970
Really Mr Browning, I must ask you.

1303
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:28,650
What?

1304
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:32,714
You know very well that love has no
place and can have no place in my life.

1305
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:34,844
As I have told you, I am a dying woman.

1306
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,124
That's tough.

1307
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:38,003
We must never see each other again.

1308
01:14:38,513 --> 01:14:40,458
You are breaking my heart.
- Oh, Robert.

1309
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:41,544
I love you.

1310
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:43,367
I love you. I love you.

1311
01:14:43,827 --> 01:14:45,179
Have mercy on me.

1312
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:50,756
Even with my temper.

1313
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:57,412
Oh Tim.

1314
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,294
That's my Ginny.

1315
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:12,432
Our friend just left.

1316
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,877
No runs, no hits, no errors.

1317
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:18,950
Tell me.

1318
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:20,501
Oh, he was ..

1319
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:23,454
Took it very well. Brad is a good
guy really. I'm going to miss him.

1320
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:25,371
Miss him?

1321
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,595
He's going to New York. He told me.

1322
01:15:27,865 --> 01:15:30,569
But don't worry about it. You can get
someone else to play Robert Browning.

1323
01:15:31,815 --> 01:15:33,059
I wasn't thinking of that.

1324
01:15:33,422 --> 01:15:34,352
I only meant ..

1325
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,843
When did he decide all this?

1326
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:39,807
Some time ago, I guess. He didn't want
you to know though until he was sure.

1327
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,044
Oh.

1328
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:42,789
Why is he going?

1329
01:15:44,357 --> 01:15:46,457
Ambition I suppose.
Brad is a good lawyer.

1330
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:49,274
I suppose he wants to spread his wings.

1331
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:53,173
Well, it does take a
certain amount of courage.

1332
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:54,988
Yeah, sure.

1333
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,596
You know, I am getting
worried about myself.

1334
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:03,759
I can't hate Brad. I'm even getting
to the point where I like this cat.

1335
01:16:05,384 --> 01:16:06,628
Here is to the four of us.

1336
01:16:10,476 --> 01:16:15,149
I don't know Mr Browning at all but even
great poets want to settle down in time.

1337
01:16:15,712 --> 01:16:17,042
And have a home of their own.

1338
01:16:17,553 --> 01:16:19,551
And a wife and little ones.

1339
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:22,279
It would be so dreadful if ..

1340
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:23,905
I am sorry.

1341
01:16:24,724 --> 01:16:26,337
I didn't mean to interfere.

1342
01:16:27,268 --> 01:16:28,435
I will leave you now.

1343
01:16:37,816 --> 01:16:40,840
Begging your pardon Miss,
but Mr Browning is calling.

1344
01:16:42,408 --> 01:16:43,829
Show him in, Wilson.

1345
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,033
Yes, Miss.

1346
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:02,893
[ Door knocks ]

1347
01:17:04,029 --> 01:17:04,780
Come in.

1348
01:17:17,157 --> 01:17:17,900
My love.

1349
01:17:18,774 --> 01:17:19,647
Robert.

1350
01:17:24,775 --> 01:17:26,544
I went for a ride and
a walk in the park ..

1351
01:17:26,668 --> 01:17:29,197
And afterwards, I ran all the
way upstairs without help.

1352
01:17:29,554 --> 01:17:30,798
And without once stopping.

1353
01:17:31,284 --> 01:17:34,635
Of course, dearest. It's a splendid
feat and I am proud of you.

1354
01:17:35,313 --> 01:17:36,377
Come and sit down.

1355
01:17:40,108 --> 01:17:42,887
I tell you, Judge. I didn't know what to
do about it when they brought him in.

1356
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:44,352
But nobody knows he's here.

1357
01:17:44,628 --> 01:17:47,675
I felt you could quiet him down and get
him home while everybody is at the show.

1358
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:49,861
And Sadie, she couldn't take a chance.

1359
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:52,690
She had to call us.
He was tearing the place apart.

1360
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:59,293
Here is a friend of yours, Mr Smith.

1361
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,658
Your Honor. I am guilty.

1362
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:07,771
I'll be close by if you need me, Judge.
- Alright, Charlie. I'll call you.

1363
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,671
You got a drink, Judge?
- No. Come to my house. We'll get one.

1364
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:18,238
Did my father tell you
to come and get me?

1365
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:20,059
No, Jamie. Nobody knows anything.

1366
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,441
Right. You said it.

1367
01:18:24,896 --> 01:18:26,265
Nobody knows anything.

1368
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,392
Especially judges.

1369
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:34,250
Especially judges, Judge.

1370
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,944
You know, I told you about Alice.

1371
01:18:38,554 --> 01:18:39,895
That I was fed up.

1372
01:18:41,709 --> 01:18:42,882
Well, Judge.

1373
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,490
I am fed up.
- Take it easy, Jamie.

1374
01:18:45,828 --> 01:18:47,549
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1375
01:18:49,513 --> 01:18:52,339
Well, you going to put me in jail?
Go ahead and put me in.

1376
01:18:53,738 --> 01:18:55,058
Put my father in too.

1377
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:56,628
Send us all to jail.

1378
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,621
Why wait until the stockholders find
out what we did during the war?

1379
01:19:01,382 --> 01:19:03,641
Go on, go on. Send us all to jail.

1380
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:07,668
Come on, Jamie.

1381
01:19:08,378 --> 01:19:09,580
Come on.
- Okay.

1382
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:11,397
Do your duty.

1383
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:14,152
Kick all your friends in the face.

1384
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:07,236
I thought you had gone to bed.

1385
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:11,214
Ginny dear, please be sensible.
I <i>had</i> to leave the theater.

1386
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,907
Did you get my message?
- Yes.

1387
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:15,232
Yes. It isn't that.
- Well, what is it?

1388
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,152
It is me.

1389
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:18,745
It's me.

1390
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:19,856
What?

1391
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:22,347
I don't know.

1392
01:20:23,045 --> 01:20:25,491
Tim. Why can't I be what
you want me to be?

1393
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,985
Darling, what are you talking about?
You <i>are</i> what I want you to be.

1394
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:30,608
You were wonderful tonight.

1395
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,795
Everybody says so.
- It isn't that, I tell you.

1396
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:34,803
I don't care what they say or think.

1397
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:36,798
I cannot go on like this.

1398
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:39,064
Ginny, you're just let down
after your performance.

1399
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:39,927
No.

1400
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,988
I can't pretend anymore.

1401
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:43,899
I hate this place.

1402
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:45,618
I hate this life.

1403
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:47,998
I have tried, but ..

1404
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,911
I am so bored.

1405
01:20:51,288 --> 01:20:52,417
There is no way out.

1406
01:20:53,222 --> 01:20:54,355
It's hopeless.

1407
01:20:54,743 --> 01:20:55,673
I am hopeless.

1408
01:20:55,879 --> 01:20:57,682
Ginny, I wouldn't say that.
- But I am.

1409
01:20:58,274 --> 01:20:59,472
I have tried to fit it.

1410
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:01,607
But they don't want me.

1411
01:21:03,355 --> 01:21:04,456
No. I won't say that.

1412
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:07,328
I don't want them.

1413
01:21:08,592 --> 01:21:10,322
You have pretty well
convinced me of that.

1414
01:21:10,777 --> 01:21:12,708
I've gotten to hate the name of Wargate.

1415
01:21:13,281 --> 01:21:14,482
Everything is Wargate.

1416
01:21:14,976 --> 01:21:18,584
You can't even sit in a theater and see
me act without some Wargate spoiling it.

1417
01:21:19,203 --> 01:21:21,927
I didn't do that for Jamie
because his name is Wargate.

1418
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,118
Oh, Tim.

1419
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:25,198
Don't be angry with me.

1420
01:21:25,721 --> 01:21:27,023
It's a little late for that.

1421
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:31,152
Yes, Tim. It is.

1422
01:21:32,841 --> 01:21:34,057
And if I don't go soon ..

1423
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:35,854
It will be too late.

1424
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,215
I don't feel it happening.

1425
01:21:39,919 --> 01:21:41,594
I can feel myself dying.

1426
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,844
Ginny, maybe you should see Doc Drover.

1427
01:21:48,097 --> 01:21:50,623
No. I don't need a doctor.
I need a scolding.

1428
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,272
I've scolded myself.

1429
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:55,887
Tim, I know I'm spoiled and selfish.

1430
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,180
And married to the most
wonderful man on earth.

1431
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:00,672
Ginny.
- It's true.

1432
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:01,969
But it doesn't help.

1433
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:03,930
Nothing will help that I can think of.

1434
01:22:04,346 --> 01:22:06,046
You love it here.
You love these people.

1435
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:07,556
You want to stay here.

1436
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,369
I can't ask you to give
up being a judge.

1437
01:22:13,002 --> 01:22:14,132
Give up being a judge?

1438
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,778
Well, do you have to be one here?
- I don't have to be one.

1439
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,209
Could you be a judge in ..

1440
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:20,311
In Minneapolis or Chicago?

1441
01:22:21,064 --> 01:22:24,355
Just someplace where Boone and Queenie
and Webb and Louise don't own us.

1442
01:22:24,747 --> 01:22:25,789
Nobody owns us.

1443
01:22:25,977 --> 01:22:26,935
Don't they, Tim?

1444
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:38,487
Can't we go away? Just you and I?

1445
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:42,454
Tim, wouldn't you have much more
interesting cases to see in Chicago?

1446
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:44,992
Darling, I couldn't be a judge
in Chicago right away.

1447
01:22:45,212 --> 01:22:45,961
If ever.

1448
01:22:46,085 --> 01:22:48,971
Does it mean so much to you being a
judge? You were happy as a lawyer.

1449
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:54,403
Well.

1450
01:22:55,486 --> 01:22:58,652
I did have a pretty good offer not
long ago from a law firm in New York.

1451
01:22:59,597 --> 01:23:00,355
New York?

1452
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,333
Yeah. Denny Thane's firm.

1453
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,649
He is from here. We used to go to
school together. He has a big ..

1454
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:07,269
What is the matter?

1455
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:10,313
Well, I hadn't thought about New York.

1456
01:23:10,851 --> 01:23:12,628
You haven't anything
against it, have you?

1457
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:16,703
Ginny, you're not afraid
of Brad, are you?

1458
01:23:16,884 --> 01:23:18,201
You can tell me, you know.

1459
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:24,275
No, Tim.

1460
01:23:24,552 --> 01:23:26,053
I am not afraid of Brad.

1461
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:31,339
Well, if we're going to make a change we
may as well make it as big as possible.

1462
01:23:31,847 --> 01:23:34,965
And if I'm going to give up being a
judge, I suppose I should notify them.

1463
01:23:36,456 --> 01:23:38,428
Anyway, it won't do any
harm to think it over.

1464
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,159
And I'll tell you what.

1465
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:43,008
While we are doing our thinking we
might just as well do it in New York.

1466
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,297
Oh, Tim.

1467
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:51,711
Look.

1468
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:53,434
There it is.

1469
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,437
Gee, and they got all that from
the Indians for 24 dollars.

1470
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:57,712
And a bottle of rum.

1471
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:13,635
Thank you.

1472
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,791
Well, you say when.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1473
01:24:18,915 --> 01:24:21,132
We hope you feel at home in our hotel.
- I beg your pardon?

1474
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:22,347
That is our motto.

1475
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:24,772
A nice motto.

1476
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:27,474
Well now, where do we start?
- I've got a list of things.

1477
01:24:27,598 --> 01:24:30,121
I'll get hold of Thane and tell him
we'll be busy until next week.

1478
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:32,067
We could go shopping this afternoon.

1479
01:24:32,286 --> 01:24:34,970
Would you get Hanover 26453 please.

1480
01:24:35,246 --> 01:24:37,030
These are the places
Queenie told me to go.

1481
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:39,924
Let's not go there. Remember,
you're a free woman from now on.

1482
01:24:40,171 --> 01:24:40,843
Hello?

1483
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,364
Hello. Mr Thane, please.

1484
01:24:42,808 --> 01:24:43,839
Judge Timberlane.

1485
01:24:43,963 --> 01:24:46,289
We'll shop for you first.
You need some new ties.

1486
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:47,970
Hello?

1487
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:51,669
You mean, right now?

1488
01:24:52,252 --> 01:24:53,120
Right away?

1489
01:24:54,492 --> 01:24:56,482
Oh. Well, just a minute please.

1490
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,524
Thane has to go to Washington
tonight for a week.

1491
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:02,600
Go ahead.

1492
01:25:03,294 --> 01:25:03,966
Hello?

1493
01:25:04,358 --> 01:25:06,050
Alright. I will come right down.

1494
01:25:06,796 --> 01:25:07,440
Yes.

1495
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:08,758
Thank you very much.

1496
01:25:09,392 --> 01:25:11,602
Well, that's that.
- You'd be bored shopping anyway.

1497
01:25:11,866 --> 01:25:14,545
I'll be home by five or six and then
we'll go to dinner. Where will we go?

1498
01:25:14,669 --> 01:25:16,236
I don't know.
- We'll find a place.

1499
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,434
Then the theater.

1500
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:21,512
Now, you be sure to buy a dress that is
worthy of a successful New York lawyer.

1501
01:25:23,514 --> 01:25:24,418
[ Telephone ]

1502
01:25:25,302 --> 01:25:26,200
You take it.

1503
01:25:29,102 --> 01:25:29,845
Hello?

1504
01:25:30,922 --> 01:25:31,985
Hello, Brad.

1505
01:25:34,072 --> 01:25:35,046
We just got in.

1506
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,504
When am I going to present you
with the keys to the city?

1507
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:40,712
My time is your time.
How about this afternoon?

1508
01:25:41,482 --> 01:25:44,979
Well, I'm tied up this afternoon.
Wait unit I see about Ginny.

1509
01:25:45,429 --> 01:25:47,118
Brad is free this afternoon.

1510
01:25:47,551 --> 01:25:48,362
Why not?

1511
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:52,831
How are you on shopping?

1512
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:56,312
That is what I call a real friend.

1513
01:25:58,289 --> 01:25:59,636
Well, when can you come?

1514
01:26:00,262 --> 01:26:02,998
Well, don't you New Yorkers
ever work in the afternoon?

1515
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:05,124
Right away, Ginny?

1516
01:26:06,272 --> 01:26:07,144
Half an hour.

1517
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,288
How about in half an hour, Brad?

1518
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,723
I will do something for you someday.

1519
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:13,325
Right, Brad.

1520
01:26:14,572 --> 01:26:15,788
Now, you won't be lonely.

1521
01:26:16,142 --> 01:26:17,444
I wish you hadn't done that.

1522
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:18,322
Why not?

1523
01:26:18,755 --> 01:26:20,463
Can you call him back?
- Why?

1524
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:22,303
I don't know.

1525
01:26:22,871 --> 01:26:23,936
This is <i>our</i> trip.

1526
01:26:24,297 --> 01:26:26,039
Oh, he is just trying to be nice.

1527
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,476
We have to see him some time anyway.

1528
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:31,128
Now, when I come back I will
have good news for you.

1529
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,380
It's square-head.
- Well, Mush-rat.

1530
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:46,516
How are you?

1531
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:47,899
You old son-of-a-gun.

1532
01:26:48,131 --> 01:26:50,474
I haven't seen you since ..
- Class reunion, '36.

1533
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:52,493
That's right. Have a chair.
- Thanks.

1534
01:26:53,116 --> 01:26:54,321
Well, old square-head.

1535
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,915
So, you want to be a New York lawyer?
- Well, it ..

1536
01:26:57,268 --> 01:26:58,582
It looks like nice work.

1537
01:26:58,924 --> 01:27:00,939
Yes. Very nice. Very nice indeed.

1538
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:04,734
When I heard you were coming I dug
up something that may interest you.

1539
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,454
Have you read any poetry lately?
- No.

1540
01:27:07,642 --> 01:27:08,228
No.

1541
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:11,135
I had a long talk with the old
man about you this morning.

1542
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,865
It looks pretty good.
- It does.

1543
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:15,569
Of course, I told him you
are not much of a lawyer.

1544
01:27:15,804 --> 01:27:18,104
You mean, compared to you?
- Compared to me of course.

1545
01:27:18,495 --> 01:27:21,635
But I told him that in spite of those
high school ideals of yours ..

1546
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:23,905
You are a hardworking ambitious fellow.

1547
01:27:24,258 --> 01:27:25,877
Good teeth and a full head of hair.

1548
01:27:26,352 --> 01:27:27,453
And a lot of friends.

1549
01:27:27,685 --> 01:27:29,282
Well, I'll try to keep the hair.

1550
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:32,581
Of course, it didn't
hurt to tell him that ..

1551
01:27:32,974 --> 01:27:36,021
You might bring us some of that
Wargate eastern division business.

1552
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,738
By the way, is there anything
in that stockholder suit?

1553
01:27:39,447 --> 01:27:41,170
It hasn't come up for trial yet.

1554
01:27:42,251 --> 01:27:44,211
What is it? Just the usual
screwball stockholders?

1555
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,466
Well anyway, there is one period of
boredom you will be spared because ..

1556
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:50,382
We will be needing you here right away.

1557
01:27:50,795 --> 01:27:51,381
Ah.

1558
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,770
Here it is.

1559
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:55,046
This is what I was looking for.

1560
01:27:55,535 --> 01:27:56,915
Does the witness recognise it?

1561
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,095
Where did you get the old class book?

1562
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:00,461
That's right.

1563
01:28:01,347 --> 01:28:03,439
The Class Book of the Grand
Republic High School.

1564
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:06,230
And turning to page ..

1565
01:28:07,326 --> 01:28:08,181
Nineteen.

1566
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:11,186
I find a poem entitled ..

1567
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:13,528
'Memorandum to Pontius Pilate'.

1568
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:17,412
Written by a certain senior
whose initials are 'C.T'.

1569
01:28:18,992 --> 01:28:20,719
Now listen very carefully, Timberlane.

1570
01:28:21,182 --> 01:28:22,553
This may be used against you.

1571
01:28:24,378 --> 01:28:25,593
'Judas or Pilate'?

1572
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,208
'Of these two men ..'

1573
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:30,024
'Which of them was the
worst, my friend'?

1574
01:28:31,427 --> 01:28:33,555
'Judas sold out for silver, forsooth'.

1575
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:36,298
'While Pilate just smiled and said ..'

1576
01:28:36,773 --> 01:28:37,810
'What is truth'?

1577
01:28:39,005 --> 01:28:40,049
'Judas was stupid'.

1578
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:41,727
'Pilate was smart'.

1579
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,841
'No law could convict him'.

1580
01:28:44,234 --> 01:28:45,652
'Except his own heart'.

1581
01:28:46,276 --> 01:28:49,197
'He had nothing to answer
save conscience demands'.

1582
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:51,385
'Pilate played safe'.

1583
01:28:51,821 --> 01:28:53,157
'He washed his hands'.

1584
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:58,739
Timberlane. Are you guilty or not
guilty of having written that poem?

1585
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:00,746
Guilty on all counts.

1586
01:29:01,116 --> 01:29:02,933
Of course, I didn't show
that to the old man.

1587
01:29:04,284 --> 01:29:07,119
I can't tell you how happy I
am about this whole set up.

1588
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:10,881
I feel pretty sure that you could
start tomorrow if you can get away.

1589
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:13,998
That would mean, by the end of
the year you would be earning ..

1590
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:15,665
Well, let's not go into that.

1591
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:17,541
But the future is magnificent.

1592
01:29:18,085 --> 01:29:21,588
And if you're not a full partner in
a year or two I'll be very surprised.

1593
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:24,822
Pilate played safe.

1594
01:29:25,782 --> 01:29:26,855
He washed his hands.

1595
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,842
Didn't you hear what I said?

1596
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:33,151
Mush-rat, I wouldn't have believed it.

1597
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,660
But you are worth it.

1598
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:39,133
I can't believe that a man could lie to
himself the way I have lied to myself.

1599
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,298
The ability of the mind to find excuses.

1600
01:29:44,148 --> 01:29:45,709
To keep from facing the truth.

1601
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,758
Even love can be an excuse.

1602
01:29:49,262 --> 01:29:50,915
What in blazes are you talking about?

1603
01:29:53,502 --> 01:29:54,859
It was a close call.

1604
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,471
I will never be able to thank you
and don't think I am ungrateful.

1605
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,066
Goodbye.
- What is this?

1606
01:30:02,468 --> 01:30:04,863
This is a judge going
back where he belongs.

1607
01:30:05,112 --> 01:30:07,478
You are not going back to a
stupid job in a one-horse town ..

1608
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:09,043
Tossing away a chance like this?

1609
01:30:09,783 --> 01:30:10,672
Yes. I am.

1610
01:30:11,808 --> 01:30:12,709
So long, Mush.

1611
01:30:16,164 --> 01:30:17,065
It is so chic.

1612
01:30:17,596 --> 01:30:19,519
So gay on your lovely head, Madame.

1613
01:30:28,518 --> 01:30:31,958
Ah, Madame. You make our
beautiful clothes come to life.

1614
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:44,334
Good evening, Mr Criley.
- Hello, Robert.

1615
01:30:49,798 --> 01:30:51,893
Where is my sister, Robert?
- I will find her for you.

1616
01:30:52,017 --> 01:30:52,804
Thank you.

1617
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,176
Mr Criley is here, madam.

1618
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:03,514
Well.

1619
01:31:06,354 --> 01:31:07,026
Hello.

1620
01:31:07,243 --> 01:31:09,455
Avis, this is Ginny.
- Mrs Timberlane, of course.

1621
01:31:09,781 --> 01:31:12,098
My brother said you were very
pretty, and as usual he's right.

1622
01:31:12,295 --> 01:31:13,515
Thank you, Mrs Elderman.

1623
01:31:13,786 --> 01:31:16,439
Now, how do you like New York so far?
- So far so good.

1624
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:17,657
So very good.

1625
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:18,957
How is Cass?

1626
01:31:19,194 --> 01:31:20,982
I used to know him.
- He has to go downtown.

1627
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:22,439
Too bad he couldn't be here.

1628
01:31:22,914 --> 01:31:25,137
Avis, there are an awful lot
of people here I don't know.

1629
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:27,604
There's an awful lot of people
here who don't know each other.

1630
01:31:28,459 --> 01:31:30,291
That is because I am
married to a publisher.

1631
01:31:30,415 --> 01:31:32,952
He attracts celebrities like
blue serge attracts lint.

1632
01:31:33,288 --> 01:31:34,291
Oh, Mary Ann.

1633
01:31:34,609 --> 01:31:36,432
Yes, Avis?
- Mrs Timberlane.

1634
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,787
This is Mary Ann Milligan, editor
of Modern Women magazine.

1635
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:39,959
How do you do.

1636
01:31:40,156 --> 01:31:42,704
Look her over Mary Ann, and tell
the world what she's wearing.

1637
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:43,748
Certainly.

1638
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,219
The speciality of the house.

1639
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:46,760
A 'devil's disciple'.

1640
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:49,200
Well, my first Devil's disciple.

1641
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,987
Your first of a lot of things, Ginny.

1642
01:31:51,254 --> 01:31:53,147
Brad, can I see you a second?
- Hello, Jack.

1643
01:31:53,354 --> 01:31:54,736
Excuse me for a moment, Ginny.

1644
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:12,100
What do you think of it?

1645
01:32:13,156 --> 01:32:14,458
Well, I don't understand it.

1646
01:32:15,178 --> 01:32:16,394
I will explain it to you.

1647
01:32:17,082 --> 01:32:18,394
It is absolutely no good.

1648
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:20,881
As a matter of fact it
is a wretched thing.

1649
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,318
You she, she never comes to life.

1650
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,074
She never emerges.
- Hello there.

1651
01:32:25,252 --> 01:32:26,153
Ça va mon ami.

1652
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:29,338
Congratulations. My sister tells me
you took an academy prize with this.

1653
01:32:29,683 --> 01:32:30,555
Second prize.

1654
01:32:31,133 --> 01:32:35,172
But if this charming lady will pose
for me, I swear the next time ..

1655
01:32:35,594 --> 01:32:36,985
It would be the first prize.

1656
01:32:37,904 --> 01:32:39,148
I will have to ask mother.

1657
01:32:45,295 --> 01:32:46,311
Say, isn't that ..

1658
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,656
Tell him I was here.

1659
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,176
You were with us that night, Joe?

1660
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,989
It is. Walter Pidgeon in the flesh.

1661
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:54,639
I just saw him at the Bijou
back home a few days ago.

1662
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,894
And this gentleman is
a critic of the drama.

1663
01:32:58,104 --> 01:32:59,939
I know. I heard your
lecture in Minneapolis.

1664
01:33:00,186 --> 01:33:02,514
I remember you, my dear.
You are the one who stayed awake.

1665
01:33:03,403 --> 01:33:05,274
Please come after the
theater tomorrow night.

1666
01:33:05,398 --> 01:33:07,986
I'm throwing a party for some
Chinese dancers. They are terrific.

1667
01:33:27,737 --> 01:33:29,182
It's a tough town in the daytime.

1668
01:33:29,662 --> 01:33:32,282
But when the lights go on there is
nothing like it anywhere in the world.

1669
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:35,111
If I had been a man I'd
have been here long ago.

1670
01:33:35,368 --> 01:33:37,737
Sometimes there is a fog
and then it is fantastic.

1671
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:39,127
I would love that.

1672
01:33:40,054 --> 01:33:41,499
You are very satisfactory, Ginny.

1673
01:33:42,895 --> 01:33:43,682
I am glad.

1674
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:45,320
I have thought of you so often.

1675
01:33:46,136 --> 01:33:47,363
Of showing this to you.

1676
01:33:48,402 --> 01:33:50,161
You are lovelier than
I have ever seen you.

1677
01:33:50,487 --> 01:33:52,746
I like you better than I
ever did and that is a lot.

1678
01:33:56,161 --> 01:33:58,232
Brad. Why did you leave Grand Republic?

1679
01:33:59,358 --> 01:34:00,889
There was nothing else to do, Ginny.

1680
01:34:01,332 --> 01:34:04,153
I decided the town was
too small for you and me.

1681
01:34:04,727 --> 01:34:07,196
The time had come to stop
kidding myself and I knew it.

1682
01:34:10,993 --> 01:34:12,622
Brad, I didn't know you felt like that.

1683
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:14,499
Here in New York I can say it, Ginny.

1684
01:34:14,911 --> 01:34:16,182
I couldn't back there.

1685
01:34:16,715 --> 01:34:19,004
Here you say what you
like, do what you like.

1686
01:34:19,763 --> 01:34:21,122
The values are different here.

1687
01:34:21,769 --> 01:34:22,727
New York is big.

1688
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:25,243
It takes the crap out of your soul.

1689
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,875
My brother is monopolising
you and we won't have it.

1690
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:32,076
Some of my special guests just arrived.
You must come and meet them.

1691
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:40,341
I wish we could start all over again.

1692
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,624
What is to stop us?

1693
01:34:42,002 --> 01:34:44,191
What are you doing tomorrow?
- What are you doing tonight?

1694
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:45,616
Ginny.
- No, Brad.

1695
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,414
You are in love with me.

1696
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:49,322
Don't spoil it.
- You belong here.

1697
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,711
Yes.
- With me.

1698
01:34:51,514 --> 01:34:52,100
No.

1699
01:34:52,925 --> 01:34:55,114
It was amazing to watch you
today Ginny and know for real.

1700
01:34:55,391 --> 01:34:57,920
I loved it. They were wonderful to me.
- Why not?

1701
01:34:58,236 --> 01:35:01,117
You came to life. You were brand new.
Of course they were wonderful to you.

1702
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,054
Brad.

1703
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,814
Did you really mean what
you said a while ago?

1704
01:35:06,298 --> 01:35:07,451
You know I love you.

1705
01:35:07,983 --> 01:35:09,971
You are going to find that
you belong to me, Ginny.

1706
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,115
You are going to come to me and say so.

1707
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:20,251
Never mind. Here she is now.

1708
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:21,740
Thank you very much.

1709
01:35:21,971 --> 01:35:22,911
Sorry I'm late.

1710
01:35:23,035 --> 01:35:24,577
That's alright. Well, look at you.

1711
01:35:25,299 --> 01:35:27,454
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I have seen in New York.

1712
01:35:27,578 --> 01:35:28,407
Thank you.

1713
01:35:28,531 --> 01:35:31,622
Have fun? Where have you been?
- Places and places. A penthouse party.

1714
01:35:31,819 --> 01:35:34,476
My first look at New York with the
lights on. And was that something.

1715
01:35:35,205 --> 01:35:37,614
Well, where was the party?
- Brad's sister's place.

1716
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:39,621
Say, her husband must have millions.

1717
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,476
It's a lovely place. Way up in the sky.

1718
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,267
He is a publisher.
Brad's sister's husband.

1719
01:35:46,028 --> 01:35:47,873
Oh, and such wonderful people.

1720
01:35:48,258 --> 01:35:49,526
Exciting people.

1721
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:51,765
Gee Tim, the way they treated me.

1722
01:35:52,395 --> 01:35:53,897
You would think I was somebody too.

1723
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,267
You are somebody.

1724
01:35:57,409 --> 01:35:59,119
Maybe you've guessed I had a good time.

1725
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:01,000
Oh, Tim.

1726
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,533
Thank you again.

1727
01:36:04,915 --> 01:36:07,359
Darling, I'm the happiest
girl in greater New York.

1728
01:36:08,103 --> 01:36:08,947
Points east.

1729
01:36:09,357 --> 01:36:10,756
West, north.

1730
01:36:11,201 --> 01:36:11,904
South.

1731
01:36:13,361 --> 01:36:14,920
And that's certainly enough about me.

1732
01:36:15,225 --> 01:36:16,069
How is Brad?

1733
01:36:17,076 --> 01:36:18,678
Oh, he's in good form.

1734
01:36:19,432 --> 01:36:22,437
He wants to take us to his sister's
house in Connecticut for next weekend.

1735
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:24,738
Brad was certainly made for this town.

1736
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:27,189
Well, I guess some men are and ..

1737
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:28,860
Some men just aren't.

1738
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,554
What is the matter, dear?
Didn't it go so well?

1739
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:34,595
Oh, it went fine. Sure.

1740
01:36:34,896 --> 01:36:37,540
They offered me the keys to the city
of New York and part of Brooklyn.

1741
01:36:38,402 --> 01:36:40,016
And a partnership to boot.

1742
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:44,739
Oh Tim, that is wonderful.

1743
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,161
I turned it down.

1744
01:36:47,045 --> 01:36:48,265
Turned it down?
- Ginny.

1745
01:36:48,389 --> 01:36:50,441
Wait a minute. Hold everything.
- You're going back.

1746
01:36:50,714 --> 01:36:52,659
I had no right coming
here in the first place.

1747
01:36:52,944 --> 01:36:54,603
Well, I am not going back.
- Oh, Ginny.

1748
01:36:54,837 --> 01:36:57,474
Don't say that until you hear why.
- But I don't care why.

1749
01:36:57,708 --> 01:36:59,624
Don't you want to hear me?
- No, it is too late.

1750
01:36:59,832 --> 01:37:02,079
Ginny, it's never too late to
hear the truth about yourself.

1751
01:37:02,203 --> 01:37:04,859
And that is what I heard this
afternoon: the truth about myself.

1752
01:37:05,106 --> 01:37:07,749
If I go back I'll die.
Here, I am happy. Alive.

1753
01:37:08,006 --> 01:37:10,364
Now wait a minute. Let's be careful.
- Be careful?

1754
01:37:10,957 --> 01:37:12,001
Be careful of what?

1755
01:37:12,376 --> 01:37:13,248
Our marriage?

1756
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,215
Why don't you try being careful of it?

1757
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:19,170
A fair judge should tell people marriage
is the most special thing in the world.

1758
01:37:19,455 --> 01:37:20,901
What are you trying to say to me?

1759
01:37:21,025 --> 01:37:23,541
I'm saying I've a right to live my life.
- Now listen to me, Ginny.

1760
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:24,691
No. I've heard it.

1761
01:37:25,302 --> 01:37:27,720
You have to go back because the
Wargates want you and the Havocks.

1762
01:37:28,954 --> 01:37:29,970
And you want them?

1763
01:37:31,138 --> 01:37:33,515
I didn't marry a man.
I married a country club.

1764
01:37:34,444 --> 01:37:35,992
Brad Criley said that, didn't he?

1765
01:37:36,178 --> 01:37:37,393
He didn't have to say it.

1766
01:37:37,857 --> 01:37:39,029
I knew it all along.

1767
01:37:39,692 --> 01:37:40,879
But I wouldn't admit it.

1768
01:37:41,348 --> 01:37:43,319
Any more than I would admit
the truth about Brad.

1769
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:45,192
He loves me.

1770
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:48,367
He has loved me from the very first day.

1771
01:37:48,999 --> 01:37:51,651
So. Go back if you want to,
but I'm staying here with him.

1772
01:37:55,516 --> 01:37:56,203
Ginny.

1773
01:37:56,728 --> 01:37:58,346
So, you've lied to me. Both of you.

1774
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,113
No!

1775
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:01,787
Brad has been decent about it.
He's not a coward.

1776
01:38:02,162 --> 01:38:04,649
He had the courage to get out of
that town. To live his own life.

1777
01:38:05,028 --> 01:38:06,530
He had the courage to be different.

1778
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:09,175
So you want somebody different?
- I am staying. Do you hear?

1779
01:38:09,415 --> 01:38:11,293
I'm staying, so go.
Go on back to your friends.

1780
01:38:11,509 --> 01:38:12,697
Yes, I am going back.

1781
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,641
But I am not going back to my friends.

1782
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:18,582
I go back to something more important
than friends or marriage or you.

1783
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:20,645
So you want somebody different, do you?

1784
01:38:21,057 --> 01:38:22,476
Well, you are going to get it.

1785
01:38:23,048 --> 01:38:24,937
From now on you are on
your own. You are free.

1786
01:38:51,062 --> 01:38:51,823
Hello?

1787
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:53,529
Brad.

1788
01:38:54,007 --> 01:38:56,539
"<i>I know this sound crazy, darling.
But I am just leaving for Chicago</i>."

1789
01:38:57,157 --> 01:38:58,199
"<i>Just got orders</i>."

1790
01:38:58,531 --> 01:38:59,718
I'm at the airport now.

1791
01:39:00,236 --> 01:39:02,432
Only for a few days, tell Cass.
Then I'll be home.

1792
01:39:02,682 --> 01:39:05,697
We'll have dinner at 21, supper at
The Stork and dance at El Morocco.

1793
01:39:06,231 --> 01:39:07,187
I got to run.

1794
01:39:07,311 --> 01:39:09,139
"<i>Goodbye, darling.
I'll be seeing you soon</i>."

1795
01:39:09,352 --> 01:39:10,328
But Brad, I ..

1796
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,180
Mr Timberlane asked me to give you this.

1797
01:39:25,221 --> 01:39:26,008
Thank you.

1798
01:39:47,968 --> 01:39:51,633
In regard to the request of the Wargate
Corporation for further postponement.

1799
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:54,228
I would like to remind the
attorney for the defendant ..

1800
01:39:54,352 --> 01:39:58,542
That it is a truism of law that justice
too long delayed is justice denied.

1801
01:39:58,942 --> 01:40:01,651
This case must come to trial
before the end of this term.

1802
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:04,976
The request for postponement is denied.

1803
01:40:16,765 --> 01:40:17,703
[ Telephone ]

1804
01:40:21,937 --> 01:40:22,609
Hello?

1805
01:40:24,223 --> 01:40:25,410
Hello, Brad.

1806
01:40:26,161 --> 01:40:28,730
I was never so glad to hear
a voice in my whole life.

1807
01:40:31,848 --> 01:40:34,883
Well, I've hardly been out of this room.
The weather has been so awful.

1808
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:37,884
I've had a little cold.
I hate this room.

1809
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:41,131
I hate New York so it is
about time you got back.

1810
01:40:41,714 --> 01:40:44,547
Now that I'm back I'll fix everything
for you. I'll even fix the weather.

1811
01:40:46,753 --> 01:40:49,541
Listen. I've a table reserved for three
at the College Club at one o'clock.

1812
01:40:49,665 --> 01:40:50,667
Can you make it?

1813
01:40:51,365 --> 01:40:53,495
Well, you had better make
that reservation for two.

1814
01:40:54,295 --> 01:40:55,282
Why only for two?

1815
01:40:55,607 --> 01:40:57,556
What happened to that
fellow you're married to?

1816
01:40:58,266 --> 01:41:00,054
I'll tell you all about
it when I see you.

1817
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,195
Okay. One o'clock.

1818
01:41:03,095 --> 01:41:04,301
Fine. Bye.

1819
01:41:13,104 --> 01:41:14,186
This way, Mr Criley.

1820
01:41:14,745 --> 01:41:15,849
Well. How you been?

1821
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:17,790
The whole world ran out on me.
Left me flat.

1822
01:41:18,052 --> 01:41:19,084
Even your sister.

1823
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:21,784
She went off to Connecticut for the
weekend and didn't come back.

1824
01:41:22,194 --> 01:41:24,211
This has been a ghost town
as far as I am concerned.

1825
01:41:25,318 --> 01:41:27,270
Now that you're here I feel better.

1826
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:29,698
Where was the judge?

1827
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:32,260
Couldn't he do better than that
for a girl who looks like you?

1828
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:33,594
Drink, Mr Criley?

1829
01:41:34,384 --> 01:41:35,436
Martinis?
- Hmm.

1830
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,202
Two.

1831
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,740
Now then, where is Cass?

1832
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:42,635
He has gone back to Grand Republic.
- To pick up the furniture?

1833
01:41:43,284 --> 01:41:43,922
No.

1834
01:41:45,096 --> 01:41:46,589
No. He has gone back for good.

1835
01:41:46,888 --> 01:41:48,410
You are kidding?
- No.

1836
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:51,605
You couldn't say it that
easily if it were true.

1837
01:41:51,813 --> 01:41:52,801
It is true.

1838
01:41:56,206 --> 01:41:57,699
I have ordered.
- Yes, sir.

1839
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:00,951
Well. Good luck, Brad.

1840
01:42:02,256 --> 01:42:03,807
So you and Cass are washed up?

1841
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:05,828
Absolutely.

1842
01:42:06,132 --> 01:42:07,319
Was I the reason for it?

1843
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,439
No. Not really.
- Well, that's good.

1844
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:15,228
Well, now you know why I was
so glad to hear your voice.

1845
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:16,683
Just what did happen?

1846
01:42:17,366 --> 01:42:20,791
Well, when he went downtown to see about
the new job everything was alright.

1847
01:42:21,197 --> 01:42:21,855
And?

1848
01:42:22,201 --> 01:42:24,864
I don't know what happened but when
he came back everything was changed.

1849
01:42:25,323 --> 01:42:27,082
We were going right
back to Grand Republic.

1850
01:42:27,478 --> 01:42:29,695
He was going to stay on the
bench for the rest of his life.

1851
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:32,012
I was going to stagnate
for the rest of mine.

1852
01:42:32,198 --> 01:42:32,870
I see.

1853
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:34,963
You can imagine how that hit me.

1854
01:42:35,393 --> 01:42:37,753
I wish to heaven I'd gone in with
you when I brought you home.

1855
01:42:38,314 --> 01:42:40,074
Brad, you couldn't have done anything.

1856
01:42:41,329 --> 01:42:43,239
Was my name mentioned in any way at all?

1857
01:42:44,578 --> 01:42:45,261
Yes.

1858
01:42:46,298 --> 01:42:47,916
Of course.
- In what way?

1859
01:42:53,134 --> 01:42:55,397
I said I was going to
a man who loved me.

1860
01:42:55,743 --> 01:42:56,644
You said that?

1861
01:42:57,390 --> 01:42:58,062
Yes.

1862
01:42:58,379 --> 01:43:00,022
I wonder what Webb and Boone will say.

1863
01:43:00,646 --> 01:43:02,902
What business is it of theirs?
- I happen to work for them.

1864
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:04,517
And I thought you were different.

1865
01:43:04,641 --> 01:43:06,010
Different.
- Watch it, Ginny.

1866
01:43:16,915 --> 01:43:18,992
I guess I thought I did
exactly what you hoped I'd do.

1867
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:21,524
Any chance of patching it up?

1868
01:43:24,651 --> 01:43:25,805
No. I suppose not.

1869
01:43:26,682 --> 01:43:28,048
Somebody else, maybe.

1870
01:43:30,473 --> 01:43:32,246
From the very first minute I knew you ..

1871
01:43:32,799 --> 01:43:33,815
You made me think.

1872
01:43:34,104 --> 01:43:35,927
Don't be childish. Of course I love you.

1873
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:43,397
Excuse me.

1874
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,014
Get my car, will you.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

1875
01:43:52,346 --> 01:43:53,996
A cab please.
- Taxi.

1876
01:43:56,957 --> 01:43:58,585
Never mind the taxi. Here is my car.

1877
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,684
Let's have it clear, Ginny.

1878
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:27,015
We go through with this all the way.
There's no other way.

1879
01:44:27,139 --> 01:44:29,082
You won't stay in New York.
Not for one night.

1880
01:44:29,206 --> 01:44:31,183
You'll stay at my sister's
house in Connecticut ..

1881
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:32,774
Until you establish a residence.

1882
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,688
Shut up, Brad. Why aren't you honest
with me? You never wanted to be free.

1883
01:44:35,977 --> 01:44:37,707
I didn't want a smash-up like this.
- No.

1884
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:40,081
What you wanted for me was
just a cheap, contemptible ..

1885
01:44:40,205 --> 01:44:41,747
For heaven's sake.
- Stop the car.

1886
01:44:41,871 --> 01:44:44,126
I'll drive you to your hotel.
- Stop the car and let me out.

1887
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,942
Ginny, behave yourself.
- Stop it.

1888
01:44:46,178 --> 01:44:47,266
Stop it, stop it!

1889
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:07,062
Where are you going, Judge?
- The country club.

1890
01:45:07,771 --> 01:45:09,736
Dr and Mrs Drover's 25th anniversary.

1891
01:45:10,331 --> 01:45:11,354
That's fine.

1892
01:45:11,577 --> 01:45:13,737
You go and have a good time
with your friends now, Judge.

1893
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:15,366
Thanks for tying my tie.

1894
01:45:16,027 --> 01:45:17,386
It's like old times, isn't it.

1895
01:45:18,585 --> 01:45:19,604
Not quite.

1896
01:45:31,351 --> 01:45:33,053
So you think you ought
to go out, do you?

1897
01:45:34,162 --> 01:45:35,602
You want your freedom too, huh?

1898
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:38,094
Go ahead. Nobody is stopping you.

1899
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:39,430
Go on.

1900
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:42,921
Go to New York if you want to.

1901
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:44,717
Who are you talking to?

1902
01:45:45,207 --> 01:45:47,902
I was rendering a decision. It seems
the plaintiff wanted her freedom.

1903
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:08,046
I'll get her to the vet.

1904
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:10,749
Happy anniversary you old codgers.

1905
01:46:13,709 --> 01:46:15,773
It's my anniversary too.
Don't I get kissed?

1906
01:46:16,042 --> 01:46:18,835
Come on up somebody and kiss
my wife and see if I care.

1907
01:46:19,515 --> 01:46:21,855
How could you put up with
this rotten egg for so long?

1908
01:46:22,075 --> 01:46:22,976
She's had to.

1909
01:46:23,322 --> 01:46:26,784
Her old man needs the 80 bucks a month
he gets from his roughneck son-in-law.

1910
01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:30,363
Chris. For crying out loud I thought
you said Cass was coming.

1911
01:46:30,571 --> 01:46:33,103
Well, he's going to be late.
He telephoned about a sick cat.

1912
01:46:33,325 --> 01:46:35,263
Not the sick cat he
is married to, I hope.

1913
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:39,004
I don't think that's so funny.

1914
01:46:39,128 --> 01:46:40,667
Cheer up, Chris. You'll get him yet.

1915
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:42,464
To Chris and Cass.
- Now you're talking.

1916
01:46:43,255 --> 01:46:44,471
You are talking nonsense.

1917
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,137
And you are blushing.

1918
01:46:49,368 --> 01:46:51,255
Well, it's the judge himself.
- Hiya, Boone.

1919
01:46:51,534 --> 01:46:53,357
You are late.
- Yes. I had to go to the vet.

1920
01:46:53,481 --> 01:46:55,118
With Ginny's cat. But it's alright now.

1921
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:57,075
Old square-head, we
don't see enough of you.

1922
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,700
After all, we're your best friends.

1923
01:46:59,181 --> 01:47:00,483
What is on your mind, Boone?

1924
01:47:01,032 --> 01:47:01,743
Well.

1925
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:03,916
We need that postponement, Cass.

1926
01:47:05,031 --> 01:47:06,275
I do a lot for my friends.

1927
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:10,589
That's why I don't mind asking a favor
from a close friend like yourself.

1928
01:47:11,561 --> 01:47:13,799
I don't think this is a question
of friendship, Boone.

1929
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:15,208
But maybe it is.

1930
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,127
I certainly think you are my friend.

1931
01:47:18,048 --> 01:47:19,636
So I want to get it straight with you.

1932
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:22,513
There's something about this
Wargate suit I don't like.

1933
01:47:22,784 --> 01:47:24,071
That's why I came back.

1934
01:47:24,993 --> 01:47:26,609
I don't know what you're talking about.

1935
01:47:27,394 --> 01:47:28,581
I hope you don't, Boone.

1936
01:47:29,619 --> 01:47:30,892
I hope I'm wrong about it.

1937
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:38,208
It's the Judge.

1938
01:47:38,694 --> 01:47:40,610
Our old Cass came back to us.

1939
01:47:40,889 --> 01:47:41,744
Hiya, Cass.

1940
01:47:41,974 --> 01:47:43,260
Come on, let's eat.

1941
01:47:45,874 --> 01:47:47,222
Thank you very much.

1942
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:49,366
How are you?

1943
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:09,794
You look lovely tonight, Chris.
- It's a trick I learned.

1944
01:48:09,991 --> 01:48:12,065
It's just a question of going
to the right beautician.

1945
01:48:12,255 --> 01:48:14,190
You can buy it these days
the way you buy a hat.

1946
01:48:16,285 --> 01:48:17,866
It's nice to see you, Chris.

1947
01:48:18,727 --> 01:48:20,773
I've thought about you.
Wondered what you were doing.

1948
01:48:21,178 --> 01:48:23,455
Oh, I have been catching
up on my education.

1949
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:26,854
I've learned a lot in the
last two years, Cass.

1950
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,897
For instance?

1951
01:48:29,626 --> 01:48:30,900
For instance.

1952
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:33,507
If I had known two years
ago what I know now ..

1953
01:48:34,344 --> 01:48:36,021
I could have made you marry me.

1954
01:48:37,045 --> 01:48:38,441
I should have done it.

1955
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:40,470
I suppose so, Chris.

1956
01:48:42,212 --> 01:48:42,880
I.

1957
01:48:44,336 --> 01:48:47,348
Could still make you happy
and comfortable, Cass.

1958
01:48:49,403 --> 01:48:50,036
I ..

1959
01:48:51,318 --> 01:48:52,469
I think you need me.

1960
01:48:54,969 --> 01:48:55,890
If you do.

1961
01:48:57,968 --> 01:48:58,984
You could have me.

1962
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:04,889
Chris, dear.

1963
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:09,654
Chris, you have always been so sweet.

1964
01:49:12,366 --> 01:49:12,981
I ..

1965
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:17,470
I was unfair to you once, Chris.
This would just be doubly unfair.

1966
01:49:22,035 --> 01:49:23,680
You are the only consistent thing, Cass.

1967
01:49:24,848 --> 01:49:26,293
In this whole cockeyed world.

1968
01:49:34,649 --> 01:49:36,125
[ Crying noises ]

1969
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:39,972
Lillian.

1970
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,582
What is the matter, Lillian?

1971
01:49:46,825 --> 01:49:47,814
I was crying.

1972
01:49:50,796 --> 01:49:52,312
Because my glass is empty.

1973
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:00,136
Cass. Go to her.

1974
01:50:01,093 --> 01:50:01,822
To whom?

1975
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:04,782
They aren't your friends here.
They aren't anybody's friends.

1976
01:50:06,567 --> 01:50:08,140
What is the matter, Lillian? Tell me.

1977
01:50:08,781 --> 01:50:09,996
I am not supposed to.

1978
01:50:10,623 --> 01:50:11,639
But I am going to.

1979
01:50:12,633 --> 01:50:13,815
Is this about Ginny?

1980
01:50:14,638 --> 01:50:15,996
Do you know Mrs Elderman?

1981
01:50:16,926 --> 01:50:18,020
Yes. Brad's sister.

1982
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:20,300
They took her to
Mrs Elderman's apartment.

1983
01:50:20,689 --> 01:50:22,162
She is very ill, Cass.

1984
01:50:23,407 --> 01:50:24,522
How do you know this?

1985
01:50:24,646 --> 01:50:26,686
The doctor there telephoned Roy.
- When?

1986
01:50:26,949 --> 01:50:27,785
Yesterday.

1987
01:50:28,465 --> 01:50:30,069
Why didn't you tell me Ginny was ill?

1988
01:50:30,847 --> 01:50:32,868
Why should I? She is going
to marry Brad, isn't she?

1989
01:50:32,992 --> 01:50:34,093
Well, how ill is she?

1990
01:50:34,498 --> 01:50:37,331
There was a bad accident.
Internal injuries. She may not live.

1991
01:50:37,771 --> 01:50:39,302
They called me for her case history.

1992
01:50:40,232 --> 01:50:41,989
Now don't be a fool, Cass Timberlane.

1993
01:50:42,265 --> 01:50:43,481
She left you, didn't she?

1994
01:50:43,621 --> 01:50:45,181
Personally, I think you are lucky.

1995
01:50:45,561 --> 01:50:46,817
Good riddance, I say.

1996
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:48,659
Happy anniversary.

1997
01:50:49,707 --> 01:50:51,005
Happy anniversary.

1998
01:50:51,526 --> 01:50:52,942
Twenty-five years.

1999
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,236
The happy Drovers.

2000
01:51:20,406 --> 01:51:21,763
Let me get to her in time.

2001
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:23,658
Please, God.

2002
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:27,291
I am Judge Timberlane.

2003
01:51:27,559 --> 01:51:28,203
Avis.

2004
01:51:29,575 --> 01:51:30,673
Oh, Cass.
- Ginny?

2005
01:51:30,928 --> 01:51:31,965
She is very bad.

2006
01:51:32,404 --> 01:51:33,640
How bad, Avis?
- Very.

2007
01:51:33,764 --> 01:51:35,380
She's been unconscious since yesterday.

2008
01:51:35,641 --> 01:51:37,731
You have no idea how hard
it has been on us, Cass.

2009
01:51:37,971 --> 01:51:38,849
Where is she?

2010
01:51:39,117 --> 01:51:41,163
I don't think you should see her now.
- Where is she?

2011
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,038
Up there.

2012
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:49,715
What is it? What do you want?
- I'm her husband.

2013
01:51:49,839 --> 01:51:51,398
Look, if you'll just wait downstairs.

2014
01:51:53,292 --> 01:51:54,759
Has she a chance, doctor?

2015
01:51:55,557 --> 01:51:56,799
I am doing what I can.

2016
01:51:57,085 --> 01:51:58,120
She isn't helping.

2017
01:51:58,595 --> 01:51:59,696
She is a bad patient.

2018
01:52:00,288 --> 01:52:01,704
She doesn't really want to live.

2019
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:06,729
Ginny.

2020
01:52:09,143 --> 01:52:10,064
Ginny, dear.

2021
01:52:12,276 --> 01:52:13,425
Ginny. It's Tim.

2022
01:52:18,376 --> 01:52:19,075
Ginny.

2023
01:52:23,225 --> 01:52:25,204
My candle burns ..

2024
01:52:27,332 --> 01:52:28,424
At both ends.

2025
01:52:30,596 --> 01:52:32,295
It gives a lovely light.

2026
01:52:35,385 --> 01:52:36,957
It's so foggy.

2027
01:52:39,056 --> 01:52:40,275
And there is no sky.

2028
01:52:42,945 --> 01:52:43,595
Tim.

2029
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:46,442
Ginny. Don't cry.

2030
01:52:46,982 --> 01:52:48,270
Don't, Ginny. Don't.

2031
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:53,732
Tim?

2032
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,600
Yes, Ginny. It's Tim.

2033
01:52:58,532 --> 01:52:59,606
Where are you?

2034
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:01,991
Right here, darling.

2035
01:53:08,193 --> 01:53:09,292
Oh, Tim.

2036
01:53:12,879 --> 01:53:14,691
I want to die in my own home.

2037
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:19,840
Take me home.

2038
01:53:25,808 --> 01:53:26,569
Cass.

2039
01:53:27,879 --> 01:53:28,694
How is she?

2040
01:53:29,657 --> 01:53:30,615
Get out of here.

2041
01:53:31,016 --> 01:53:32,527
Cass, if she lives ..
- Get out.

2042
01:53:45,525 --> 01:53:46,312
Is she ..?

2043
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:48,457
For the present at least.

2044
01:53:56,605 --> 01:53:58,298
But hasn't Cass said anything?

2045
01:53:58,627 --> 01:53:59,213
No.

2046
01:53:59,632 --> 01:54:00,925
No. He's been very kind.

2047
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:03,042
Very thoughtful. Very busy in court.

2048
01:54:03,473 --> 01:54:05,604
Have you seen the afternoon papers?
- No.

2049
01:54:06,018 --> 01:54:07,782
Webb and Boone have been indicted.

2050
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:17,451
How could anyone be as mistaken
as I was about Cass's courage.

2051
01:54:18,917 --> 01:54:21,578
I think Cass is waiting
for you to say something.

2052
01:54:22,781 --> 01:54:24,521
Say what? That I am sorry?

2053
01:54:25,747 --> 01:54:26,905
He knows that.

2054
01:54:27,723 --> 01:54:29,939
Even if he doesn't know what
I've gone through since.

2055
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,418
He brought me back.

2056
01:54:33,027 --> 01:54:34,776
Here in this house with him.

2057
01:54:35,588 --> 01:54:36,730
Our house.

2058
01:54:37,974 --> 01:54:39,518
Loving him more than ever.

2059
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:42,452
And not being able to
break through to him.

2060
01:54:44,199 --> 01:54:46,219
Oh Lillian, I've been such a fool.

2061
01:54:51,165 --> 01:54:53,095
I am sorry it's ended this way.

2062
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:54,275
Mrs Timberlane.

2063
01:54:54,439 --> 01:54:57,015
The judge says when you're alone
he wants to see you in the library.

2064
01:54:57,226 --> 01:54:58,138
Thank you.

2065
01:55:00,273 --> 01:55:01,579
I am sorry too, Lillian.

2066
01:55:11,876 --> 01:55:13,029
Has Lillian gone?

2067
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,211
Yes. She just left.

2068
01:55:15,755 --> 01:55:16,933
How do you feel?

2069
01:55:17,705 --> 01:55:18,750
Well enough to go.

2070
01:55:20,241 --> 01:55:21,438
Would you like to?

2071
01:55:22,578 --> 01:55:23,708
Well, I ..

2072
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:26,398
I think it would be better all around.

2073
01:55:27,976 --> 01:55:28,989
To New York?

2074
01:55:30,613 --> 01:55:31,941
If I can get a job there.

2075
01:55:32,929 --> 01:55:34,300
Brad is coming back here.

2076
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:36,000
Oh?

2077
01:55:37,607 --> 01:55:38,966
What's that got to do with it?

2078
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,905
I just thought.
- You are wrong.

2079
01:55:41,799 --> 01:55:45,088
I don't know much about how deep
those things go or how long they last.

2080
01:55:45,769 --> 01:55:46,672
Cass, listen.

2081
01:55:47,204 --> 01:55:48,577
Brad was something a girl ..

2082
01:55:49,242 --> 01:55:50,633
Well, maybe not all girls.

2083
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:53,178
But he was something
that I had to go through.

2084
01:55:54,039 --> 01:55:56,600
Brad was my .. my postgraduate course.

2085
01:55:57,728 --> 01:55:59,168
He was a great teacher.

2086
01:56:00,542 --> 01:56:02,454
You're not telling the
whole story, Ginny.

2087
01:56:03,732 --> 01:56:05,005
I am not telling any story.

2088
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:08,270
I don't mean that I doubt you.
- Why not? You have every right to.

2089
01:56:09,079 --> 01:56:10,885
For heaven's sake, Cass.
Don't be so fair.

2090
01:56:11,147 --> 01:56:13,660
This isn't a chess game.
I kicked the board over.

2091
01:56:14,433 --> 01:56:15,932
Your queen has turned into a rook.

2092
01:56:16,528 --> 01:56:17,350
Stalemate.

2093
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:19,024
Do you want a divorce?

2094
01:56:19,686 --> 01:56:21,245
I want peace within myself.

2095
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:23,681
I've broken up my marriage.

2096
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:25,946
And I want to set you free.

2097
01:56:26,478 --> 01:56:28,981
Where would go for the divorce?
- Oh Reno. Florida.

2098
01:56:29,618 --> 01:56:30,973
We could get it in New York.

2099
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:35,358
No we couldn't.

2100
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:40,708
I see. Brad the perfect gentleman
would like to protect your honor.

2101
01:56:41,121 --> 01:56:43,780
And his I suppose.
- Brad wouldn't have to lie.

2102
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:44,882
No?

2103
01:56:45,323 --> 01:56:47,089
Would you like me to swear on the bible?

2104
01:56:47,429 --> 01:56:49,004
No, Ginny. We're not in court.

2105
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:54,139
Cass, for heaven's sake
let's get this over with.

2106
01:56:55,358 --> 01:56:56,379
Let me go.

2107
01:56:57,031 --> 01:56:58,130
Let me go.

2108
01:56:59,256 --> 01:57:01,187
Ginny, listen to me. I'm not your judge.

2109
01:57:02,324 --> 01:57:04,799
You wanted your freedom, didn't you?
Your freedom from this set up.

2110
01:57:05,136 --> 01:57:07,312
You thought that Brad
did too and that I didn't.

2111
01:57:07,522 --> 01:57:11,089
That I was owned by my surroundings
and by my country club friends.

2112
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:13,953
I never knew the truth, Cass.
- No. You didn't, Ginny.

2113
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:17,309
But if I hadn't been so blind myself
about some of those things ..

2114
01:57:17,433 --> 01:57:19,626
You never would have needed to go to ..

2115
01:57:20,679 --> 01:57:23,708
To another man to help you in your
rebellion against those things.

2116
01:57:23,996 --> 01:57:25,982
I know a little bit more
about myself now, Ginny.

2117
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:27,470
I don't know about you.

2118
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:29,070
But if it will ..

2119
01:57:29,461 --> 01:57:31,965
Ease your mind and make
you happy to get a divorce ..

2120
01:57:32,363 --> 01:57:33,519
I shan't say anymore.

2121
01:57:37,907 --> 01:57:39,566
Say something more.
- Ginny.

2122
01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:43,126
Freedom isn't a question of
marriage or where you live.

2123
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:45,455
It's a fight inside
yourself all the time.

2124
01:57:47,694 --> 01:57:49,606
And a wife can be an awful lot of help.

2125
01:57:52,511 --> 01:57:53,126
Tim.

2126
01:57:54,022 --> 01:57:54,608
Me?

2127
01:57:55,834 --> 01:57:56,649
You, Ginny.

2128
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:02,890
Oh, darling.

2129
01:58:41,964 --> 01:58:42,736
..r-o-s..

2130
01:58:43,305 --> 01:59:43,860
