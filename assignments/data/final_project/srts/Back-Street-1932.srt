1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,600
<i>Flight 44 United Los Angeles to Chicago has just landed. Will the passengers please report to the information desk?

3
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,060
- Thank you. 
- What about the navy?

4
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,500
- I have to be in Chicago tomorrow. 
- You’ll have to wait your turn sir.

5
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,330
- You think we'll still make Chicago by morning? 
- If I knew that I'd tell you, sir,

6
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,300
these days are worse than the war. 
- Any chance of another flight?

7
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,430
- Look let me get you a hotel room. 
- Meaning no chance.

8
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
May as well relax.

9
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,400
- Might even enjoy it. 
- You’ll like the Sheraton, it's a nice hotel.

10
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,530
Oh, that’s it, sailor, I have to be going.

11
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,600
Well why don't we go together? I mean some nice quiet place, huh?

12
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,460
- Oh it's a business appointment! 
- Business? This time of night?

13
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,530
I know it's terrible, isn't it? But that's the way it is.

14
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,530
Just when i meet a girl that can dance...

15
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,560
Say how about next week? I got a leave, can you be here?

16
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,600
- Well I guess. If i'm still in Lincoln. 
- Yeah. Don't you live here?

17
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
You call this living?

18
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,330
- Okay, lady, hop in. 
- Who me? I don't want a cab.

19
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,900
Hey hold it, I do.

20
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,600
Excuse me.

21
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,600
Sheraton Hotel.

22
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
- Hi.
- Hi!

23
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,360
- I'm not late. 
- Oh you're never late. I'm early.

24
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,130
- Do I look alright? 
- Oh more than alright. And you always do to me.

25
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,100
Well for Mr. Venner do I look alright?

26
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,360
Too good for Mr. Venner, whoever he is. Another salesman?

27
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,060
Oh no, he's a real honest-to-goodness manufacturer, and he says he's always on the lookout for new designers.

28
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,600
- On the lookout or on the make? 
- Oh, Curt.

29
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,960
He's a very busy man but he did take time out to look at my sketches.

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh sure 11 o'clock at night in his hotel room.

31
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,900
It is not in his hotel room, it's in the lobby.

32
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,300
- Funny? 
- Well you'd think so if you saw Mr. Venner.

33
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,060
- You want me to wait for you? 
- No, I'd only worry about keeping you waiting.

34
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
- Wish me luck? - Sure.

35
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
I'm on your side, Rae. In anything.

36
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,060
- A girl has to be crazy not to be in love with you. 
- Alright.

37
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,830
You get the minister and I'll get the psychiatrist.

38
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,700
Night, Curt.

39
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,460
Excuse me.

40
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,100
Again that is.

41
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,230
- Are you all right? 
- Uh-huh.

42
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,260
- Yes, sir? 
- Paul Saxon. I believe I have a reservation.

43
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,800
- That's right. - I may get a call from the airport,

44
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,130
no matter what time it comes-- 
- We'll put it through.

45
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,230
Would you please tell Mr. Venner that Miss Rae Smith is in the lobby?

46
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,000
Now Miss Smith, Mr. Venner is expecting a long-distance call. He asked that you go directly to his suite, 303.

47
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,500
Captain, we're a little short-handed. Would you mind?

48
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,030
Three, please.

49
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Ah Miss Smith, do come in.

50
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,330
My goodness, Mr. Venner. Must be a terribly important phone call you're expecting.

51
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,830
All in your honor, my dear. I've been looking forward to seeing you.

52
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,730
Well then why don't you turn on the lights? I don't glow in the dark, you know.

53
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,860
- But you do, my dear, you do indeed.
- Flatterer.

54
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,300
I put color swatches on most of these sketches.

55
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,630
Yes I'm sure they'll be fine, now why don't you just sit down and relax, huh?

56
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,460
And we'll have a little champagne.

57
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,630
You know it's amazing, a little wine makes business a pleasure.

58
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,260
Uh, these sketches are all complete outfits, and I've indicated accessories.

59
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,430
Now now now, time for that later on, when we're better acquainted.

60
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,930
A toast to your future.

61
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,700
Well I'll feel more like toasting my future after you've looked at my sketches.

62
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,830
- Now don't be coy.
- Oh I'm not being coy, Mr. Venner.

63
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,330
- I'm very serious about being a designer.
- Well then relax.

64
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,600
We'll finish the champagne and then we’ll look at them.

65
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,600
- Let's look at them now please.
- Not now!

66
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,330
When then? Tomorrow? Or shall I just leave them?

67
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,530
Say what is this some kind of a game? I go to all the trouble of ordering champagne and--

68
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,530
Say what's your hurry?

69
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Venner. I'm afraid I misunderstood you.

70
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,760
After all you did say to meet you in the lobby and well,

71
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
I didn't think it would take very long.

72
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,330
- He's downstairs waiting for me.
- Who's waiting?

73
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,960
Why my, um, fiancé of course.

74
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,660
Your fiancé? What kind of a fiancé would let you come to a man's room at this hour?

75
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,860
Well he didn't want to let me but I told him it would just take a few minutes,

76
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:13,330
and he's apt to come looking for me.
- Oh yeah? Well we'll just relax until he shows up,

77
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,330
Because my dear I do not believe one word of your story.

78
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,060
Now come on try a little more champagne. Relax.

79
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,860
I can help you get ahead but it's not a one-way street you know.

80
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,260
- Not one-way, dead-end!
- Now wait a minute!

81
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,860
You stop that! Stop it!

82
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,130
Yes?

83
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
Who is it?

84
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,330
Is Miss Rae Smith there?

85
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,430
A marine...

86
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,630
- I forgot to tell you, he's a marine.
- I hate to interrupt a business meeting but...

87
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,700
Well you know, Rae, I'm due at the airport very soon and if you're gonna see me off...

88
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,530
It's been very pleasant, Mr. Venner.

89
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,930
Why didn't you just flatten the old goat and walk out?

90
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,430
Oh I don't know. Maybe it's because I wanted so much for it to work out, and maybe...

91
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,660
You know the worst part? He was trying to seduce me with champagne!

92
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
Domestic champagne, yet!

93
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh that's wonderful!

94
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
So are you! Have you any idea how grateful I am?

95
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,660
I thank you. I do thank you.

96
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,830
That's what a marine is for.

97
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,960
Good night, marine.

98
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,660
- I'll never forget you.
 - Do you have to go?

99
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,960
I mean, can I buy you a drink?

100
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,400
- That's your phone.
 - Yes I know, but...

101
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,800
Well, don't run off... wait.

102
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,660
Promise?

103
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,430
Hello? Yes this is Saxon.

104
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,030
Oh, cancellation, good, I uh...

105
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,760
I mean I can't make it.

106
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,500
That's right. I'll take my chances.

107
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,060
That's what I said. I'll take my chances.

108
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,430
Let's see the town.

109
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,500
Are you crazy? Ironing in the middle of the night?

110
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,660
Potatoes??

111
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,330
You're cooking potatoes!

112
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh Janey, men like potato salad don't they?

113
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,700
All men? Even sophisticated men?

114
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,560
Oh, you came to the right party alright.

115
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,030
I know all about sophisticated men. And potatoes.

116
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,600
They're done.

117
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,900
What do you want with potato salad at...?

118
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
3:30 in the morning!

119
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,260
Well... did you ever hear of a picnic without potato salad?

120
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,200
No!

121
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,730
I thought we'd go out to Big Chief Lake.

122
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,730
Big Chief Lake. Gee I haven’t been out there since...

123
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
Who's we?

124
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,260
Paul Saxon. Oh you don't know him, he's not from around here, I just met him tonight.

125
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,660
- Mommy, can I have a glass of milk?
 - What are you doing out of bed?

126
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,730
Marilyn, it's still night time, honey, now will you get back to bed?

127
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,360
Oh Janey, let her stay up for a while.

128
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,060
You're the boss where she's concerned.

129
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,860
There's a sweetheart. There we go.

130
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,860
Keep your eyes on the road, driver.

131
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,660
Why? don't you feel safe with me?

132
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,930
Certainly not. Does anybody?

133
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,260
You know, we really didn't have to start this early, but I'm such an early bird.

134
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,330
I'm glad we did. I want this to be a long long day.

135
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,530
Say, I've been meaning to tell you ever since we drove by your store last night.

136
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,560
You and I are in the same business. I have some department stores too.

137
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,130
- Some?
 - Well it's a family business.

138
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,000
My grandfather started it. The Saxon Stores.

139
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,230
Are you <i>that</i> Saxon?

140
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,230
- I hope you don't mind.
 - Not too much!

141
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,600
You know, I was beginning to wonder what you and I could possibly have in common.

142
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Were you, indeed?

143
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,500
I wasn't. I knew.

144
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,960
Right away.

145
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,500
- What are you sketching? Let me see.
- No not yet. In a minute.

146
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,700
There's an old legend. At certain times of the year, a girl can see her sweetheart's face in the lake.

147
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,200
That is if she's... you know...

148
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,660
Pure of heart.

149
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,330
Please.

150
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,630
Make it mine. From you.

151
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,130
Just Rae?

152
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh that's how I see myself when I become a famous designer with my own salon.

153
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,430
That's my signature, all small letters. Very chic, don't you think?

154
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
You're really serious about being a designer aren't you?

155
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,230
- It's all i ever wanted to be.
- Why don't you do something about it?

156
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,600
I do whenever I can! Why else would I bother with a man like Venner?

157
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,960
Oh no, that's hoping. Hoping to be lucky, hoping for lightning to strike.

158
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,460
I mean really get out and do it.

159
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,100
I tried, but then my mother got sick and I had to stay and run the store.

160
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,200
But there wasn't anybody else, my sister Janey, well...

161
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,960
She was just married and just had a baby.

162
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,730
That was thoughtless of me. I guess I never made a sacrifice like that.

163
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,830
Everything I ever wanted I just reached out and took.

164
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm sorry.

165
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,130
Don't be. I loved my mother, she was a wonderful woman.

166
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,830
And when you love somebody... that's it.

167
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,960
Just that simple?

168
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,730
It is for me. How about you?

169
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,960
I think we better be going. You'll want to find out about your plane.

170
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,230
There'll always be another plane.

171
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,760
Never another picnic with Rae Smith.

172
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,700
Don't. Don't say it, please.

173
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,260
Never is such a long time.

174
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,100
Rae, I… Rae!

175
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh, Paul, I know this is crazy but I love you, I love you!

176
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,530
As simple as that... and as wonderful.

177
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,030
Help yourself to more coffee on the house. I gotta get started for the morning rush.

178
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,160
Here's your change. Do me a favor, will ya, if anybody comes in tell them to holler.

179
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
You and the missus take your time.

180
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,530
See how respectable we look?

181
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh, darling.

182
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,860
For the rest of our lives let's have breakfast at four in the morning.

183
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,200
You're an idiot.

184
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,660
Tell me, is it normal to be so hungry and so happy at the same time?

185
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
Well now, just how hungry are you, Miss Smith?

186
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,300
Tell me first. Just how happy are you?

187
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,000
Finish your coffee. I'll call the airport to see if there's a seat on today's plane.

188
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,900
It's a nice idea but slightly illegal.

189
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,560
I'd love to sit in your lap all the way to Chicago, but I don't think the airlines would allow it.

190
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,030
You'd better get two seats.

191
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,960
- I wish it were that simple.
- Isn't it

192
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,200
Well I've been away a long time, Rae, and... well there's the store, I...

193
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,360
You mean a man who runs a department store can't be in love?

194
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,960
It's the timing. Right now I<i> have</i> to leave you.

195
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,730
I wouldn't leave you for all the department stores in the world.

196
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,960
Be sensible, Rae, this is business, it's complicated.

197
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,600
It means i have to get things straightened out. Things that never mattered before.

198
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,660
Rae, I had a life before I got in the marine corps.

199
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,160
Before my plane was grounded here.

200
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,030
Before I met you.

201
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,660
- It's another woman.
- Now listen to me.

202
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,730
Oh that's silly of me, there must be dozens of women ready to throw themselves at you.

203
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,030
Just like I did.

204
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,260
Rae, do you think I want… just to say goodbye to you... like that?

205
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
But you must.

206
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,600
And it's hard isn't it?

207
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,930
Well let me make it easy for you.

208
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,630
- Wait.
 - Because if that's all it was to you,

209
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,500
that's all it is to me.

210
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,230
Goodbye, marine. Goodbye.

211
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,230
Rae, wait.

212
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,460
Rae, wait!

213
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,930
I'm sorry, Mr. Saxon, but she can't talk to you right now.

214
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,460
Tell her I turned this place over to get two tickets, and I got them.

215
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,560
Flight 73. Tell her it leaves in 40 minutes.

216
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,860
- I want her on it with me.
- Just a minute, Mr. Saxon.

217
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,930
Rae. Rae!

218
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,030
You better hear this!

219
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,830
He's using the phone at the ticket counter! He says he must talk to you!

220
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,830
Mr. Saxon? She won't talk to you.
- But she must!

221
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,730
Tell her I love her. Tell her it'll be a mess but I don't care I can work it out.

222
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,930
We can work it out, we have to.

223
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,030
- But she.
- No, no butts we can talk it out all the way to Chicago.

224
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,030
And listen, tell her we have the rest of our lives to work it out!

225
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,460
Alright, I'll do the best I can. What's your flight number again?

226
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,830
- 73.
- Okay. Rae. Rae!

227
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,830
He wants you to go with him on the plane now!

228
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,600
He says everything will be a mess, but he wants you to...

229
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,160
I am trying, Mr. Saxon, but she...

230
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,000
Hello? Operator. Operator, we've been cut off!

231
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,230
Oh he loves you, Rae, he said so.

232
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,430
He's waiting for you and wants you to go with him no matter what!

233
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,030
- First they cut you off and then it's busy!
 - You better try the phone booth,

234
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,160
I got a lot of calls to make. Confirmations.

235
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
- Call him back tell him I'm on my way!
 - Okay. Operator?

236
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,100
Still busy, operator. All right all right I'll wait!

237
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,960
- Did you get him?
 - No, it's still busy!

238
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,260
Well it can't be you must have got a wrong number. Keep trying and tell him I said yes yes yes!

239
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,660
Okay.

240
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,160
- Rae! You write to me!
 - Yes of course!

241
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:43,160
- Operator isn't there another number I could call?
 - But it can't be! Check it maybe it's out of order.

242
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,060
Mister, could you drive me to the airport, I'll pay you.

243
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
I'm late now, sorry.

244
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,730
Would you give me a push to the gas station? It's straight up the road.

245
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,430
- Okay.
 - Thanks.

246
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,430
Alright, get your foot off the brake now!

247
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,600
- Just a moment.
- Now wait!

248
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,830
Please one moment!

249
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
Okay...

250
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,760
Oh please there must be another number!

251
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,230
Thanks.

252
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,360
Gas please and hurry!

You could have waited... You could have waited.

265
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,500
You knew I'd come.

266
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,330
You can come out now, Curt's gone.
- What did you tell him?

267
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,800
I told him you were taking a nap.

268
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,130
He's no fool, he got the message, he went bowling with Cleve.

269
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,160
- You know, they don't come any better than Curt.
- I know.

270
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,330
He's good and kind and gentle

271
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,760
And he's smart too, he’ll go places.

272
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,560
And he worships the ground that you walk on.

273
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Look, Rae, love isn't like a a scale that's supposed to balance.

274
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,500
There isn't a marriage in the world where one doesn't love more than the other.

275
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
- Now what's wrong with Curt?
- Nothing.

276
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,530
Except that I don't love him, and I won't marry him.

277
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,200
I can't lie and short-change him.

278
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,130
- Well you might learn to love him you know it's happened before.
- And you might leave me alone!

279
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,130
Look I don't get you! For three weeks now you've been moaning about this Paul Saxon,

280
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,700
you could have at least written him or called him.

281
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,900
I did.

282
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,760
And you know something? He's married.

283
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,230
Oh no...

284
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,630
- Oh that never occurred to me.
- Me either.

285
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,230
First I didn't even believe it. Not even when the butler asked me if I wanted to talk to Mrs. Saxon.

286
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,400
I thought it was his mother. Then I looked it up in the newspaper files, real easy.

287
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,230
Big society wedding.

288
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,400
Darling, I'll tell you something. I'm glad you didn't get to the airport in time.

289
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,760
I'm glad you missed that plane.

290
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,300
- Oh, Rae honey, it isn't the end of the world!
 - For me it is.

291
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,130
So make it the beginning of another!

292
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,630
Look. Turn around and look at yourself! Come on, just look at yourself!

293
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,330
Oh with your face and that figure, boy I wish I had them!

294
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,330
And you got brains and talent.

295
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,730
- And those designs of yours
- Maybe they're no good either.

296
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,660
Well you're not gonna find out moping around here.

297
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes yes I guess you're right. I ought to get away.

298
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,860
- What about the store?
- Sell it!

299
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,200
Oh honey, please sell it and go!

300
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,230
Wake up, Rae, wake up and live now before it's too late.

301
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,960
<i>I knew you'd be crazy about New York as soon as you got a job.

00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,930
<i>For a while I was pretty worried that your money wouldn't hold out.

303
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
<i>Bought a copy of Harper's Bazaar and saw your boss's originals, as you call them.

304
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,430
<i>Cleve said if I dressed like that he'd shoot me. But what a way to die.

305
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,960
<i>You're coming up in the world, and we are all thrilled for you.

306
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:40,800
<i>As for us, Cleve’s on a diet, Marilyn has a cold, and I'm the same.

307
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,100
<i>Guess I always will be. Love, Janey.

308
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,000
The genius just arrived.

309
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,730
What kind of a mood is he in today?

310
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,860
Well if it was anyone else, rotten. For him, pretty good.

311
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,400
Thanks, Rae.

312
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,330
I've never seen anything like it. It's perfectly awful.

313
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,100
And what's this thing? Give me the shears. If i hadn't designed it myself, I'd burn it.

314
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,030
Here, take it away. I don't want to see it until the showing.

315
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,760
Well what do you want?

316
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,060
My sketches, Mr. Dalian. You've had them for over six months now.

317
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,500
Perhaps you've had a chance to look at them.

318
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,730
Do you buy all your clothes at rummage sales?

319
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,900
I didn't buy it, I made it. And if it weren't good, you wouldn't bother to insult it.

320
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,300
Deliver me from drugstore psychiatrists. And what's so good about it?

321
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,700
It has lines, style, simplicity. It says something.

322
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,400
Well, you've picked up the lingo quickly enough.

323
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,160
I always listen when you talk to a customer.

324
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,600
Dalian does not have customers. Dalian has patrons.

325
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,930
And as to your sketches, I'm not sure, but I think I've seen worse.

326
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,560
"Dear Janey,

327
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,630
Sorry I couldn't write sooner, but I've been working like mad and loving it.

328
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,200
Dalian added three of my designs to his summer line.

329
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,200
But not one kind word, compliment, or pleasant look.

330
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,630
Then yesterday, Mrs. Oliver Banning - she's on the best dressed list every year -

331
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,000
came in, and he introduced me as his assistant!

332
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,130
It was the first I heard of being promoted.

333
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,500
I didn't really believe it, but my paycheck convinced me.

334
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,830
All these years, Janey, finally it's paid off. Love to all. Rae."

335
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,600
- Did you read the Tribune?
 - Uh-huh.

336
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,000
- And the Post?
 - Uh-huh.

337
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,630
-And The Times?
 - This year, Mrs. Whitney Ames

338
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,960
and her debutante daughters, Susan and Lydia,

339
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,060
stole the fashion spotlight in originals from the atelier of Dalian

340
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,630
and his new and talented associate Rae.

341
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,630
Don't sit there wasting my time and drooling like an egotistical idiot.

342
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,230
Oh Dalian, I love you. I love the whole thing.

343
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,060
- If I couldn't come here every day...
 - Oh stop babbling like a breathless ingenue,

344
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,400
you don't fool me. You're a shrewd, conniving, opportunistic female.

345
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
And you give me nightmares.

346
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,460
I wake up with a cold clammy feeling that you're about to sandbag your way into a full partnership.

347
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:43,660
- Of course it's only a dream.
 - Well I believe in dreams implicitly. Don't you?

348
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,560
Get out of here you monster, go to lunch! Go and rest on your laurels!

349
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
And I hope there's a thorn in them!

350
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,130
I think i'll just take a walk down Fifth Avenue and sneer at everybody's dresses except ours!

351
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,400
How nice of you to include me.

352
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,560
Check the accounts receivable setup.

353
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
-  That's the only problem.
- Yes sir, fine.

354
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

355
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,830
You've got the data. Mind if I skip the meeting?

356
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,860
Rae? Rae Smith is it really you?

357
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,800
I don't know what to say.

358
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,500
Say you're glad to see me.

359
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,800
You're looking very well.

360
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,560
You're beautiful.

361
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
What are you doing in New York?

362
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,360
So you're that Rae?

363
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,000
All small letters. Very chic. I should have guessed.

364
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,160
Have lunch with me.

365
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,760
I've had lunch, thanks.

366
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,830
Dinner?

367
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,430
I can't.

368
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Tomorrow then.

369
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,600
No. Not tomorrow.

370
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,530
It was wonderful seeing you again, Paul.

371
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm sorry, Rae. I simply had to see you.

372
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,530
I'm busy, I told you.

373
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,460
- I see you found the right apartment!
 - Oh yes, thank you very much.

374
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,300
I won't ask you to sit down. I won't even offer you a drink.

375
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,730
- You're not serious.
 - Never more serious.

376
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,630
I don't want you here.

377
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,400
I don't know what you thought about me, or what you think now.

378
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,330
It isn't as if we were just old friends.

379
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,530
No I guess it isn't. But just listen to me. Please, that's all I ask.

380
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,000
I knew when I saw you today that I'd been looking for you wherever I went.

381
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,300
Always hoping to find you.

382
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,060
- But never really trying.
 - Because I had no right.

383
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,800
Do you have the right now?

384
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,760
No. But I can't help myself.

385
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,500
Rae do you know what it's like to think of someone or want someone

386
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,730
and not be able to do one thing about it?

387
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,500
Please, Rae, try to understand, try.

388
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Well...

389
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,560
Maybe that's... the way it was meant to be.

390
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,530
Sometimes life makes these decisions for us.

391
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,800
Yes...

392
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,130
Yes sometimes.

393
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
Like seeing you today.

394
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,260
Like knowing you're here.

395
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,130
No, it's too late, Paul.

396
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,400
I'm not cut out to be the other woman.

397
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,200
You're out of my life. It's over. Finished.

398
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,930
And it has to stay that way.

399
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,100
I love you, Rae.

400
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,700
Please don't send me away.

401
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,930
Who were you when I picked you up? A nobody. Couldn't design a shroud.

402
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,230
- I taught you all you know!
 - Please. Don't pick on me, not today.

403
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,160
- I'll never stop being grateful to you.
 - Then why do you want to quit? Better offer?

404
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,760
I told you. It's not to work for anyone else.

405
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,300
I have to get away. Don't ask me why.

406
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,830
Oh I know why.

407
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,430
He's married, of course.

408
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,530
- And has two children.
 - Oh please, please, spare me the dreary details.

409
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,700
Although I did think you'd be above such shabby involvements.

410
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,700
I want to be here, but... if I stay here...

411
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,700
- Well that's why I have to get away.
 - And give up everything you've won?

412
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
Sink the ship to put out the fire?

413
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,660
Do they have birth certificates in Nebraska?

414
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,860
Birth certificates? Sure. Why?

415
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,630
Then wash your face and stop looking like a poached egg

416
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,960
and go downtown and get yourself a passport.

417
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,360
We may as well collect some of that money the tourists are tossing around Rome.

418
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,430
Everyone else is...

419
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,900
thanks Dalian. thanks

420
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,330
Thanks.

421
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,460
- Buongiorno, signora!
 - Good morning, buongiorno!

422
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,960
- Good Morning, Mrs. Penworth.
- Oh, good morning Miss Smith!

423
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,430
A happy weekend, I hope?

424
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,330
Quiet but happy. I'll be in the work room.

425
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,800
And this morning when I opened the shop, he was already at the door waiting.

426
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,530
I couldn't keep an American gentleman. An old friend he said.

427
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,630
- American?
 - And a gentleman I assure you.

428
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,230
Oh I would not have let him wait in your office.

429
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,630
Curt! Oh Curt I don't believe it!

430
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,060
It's me alright!

431
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,600
Come on outside, I want to get a good look at you.

432
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,030
You are absolutely positively the last person on earth I ever expected to see here!

433
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,030
I'm the last person that ever expected to be here. Gosh you look wonderful.

434
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,330
Sit down. Sit down and tell me everything!

435
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,500
I don't care if you start at the beginning, the middle, or the end, but tell me everything.

436
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Well I had some business in Turin.

437
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,130
Oh what business? It's been so long.

438
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,060
Like we say in Lincoln, I'm in the industrial plastics game.

439
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,300
Like we say here, I'm in the rag business!

440
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,500
- What are you doing in Rome?
 - Well I...

441
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,300
I wanted to see you.

442
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,930
Oh Curt you're such a dope.

443
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,730
You know that old saying "see Naples and die, see Rome and live?"

444
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,300
I'm taking you out on the town tonight.

445
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,060
I'm not alone. I'm with the Claypools.

446
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,760
Charlie's one of my partners.

447
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,100
He and his wife Marge are just dying to meet you.

448
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,700
I'd love to meet them.

449
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,430
and we'll start off with cocktails at my place

450
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,830
and then I'll take you all to my favorite restaurant across the river.

451
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,030
Rae that'll be wonderful, just wonderful.

452
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,360
I was hoping for some of that octopus they eat here!

453
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,930
Oh Charlie, what a silly thing to say, you know you'd be afraid to taste it!

454
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,560
- That's his idea of a joke.
 - Well the joke's on him.

455
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,000
That's what you're gonna have for your midnight snack, I know just the place.

456
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,430
And they even put it up in cans and you can take some back to Lincoln.

457
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,060
Oh thanks a lot!

458
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,330
- By the way, how is Lincoln?
 - Oh it's grown so much you wouldn't know the place.

459
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,030
Why don't you come back sometime? For a visit anyhow.

460
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,500
I just might do that.

461
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh Rae, who is the man with the fez?

462
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,800
- Ex-king Zhodeck.
 - Oh Charlie, a king!

463
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,060
Let's go to the powder room and we'll pass his table on the way.

464
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,460
Oh good!

465
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,330
They'll never believe this in Lincoln!

466
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,230
Oh Paul it was a lovely party! And the baroness' yacht you know...

467
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,030
Full moon and so romantic, a lovely orchestra.

468
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,460
- I'm sorry you weren't there.
 - More champagne?

469
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
I am too, we would’ve liked being there.

470
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,760
- Liz...
 - Oh really, Paul, champagne won’t hurt Liz.

471
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,330
No, Tony!

472
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,600
My husband doesn't want me to, I'd rather not.

473
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
What's the matter, Paul? Don't get stuffy.

474
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
Champagne's perfectly safe, why they use it to launch ships!

475
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,460
I'll be back in just a minute, I want to see how the children are.

476
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,000
- How domestic can you get?
 - Relax, darling, they're perfectly safe back at the hotel.

477
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,260
- Miss Hatfield's a jewel!
 - I just want to make sure they're tucked in.

478
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,730
I think I'd better say goodnight to them too.

479
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,560
- What do you want?
 - Just to make sure it's a phone call not a detour to the bar.

480
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,330
What if it is?

481
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,830
Liz, a few more drinks and you'll fall flat on your face.

482
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,230
Let's find out.

483
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
Oh!

484
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,430
Here, let me help you.

485
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,260
Liz, you're getting out of here.

486
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,430
- Always the devoted husband!
 - Come on.

487
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,560
Is everything okay?

488
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,000
Couldn't be better.

489
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,230
- Yes, it could if you asked me to dance!
 - Well then I'm asking.

490
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,800
Rae I don't know how to thank you for taking us around, showing us everything.

491
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Marge and Charlie will be talking about this for the rest of their lives.

492
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Solid decent happy lives. I like them.

493
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,600
- I do too, I'm glad you do.
 - Curt. I want to see a lot of you while you're here.

494
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,300
You don't have to ask me twice. I was just trying to figure out how to ask you.

495
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,430
Let's get things lined up for tomorrow. First we'll go to the...

496
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,130
I won't be in Rome tomorrow, I've got a business appointment.

497
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,000
Let me know the minute you get back. The very instant.

498
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,330
The very second, I promise.

499
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,430
You ought to sue that restaurant. They charge enough not to have holes in their carpets.

500
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,460
That's why I tripped. Look!

501
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,300
Look, I think I'm getting a bruise right here.

502
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,400
Why don't you say it? You're sick of me.

503
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm sick of covering up for you in public.

504
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,100
I'm sick of pretending in front of the children.

505
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,630
- Yes, I'm sick of the whole mess.
- You and me both!

506
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:35,630
I'm sick of being picked on! I'm sick of having you watch me like a policeman!

507
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,760
I'm sick of you!

508
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,700
Oh Paul. We haven't always been like this.

509
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,530
Clawing at each other, tormenting each other.

510
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,430
Let's be honest, Liz. Our marriage wasn't working a long time before I went in the marine corps.

511
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,430
Why do you think I tried so hard to get in?

512
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,060
Why do you think you never asked me not to go?

513
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,530
Paul, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about tonight. I'm sorry about everything.

514
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,800
You always are... but it never helps.

515
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,630
You promised if we moved to Europe you'd try to change,

516
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,000
- we've been here not quite 48 hours--
- Oh don't be such a hypocrite!

517
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,460
You never agreed to come to Europe just because of me.

518
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,500
You came to open more department stores.

519
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,260
That's why you bought the house in Paris. That's why we're going to live there.

520
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,060
Department stores! Saxon stores all over the world!

521
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,400
Hooray for you! That's all you care about.

522
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,400
That's all you've ever cared about.

523
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,830
Liz.

524
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,630
Please. Why don't you give me a divorce?

525
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,360
Don't be such a fool, Paul. I worked much too hard getting you.

526
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,300
I couldn't argue about a settlement. You can have everything I own.

527
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,100
How generous!

528
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,100
I never needed your money, I don't need it now.

529
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,430
- Then why?
- Because I have no intention of being the ex Mrs. Saxon.

530
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,060
I know too many ex-misses wandering around paying some man's bills just for the company.

531
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,130
Worried sick he'll find somebody else and walk out, no thank you,

532
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,560
none of those fancy boys for me.

533
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,230
I haven't noticed you avoiding them now.

534
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,200
But darling that's the advantage of being married!

535
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,760
No entanglements! It's fun for them and it's fun for me.

536
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,730
Don't dream about a divorce, Paul. I like it this way.

537
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,500
Put it down.

538
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,630
I said put it down!

539
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,100
Give it to me! I want it! Give it to me! Give it to me!

540
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,530
I need it! Give it to me!

541
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,800
Give it to me! Give it to me!

542
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,760
Give it to me! Give it to me!

543
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,660
If you do that I'll kill you! I'll kill you do hear me? I'll kill you!

544
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,900
I'll kill you!

545
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,760
Give me that! Don’t do that!

546
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,100
Give me that! Don’t do that!

547
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,200
You know water always makes your hangover worse.

548
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,900
- I'm thirsty.
 - Coffee. Drink it.

549
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,960
- I don't want any coffee!
 -Drink it.

550
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,200
You'll need it before the children come in to say good morning.

551
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,260
Children...

552
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,830
Miss Hatfield! Caroline! Paul!

553
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,200
Almost forgotten about the children...

554
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,560
Not a very good mother I expect.

555
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,530
Come on, come on.

556
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,530
- Good morning, mother.
- Good morning, dear.

557
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,100
- Good morning, mother.
 - Hi, dad!

558
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,000
Hello, son!

559
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,430
How's my big girl?

560
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,430
- Hey you cut your face!
 - Oh that. Shaving.

561
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,100
I was a little careless.

562
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,530
- Does it hurt?
 - No, baby. Not anymore.

563
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,160
Is everything ready, Miss Hatfield?

564
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,060
We were just waiting to say goodbye to you,

565
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,730
- then we'll be on our way.
- Good.

566
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,930
On your way? Where?

567
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,000
- We're going to see an owl.
 - Maybe even a glacier!

568
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,700
All of a sudden? Why?

569
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,500
Rome isn't a very good city for children this time of year, it's terribly damp.

570
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,430
- Well I don't know, I...
 - They'll enjoy it, Mr. Saxon.

571
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,730
Well it's a long trip, darling, so you'd better get started. Say goodbye to your father.

572
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,430
Bye, dad.

573
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,460
- Bye, dad.
- Have a good time!

574
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,400
 - You too, Miss Hatfield.
-  Thank you, sir.

575
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,900
Enjoy your trip, darlings! You know where to reach us?

576
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,130
- Chateau d'Or. San Tropez.
- That's right.

577
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,960
Goodbye. Have fun!

578
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,760
How long do you think it's going to work?

579
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,000
What do you mean?

580
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,530
Sending the children away so you can... keep everything a secret.

581
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,000
They're getting older. They'll start to notice.

582
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,030
You're a very good father, you'll see to it that they don't.

583
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,900
You're my insurance, darling. I have nothing to worry about.

584
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,033
And I thought if I left now I'd have time for a swim.

585
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:02,733
And don't worry about the shop, everything's under control. Enjoy yourself!

586
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,400
- Hello, Paul.

587
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,066
Hello, Rae.

588
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,433
Your day over?

589
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:44,066
Yes.

590
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,300
Rae I... didn't just happen to be walking by here.

591
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:53,233
Can't we...

592
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:58,600
Just a quiet talk somewhere? Please?

593
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:03,766
Please.

594
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,366
How about a swim? It's not too far from here.

595
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:41,666
The second time I tried to get a divorce, she took the children for a drive.

596
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:46,133
90 miles an hour when a tire blew. It's a miracle they weren't all killed.

597
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,233
And that's the whole story.

598
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:53,100
If the thing is wrong to begin with it doesn't get better. Only worse.

599
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,033
I don't see how this could get worse.

600
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,933
What's the answer if there is one?

601
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,500
What do you want me to say, Paul? That I still love you?

602
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:16,033
I do.

603
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,900
And I love you. Now and always.

604
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:31,333
But I have no right to mess up your life for the nasty bits and pieces of mine.

605
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:35,366
I shouldn't have come looking for you. I'll go now.

606
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,933
- Is that what you really want to do?
 - What else can I do?

607
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:46,800
I can't get a divorce. What future can I offer you? What hope?

608
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,466
Well what do I have now?

609
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:57,733
- I need you too, Paul.
- There's no use pretending, Rae.

610
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,566
I've tried to face being alone. I can't go on without you.

611
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,766
I won't let you.

612
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:32,766
I'm dreadfully sorry, Mr. Stanton, but I don't know any more now than I told you over the telephone.

613
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,333
I don't believe it, she's been gone for three days!

614
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:38,400
Well she often goes away, takes a little time to herself.

615
00:57:38,566 --> 00:57:40,966
- We're not at all disturbed.
- I am.

616
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:45,833
We made all sorts of plans, why would she just disappear without telling me where to find her?

617
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:51,400
I guess that question just answered itself.

618
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,433
- Thank you, I'm sorry if I bothered you.
 - Not at all.

619
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:57,333
When miss smith returns, I'll tell her that you called.

620
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,400
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't. Please don't mention that I came by.

621
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:22,000
Do you believe that in three days, a man can become an entirely different human being?

622
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,366
Well not too different I hope.

623
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:31,333
- I have a question.
- Today I know all the answers.

624
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:38,733
It's all those ifs. If your plane hadn't been grounded and if my car hadn't run out of gas.

625
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:44,200
- And if we'll really have more days like this.
 - Every one I can steal.

626
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,100
- What a dreadful way to say it.
- It doesn't matter.

627
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:54,400
As long as I know we'll be together sooner or later. Even for a minute.

628
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,166
But together.

629
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,133
Well...

630
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:36,433
I've been trying to find you for three days!

631
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:39,666
Well never mind me. Where are the children?

632
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:47,666
You tell me where you were, I'll tell you about the children.

633
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:55,633
- Who are you calling?
- Miss Hatfield.

634
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,800
You don't have to. The hildren are here, I sent for them.

635
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,233
When I couldn't reach you, I came back.

636
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:04,933
I couldn't stay here alone, I had to have someone.

637
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,966
I'd say you had pretty steady company.

638
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,000
What are you gonna do about it?

639
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,600
Just what you're gonna do about it.

640
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:23,033
Nothing.

641
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,066
You really mean that, don't you?

642
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:32,933
That's quite a change in three days!

643
01:00:33,566 --> 01:00:36,300
Who was with you? I wanna know where you were!

644
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:40,033
A woman!

645
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:45,733
That's it, and she thinks you're wonderful! And you believe her!

646
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:49,466
Was she expensive, darling? Was she?

647
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:57,233
I'm right! I guessed it!

648
01:00:58,066 --> 01:01:01,966
- I warn you, Paul. If you ever look at another woman--
- It won't work, Liz.

649
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:06,333
All these years I've asked, begged, pleaded for a divorce! Well not anymore.

650
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:09,533
You don't have to give me a divorce, but it's all over, Liz.

651
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,733
I gave you every chance. I crawled to try to help you.

652
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,366
You didn't want it. Now it's too late.

653
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,333
If you walk out of here, Paul, I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I will, Paul!

654
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:23,166
- Did you hear me?!
- Yes.

655
01:01:23,466 --> 01:01:25,466
And a hundred times before.

656
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,600
- Hello?
 - Rae, darling.

657
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,766
- Paul.
-  Will you meet me at the beach house?

658
01:01:50,966 --> 01:01:53,266
I'll be about an hour. Two at the most.

659
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,866
Mr. Saxton, come quickly, it's Mrs. Saxon! Hurry!

660
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,366
I have to go now, I'll see you later.

661
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,000
Hello?

662
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:35,566
Oh Paul, I've been going crazy, waiting, worrying, imagining all sorts of things!

663
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:37,733
And I didn't dare call you.

664
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,466
I'm sorry. I called as soon as I could after...

665
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:45,100
After what? What happened, are you all right?

666
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:46,333
It's Liz.

667
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,700
Sleeping pills.

668
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,900
Oh no.

669
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:55,833
- Is she...
- She's all right now.

670
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,266
She'll be out of the hospital tomorrow.

671
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:03,933
I'm calling from there. She gets hysterical if I just talk about leaving the hospital.

672
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,533
I haven't even been able to get to the children.

673
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,366
The children, how terrible for them.

674
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,133
Rae, I...

675
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,366
I won't even be able to see you.

676
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,966
To say goodbye.

677
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,033
Goodbye? But I...

678
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:25,233
Well when... when Liz leaves the hospital tomorrow she wants to go right home.

679
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Home?

680
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,733
- To the states?
- The house in Paris.

681
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,466
I know it's awful to say this but...

682
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:39,700
Liz knew just what she was doing.

683
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,133
She's won and left us with nothing.

684
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:48,233
Oh no. No I have so much.

685
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:50,566
What do you have?

686
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:54,700
Waiting? Worrying?

687
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:59,433
Loving you, and knowing you love me.

688
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:02,433
Oh, Paul, I have all that.

689
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:04,333
Rae, I have to go now.

690
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:08,500
I understand. Goodbye.

691
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,733
Goodbye.

692
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:27,933
Don't you think you should stay one day more before you go?

693
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:31,900
Don't be silly, darling, it was just a touch of the flu, I'll be perfectly all right.

694
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:36,100
The children are training up with the nurse, that's why we have to leave now, to meet them.

695
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,500
<i>- Gate 3 now boarding.</i>
- Goodbye.

696
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,166
Goodbye. See you in Paris.

697
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,833
How about a picture? You and Mrs. Saxon.

698
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,733
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh yes, please!

699
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:53,000
<i>Flight 51 Rome to Paris. Gate 3 now boarding.

700
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:05,766
- Thank you
 - Thank you.

701
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,066
You better get me aboard, darling, I'm terribly tired.

702
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:11,366
- Goodbye again.
- Goodbye!

703
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,800
Long distance? I want a place to call to Paris please.

704
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,333
Person to person, Mr. Paul...

705
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,066
Never mind.

706
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:56,666
Hello. Can you please tell me if flight 7 from Paris will be in on time?

707
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,800
It lands in 20 minutes? Wonderful.

708
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,633
Oh, Mrs. Penworth. I'm going home now.

709
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:15,900
And you should.

710
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,900
You've been working nights and weekends for over a month now and it's just too much.

711
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,400
Thanks, but don't worry about me, I'm just fine.

712
01:07:22,733 --> 01:07:25,733
I'll be at the apartment in 15 minutes if any calls should come.

713
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:28,833
I'll have them transferred to you there just as I always do.

714
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:37,566
Hello? Hello?

715
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,033
Yes, this is Rae Smith.

716
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,533
Oh darling. Darling, it's been so long.

717
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:57,333
- Not because I wanted it to be.
- I know and I'm not complaining.

718
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,800
And you can be here after all, can't you?

719
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:03,766
I've got it all planned. We'll go out to the beach house.

720
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:07,033
It would be wonderful but... I just can't.

721
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:11,766
But I had to talk to you. Make sure you understand.

722
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:14,600
Of course I understand.

723
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:20,900
And the beach house will still be there next time. Unless a high tide has washed it away.

724
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,766
I haven't been there since the last time with you.

725
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:28,333
I can't even tell when the next time we'll be.

726
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:31,600
If only we weren't so far apart.

727
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:35,466
It'd be an hour, even a moment when we could be together.

728
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:40,800
Paul... suppose... I mean...

729
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:46,766
Suppose I came to Paris to stay, to live there.

730
01:08:47,133 --> 01:08:49,833
- Would that be all right, Paul?
- Would it?

731
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:54,066
I've dreamed about it! If you only knew how many times, but...

732
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,833
How, how can you?

733
01:08:56,133 --> 01:09:00,600
I'll be there. I promise. Nothing can stop me.

734
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,800
Well when? How soon? Tomorrow? This weekend?

735
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:07,566
- It'll take a little time to arrange!
- A little time...

736
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,333
When I'm waiting for you, there's no such thing as a little time. Don't you know that?

737
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:14,800
Do you think I don't?

738
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:19,566
Oh my darling, do you really think I don't?

739
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,133
But Rae, I can't wait forever.

740
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,333
I have to see you even if it's only for an instant, just to make sure you're here!

741
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,566
I'll leave in about 10 minutes. Meet you in front of your hotel.

742
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,433
Right.

743
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:01,500
- Am I late?
 - I was early!

744
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,333
Here we are.

745
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:14,833
Alone at last.

746
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:20,400
Yes, sir! Alone at last!

747
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,866
You know, I'm just beginning to realize that you're a most amazing woman!

748
01:10:33,966 --> 01:10:36,766
Why, because I've kept my mouth shut for the last half hour?

749
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,200
Because you haven't asked where we're going.

750
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:43,500
Couldn't matter less as long as we're going there together.

751
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,166
Where are we going?

752
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:50,600
Uh-huh, just as I suspected. Feet of clay.

753
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:57,633
Well now this road goes to the airport. On the other hand, this one...

754
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,466
Doesn't.

755
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,033
Paul, if you don't tell me where we're going, I'll...

756
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:11,666

757
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:37,500
I wanted you to see this place.

758
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,533
- Well what do you think of it?
- Oh it's lovely!

759
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:55,800
- You didn't! It isn't...
- With all my love.

760
01:11:57,633 --> 01:11:59,433
Oh, Paul!

761
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:23,133
It's beautiful, darling, just perfect!

762
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,166
Well go ahead. Take a look! It's your house.

763
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:32,766
Our house, Paul.

764
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,533
It’s the kind of house I've always dreamed about!

765
01:13:04,233 --> 01:13:06,900
I thought I'd leave the interior decoration up to you.

766
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:08,800
But I did make a start at it.

767
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:19,633
Paul...

768
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:23,233
Do you think you can build a room around that?

769
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,900
Why not? I built a life around it.

770
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:38,433
Just be with me whenever you can, and I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

771
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:24,733
- Those shrubs over there need pruning.
- You say that every time you pass them!

772
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:27,866
Well next time for sure. I have to get a pair of pruning shears.

773
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:31,066
That's the last time for that alibi. Here, hold this.

774
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:35,533
I ordered you a pair. They'll be here in a few days.

775
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:37,030
Slave driver!

776
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:43,000
Well I'll see you at the airport this afternoon.

777
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,266
- No trouble with the London reservations, was there?
- Oh no, no trouble with the reservations.

778
01:14:47,266 --> 01:14:49,400
But I'm not sure I can go with you this time.

779
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,366
- There's so much to do getting the new shop started.
- But...

780
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,233
Oh, darling, I know I shouldn't tease you,

781
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:59,833
but that look on your face makes me feel like a new woman.

782
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,100
You know I'll be there. Wherever you are, whenever you say.

783
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,533
See you at the airport!

784
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:53,533
Every time I look in one of these mirrors, I decide I ought to visit that wonderful little man in Switzerland!

785
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:56,900
Three days and you're back in circulation!

786
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,600
And just between us, I haven't been circulating much lately.

787
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,200
- Good morning, Mrs. Evans.
- Hello, Rae.

788
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,666
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh that's quite all right!

789
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:10,033
Liz, this is the famous Rae. Mrs. Paul Saxon.

790
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:13,266
How do you do? I've heard a great deal about you.

791
01:16:13,633 --> 01:16:18,033
That's very flattering. Of course, I've seen your photographs in all the fashion magazines.

792
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:21,600
Oh now don't add to her ego. She's just back from Spain,

793
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,766
a gorgeous matador even dedicated a bull to her!

794
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:32,366
- What do you think, Rae?
- Well, I think a little less here,

795
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,633
and a little more here.

796
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,733
Matter of fact I should have stayed in Spain.

797
01:16:37,733 --> 01:16:41,300
I just got back this morning, and Paul's leaving for London this afternoon.

798
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:43,866
Maybe I'll go with him.

799
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,233
Oh, speaking of Paul, I saw him this morning.

800
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:50,766
We were coming in from the country, and he was driving into Paris.

801
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:55,666
- Driving into Paris?
- Yes, in the lane right beside us.

802
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,866
We honked and shrieked, but he didn't seem to hear us!

803
01:16:57,866 --> 01:17:00,066
Driving into Paris, are you sure?

804
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:04,733
Well of course I'm always a little bleary in the morning, maybe it wasn't.

805
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,566
Do you have a phone I could use?

806
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,666
Oh yes, right in my office. Show Mrs. Saxon to the phone in my office.

807
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,666
Oui, madame. Par ici, madame.

808
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:21,600
I seem to have opened a can of beans.

809
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:26,033
Well at least she isn't screaming.

810
01:17:26,733 --> 01:17:30,166
You know, by the time she gets through she'll probably quote me as saying,

811
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,966
"He had two blondes and a redhead with him."

812
01:17:34,133 --> 01:17:38,566
Maybe he had it that stashed away in the trunk. Everybody knows that he's got someone.

813
01:17:42,066 --> 01:17:45,400
- I think we'll be ready for a final fitting in about a week.
- Good!

814
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:51,600
Yes, this morning. You're costing me a fortune and I have to tell you these things.

815
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,366
I hope so, or I'll get someone else.

816

822
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,066
- Hello, son, it sure is!
- We wanted to say goodbye!

823
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,233
I'll only be in London a couple of days, and I said goodbye this morning!

824
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:04,300
We've all just been to the dentist, Mr. Saxon, and they insisted I bring them here.

825
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,500
Oh they did, did they? Well how was your drive?

826

827

- Well I've never been there. Why?

828
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:17,500
I just wanted to know. It's such a funny name.

Oh.

833
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:50,033
Pardon me, but could you tell me how much it costs...

834
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:51,266
Her name is Smith.

835
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,266
No it actually is! I saw her passport, she's American.

836
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,133
I could have told you she would be on this flight as soon as Paul Saxon picked up his ticket.

837
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:04,633
Wherever he goes, she goes.

838
01:20:10,266 --> 01:20:14,933
- Just coincidence.
- Every time? Uh-uh.

839
01:20:16,033 --> 01:20:18,733

What does it mean if something's too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence?

848
01:21:06,866 --> 01:21:10,766
Well I guess that means that it's no accident. That it was arranged.

Nothing.

I told you, nothing.

Really, darling, it wasn't necessary to change your flight.

855

How could the boy even suspect we were together?

856
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:50,500
I don't know perhaps he didn't, but... I had a feeling he kept looking at me.

And I'm wearing a new dress and you've never even noticed.

860

I did. I noticed the dress.

861

And how very beautiful you are.

862
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,833

 - Oh that's not true, darling.

My life is full and rich and wonderful.

Loving you, and being loved by you.

Why don't you ask me to dance?

You know, in all our years together… we've never danced.

Janey, I'd better run now.

I really feel guilty taking off the afternoon before the fashion show.

892
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:31,533
Not much of a holiday. It's almost 5 and you deserve a rest.

893
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,566
Now don't you worry about a thing.

894

You've designed a magnificent line and tomorrow is going to be a crashing success, I know.

I know who you are. I know all about you!

Why can't you stop following my father?

897
01:26:54,933 --> 01:26:58,666
They don't think I know, but I do! Why don't you leave my father alone?

898
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:00,666
I hate you! I--

903
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:21,766
Oh no.

904
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,400
No it's worse, much worse.

905
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,966
It's Paul Jr. He knows about me.

906
01:28:31,466 --> 01:28:35,333
But he can't! Why that's impossible. I'll be right out.

907
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,066
No don't, don't come here! Go to your son.

908
01:28:38,366 --> 01:28:42,033
It doesn't matter about me, about us. He's the one who needs you.

909
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,133
Oh, Paul, how he needs you.

910
01:28:45,433 --> 01:28:47,800
Help him, darling. Help him.

911
01:28:48,566 --> 01:28:49,533
Yes.

912
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,633
Hello, son.

913
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,533
Did you have your dinner already?
- I wasn't hungry.

914
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:40,100
Well maybe you and I can have a bite together. But we'll talk about things--

915
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,366
You mean you're not going out with her tonight?

916
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,633
I know all about her.

917
01:29:45,133 --> 01:29:46,666
Her name's Rae Smith.

918
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:50,000
Where did you hear all that?

919
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,100
- Who told you?
- I found out.

920
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,533
By myself. When I talked to her.

921
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
I told her to leave you alone.

922
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,533
Didn't she tell you?

923
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,066
yes yes she did

924
01:30:09,133 --> 01:30:11,033
- Paul...
- And I hate her.

925
01:30:11,533 --> 01:30:13,400
I'd like to kill her.

926
01:30:17,766 --> 01:30:20,800
- Sit down, son.
- I don't want to hear about her!

927
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,866
Sit down, son.

928
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:43,966
I guess I always knew that... one day you and I would have to talk about...

929
01:30:46,466 --> 01:30:48,133
About all this.

930
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:54,533
Well I kept hoping and praying it would be years away... when you were older.

931
01:30:54,766 --> 01:30:57,400
I'm old enough. Almost 12.

932
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,000
So old.

933
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:04,100
So young.

934
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,300
- Listen to me, son.
- I don't care what you say,

935
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:14,000
you're never gonna change what I think!
- Please don't judge us. Not now.

936
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,933
- Rae Smith never hurt you or your sister--
- I don't believe you!

937
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,930
I hate her, I wish she was dead!

938
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,400
Don't. Don't talk like that.

939
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,500
How can I explain things you're too young to know about?

940
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:33,133
Men and women. Loving and being loved.

941
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,866
What words do I use for something that isn't words at all?

942
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:42,933
The way people meet. How they feel about each other.

943
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,033
Do you know what I'm trying to say? Even a tiny little bit?

944
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,266
My boy, my son!

945
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:58,866
- Try to understand.
 - I understand all right!

946
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,766
- She's a no-good dirty--
- Paul!

947
01:32:06,233 --> 01:32:07,800
You’d better go to your room.

948
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:22,000
And now, to be auctioned for the benefit of the children's hospital.

949
01:33:22,366 --> 01:33:25,633
I'd like to present my own personal favorite.

950
01:33:26,533 --> 01:33:28,333
Wedding in June.

951
01:33:43,966 --> 01:33:46,333
- One thousand dollars.
- Thank you!

952
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,233
- Fifteen hundred dollars!
- Thank you!

953
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:52,533
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.
- Thank you!

954
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:55,266
- Ten thousand dollars!
- Thank you!

955
01:34:03,933 --> 01:34:06,500
$10,000 for the children's hospital.

956
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,900
Any more?

957
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:16,333
- Sold--
- Sold to Mrs. Paul Saxon!

958
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,666
Shall we deliver the gown to your home?

959
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:27,166
Don't be absurd! It's not for me!

960
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:31,533
I would like it delivered, however. Doesn't matter how it fits.

961
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,900
She'll never get to wear it anyway.

962
01:34:34,633 --> 01:34:39,466
You've all tried to guess, who is the woman? Or I should say...

963
01:34:40,266 --> 01:34:43,400
The <i>other</i> woman in my husband's life.

964
01:34:43,966 --> 01:34:49,433
That mysterious creature who turns up in London. Zurich. Rome.

965
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:52,800
The one he hides away on some back street!

966
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,666
Liz, for heaven's sake!

967
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:03,300
I'd like the gown delivered to Miss Rae Smith. In care of my husband.

968
01:35:17,933 --> 01:35:21,033
Rae, darling. Don't.

969
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,066
No, Paul. Everything's over.

970
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,100
You, me, my work, it's all over!

971
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:32,033
Everyone's laughing. Other people's love affairs are always funny.

972
01:35:32,966 --> 01:35:36,533
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters but you and me.

973
01:35:36,966 --> 01:35:38,633
That's not true, Paul.

974
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:42,033
The children matter. And they know.

975
01:35:43,866 --> 01:35:45,233
Everyone knows.

976
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,066
It's become..

977
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,966
Cheap and vulgar and dirty.

978
01:35:51,566 --> 01:35:53,766
And we'll never change that, never.

979
01:35:55,733 --> 01:36:01,133
- I will, I promise you, I will.
- You can't. No one can.

980
01:36:03,766 --> 01:36:09,933
You know... the funny thing about life... is that all the old cliches are true.

981
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:16,266
You can't break the rules. You can't live your own life.

982
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:19,133
You can't ignore the world.

983
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:26,733
I'm never gonna see you again, Paul.

984
01:36:28,066 --> 01:36:31,166
I'm leaving here and I'm going where you'll never find me.

985
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,100
You'll stay right here.

986
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,233
I'm going out now, but I'm coming back.

987
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,700
And when I get back, I'll never leave again.

988
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:17,966
Oh hello, darling. Sorry I can't wait, I'm going out to dinner.

989
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:19,833
Get back to the house, I want to talk to you!

990
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,266
Flattering but impossible. I didn't expect you and I'm late already.

991
01:37:23,266 --> 01:37:26,066
Get out of that car or it'll be a scene you'll never forget! Right here!

992
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:28,466
Sounds fascinating, give me a rain check!

993
01:37:34,633 --> 01:37:36,500
Tomorrow I'm suing for divorce.

994
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,100
And how far do you think you'll get? Everything's on my side thanks to your little dressmaker.

995
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:48,766
- I'll drag her through every courtroom.
- You can't hurt her any more than you already have.

996
01:37:48,766 --> 01:37:52,733
- I'll never give you up, Paul. Never.
- I couldn't care less.

997
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,700
I'm walking out, I should have done it five, ten years ago.

998
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,700
How about the children?

999
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:03,200
- They'll know.
- Paul already knows.

1000
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:08,600
You can let me out now.

1001
01:38:17,166 --> 01:38:18,333
Liz, don’t be crazy!

1002
01:38:20,966 --> 01:38:21,800
Liz!

1003
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:24,400
Liz, stop! Liz!

1004
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:33,800
Liz, stop!

1005
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:15,166
Hello, Dad.

1006
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:35,033
Paul.

1007
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:40,000
Paul.

1008
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,266
Please.

1009
01:40:35,866 --> 01:40:37,200
Please.

1010
01:40:46,933 --> 01:40:50,733
St. Cloud. 407.

1011
01:40:53,966 --> 01:40:56,266
- Hello?
- Just a moment, please.

1012
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:13,833
Rae.

1013
01:41:18,633 --> 01:41:20,300
Rae Smith.

1014
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,800
I...

1015
01:41:29,633 --> 01:41:31,300
Love...

1016
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:34,733
You...

1017
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:39,066
Paul! My darling, I love you too!

1018
01:41:56,233 --> 01:41:57,233
Dad…

1019
01:41:59,733 --> 01:42:01,100
Dad!

1020
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:05,433
Dad, I'm sorry! Dad!

1021
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:09,900
What's the matter? What's happened?

1022
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:11,866
Paul!

1023
01:42:12,733 --> 01:42:13,966
Paul!

1024
01:42:14,933 --> 01:42:16,433
Paul!

1025
01:44:41,133 --> 01:44:42,100
Yes?

1026
01:45:11,966 --> 01:45:13,466
Hello, Miss Smith.

1027
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:17,300
Come here...

1028
01:45:36,933 --> 01:45:40,000
I don't think you've ever met my sister Caroline.

1029
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,533
Hello, Miss Smith.

1030
01:45:44,933 --> 01:45:46,566
Hello, Caroline.

1031
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,833
We came because... Well...

1032
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,933
There's nobody left. I mean...

1033
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:58,600
There's... nobody... nobody close.

1034
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,800
So we thought, maybe, if you didn't mind...

1035
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:07,300
We could come to visit you once in a while... Maybe?

1036
01:46:09,466 --> 01:46:14,200
Miss Hatfield said we could. If it's all right with you.

1037
01:46:15,305 --> 01:47:15,207
