1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:11,527
- Did you bring my band of Indians?
- Indians?

3
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,010
Yes, American Indians,
musicians to play in my café.

4
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,734
- Oh, you mean Indians with feathers?
- Yes, with noses.

5
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:20,039
- Like on the American five cents?
- Yes, yes.

6
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,561
- Have you got them on board, yes?
- No.

7
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,217
Thank you, <i>monsieur.</i>

8
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:33,728
Indians? Indians?
Are you the Wabash Indians Band?

9
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,851
Are you Voyda?

10
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,477
I am Alexander Petrovitch
Moskovich Voyda.

11
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,369
Let's pick it up from there.

12
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,540
We're the boys you hired
to play at your café.

13
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,426
- The Wabash Indianians.
- Indianians?

14
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,240
Is this the same as Indians?

15
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,073
Well, yes, in a sense.

16
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,496
You see, we don't wear our feathers
in warm weather, do we, boys?

17
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:55,946
- No.
- No, never, never.

18
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,077
- Well, when do we start, Mr. Voyda?
- You don't start.

19
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:01,546
I cable for Indians and I want Indians!

20
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:05,482
No pale American face
is going to make me a fool of myself.

21
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,579
Did you ever heard of Alexander
Petrovitch Moskovich Voyda?

22
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,756
- Sure.
- Yes, and how, and how.

23
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:13,697
As a matter of fact, we hear you're one
of the cleverest fellows in Paris.

24
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,844
In Paris and all Europe.
The whole world.

25
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,533
Well, I was coming to that.
I just wanted to prepare you, that's all.

26
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,294
You got a great bet
in these boys, Mr. Voyda.

27
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,712
- They'll be a knockout in your café.
- They shall never see my café.

28
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,886
I ordered Indians, and what do I get?

29
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,194
Wait, Mr. Voyda.

30
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,201
Huck, do the organ number, quick.

31
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,536
Come on, boys, give us the organ number.
Get the gloves out.

32
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:39,813
- Oh, Mr. Voyda.
- What?

33
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:41,127
Aren't you going to
give these boys a chance?

34
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,504
No, why should I?

35
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,447
Sorry, Mr. Voyda,
but I'm afraid you've got to listen.

36
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,817
Just submit quietly
and we'll both keep out of jail.

37
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,496
Well, how did you like that, Mr. Voyda?
You see, you almost made a mistake.

38
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:21,897
I made a mistake? You made a mistake.

39
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,458
You are not Indians!

40
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:27,818
The cable mentioned a short engagement.

41
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,245
Well, it was a nice trip over.

42
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:33,414
It'll be a nicer trip going back,
stoking coals.

43
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,645
Come on, boys, the train for Paris.

44
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,686
A grand total of $13.78.

45
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,669
And a button.

46
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,597
Well, boys, at the rate we live,
that'll last us about two months.

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,642
Mother told me
there would be days like this.

48
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:03,975
Say, listen,
they dance in Paris, don't they?

49
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,953
All we have to do
is find out who pays the fiddler.

50
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,717
Does anyone know anyone in Paris?

51
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,208
That top sergeant brother of mine
gave me some addresses.

52
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:11,330
Quiet.

53
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:15,687
Wait! I know somebody, a little girl
who used to live next door to me.

54
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:19,072
Gee, I was crazy about her, too.
She's a sensation in Paris,

55
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,634
she's a star of some show or something.

56
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,130
- She'll help us.
- Well, what's her name?

57
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,369
What was her name?

58
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,175
Gee, I could find her like that
if I could only remember her name.

59
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,031
Anybody else you know
you can't remember?

60
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,368
Yeah, but I can't think who they are.

61
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:39,591
I know, it's Lizzie, Lizzie...
Elizabeth Gatz.

62
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,869
That's it. Elizabeth Gatz.

63
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,378
What a beautiful name.

64
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,535
Whether you find your Lizzie or not,
I've got an aunt in Paris. Aunt Minnie.

65
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:48,391
Can Aunt Minnie use a band?

66
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:50,788
Probably not. She's a dressmaker.

67
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,595
Well, I've knitted and tatted
all my life, but I've never sewed.

68
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,382
- She's very rich and famous. She might...
- Why didn't you say so before?

69
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:58,722
She's Roberta.

70
00:06:58,795 --> 00:06:59,875
Roberta?

71
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,854
- This Roberta?
- Yeah.

72
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,192
They tell me in Paris if you
don't buy your gowns from Roberta,

73
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,721
you're not dressed at all.

74
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:09,348
I see, nude if you don't, and nude if you do.

75
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,880
Grab my bag, will you?

76
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:27,787
Listen, ask your aunt Minnie if she knows
where we can find Lizzie Gatz, will you?

77
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,924
- Okay. I won't be long.
- All right.

78
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:33,799
You fellows pick yourselves
some comfortable easy chairs.

79
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,505
Hey!

80
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:26,946
Hey!

81
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:44,721
What am I supposed to do here
besides pray? Or can't you speak English?

82
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,913
Well, the old trap won't go.

83
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,498
Oh, what's the use? Just a dumb foreigner.

84
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,082
Oh, here, here, here.

85
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,770
You mustn't do that. You might be killed.

86
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:02,233
Oh, you speak English.

87
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:03,826
Ladislaw.

88
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,424
Oh, don't go away. I want to thank you.

89
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,702
Gee, you saved my life.
I'm ever so much obliged to you.

90
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,428
Oh, it's nothing at all.

91
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:28,660
Oh, I mean you're welcome, of course.

92
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:30,738
Do you know
where I can find Madam Roberta?

93
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,599
Yes. Come with me.

94
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,249
I didn't really mean that
about a dumb foreigner.

95
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:41,718
I forgive you.

96
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,322
Gee, that's swell.

97
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,466
You speak English beautifully.

98
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,800
Long ago I went to school in England.

99
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:49,938
Did you like it?

100
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:53,753
Oh, yes, I like the English.
And the Americans, too.

101
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:56,090
Gee, that's swell.

102
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,648
- I'm an American.
- Gee, that's...

103
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,847
I mean, I thought so.

104
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,301
Will you sit here, please?

105
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,379
Thank you.

106
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:31,541
But Minnie, you've made a mistake
in the year. You don't look a day over...

107
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,359
- Stephanie!
- How do you do, Lord Henry?

108
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,768
My dear.

109
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:39,188
I saw your cousin,
Prince Peter, last week in Rome.

110
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:41,844
He asked after you most solicitously.

111
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:44,914
I hope you told him I had gone to work
and he should do the same.

112
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,442
When all you titled aristocrats get jobs,

113
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,035
maybe Europe can settle down
to a few years' peace.

114
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,351
What is it, Stephanie?

115
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,029
There's a young gentleman outside
from America, waiting to see you.

116
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,986
Young gentleman from America?

117
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,418
John.

118
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,698
John!

119
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,620
Bring him in, Stephanie. Bring him in!

120
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,959
No, wait. Don't let him come
until I've powdered my nose.

121
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:07,126
Give me that compact, Henry.
Quick, quick, the compact!

122
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,890
How does he look?

123
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,645
He must look all right.

124
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,751
- Send him in, Stephanie.
- Yes, <i>madame.</i>

125
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:26,648
- This "John from America", who is he?
- My nephew.

126
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:30,258
I met him when I was there a few years
ago and took a great fancy to him.

127
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:31,672
He's quite famous in his way.

128
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,870
"All-American halfback" or
"three quarters back" or something.

129
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,596
- Really?
- Yes, you know, it's queer,

130
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,161
but when you
happen to like your relatives,

131
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,512
you like them better than other people.

132
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,229
- And if you hate them?
- Don't be obvious, Henry.

133
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,470
He was the only one of the whole tribe

134
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,156
who was polite to me
during my entire visit.

135
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:48,793
I like him, Henry.

136
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:52,402
He's like a big, affectionate,
blundering Newfoundland dog.

137
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,320
I'd like to see him grow up.

138
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,559
- How big is he now?
- Oh, about 6'2".

139
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:04,628
John, my dear, I'm so glad to see you.

140
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,836
It's swell to see you, Aunt Minnie.

141
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,968
- Here he is, Henry, here is my...
- Newfoundland dog?

142
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:13,682
I was telling him about you, John.

143
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:17,072
This is Lord Henry Delves,
a really grand person.

144
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:21,777
And this is Stephanie, my able assistant
whom I couldn't do without.

145
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:33,559
Well, young man, I think your aunt
should be very much complimented.

146
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,448
When I was in Paris at your age,

147
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,904
I didn't spend my time visiting my aunts.

148
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:40,729
Maybe you didn't
have any aunts like Aunt Minnie.

149
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,169
Very prettily said, John.

150
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,537
There aren't any like your aunt Minnie.

151
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:47,123
Well, goodbye, young man,
I'm off to catch a train,

152
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:48,951
but in a fortnight I'll be back.

153
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:51,768
And then, as I understand is the custom
in your country,

154
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:54,388
we'll go places and do something.

155
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,654
Goodbye, Minnie,
miss me just a little, won't you?

156
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,639
A very great deal, my dear.

157
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,952
Nice old duck, isn't he?

158
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,815
Oh, he isn't so terribly old.

159
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,850
Oh, I didn't mean in years, Aunt Minnie.
I meant I like him.

160
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,002
Do you?

161
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,433
Then you're a good judge of men.

162
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:23,989
Now, tell me about this young lady
you wrote me about. What was her name?

163
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,033
Sophie. She's given me the air.

164
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,153
What?

165
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:28,437
We had a row.

166
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:32,145
Oh, I thought she'd given you an heir.

167
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,069
She must be very stupid.

168
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,276
Oh, no, she's brilliant, really.

169
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,674
She speaks German and French
and everything.

170
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,391
Here's her picture.

171
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,563
It isn't very good of her, though.

172
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:46,993
She has her points.

173
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:51,184
I take it you're smarting
over this air she has given you.

174
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,749
Well, I'm still in love with her.

175
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,309
But she says I'm just a hick.

176
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,069
- A what?
- A farmer.

177
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,148
I've got hay in my hair.

178
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,295
I can't talk on any subject,

179
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,272
- I can't dance, I can't even dress myself.
- Ridiculous.

180
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,288
And I don't know anything
about women's clothes,

181
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:09,658
and when I have to order dinner
it's always meat, potatoes and pie.

182
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:13,071
Oh, she says that, does she?
Well, we'll show her she's wrong.

183
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,513
Gosh, John's been in there a long while.

184
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,815
Oh, why didn't we go to a hotel first?

185
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,192
Man, I'm hungry.

186
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:21,713
Come on, Mac, give him the call.

187
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:33,206
That's my gang.

188
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,768
- I came over with a band.
- A band of what?

189
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,323
An orchestra.
They're the Wabash Indianians,

190
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,242
hired for a job in Paris
and fired through a misunderstanding.

191
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,655
Now they're looking for an engagement.
They're a swell bunch.

192
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,530
They do that rather prettily.

193
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:54,806
<i>Madame,</i> Scharwenka wants to see you.

194
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,915
She doesn't like her tissue.
She doesn't like the model,

195
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:59,190
she doesn't like the fit,
and she doesn't like the price.

196
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:01,462
Oh, you mean she doesn't like it.

197
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,636
Yes, <i>madame,</i> what will you do about it?

198
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,265
Do about it? Let her go.

199
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,385
She'll come back.

200
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:09,491
She's the rage here right now,
and she's got the best figure in Europe,

201
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:12,083
but she has to have it dressed,
at least partly.

202
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,064
I'm afraid
she intends to start her screaming.

203
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,665
If she does, stick a pin in her.

204
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,712
Oh, I'd rather use an ice-pick.

205
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,800
This time I left the door open.

206
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,537
Who is she going to stick a pin into?

207
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:37,359
Scharwenka, a Polish countess who has
spurned the hollow mockeries of society

208
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,823
and gone in for nightclub entertaining.

209
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,211
You can see she's talented.

210
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:46,170
Do you allow her to make such a noise?

211
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,434
- lf she enjoys it, why not?
- Well, suppose the police come in?

212
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,418
Good, they can take her away.

213
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:54,289
But she must be insane
to make such a row.

214
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:56,467
Stephanie may not be safe with her.

215
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,416
- You feel inclined to stop her?
- Yes, I do.

216
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:02,227
No, no, no, no, no!

217
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:03,825
You are not the only couturier in Paris!

218
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,451
I am a good advertising
for the house that dresses me!

219
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,563
I do not know why
I come to Roberta anyway!

220
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,642
You... Will you quit pushing me?

221
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,238
I... I beg your pardon.

222
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,215
You can't behave like that, you know.

223
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,167
You big beautiful American!

224
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:38,929
You are very strong.

225
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,919
You do not understand.
These Latin races must be shouted at.

226
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,952
I'm not a Latin
and shouting doesn't impress me.

227
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,858
Hey.

228
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,937
I shall never set foot in this place again.

229
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,791
You do not know
how they have treated me.

230
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,633
This horrible old woman here.
The greedy old <i>diable.</i>

231
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,192
Easy, she's my aunt.

232
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,295
Oh, well, I was not blaming it on her.

233
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,307
She is really a genius,

234
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,535
but that little shrew who
runs the business. That Stephanie...

235
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,228
But Stephanie is swell.

236
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:17,361
What, you are her lover?

237
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,123
I've never seen such a place.

238
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,161
No one thinks of anything
but being somebody's lover.

239
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,430
Well, have you never thought of it?

240
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,293
What happened?

241
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,066
Your nephew has done
most admirably, <i>madame.</i>

242
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,847
What did he do? Where is Scharwenka?

243
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,125
On his neck.

244
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,810
Oh, I see.

245
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,507
Does he like it?

246
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,952
Not particularly.

247
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,609
But I don't hear him shouting for help.

248
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,880
There's that cuckoo band again.

249
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,641
Scharwenka!

250
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,730
Do you think she'd do something
for my nephew if he asked her?

251
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,810
I don't think he'll even have to ask her.

252
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,217
No, no, no.
I mean something for this band of his.

253
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:05,493
She could get them an engagement

254
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:08,563
and if they're John's friends,
they're a swell band.

255
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,195
I must show you Paris,

256
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,465
and I want you to love it.

257
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,415
- I've seen the Eiffel Tower.
- Oh, no.

258
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,240
My dear Countess. I understand there are
a few things wrong with the gown.

259
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:22,071
You shall have a new model,
at a new price.

260
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,393
Oh, there's nothing wrong with the gown.
I'll be back tomorrow for another fit.

261
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:29,815
May I present my nephew, John?

262
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,752
Oh, he presented himself
most charmingly.

263
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:36,725
My nephew is paying me a visit
en route to London,

264
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:40,788
he has a band which is playing at a private
party for the Duke of Wattingham.

265
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:43,924
I should like to hear
your orchestra sometime.

266
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:46,480
Now. There's no time like now.

267
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,699
Now, hang on to your hat.

268
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,325
Hey, fellows!

269
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,170
Strike it up. It's a job.

270
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,647
Come on, boys, let's give them
the <i>Let's Begin</i> number.

271
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,644
- Come on, get over here.
- Come on, man, get over there.

272
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,425
All right, boys, let's swing it.

273
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,912
<i>Now that you've got me going</i>
<i>what you gonna do?</i>

274
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,788
<i>Is it up to me or is it up to you?</i>

275
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:47,797
<i>What kind a game is this we've begun?</i>

276
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:50,610
<i>Was it done just for fun?</i>

277
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,622
<i>Don't forget since we've met</i>

278
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,753
<i>There's no reason for vain regret. Oh</i>

279
00:19:56,858 --> 00:20:01,048
<i>Is this to be a case of "fall</i>
<i>and glad I fell, kiss and never tell</i>

280
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,640
<i>"Folly and farewell?"</i>

281
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,234
<i>Which is going to be "might have been</i>

282
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:08,655
<i>"Lose or win? Let's begin"</i>

283
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,632
<i>I'm here to tell you, let's begin</i>

284
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:21,264
<i>Now that you've got me going</i>
<i>what you gonna do?</i>

285
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:24,186
<i>Is it up to me, or is it up to you?</i>

286
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,932
<i>What kind of game is this we've begun</i>

287
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,656
<i>Was it done just for fun?</i>

288
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,722
<i>- No</i>
<i>- Realize that I'm wise</i>

289
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:36,023
<i>And please stop rolling</i>
<i>those big blue eyes</i>

290
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,644
<i>Is this to be a case of "Fall and glad I fell</i>

291
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,940
<i>"Kiss and never tell, folly and farewell?"</i>

292
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,065
<i>Which is going to be</i>
<i>"might have been"let's begin</i>

293
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,014
<i>Let's begin</i>

294
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,229
- I think I saw...
- Huck, it looks like you're all set.

295
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,403
- You remember the girl I told you about?
- She likes the band.

296
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:14,329
Well, I was out there dancing.
I looked up and I saw...

297
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:15,376
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

298
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,320
- You're going in to meet a Polish countess.
- I don't want to meet any countess.

299
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,663
- But she can give the band a job.
- I don't care what she can...

300
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:22,585
- Who, who can? She can?
- Yeah!

301
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,985
- Well, that's different.
- No cracks, now.

302
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,418
I think they're very good.

303
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,120
Aunt Minnie,
this is my friend Huck Haines.

304
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,201
My nephew has told me about you.

305
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,950
Countess, may I present
<i>Monsieur</i> Huck Haines?

306
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,865
Countess?

307
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,385
- Well, if it isn't...
- Huck is for Huckleberry, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

308
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,067
Yes,

309
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,729
and a couple of <i>n'est-ce pas.</i>

310
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,458
Mr. Haines is the piccolo player
I was telling you about.

311
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,825
Ah! Piccolo player. How <i>charmant.</i>

312
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:03,731
No, no, no, <i>madame. Pas de piccolo.</i>

313
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:06,578
I play what you call a filthy piano.

314
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:11,540
May I present myself,
Le Marquis de Indiana.

315
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,965
Ah, Indiana,

316
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,778
a province in the south of Greece, eh?

317
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:19,769
No, no, no, <i>Madame la Comtesse.</i>

318
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:21,910
Just west of Pittsburgh, babe.

319
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:23,407
Hey, ix-nay acking-cray.

320
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:27,768
These Americans are
what you call fresh guys.

321
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,778
No, no, no. Refreshing.

322
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:35,416
<i>Oh, mais oui.</i> Refreshing.
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

323
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:37,847
It is nothing, toots.

324
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:43,864
I should like to talk to this refreshing,

325
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,760
filthy piano, alone.

326
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:49,971
Oh, certainly, certainly.

327
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,975
Is he a lunatic?

328
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:57,204
Oh, no, that's merely his way
of making her feel at home.

329
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:58,418
Oh!

330
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:02,022
Now, listen here, Huck Haines...

331
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,035
No, no, no, no. What a charming surprise.

332
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,883
This little <i>tete-a-tete</i> with you, alone.

333
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,159
Huck, please.

334
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:12,901
What's the racket, Liz?
Did you marry the title or just lift it?

335
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:15,243
Be a pal, will you, Huck?
It's just a stage name.

336
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,481
You've got to have a title
to croon over here.

337
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,365
I know. Gee, Lizzie, you look grand.

338
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:24,236
Look, I promise to get you a job
if you won't tell on me.

339
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,821
- Okay, Liz.
- And it's not Liz.

340
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:30,090
I'm sorry, Princess? Baroness?
Oh, what is it?

341
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,945
You may call me Tanka.

342
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,961
- Tanka.
- You're welcome.

343
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,639
It's swell seeing you again, Tanka.

344
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,203
But what about that job for the boys?

345
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:44,395
<i>Madame</i> Roberta is having tea
in her sitting room,

346
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:47,112
and she would like you to join her,
if you'd care to.

347
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:48,741
Oh, I am so sorry.

348
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:52,588
But you will tell <i>Madame</i> Roberta
that I have an engagement

349
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:55,206
with the Marquis de Indiana?

350
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,960
Yes, Countess.

351
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,434
Well, now, I guess
I've got you to add to my worries.

352
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,714
It's time for your nap.

353
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:11,913
Stephanie, my child,
I'm adding to your many duties.

354
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,924
We're going to make John over.

355
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,739
I think he's very nice as he is.

356
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:20,010
A good tailor never hurt a man,
no matter how nice he is.

357
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:30,731
That's Ladislaw.

358
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,831
The doctor makes me
take a nap every afternoon

359
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:37,061
and Stephanie thinks
that music helps me go to sleep.

360
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,632
Ladislaw is our doorman and a prince.

361
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:45,544
A prince, your doorman?

362
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,907
A Russian prince.

363
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:50,822
If there were such a thing as a restoration,

364
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,511
Ladislaw would be in line for the throne.

365
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:07,236
Ladislaw, I hope
you're in good finger today.

366
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,315
- This is my nephew, Mr. Kent.
- Glad to know you.

367
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:12,707
Are you comfortable?

368
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,688
I want a drink of water.

369
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,965
Don't stand there, Ladislaw.
Play something. Play something.

370
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,523
You'll wake her.

371
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,245
You're darn right, you will.

372
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:34,645
<i>I'll be hard to handle</i>

373
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,336
<i>I promise you that</i>

374
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,813
<i>and if you complain here's</i>
<i>one little Jane that will leave you flat</i>

375
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:47,122
<i>I'll be hard to handle</i>
<i>What else can I be?</i>

376
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,399
<i>Just ask my dad</i>
<i>the trouble he had controlling me</i>

377
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:56,404
<i>I have faults, to be specific</i>

378
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:59,059
<i>In a temper, oh I'm terrific</i>

379
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:02,260
<i>I throw chairs and tables and I never miss</i>

380
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:06,960
<i>Oh, I'm as cold as any shellfish</i>

381
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,684
<i>I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish</i>

382
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:12,847
<i>Think it over, my warning is this</i>

383
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:19,093
<i>I'll be hard to handle, I'm making it plain</i>

384
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:24,340
<i>now just be a dear and scram out of here</i>
<i>cause I'm gonna raise Cain</i>

385
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,949
<i>I'm as cold as any shellfish</i>
<i>I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish</i>

386
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:43,542
<i>Think it over my warning is</i>

387
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,505
<i>If you want me sweet and hot</i>
<i>Oh, I'll be hard to handle</i>

388
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,942
<i>I'm making it plain</i>

389
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,462
<i>Now just be a dear and scram out of here</i>

390
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,177
Nice work, Countess, nice work.

391
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:04,302
Oh, well.

392
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:05,944
That was pretty good, boys

393
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,206
but listen, Candy, give me a better pick-up
after that second break, will you?

394
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,800
Okay. Okay, boss.

395
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:20,309
You know, this reminds me of the old days
when we used to give shows in your barn.

396
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:23,574
Yeah, we used to fight over
who handled the gate receipts.

397
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,642
You remember the valentine I sent you?

398
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:29,463
The one with the arrow piercing the heart
and dripping blood?

399
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,392
Oh, yes, I remember that. I think that's
the only valentine I ever received.

400
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,895
It's the only one I ever sent.

401
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,824
Those were the happy days, weren't they?

402
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,897
Do you know, I think I was
in love with you then, Huck.

403
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,206
- I know you were.
- You.

404
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,627
Me. And what's more,
I was madly in love with you.

405
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,058
- Oh, we were funny kids, weren't we?
- Oh, I suppose so.

406
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,853
Remember that beauty contest I won?

407
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:55,572
- Oh, you got a trip to Kansas City.
- Yeah, well you won it for me.

408
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:58,520
How did you get all those men
from the overall factory to vote for me?

409
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:01,750
That was easy.
I showed them a picture of Lillian Russell.

410
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,306
Lillian Russell?
What was the matter with my picture?

411
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:05,490
Well, if you must know,

412
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:08,245
we got a lot of votes from the farmers
with a picture of a prize heifer.

413
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:09,752
Oh, you.

414
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,327
He is coming now.

415
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:18,259
Listen, Huck, give it to him
and make it sweet and hot.

416
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,621
Come on, boys, the big boss is coming.
Let's jam it.

417
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:35,411
What's that?

418
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:38,001
You want an orchestra.
I have got one for you.

419
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:41,008
You are tearing your hair
to get good music, I bring it to you.

420
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,487
I take them away
from the Duke of Wattingham,

421
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:43,862
just to give it to you.

422
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,424
You give it to me?

423
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,151
How much does it cost?

424
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,389
What does it matter? Listen to them.

425
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,548
They are good.

426
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:58,423
They are very good.

427
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,815
They are hired.

428
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,431
I am glad
I didn't take those white-faced Indians.

429
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:07,286
I think maybe sometimes I am wrong.

430
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:08,792
But this orchestra

431
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:11,567
is superb.

432
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,127
And who did it for you?

433
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:15,858
Little Tanka.

434
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,341
The palefaces!

435
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:33,586
Who did it?

436
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:38,321
Little Tanka do it for me.

437
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:39,992
It's a frame-down.

438
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,807
That's what it is, a frame-down!

439
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,039
- Well, up or down, do we stick?
- Stick?

440
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:47,667
You're right,
you stick a knife upon my back.

441
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:50,804
- Voyda, what is wrong with them?
- What is wrong for them?

442
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:53,807
I cable for Wabash Indians

443
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:57,776
and what do I get? Indianians!

444
00:35:58,169 --> 00:35:59,925
Get out! No job!

445
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,449
- I do not get it.
- Neither did we.

446
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:05,139
Very well, let them go!
Then I go with them!

447
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,442
Oh, yes? Where you going to?

448
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,081
Now, what was the name of that club
that made you the offer yesterday?

449
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:14,389
Oh, oh, the Club Antoine.
Oh, I could go there today.

450
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:17,491
They offered me a six-month contract
and I could take the band with me.

451
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,968
You go, you go.

452
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:21,104
You are not bluffing with Voyda.

453
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,932
Indians.

454
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:24,113
Now, listen, Mr. Voyda.

455
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:26,225
I think you're making a big mistake
by letting the Countess

456
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:28,240
go to the Café Arman. I mean Antoine.

457
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,982
I think you ought to try
and make her stay here, if possible.

458
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,807
After all, Mr. Voyda,
your money is just as good as no money.

459
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:36,628
I mean, anybody's money.

460
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,124
That Café Antoine.

461
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:42,801
I hold you to your contract with me.

462
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,847
I have your cable accepting it.

463
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:49,492
As for you, I can pay you as much money
as Antoine can pay you.

464
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:50,901
Everything is fixed!

465
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:52,856
I go and telephone my lawyer!

466
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:56,631
Boys, we're working.

467
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,453
Hurray!

468
00:36:58,553 --> 00:36:59,982
<i>Vive la France!</i>

469
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,749
<i>Vive la</i> Russia, you mean.

470
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:10,615
Hello, Stephanie.

471
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:13,046
Stephanie, how's the Newfoundland pup?

472
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:16,376
- The all-American nephew?
- You won't recognize him.

473
00:37:16,474 --> 00:37:19,288
Since you've been gone, Stephanie
has made a man of the world of him.

474
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:20,728
He's positively arresting.

475
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:23,887
You ought to see him, Lord Henry.

476
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,961
Your tailor has surpassed himself.
He looks wonderful.

477
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:29,618
But then I think
he has the knack of wearing clothes.

478
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,544
Not every man has, you know.

479
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,289
And he has a positive flair for languages.

480
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,138
The way he's taken hold of French
is amazing.

481
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:40,886
You should have heard him
tell a taxi driver where to go last night.

482
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,343
And Stephanie and I
have given him a few pointers

483
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,028
it would take most men
a lifetime to acquire.

484
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:49,455
What a start for a young fellow.

485
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,446
<i>Au revoir,</i> my dear.

486
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:54,392
You never looked lovelier in your life
than you do this minute.

487
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:55,701
Until tomorrow.

488
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,290
It's always nice to know
I shall see you tomorrow, Henry.

489
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,815
You've been saying
very pleasant things to me, lately, Minnie.

490
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,857
- Not really ill, I hope?
- No.

491
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:06,162
- Stephanie.
- Lord Henry.

492
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:37,142
- Where is John?
- Taking his French lesson.

493
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,898
Haven't you heard them?

494
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:40,337
No.

495
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,214
<i>La</i> winner!

496
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:39,121
Come on, boys, come in.

497
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:45,614
- So long, prof.
- So long, prof.

498
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:55,118
Can I get you something?

499
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,403
No, thank you.

500
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,773
Not even a drink of water?

501
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,688
No.

502
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:03,475
Sing, please.

503
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:17,879

- Sophie, Sophie.
- What's the matter?

531
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:46,220
Here's an article about John.

532
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:47,438
He's turned dressmaker.

533
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:49,651
Can you bear it?

534
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:52,692
lmagine John Kent in a smart dress shop?

535
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:56,208
He wouldn't know a smart dress
from last year's awning.

536
00:42:56,277 --> 00:43:00,238
Well, the first place I'll make a beeline for
in Paris is going to be Roberta's.

537
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,487
It's all right, Fernande.

538
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:21,193
I was just saying goodbye to
a room in which I've been very happy.

539
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:24,236
But you are not
leaving Roberta's, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

540
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:29,231
Goodbye, Fernande.

541
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:07,084
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur</i> Fullback.

542
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:08,302
I wish to place an order.

543
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:10,958
Would you mind hemstitching
two dozen touchdowns for me?

544
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:12,076
Oh, lay off.

545
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,702
Would run up for me two field goals
and a bias,

546
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:16,593
with the score tied in the back?

547
00:44:16,693 --> 00:44:18,155
Kind of a halfback.

548
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,802
I don't get sore often, but I will in a minute
if you two don't shut up.

549
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,797
Do you plan
fitting the ladies yourself, John?

550
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:30,353
What a picture. Tape measure around
the neck and pin-cushion on the hip.

551
00:44:30,453 --> 00:44:31,598
I ought to spank the two of you.

552
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,491
Now, don't lose
your sense of humor, Johnny.

553
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,142
Why don't you let a guy alone
when he's trying to figure things out?

554
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:38,033
She just wants to know
what you're going to do.

555
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,955
- That's all.
- I'm going home.

556
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:43,474
- But you can't. You're Mr. Roberta.
- I'm not. Stephanie is.

557
00:44:43,573 --> 00:44:46,769
I mean, well, Aunt Minnie left no will,
so her property comes to me.

558
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:49,586
But she always said
the shop was to be Stephanie's.

559
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,408
- Stephanie's going...
- Yes.

560
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:57,716
We are astonished.

561
00:44:57,877 --> 00:44:59,284
Well, I'm not astonished.

562
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:01,771
You mean you're going to give
the whole shop to Stephanie?

563
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:04,943
Yes, right away. That's what Aunt Minnie
wanted and that's what I want.

564
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,737
You're giving it to her without any...

565
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:09,837
strings?

566
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,600
What do you mean, "strings"?

567
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:13,524
Oh, she just means

568
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,365
strings.

569
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:22,096
Well, you make yourselves comfortable.
I've got to find Stephanie.

570
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,550
I was looking for you.

571
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:31,728
- Well, hello.
- No, no, no.

572
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:35,508
Can you tell me why no will can be found?

573
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:38,474
- Well, because there isn't any.
- Why haven't you been able to find it?

574
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,167
- It must have been destroyed.
- So you admit it?

575
00:45:41,397 --> 00:45:42,510
Admit what?

576
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:45,712
For years Stephanie has worked
to build this business.

577
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,885
It was hers as much as Roberta's.

578
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:50,190
<i>Madame</i> could not destroy that will.

579
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:53,355
- Are you trying to say I did?
- I will not say yes or not.

580
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:56,112
But it looks queer, very queer.

581
00:45:56,308 --> 00:45:58,348
You... Why, you Russian prince!

582
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:00,884
I'm still boss of this outfit,
and you're fired!

583
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:03,731
No, no, I am not fired. I am perfectly cool.

584
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:05,422
I mean you're dismissed.

585
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,139
You think you can get rid of me so easy!

586
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:10,514
- Get out!
- You think no one will protect Stephanie.

587
00:46:10,612 --> 00:46:13,231
- Stephanie doesn't need your protection.
- While Stephanie stays here

588
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:15,242
and remains here, I will protect her.

589
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:20,787
Aren't you ashamed to be quarreling
like two silly little boys?

590
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:24,106
Please go, Lad, I'll meet you downstairs.

591
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:31,119
The Russian nobility burns me up anyway.

592
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,393
They're always sticking their noses
in other people's business.

593
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:35,347
- You don't like the Russian nobility?
- No.

594
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:36,852
I don't like his hanging around you.

595
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,543
I was going to give you the shop anyway.

596
00:46:38,644 --> 00:46:42,125
Oh, you are very magnanimous,
giving me something I don't want.

597
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:43,951
- You don't want it?
- No.

598
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:45,866
And who are you to give me gifts?

599
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:48,940
- Wait a minute, you mustn't act like this.
- I'll act the way I choose.

600
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:50,768
It's your shop, you run it.

601
00:46:50,837 --> 00:46:51,916
Goodbye.

602
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:53,898
Hey, wait a minute, Stephanie.

603
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:56,457
I'm sorry, but I can't be a dressmaker.

604
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:58,834
I couldn't half carry on the business.

605
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:03,723
- Maybe you could carry it on half.
- How do you mean?

606
00:47:04,757 --> 00:47:06,513
Well, I mean

607
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:10,225
- maybe we could be partners.
- No, no.

608
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:11,917
You like it, you take it, Stephanie.

609
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:13,516
I've got a football team to coach.

610
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:16,753
No, I wouldn't accept anything
except in partnership.

611
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:18,347
Not on your life. That's out.

612
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:21,420
- All right, then I'm out.
- Oh, wait a minute.

613
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:24,940
<i>Pardon, mademoiselle,</i>
may I finish this now?

614
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:26,354
Oh, yes, yes.

615
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:29,011
Oh, wait a minute.

616
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:31,309
May she?

617
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:35,086
I mean, yes. Certainly, my good woman.

618
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:40,684
You'll make a very nice partner.

619
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:44,783
It isn't generally known that <i>Madame</i>
has been letting me do all the designing.

620
00:47:44,884 --> 00:47:47,634
So we'll have to startle them
with daring styles.

621
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,385
- Partners.
- Partners.

622
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:54,702
Oh, John, look. We've had a brainstorm.

623
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,350
Instead of you going home, why don't
you and Stephanie become partners?

624
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,039
Huck, you're brilliant.

625
00:48:05,204 --> 00:48:06,960
What do you say, Stephanie?

626
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:10,996
No, not on your life. That's out.

627
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:13,556
You'll make a very nice partner.

628
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:17,646
It isn't generally known that <i>Madame</i>
has been letting me do the designing.

629
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:22,194
We'll have to startle them
with daring styles.

630
00:48:24,244 --> 00:48:26,000
- Partners.
- Partners.

631
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:30,002
Countess, you shall be our first customer.

632
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:38,766
Yvonne.

633
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:43,276
This we call <i>le Petit Trianon.</i>

634
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:45,745
If you don't like any of these,
say so, won't you?

635
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:47,601
Gee, I think they're swell.

636
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:53,874
And this is <i>le train bleu.</i>

637
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:58,386
Oh, that one's a honey.
That's the one I'd take.

638
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:03,731
Do your ecstasies
refer to the gown or the girl?

639
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:07,342
Oh, I hadn't noticed the girl,
but now that you mention her,

640
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,851
- I'd take...
- Yes?

641
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,251
The gown. Less upkeep.

642
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,532
This is called <i>la sirene noire.</i>

643
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,423
Does not she look wonderful in that?

644
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,411
Marvelous.

645
00:49:27,893 --> 00:49:29,486
Just like a peeled eel.

646
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:37,709
I don't like that one.

647
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:39,629
Liane...

648
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:42,189
Albert.

649
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:44,945
Maybe we could do something about it.

650
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:49,835
Albert, do you suppose
we could raise this back a little?

651
00:49:49,908 --> 00:49:52,429
If you don't mind, I'd like that dress out.

652
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:55,091
- As bad as that, huh?
- Worse.

653
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:57,840
All right, then it's out.

654
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,563
Take it away, Albert.

655
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,885
This is <i>le ciel gris.</i>

656
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:21,899
That is the one I will take.

657
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:26,060
And tall, handsome gentlemen
with large bank accounts

658
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:28,586
will be asking for my telephone number.

659
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:31,666
And getting it.

660
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:35,626
And won't they be surprised
when I answer?

661
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:42,127
Well, so long.
Tell the Countess I'll be waiting for her.

662
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,276
Where?

663
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,484
Oh, either on the right side
of the Left Bank,

664
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,182
or the left side of the right bank.

665
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:51,347
- I think you're swell not to be angry.
- Angry?

666
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:55,793
I hope we're good enough friends
for you to express an opinion.

667
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:59,188
And I hope we're good enough friends
for you to dine with me tonight.

668
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:01,227
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Tomorrow night.

669
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:03,152
I'm very sorry.

670
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:06,957
I'll tell you, the night
Huck opens at the Café Russe.

671
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:09,740
All right.

672
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:11,788
Gee, that'll be swell.

673
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:18,236
Yes.

674
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,829
I've always been interested
in newspaper work.

675
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:22,242
Have you anything more to say?

676
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:23,683
I think he's said enough.

677
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,090
I haven't any more paper.

678
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:27,578
Oh, we have reams and reams of it here.

679
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:28,860
Oh, thanks.

680
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:32,156
A football player
owning a dress shop is news, isn't it?

681
00:51:32,228 --> 00:51:33,275
Good news.

682
00:51:33,764 --> 00:51:35,520
Well, that's what I say,
almost too good to be true,

683
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:37,050
and that's why
we want you to have it first.

684
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:40,702
So that you can write it in your own sweet
charming way that you've made famous,

685
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:41,982
Miss...

686
00:51:42,948 --> 00:51:46,942
We want you to introduce it
in your own inimitable style, Miss...

687
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,607
- Jones.
- Jones.

688
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:50,077
Jones.

689
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,866
But I'm still sore about all those
silly jokes they're printing about me.

690
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,371
Yes, but they print it.

691
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:57,436
Every time they make a joke,
a million francs pour in.

692
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,862
It's a pretty expensive joke
on somebody else, I think.

693
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:04,316
- Now, when Mr. Kent designs clothes...
- When I what?

694
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,527
Does Mr. Kent design clothes, too?

695
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,145
- No.
- Oh, modesty, modesty.

696
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:14,237
Mr. Kent's idea is to introduce
the football motif into dress designing.

697
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:18,137
The outdoor flavor will make
the evening clothes look healthier.

698
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:21,474
Oh, wait till you see our
end-around-end evening creation.

699
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,492
You know, the one
with the dash-off center.

700
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,313
Has Mr. Kent any more ideas?

701
00:52:25,413 --> 00:52:27,267
- No.
- Oh, yes, thousands and thousands.

702
00:52:27,364 --> 00:52:30,528
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kent's
main idea is to design women's dresses

703
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,003
the way men think they should be.

704
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,727
And how do you men
think they should be?

705
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:34,844
Not so naked.

706
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:39,008
Well, well, he means that
if clothes are to clothe, they should clothe.

707
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:43,033
It's more stimulating
to the imagination, if clothes clothe.

708
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:45,246
That's very unique.

709
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:46,364
Yes.

710
00:52:46,437 --> 00:52:50,430
And pockets in all dresses,
especially in the evening ones,

711
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:52,448
so the women can pack their own junk.

712
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:54,753
The bulging pockets of the male
will disappear forever.

713
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:57,089
Women will not have to
depend upon their male escorts.

714
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:58,466
They'll be much more independent.

715
00:52:58,565 --> 00:53:00,986
As a matter of fact... As a matter of fact,

716
00:53:01,797 --> 00:53:05,058
pockets will make
the female more female.

717
00:53:05,156 --> 00:53:06,236
Very nice.

718
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,730
And gloves attached to the dress,

719
00:53:08,836 --> 00:53:09,916
so they won't get lost.

720
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:12,672
They'll be worn on a jeweled...
Around the neck.

721
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,820
Brilliant!

722
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,555
Well, I really must be going now.

723
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,291
- Oh, that's too bad.
- That's fine.

724
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:30,308
- Have you had enough?
- Yes, I think I have quite enough.

725
00:53:30,404 --> 00:53:33,186
- Now tell me, what paper will this be in?
- Paper?

726
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,422
Why, I'm Miss Jones. I'm syndicated.

727
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:38,110
When you talk to me,
you're telling the world.

728
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:42,083
How was I, toots?

729
00:53:44,836 --> 00:53:46,495
Pardon, <i>monsieur,</i> a lady to see you.

730
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:48,931
- Another newspaper woman?
- An American, I think.

731
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:50,241
A Miss Teale.

732
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,547
Sophie! Send her in, please.

733
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:54,462
Huck, she's here.

734
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:57,945
That's great, and just when
you were getting along so swell.

735
00:53:58,724 --> 00:54:00,066
You don't appreciate her.

736
00:54:00,164 --> 00:54:02,269
I know she seems
a little hard and sophisticated.

737
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,161
But underneath she's a pearl.

738
00:54:04,228 --> 00:54:05,722
And a pearl, so I am told,

739
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:08,000
is the result
of a chronic irritation on an oyster.

740
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:09,890
What do you know
about anything, anyway?

741
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:13,186
- I know about everything, every way.
- Then you must know Sophie's swell.

742
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:17,027
John, every day you act worse,
but today you're acting like tomorrow.

743
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:21,635
- Hello, John.
- Sophie!

744
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:23,871
You're awfully hard to see
since you became a couturier.

745
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,914
Not for you, Sophie.
When did you arrive in Paris?

746
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:27,035
This morning.

747
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:28,537
How long are you going to stay?

748
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,270
Oh, hello, Huckleberry.

749
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:31,581
Hello, Soph.

750
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:33,818
Mother and I
are going to Switzerland on Saturday.

751
00:54:33,924 --> 00:54:36,029
Goodbye, John. I'll see you Sunday.

752
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,826
Don't mind him, he's only clowning.

753
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:42,078
Thank you, dear.

754
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:45,662
Well, so you're here now.

755
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:46,779
Yes.

756
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:50,877
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- Sophie, I've tried to forget you.

757
00:54:51,237 --> 00:54:52,666
And have you, John?

758
00:54:54,148 --> 00:54:56,515
I thought I had,

759
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:58,718
but now I know I haven't.

760
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:03,203
Gee, you're swell.

761
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:07,324
John, you have a line
that just sweeps a girl right off her feet.

762
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:08,858
Yeah, sure.

763
00:55:09,508 --> 00:55:11,232
When are you going to show me Paris?

764
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:14,049
You'd be bored seeing Paris
with a small-town hick like me,

765
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:16,156
who only knows how to order
meat and potatoes and pie.

766
00:55:16,228 --> 00:55:18,781
Oh, please forget I ever said those things.

767
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,501
I only said them
because you were going away.

768
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:23,997
I didn't want you to go.

769
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:27,650
- I loved you so much.
- It was a funny way to love me.

770
00:55:27,717 --> 00:55:31,743
But, John, darling,
don't you ever say things you don't mean?

771
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:32,859
No.

772
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:43,103
Well, maybe I do.
Don't cry, Sophie, I don't like it.

773
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:48,953
I can't help it. I'm so unhappy.

774
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:53,277
I came all the way to Paris just to see you.

775
00:55:55,044 --> 00:55:58,306
- Only to find you don't love me anymore.
- But I do, Sophie, honest I do.

776
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:01,985
Oh, John.

777
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:10,114
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, come in, Stephanie.

778
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:14,430
May I present Miss Sophie Teale?

779
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:16,514
My partner Stephanie.

780
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:18,618
How do you do?

781
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:21,663
When I come in for a new gown,
may I ask for you?

782
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:23,520
Oh, that'll be swell.

783
00:56:24,613 --> 00:56:26,467
Well, I'll run along.
I know how busy you are.

784
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:29,913
- No, I'll see you to the door.
- No. No. Business before pleasure.

785
00:56:29,988 --> 00:56:33,021
But I'll save Wednesday for you.
Lunch and dinner and the evening.

786
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:35,099
That's fine. It's a date.

787
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:38,843
Goodbye, miss.

788
00:56:51,652 --> 00:56:54,913
- Stephanie, I want to...
- Why, when you have time,

789
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:59,202
- I wish you'd look over these materials.
- But I want to tell you about Sophie.

790
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:03,323
- She's very lovely.
- Yes, that is... I mean she...

791
00:57:05,348 --> 00:57:08,479
Holy smokes,
haven't we a date for next Wednesday?

792
00:57:08,548 --> 00:57:11,581
Oh, have we? I'm sure we haven't.

793
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:28,249
This we call <i>le lys doré.</i>

794
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:37,113
If I weren't going out with Johnny,
I wouldn't be so particular.

795
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:40,758
But I'm sure he'll want me to have
something that expresses my personality.

796
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,926
Suppose we have Johnny come in
and help you select something.

797
00:57:43,996 --> 00:57:46,615
He knows so much more
about your personality than I do.

798
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:49,051
Oh, no. No, please. I want to surprise him.

799
00:57:49,116 --> 00:57:53,010
You know, he's really just a little boy
in spite of his man-of-the-world exterior.

800
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:56,696
Yes, I suspected that.
I'll see what else I can get for you.

801
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,370
- Oh, hello, Huck.
- Hello.

802
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:07,803
If you're looking for Johnny,
he's in conference with his lawyer.

803
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,362
Well, then,
maybe you'll have lunch with me.

804
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:10,930
- Are you busy?
- Very.

805
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:14,517
I'm trying to find something to suit
the personality of Miss Sophie Teale.

806
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,115
Then you are busy.

807
00:58:16,252 --> 00:58:17,397
Liane.

808
00:58:18,396 --> 00:58:19,890
Excuse me, won't you?

809
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,964
Liane, that dress was discarded.
Why do you have it on?

810
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:25,108
Albert wanted to make a new top for it.

811
00:58:25,212 --> 00:58:27,481
Oh, all right. Fine.

812
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,890
- Is Miss Teale's personality in there?
- Yes, right in there.

813
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:35,314
I'll go and torment her a while.

814
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:44,058
Is that beautiful.
And just made for you, Soph.

815
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:46,874
- Oh, hello. Do you really think it suits me?
- Oh, certainly.

816
00:58:46,972 --> 00:58:50,070
A little longer sleeves,
it would make an ideal straitjacket.

817
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:51,285
Some day, by sheer accident,

818
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:52,851
you're going to say
something funny, Huck.

819
00:58:52,924 --> 00:58:55,258
Oh, Soph, now don't be like that.

820
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,396
Do you mind if I sit here
and help you pick out a gown?

821
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,631
No, I'm trying to find something
that John will like on me.

822
00:59:00,732 --> 00:59:02,325
Something startling.

823
00:59:02,396 --> 00:59:04,949
John loves to be startled by girls' dresses.

824
00:59:05,884 --> 00:59:08,634
Here is a gown
that might please you, Miss Teale.

825
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:24,594
This gown has both chic
and good breeding.

826
00:59:24,796 --> 00:59:28,953
I'm more interested in its chic.
I can supply the breeding myself.

827
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:37,106
I know the dress.
Look, Stephanie, you know that one that...

828
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:41,201
It sort of begins and then in the...

829
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,616
You know, the black one.

830
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:45,586
- The black one?
- Yes, the one you put aside.

831
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:47,825
Oh, no. No, I can't.

832
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,721
Oh, yes, you can, Stephanie.
Show it to Miss Teale.

833
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,794
- I know she'd like it.
- Oh, no, Mr. Kent wouldn't...

834
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,966
I'm quite sure Mr. Kent would want
me to see any model you have.

835
00:59:55,036 --> 00:59:57,491
Please have it shown
as quickly as possible.

836
00:59:57,564 --> 01:00:00,760
That's it, Stephanie, please have it shown
as quickly as possible.

837
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,348
Just because it's been set aside
for a marquise,

838
01:00:03,452 --> 01:00:05,973
doesn't mean that it can't be shown.

839
01:00:07,676 --> 01:00:12,149
Very well. Anna, have Liane model
<i>la sirene noire</i> at once, please.

840
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:17,337
Oh, thank you, Huck.
Now we're getting someplace.

841
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:23,985
- She'll probably like that dress.
- She's going to like it.

842
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:25,586
When John sees her in it, oh boy,

843
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:27,634
he's gonna make her walk home,
ocean and all.

844
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,936
- No, he won't. He's in love with her.
- He only thinks he is.

845
01:00:35,643 --> 01:00:37,749
If he were, would you mind?

846
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,550
I am minding, Huck. Terribly.

847
01:00:46,524 --> 01:00:48,280
Can't you hurry that model?

848
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:50,874
Yes. Yes, Miss Teale.

849
01:01:00,316 --> 01:01:03,130
Well, now that's the smartest thing
you've shown me. I like it.

850
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:06,294
It's been discarded.
It wasn't put aside for anyone.

851
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,211
- Huck was mistaken about that.
- Oh, I see.

852
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:11,985
Well, I think I'll have it just the same.

853
01:01:13,052 --> 01:01:14,361
What shall I do?

854
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:16,599
You're doing fine.

855
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:19,477
- How much is it?
- It's only 1,000 francs.

856
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,271
It's hardly worthy of you.

857
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:26,867
I'm afraid she's right, Sophie.
You know it may not be so becoming.

858
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,976
You're not a very good saleslady.

859
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:38,513
Maybe I'm wrong, Miss Teale.
That dress might suit you very well.

860
01:01:40,923 --> 01:01:42,963
This is the bit of international diplomacy

861
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:46,811
I shall boast about to my grandchildren,
the nasty little demons.

862
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,648
I'll take the dress.
But I want to try it on first.

863
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:53,812
The more I think of it, the more I am sure

864
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,786
the dress will bring out
something elegantly alluring in you.

865
01:01:57,372 --> 01:01:59,347
Well, I always know the moment
I see a dress

866
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,361
whether it'll be right for me or not.

867
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,674
I'll take this drink and then the food.

868
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:37,397
- Gee, I'm starved.
- Me, too.

869
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,151
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh, hello, Huck.

870
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:42,004
- Hello, Soph.
- Hello.

871
01:02:42,076 --> 01:02:44,148
Oh, say, Huck,
will you take care of Sophie for a minute?

872
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,642
I want to see about a table.
Pardon me, Sophie.

873
01:02:46,715 --> 01:02:49,879
- Here's a drink waiting for you.
- Oh, thanks, John. Thanks.

874
01:02:59,803 --> 01:03:02,520
- Got the new dress on, Soph?
- Certainly.

875
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:06,963
You don't know it,
but this is a great moment in my life.

876
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:08,945
- Oh, thank you, Huck.
- Thank you.

877
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,288
Don't you think
this dress does something for me?

878
01:03:11,356 --> 01:03:14,323
- It'll do something for me.
- Oh, now, Huck.

879
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:19,190
- A dress like this depends on...
- I know, it depends on that shoulder strap.

880
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:22,645
Has John seen it yet?

881
01:03:26,331 --> 01:03:29,528
- Afraid he won't like it.
- And why not?

882
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,050
He thinks everything I wear is perfect.

883
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:34,513
If I ever ask him how he likes a dress,
he just looks at me

884
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:37,686
with calf-eyes and says,
"Gee, darling, you look swell."

885
01:03:38,651 --> 01:03:40,724
I bet he won't say it about that one.

886
01:03:40,796 --> 01:03:43,763
I'll bet you $100 he says,
"Gee, that looks swell."

887
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:46,487
- Make it francs, and it's a bet.
- Sold.

888
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,878
Look, John,
we want you to settle a little bet.

889
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,835
Sophie has a very important question
to ask you.

890
01:03:59,931 --> 01:04:01,655
Gee, that's swell.

891
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,082
How do you like it? Isn't it a knockout?

892
01:04:13,211 --> 01:04:15,993
It's the worst-looking thing I ever saw.

893
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:19,001
Gee, darling, you look terrible.

894
01:04:23,804 --> 01:04:25,909
- Who sold it to you?
- Your partner.

895
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:29,842
She thought it brought out
something elegantly alluring in me.

896
01:04:31,676 --> 01:04:33,498
Oh, she did, did she?

897
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,529
I'm sorry I said anything, Sophie.
It isn't your fault, you send it back.

898
01:04:37,596 --> 01:04:41,490
I will not send it back.
It's the smartest thing in your shop.

899
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:43,832
But what do you know
about clothes anyway?

900
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:46,168
You make yourself ridiculous
by even discussing them.

901
01:04:46,236 --> 01:04:49,684
I knew enough about them
to order that thing out of our line.

902
01:04:49,755 --> 01:04:51,282
Let me tell you something, John Kent,

903
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:53,495
now that you think you know something
about women's clothes...

904
01:04:53,564 --> 01:04:54,774
- Please.
- Now that you are carrying on

905
01:04:54,843 --> 01:04:55,890
- with your dressmaker.
- Shut up.

906
01:04:55,963 --> 01:04:58,003
I won't shut up. You're in love with her.

907
01:04:58,076 --> 01:05:00,051
I could tell it
the minute she came into your office.

908
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:01,585
Let's go home.

909
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:04,634
I'll go home and I'll go home alone.

910
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,210
Suit yourself.

911
01:05:09,116 --> 01:05:11,450
- What? You'd let me?
- Why not?

912
01:05:11,835 --> 01:05:15,032
And now we're getting down to cases,
here's something I want to tell you.

913
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:17,172
You've bawled me out for the last time.

914
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:18,934
I've stood for all your knocking
and criticism

915
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:21,687
because it sounded so cute
coming from such a little snip.

916
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:23,730
And because I thought I loved you.

917
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:27,665
- Oh, you thought you loved me?
- Yes, and what a sap you've made of me.

918
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,801
Well, it certainly didn't take much effort.

919
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:33,810
And don't you ever
come crawling back to me again.

920
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:36,560
Because I'm through. Through!

921
01:05:39,771 --> 01:05:41,266
Do you hear me?

922
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:44,466
Do you hear me?

923
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,612
Sure, but I thought you said
you were through.

924
01:05:46,683 --> 01:05:48,788
- Well, I am.
- Well, goodbye!

925
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:50,936
Goodbye!

926
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,438
Noisy.

927
01:05:58,396 --> 01:06:00,916
- Give me a dozen brandies.
- A dozen?

928
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,676
Yeah, and line them up right here.

929
01:07:22,235 --> 01:07:24,472
Is there anything I can do for you?

930
01:07:27,483 --> 01:07:28,530
No.

931
01:07:28,994 --> 01:07:30,139
<i>Think of what you're losing</i>

932
01:07:30,242 --> 01:07:32,762
<i>by constantly refusing to dance with me</i>

933
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:35,353
<i>You'd be the idol of France with me</i>

934
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:39,003
<i>And yet you stand there</i>
<i>and shake your foolish head dramatically</i>

935
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:41,462
<i>While I wait here so ecstatically</i>

936
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,991
<i>You just look and say emphatically</i>

937
01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:48,375
<i>Not this season</i>
<i>There's a reason</i>

938
01:07:48,802 --> 01:07:51,191
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>Don't ask me</i>

939
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:53,437
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>Don't ask me</i>

940
01:07:53,506 --> 01:07:56,473
<i>I won't dance, madam, with you</i>

941
01:07:57,186 --> 01:08:00,928
<i>My heart won't let my feet</i>
<i>do things they should do</i>

942
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:05,022
<i>You know what? You're lovely</i>

943
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,424
<i>And so what? I'm lovely</i>

944
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:10,521
<i>But oh, what you do to me</i>

945
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:14,839
<i>I'm like an ocean wave</i>
<i>that's bumped on the shore</i>

946
01:08:15,586 --> 01:08:19,230
<i>I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor</i>

947
01:08:20,289 --> 01:08:24,380
<i>Ah, but when you dance</i>
<i>you're charming and you're gentle</i>

948
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:28,830
<i>Especially when you do the Continental</i>

949
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:33,344
<i>But this feeling isn't purely mental</i>

950
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:37,911
<i>For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos</i>

951
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:40,025
<i>And that's why I won't dance</i>

952
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:41,369
<i>Why should I?</i>

953
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:43,351
<i>I won't dance</i>
<i>How could I?</i>

954
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:45,728
<i>I won't dance, merci beaucoup</i>

955
01:08:45,794 --> 01:08:46,874
<i>Won't you?</i>

956
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:50,262
<i>I know that music leads the way</i>
<i>to romance</i>

957
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:55,071
<i>And if I hold you in my arms I won't dance</i>

958
01:11:24,673 --> 01:11:26,167
Bravo! Bravo!

959
01:11:31,457 --> 01:11:32,766
Good work.

960
01:11:33,057 --> 01:11:35,643
<i>I won't dance, ta-da-dah</i>

961
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:36,859
<i>I won't dance</i>

962
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:42,970
Get the musicians, quick.

963
01:11:44,129 --> 01:11:46,682
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

964
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:49,623
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

965
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:52,347
<i>I want a drink, ta-da-dah</i>

966
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:02,747
Your Highness, this is a great honor.

967
01:12:15,521 --> 01:12:18,521
Broken down prince
rates a lot of trumpeting.

968
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:34,966
- What is it?
- You are going to sing for us.

969
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:37,112
- Oh, am I?
- Yes.

970
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,767
All right.

971
01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:57,355
<i>They asked me how I knew</i>

972
01:13:57,459 --> 01:14:02,696
<i>My true love was true</i>

973
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:06,219
<i>I of course replied</i>

974
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:09,587
<i>Something here inside</i>

975
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:15,597
<i>Cannot be denied</i>

976
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:19,691
<i>They said someday</i>

977
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:25,480
<i>You'll find all who love are blind</i>

978
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:30,578
<i>When your heart's on fire</i>

979
01:14:30,643 --> 01:14:34,255
<i>You must realize</i>

980
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:39,080
<i>smoke gets in your eyes</i>

981
01:14:42,163 --> 01:14:45,327
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

982
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:51,154
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

983
01:14:51,603 --> 01:14:56,557
<i>Yet today my love has flown away</i>

984
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:02,376
<i>I am without my love</i>

985
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:08,783
<i>Now laughing friends deride</i>

986
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:14,514
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

987
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:18,895
<i>So I smile and say</i>

988
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:24,525
<i>When the lovely flame dies</i>

989
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:26,793
<i>Smoke gets</i>

990
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:32,595
<i>in your eyes</i>

991
01:16:02,259 --> 01:16:04,844
<i>They said someday</i>

992
01:16:04,947 --> 01:16:10,664
<i>you'll find all who love are blind</i>

993
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:16,332
<i>When your heart's on fire</i>

994
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:20,047
<i>You must realize</i>

995
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:25,863
<i>Smoke gets in your eyes</i>

996
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:31,400
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

997
01:16:31,507 --> 01:16:33,002
<i>To think I could</i>

998
01:16:33,107 --> 01:16:36,936
<i>Doubt my love</i>

999
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:40,143
<i>Yet to... my love</i>

1000
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:49,129
- Nice of you to join us.
- Now, don't try and high-hat me

1001
01:16:49,203 --> 01:16:51,920
just because you happen to be
with a broken-down prince.

1002
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:54,059
- Please go away, John.
- No, I wanna talk to you.

1003
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:56,041
- You're not yourself.
- Yes, I am. I'm twice myself.

1004
01:16:56,147 --> 01:16:57,609
I wanna talk to you.

1005
01:16:57,682 --> 01:17:00,781
What do you mean selling that dress?
Didn't I tell you to throw it out?

1006
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,640
- I didn't intend to.
- You did, too.

1007
01:17:02,739 --> 01:17:04,942
It was a dirty trick to play
on a friend of mine.

1008
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,978
- Please go away, Mr. Kent.
- You stick to your own business.

1009
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:10,701
- Laddie, please.
- Well, what have you got to say?

1010
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:14,087
- I've nothing to say.
- Oh, you have nothing to say.

1011
01:17:14,323 --> 01:17:16,941
Well, I have.
And I think it was a sneaking thing to do.

1012
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:19,913
Telling Sophie she looked
elegantly alluring in an ugly, vulgar...

1013
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,888
- Please, John, tomorrow.
- No, I want it out, now.

1014
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:25,928
All right, I'll tell you.
I sold her that vulgar, tasteless dress

1015
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:29,298
because I thought it suited her perfectly.
I think she suits you perfectly.

1016
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,185
I think you're perfectly matched.

1017
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:34,600
And after this, you'd better count
on running your business without me.

1018
01:17:34,707 --> 01:17:37,522
- Stephanie, I...
- Now, will you please go?

1019
01:18:02,866 --> 01:18:06,445
<i>So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed</i>

1020
01:18:06,547 --> 01:18:11,086
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

1021
01:18:11,827 --> 01:18:16,813
<i>Yet today my love has flown away</i>

1022
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:22,444
<i>I am without my love</i>

1023
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:29,169
<i>Now laughing friends deride</i>

1024
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:35,144
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

1025
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:39,183
<i>So</i>

1026
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:43,822
<i>I smile and say</i>

1027
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:48,238
<i>When the lovely flame</i>

1028
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:51,121
<i>dies</i>

1029
01:18:52,307 --> 01:18:57,096
<i>Smoke gets in your...</i>

1030
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:13,019
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know, but look, this is no joke.

1031
01:19:13,219 --> 01:19:16,797
I didn't say I'd take care of your silly
dressmaking business indefinitely.

1032
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:18,491
But you can't give it to me. I won't take it.

1033
01:19:18,562 --> 01:19:21,759
- You've got a band to look after.
- I've got a band to look after.

1034
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:24,248
I know, but John,
Stephanie isn't here, either.

1035
01:19:24,322 --> 01:19:26,843
<i>- Monsieur.</i>
- What? Yeah, the one with the spots.

1036
01:19:26,946 --> 01:19:28,888
What? Well, how do I know were she is?

1037
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:31,329
I only agreed to do this thing
to help you out, you know.

1038
01:19:31,427 --> 01:19:32,889
But it isn't my racket either.

1039
01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:34,937
- Tell him you've got a band!
- I've got a band!

1040
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:37,531
And both the band and the shop
will be on the rocks this way!

1041
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:39,610
I don't care which one you use.
They're both terrible.

1042
01:19:39,682 --> 01:19:41,592
What? Yeah, that was the Countess.
Well, what about it?

1043
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:43,259
- Yes, but don't you think...
- I don't think...

1044
01:19:43,331 --> 01:19:44,891
Look, use the other one, the both of them.

1045
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:46,872
The whole flock of them. Out. Out.

1046
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:48,059
What?

1047
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:50,018
Look, John, if I knew
where Stephanie was

1048
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:52,766
I wouldn't be wasting my time
with you, babe.

1049
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,194
I know,
but somebody's got to come and take

1050
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,371
this ridiculous business off my shoulders.

1051
01:19:57,443 --> 01:20:00,705
In the four days I've been here,
my voice is beginning to change.

1052
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,775
John, but wait. Don't hang up.

1053
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:07,997
He won't come back.

1054
01:20:09,123 --> 01:20:10,879
Now what am I gonna do?

1055
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:14,944
- You're not asking my opinion, are you?
- Yes. No.

1056
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,733
<i>Pardon, monsieur,</i> but do you think

1057
01:20:16,803 --> 01:20:20,600
we should use <i>matelassé</i> for
the "after twilight" number or <i>paillettes?</i>

1058
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:22,462
And what about the tippet?

1059
01:20:27,938 --> 01:20:31,321
- Well, what do you think?
- I wouldn't know, <i>monsieur.</i>

1060
01:20:32,643 --> 01:20:35,196
Well, personally,
I go in for the simple things.

1061
01:20:35,299 --> 01:20:38,714
- Which is the simpler?
- There is no difference, <i>monsieur.</i>

1062
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:43,005
Well, then,
use whichever we have the most of.

1063
01:20:43,107 --> 01:20:44,929
We have plenty of all.

1064
01:20:46,243 --> 01:20:48,315
Oh, we have?

1065
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,335
- Well, then use a little of each.
- A sort of a patchwork quilt.

1066
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,542
Yeah. No.

1067
01:20:58,306 --> 01:21:01,176
It will be newer that way
and have much more chic.

1068
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:03,771
Tell <i>Madame</i> Blanchard
that's my final decision.

1069
01:21:09,123 --> 01:21:11,643
Stephanie.

1070
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:18,082
- I knew you'd come back.
- I came back to tell John Kent he's insane.

1071
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:20,088
Where is he? Look at those.

1072
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:26,940
How do you think
women are going to react to those?

1073
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:28,320
Where is Mr. Kent?

1074
01:21:28,418 --> 01:21:31,004
Oh, he's not here.
He's been staying away, too.

1075
01:21:31,107 --> 01:21:35,035
- Who has been running the business?
- Did you say running or ruining?

1076
01:21:35,746 --> 01:21:38,812
Well, someone had to do it.
You and John left it flat.

1077
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:40,767
But I thought surely he was here.

1078
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:43,584
Well, if he were, he doesn't know
any more about it than Huck does.

1079
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,618
Not as much.
You are the one who is needed, Stephanie.

1080
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:47,967
Well, that's impossible.

1081
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:50,936
Why? Just because you and John
are in love with each other?

1082
01:21:51,011 --> 01:21:54,393
Don't be fantastic, Huck.
John isn't in love with me.

1083
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:58,846
Is it fantastic when a man
is eating his heart out for you?

1084
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,019
When your name is continually on his lips?

1085
01:22:01,091 --> 01:22:02,880
When he stands around
dark street corners

1086
01:22:02,978 --> 01:22:04,637
just to get a glimpse of you?

1087
01:22:04,738 --> 01:22:06,299
- He doesn't.
- He does, and more.

1088
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:09,404
Everyone around here knows it
but you, Stephanie.

1089
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:10,783
And maybe John.

1090
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:14,047
- But he's always quarreling with me.
- Well, what more can you ask?

1091
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:17,976
Oh, that's nothing. People in love
are always quarreling with each other.

1092
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:20,156
Now you take Liz and myself for instance.

1093
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,047
Liz? Who is this Liz?

1094
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,218
Oh, a little country girl from back home
that I'm thinking of marrying.

1095
01:22:25,283 --> 01:22:28,763
You know, big feet, dumb, simple.
Oh, very simple.

1096
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:33,015
Well, the simple and dumb ones
make the best wives sometimes.

1097
01:22:33,602 --> 01:22:37,050
Well, forgetting about this girl of Huck's
from back home, with the big feet,

1098
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:39,261
what about Roberta? What about John?

1099
01:22:39,331 --> 01:22:42,527
Yes, Stephanie, you must come back
for Aunt Minnie's sake.

1100
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,560
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

1101
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:48,638
Stephanie, you must.

1102
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:50,143
Come in.

1103
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:52,153
Oh, I'm sorry.

1104
01:22:52,323 --> 01:22:54,876
Oh, <i>mademoiselle,</i> I am so happy.
Now you can...

1105
01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:57,248
Give those to Mr. Haines, Albert.

1106
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,650
Well, there are some dresses
that men will fall for.

1107
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:07,745
- I practically designed those myself.
- I've seen worse, darling, but not much.

1108
01:23:09,603 --> 01:23:12,418
And what do you think, Stephanie?
Are they as bad as that?

1109
01:23:12,483 --> 01:23:15,516
Well, the men may like them,
but I'm sure the women won't.

1110
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:21,857
Well, maybe you're right
and maybe you're wrong.

1111
01:23:21,923 --> 01:23:25,272
- We'll just have to try them out, I guess.
- But, Huck, you can't.

1112
01:23:25,378 --> 01:23:27,483
Roberta's never put out clothes like those.

1113
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:29,529
Roberta's is in new hands now.

1114
01:23:31,587 --> 01:23:34,456
But this is like the mode
two seasons back.

1115
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:36,633
I know, but I liked them better then.

1116
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:38,714
But nobody will buy them.

1117
01:23:39,522 --> 01:23:42,817
Well, you'd be laughed out of Paris
if you did a thing like that.

1118
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:45,370
The trend is away from such styles.

1119
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,897
- I'm not interested in the trend.
- But you've got to be.

1120
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:50,687
You don't understand.
You're giving a fashion show next week.

1121
01:23:50,787 --> 01:23:52,576
Every couturier in Europe
is going to be watching.

1122
01:23:52,643 --> 01:23:54,366
You can't afford to show
models like those.

1123
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:56,922
Well, of course you cannot.
Stephanie is right!

1124
01:23:57,026 --> 01:23:58,717
What does it matter
as long as they're pretty?

1125
01:23:58,819 --> 01:24:00,444
But clothes must be more than pretty.

1126
01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:03,099
Look, the trouble with that is it...

1127
01:24:04,163 --> 01:24:06,170
It fits in the wrong places.

1128
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:10,459
Such a pity.
The famous Roberta to go second rate.

1129
01:24:10,627 --> 01:24:13,660
- Roberta's will never go second rate.
- Who is to stop it?

1130
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:16,697
The fashion show next week
will be a colossal flop.

1131
01:24:16,866 --> 01:24:18,459
Maybe we should call off
the fashion show.

1132
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,577
I think so.

1133
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:22,498
- We might better put on a good one.
- Now you're talking, Stephanie.

1134
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:25,694
We'll put on a better-than-good one.
We'll give them some entertainment, too.

1135
01:24:25,762 --> 01:24:27,289
- How about your band?
- That's a great idea.

1136
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:28,443
- Yeah.
- We'll bring over my band.

1137
01:24:28,546 --> 01:24:29,888
- A musical fashion show.
- Yes, that's it.

1138
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,921
- It'll be marvelous.
- And you can make the new designs.

1139
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,337
<i>We endorse this polo rig, of course</i>

1140
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:03,761
<i>And for an added 1,000 francs</i>
<i>we furnish horses</i>

1141
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,013
<i>Or if you're doing splits on skis</i>
<i>at St. Moritz</i>

1142
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:11,314
<i>You'd be the best-dressed</i>
<i>"faller-downer" on the courses</i>

1143
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:15,982
<i>Now take the dowager who is glad</i>
<i>to leave her watchman for tea</i>

1144
01:25:16,438 --> 01:25:19,853
<i>She'll wear this patriotic plaid</i>
<i>and meet that Scotchman for tea</i>

1145
01:25:20,502 --> 01:25:23,285
<i>When summertime begins</i>
<i>this costume always wins</i>

1146
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,580
<i>When 50 million little Frenchmen</i>
<i>clap their fins</i>

1147
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:30,507
<i>For hunting grouse or quail</i>
<i>Roberta ran up this suit</i>

1148
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:34,834
<i>The modest price includes</i>
<i>the bag, the gun and two ducks to shoot</i>

1149
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:38,038
<i>And should Amelia Earhart care</i>
<i>to get a breath of air</i>

1150
01:25:38,103 --> 01:25:41,452
<i>this is the last thing in the world</i>
<i>she'd ever wear</i>

1151
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:51,020
- Ladislaw, are we gathering later?
- The Princess begs to be excused.

1152
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:53,941
We are leaving for Rome
immediately the showing is finished.

1153
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:00,914
<i>It is the hour for dry martinis</i>

1154
01:26:00,983 --> 01:26:03,470
<i>The park is full of little Fords</i>
<i>and Isotta Fraschinis</i>

1155
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:05,909
<i>The Ritz bar is serving caviar and weenies</i>

1156
01:26:06,006 --> 01:26:07,380
<i>Madame is there</i>

1157
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:10,031
<i>And from Roberta she has something</i>
<i>that is too divine on</i>

1158
01:26:10,102 --> 01:26:13,233
<i>The sort of thing your jealous friends</i>
<i>would love to spill their wine on</i>

1159
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:16,302
<i>For your inspection, our cocktail collection</i>

1160
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:35,348
<i>Clothes must play a part</i>

1161
01:28:35,446 --> 01:28:38,829
<i>To light an eye, to win a heart</i>

1162
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:41,455
<i>They say a gown can almost speak</i>

1163
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,939
<i>If it is chic</i>

1164
01:28:45,046 --> 01:28:49,389
<i>Should you select the right effect</i>
<i>you cannot miss</i>

1165
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:53,452
<i>And night and day</i>

1166
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:57,998
<i>He is sure to say</i>

1167
01:29:00,663 --> 01:29:05,135
<i>Lovely to look at</i>
<i>delightful to know</i>

1168
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:08,108
<i>And heaven to kiss</i>

1169
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:12,019
<i>A combination like this</i>

1170
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:15,860
<i>Is quite my most impossible scheme</i>
<i>come true</i>

1171
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,878
<i>lmagine finding a dream like you</i>

1172
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,499
<i>You're lovely to look at</i>

1173
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:26,389
<i>It's thrilling to hold you</i>

1174
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:30,480
<i>Terribly tight</i>

1175
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:33,583
<i>For we're together, the moon is new</i>

1176
01:29:33,686 --> 01:29:36,752
<i>And oh, it's lovely to look at you</i>

1177
01:29:36,822 --> 01:29:41,579

I have never seen
Princess Stephanie look so lovely.

1203
01:31:20,278 --> 01:31:24,271
Yes. We shall miss her now that
she and Prince Ladislaw are leaving Paris.

1204
01:31:25,206 --> 01:31:27,661
Oh, did she marry him?

1205
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:35,477
<i>At night when madame</i>
<i>leaves the quiet of her hall room</i>

1206

<i>To drag her very weary feet</i>
<i>around the ballroom</i>

1207
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,560
<i>Her clothes and jewels must be</i>
<i>a monument of power</i>

01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,019
<i>I mean, the monument</i>
<i>they call the Eiffel Tower</i>

1209
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:44,849
<i>We'll show you the gown we made</i>
<i>Marie,</i>

<i>Queen of Romania</i>

1222
01:37:24,789 --> 01:37:26,644
- Oh, my. Oh, my.
- What?

1223
01:37:27,126 --> 01:37:30,955
- I said, "My, oh, my." That was lovely.
- It went well, didn't it?

1224
01:37:32,854 --> 01:37:35,669
- I guess I'll have to give in to you.
- To me?

1225
01:37:36,438 --> 01:37:38,510
But I didn't say anything.

1226
01:37:38,837 --> 01:37:41,325
But I thought you were
about to want to marry me.

1227
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:44,464
- Well, I was.
- Well, I accept.

1228
01:37:45,174 --> 01:37:46,930
Well, thanks very much.

1229
01:37:46,998 --> 01:37:49,900
Well, you're quite welcome,
my fine feathered friend.

1230
01:37:50,038 --> 01:37:53,071
Hey! Hey!

1231
01:37:56,086 --> 01:37:59,763
- Hey, do something about this. Will you?
- Just a moment. You stay right there.

1232
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:02,197
Well, where do you think I can go?

1233
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:08,081
- John.
- Stephanie, I...

1234
01:38:14,357 --> 01:38:17,706
- Stephanie, are you happy?
- Tremendously.

1235
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:21,842
- Then I am, too.
- Well.

1236
01:38:22,326 --> 01:38:24,399
Haven't you anything more to say?

1237
01:38:24,726 --> 01:38:28,522
No. Only congratulations
and have a good time and goodbye.

1238
01:38:42,838 --> 01:38:44,910
I'm sailing for New York tomorrow.

1239
01:38:46,358 --> 01:38:49,260
You're being very heroic about something.
What is it?

1240
01:38:49,365 --> 01:38:50,926
Oh, I was just thinking it must be fun

1241
01:38:50,998 --> 01:38:54,380
to suddenly find yourself a princess
married to a nice prince.

1242
01:38:57,430 --> 01:39:01,685
I was born a princess. I'm not married
to Ladislaw. He's my cousin.

1243
01:39:01,749 --> 01:39:05,644
And you're still a big blundering,
Newfoundland fullback.

1244
01:39:07,094 --> 01:39:09,199
- Where are you going?
- Down.

1245
01:39:11,318 --> 01:39:13,522
- Why?
- Because I pushed the button.

1246
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:16,939
- But I want to talk to you.
- That's what you're doing.

1247
01:39:17,398 --> 01:39:19,765
Just let me tell you I love you.

1248
01:39:23,798 --> 01:39:26,962
- What does that mean?
- I love you.

1249
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,753
Gee, that's swell.

1250
01:39:29,305 --> 01:40:29,863
