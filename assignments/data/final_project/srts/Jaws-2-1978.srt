1
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,315
Come on, come on.

2
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,275
- Where have you been?
- Delayed.

3
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,835
That I figured.
This is a big deal for me.

4
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,555
Hendricks had the keys to the Jeep.
I couldn't find the spares.

5
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,319
Listen, act as if you've been here
the whole time.

6
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,794
- How?
- Look bored.

7
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,273
Thank you Amity High School Band
for that eloquent selection.

8
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,912
We're happy, once again...

9
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,951
Mama, Michael won't talk to me.

10
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,629
- What are you doing here?
- Mrs Silvera couldn't come.

11
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,556
And now this year's Miss Amity,
Tina Wilcox,

12
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,755
will cut the ribbon, officially
opening this luxurious new hotel.

13
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,912
This money tree is donated
by Len Peterson,

14
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,793
the builder
of Amity Shores Condominiums,

15
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,831
as a gesture of goodwill.

16
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,871
Let's hear it for Len.

17
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
Thanks, Len.

18
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,710
$1,500 as a special gift
to the Amity Scholarship Fund.

19
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,511
Go ahead, Tina, cut it.

20
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,557
Atta girl.

21
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,555
And now the Amity High School Band
once again.

22
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,034
Refreshments on the patio, everyone.

23
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,472
Oh, boy. Let's go.

24
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,512
Brody, how are you?

25
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,118
Hello, Martin.

26
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,118
- I think it went well.
- Hell of a speech, Larry.

27
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,798
Right on the money.

28
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,037
Thank you. Have you met my son Larry?

29
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,993
- No.
- Larry Jr. Larry, over here.

30
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,235
Here we go. Say hello to Len.

31
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,157
- How you doing?
- Hi, Larry.

32
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,078
- Nice-looking boy.
- Thank you.

33
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,831
Ellen, make sure that the bar is open
and everyone's taken care of.

34
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,438
Sure.

35
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,557
Yes, sir, a fantastic lady.

36
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,957
- Don't know what I'd do without her.
- Really? Neither do I.

37
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,595
- How old is your cousin?
- 17. She's a senior.

38
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,356
I'm not crazy about blind dates.

39
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,836
They're OK if they got
little white canes and tin cups.

40
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,077
- That's awful!
- Ah, what the hell?

41
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,675
- Did your mom put all this together?
- Yeah, it's her job.

42
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,359
- Did she make the punch?
- No.

43
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,516
Good, it's terrible.

44
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,316
- Get your dance?
- Nope.

45
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,789
- Me neither.
- Who you gonna ask next?

46
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,719
Tina Wilcox. Ed's girlfriend.

47
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,751
You're crazy.

48
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,590
It doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes
beautiful girls are the loneliest.

49
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,631
That's a crock of shit.

50
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,477
I know.

51
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,230
Was it the fourth or fifth night
at the Jersey shore?

52
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,077
The fourth!

53
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,590
- I thought you wouldn't respect me.
- I did! I did!

54
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,871
Why don't we get out of here?

55
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,990
What? To fool around?

56
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,432
- Why not?
- You're on.

57
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,872
This pipe has more barnacles
than you do.

58
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,514
What are you doing? I told you!

59
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,791
Brush it off to your left!
Your other left.

60
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,308
I thought you were off duty.

61
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,114
Good morning! Till noon -
I'm on my own time.

62
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,277
- Hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

63
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,916
We got a gold plater
in the main channel, a big cruiser.

64
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,111
- Whereabouts?
- Off the point.

65
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,311
No running lights,
just the diver's flag.

66
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,717
- Want me to run out there?
- Would you? I can't run this thing!

67
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,752
- Happy to do it.
- I'll see you back at the office.

68
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,677
Take the old man of the sea.

69
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,191
Cast off the bowline,
and then the stern line,

70
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,959
and then cast off the spring line.

71
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,274
Let's go!

72
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
We'll only be here for a few minutes.

73
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,195
- Can't I come with you?
- No.

74
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,357
- He can come with me.
- No.

75
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,039
- No?
- No. Off the boat.

76
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,752
He can help me, at least.

77
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,472
Boo! Big brothers!

78
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,630
Hey, Sean,
ever been an anchor before?

79
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,359
- Mike, hi.
- You going out now?

80
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,675
- No.
- Good, you can meet my cousin.

81
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,631
Don't worry, I'll meet her.

82
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,353
OK, Tom, see you later.
Same time Thursday.

83
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,832
Andy, over here.

84
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,559
See you guys later.

85
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,353
- What's the problem?
- What isn't?!

86
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,913
Brooke!

87
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,030
Brooke!

88
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,230
Jackie, hi.

89
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,952
Quick, quick, who's that?

90
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,594
- I'm in love!
- The cousin, I hope.

91
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,552
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky...

92
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,069
Did you see the way
she looked at you?

93
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,112
- She wants you.
- She wasn't looking at me.

94
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,277
What? She was staring at you
and drooling.

95
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,312
No, I'm thin, I wear glasses,

96
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,669
I live in Amity Island year-round.

97
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,631
I'm not good enough for her.

98
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,510
You're right,
she probably wasn't looking at you.

99
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,791
Larry, look. Larry, look!

100
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,558
- What?
- Look at her.

101
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,079
Good to see you!

102
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,469
- Well?
- She's got tits like a sparrow.

103
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,231
Do you have to talk like that?

104
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,033
What are you, my mother?
Undo the jib.

105
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,310
- We're going sailing.
- Sailing?

106
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,510
He's cute.

107
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,511
Hey, look, I'm walking!

108
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,195
Mike, over here.

109
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,831
Douglas!

110
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,635
I can't watch the news, a ball game,
can't even watch a movie.

111
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,514
All I hear is that kid and his radio
going "breaker, breaker".

112
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,597
I'll try but it's under
federal jurisdiction.

113
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,959
Call the FBl.

114
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,513
One at a time. You two talk to Polly,
you come with me.

115
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,798
- What's this about Grace Kinny?
- Her bedroom window faces my son's.

116
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,798
She's teasing him,
dancing around in a towel.

117
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,196
Dancing? Hendricks, good.
Right this way. Excuse us.

118
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,471
Come in here and check out this 908.

119
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,318
What the hell's a 908?
I never heard of a 908.

120
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,191
908 means get me out of there.

121
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,153
- What's that?
- Diver's camera from the cruiser.

122
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,191
Oh, the abandoned cruiser!

123
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,595
Rich guys from Newport, Rhode Island.

124
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,438
If I had a $100,000 boat,
I wouldn't abandon it.

125
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,153
If you had one,
there'd be an investigation.

126
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,239
- Very funny.
- It's driving my boy to distraction!

127
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,555
- Dancing! Check out this dance.
- Dance?

128
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,115
- Can I go back up?
- Take it back up.

129
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,439
Now, back up, Mike!

130
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,833
Mike, it's twisted.

131
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,270
Pull it up, Mike.

132
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,557
- Underneath you, Mike.
- Drop it down now.

133
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,113
You OK?

134
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,713
You OK?

135
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,192
Pull down, Mike.

136
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,597
'The weather continues
to be warm and clear.

137
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,997
'Back to the 24-hour music from
Plymouth, the rock of New England. '

138
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,509
Wait, take a break for a minute, OK?

139
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,676
Tina... where are you going?

140
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,989
Hey!

141
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,791
Eddie, come on, let's go skiing.

142
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,434
- What?
- We can use my uncle's boat.

143
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,038
We'll do it next week, OK?

144
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,435
With you everything is next week.

145
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,758
Terry?

146
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,473
Terry?

147
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,632
Terry?

148
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,999
No!

149
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,949
Wow!

150
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,439
God!

151
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,632
I can't find anyone. They must have
gone to the bottom and drifted.

152
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,435
Witnesses say there was one person
in the boat and one water-skiing.

153
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,835
'I told you, there's nothing here. '

154
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,916
I want you to try dragging.

155
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,078
For how long? The current's moving
everything and it'll be dark soon.

156
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,669
I don't care, I want you
to stay on it as long as it takes.

157
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,399
10-4.

158
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,439
We heard a noise like a boom.
Then there was this cloud of smoke.

159
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,032
The explosion. One minute they were
having a wonderful time, the next...

160
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,919
You've no idea
what could have caused it?

161
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,428
I don't know
what could have done that.

162
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,518
- Were they off-islanders?
- I don't know.

163
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,676
Can we go now?

164
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,512
Chief?

165
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,552
Chief Brody, can we go, please?

166
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,750
Yes, thank you, Tina.

167
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,715
We've been over this a dozen times.

168
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,239
I know, I know.

169
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,158
- How much longer?
- Until we find something.

170
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm cold, bored.

171
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,197
YOU'RE bored.

172
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,633
Holy shit!

173
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,839
George!

174
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,951
Jesus, this is heavy!

175
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,911
Aw, shit. Drop it.

176
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,270
- What is it?
- Drop it. It's a power line.

177
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,629
- Terrific
- Let me untangle it.

178
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,035
We don't want a power blackout.

179
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,514
Let's go before we do find something.

180
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,595
That's your third smoke already.

181
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,710
- With coffee.
- Try a donut.

182
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,274
- I want Froot Loops.
- Eat Cheerios.

183
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,470
You eat Cheerios, I want Froot Loops.

184
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,750
You eat Cheerios.

185
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,552
What are you guys up to today?

186
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,876
- I'm going sailing.
- Again?

187
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,754
- What else is there to do?
- What about that job?

188
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,751
Do I have to?

189
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,598
He doesn't have to.
It is his vacation.

190
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,631
Where did I leave my date book?

191
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,553
Good morning.
Everybody's up early today.

192
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,670
Something going on?

193
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,714
Lots. This kid is 17. We've talked
about him getting a job before.

194
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,230
You're right. I wish you could
spend some time with him.

195
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,396
How can I? I've got a boat accident.

196
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,150
I've only got three cops and a deputy
in love with the police launch.

197
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,193
And here's another one.
Everybody's a boat freak?

198
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,037
It's an island.

199
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,072
- I'm going.
- Hold it. Wait a minute.

200
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,590
Don't go out too far if it's rough.
We've had a lot of trouble.

201
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,756
- OK. See you later.
- Be careful.

202
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,916
I'll be careful.

203
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,396
- Tina, come back here.
- Nope!

204
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,997
- Give me my hat.
- No!

205
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,117
Come on, Tina!

206
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,917
Come back here.

207
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,630
I wonder why they decided to move.

208
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,672
- Too hot in the lighthouse?
- Too hot for those two?!

209
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,918
Yuck.

210
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,519
I called you as soon as I heard.
I hear the bites are really big.

211
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,120
- After we've looked, we'll talk.
- OK.

212
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,639
Here it is.

213
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,433
Could you move back, please?

214
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,109
Move back.
Please just move back. Thanks.

215
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,919
Jesus.

216
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,671
What do you think?

217
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,711
First things first.

218
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,149
Tip of the snout, please.

219
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,548
- OK. Seven and a half meters.
- Seven and a half meters?

220
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,192
Correct.

221
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,029
- Check the bite radius.
- The what?

222
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,311
- The shape of the mouth.
- Whale's mouth?

223
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,510
- Shark's mouth.
- What shark?

224
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,596
The shark that did this.

225
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,756
We don't know that, do we?

226
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,997
- That's what we're here to find out.
- And we will.

227
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,996
I can't hear you if you whisper.

228
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,349
111 centimetres.

229
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,829
68.

230
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,109
I've had some experience with sharks.

231
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,718
Oh, have you?

232
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,389
Yeah. And I think a great white
might have done this.

233
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,432
- Carcharodon carcharias?
- Right.

234
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,029
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

235
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,835
It's obvious a big fish
took a bite out of this big fish.

236
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,348
This is a mammal, not a fish.

237
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,312
Don't quibble!
Is it a shark bite or isn't it?

238
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,679
Possibly.

239
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,234
But this is a killer whale.

240
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,477
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.

241
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,151
We know sharks are attracted
by blood and thrashing about.

242
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,679
And sound.

243
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,119
Sound?

244
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,116
Sound, like sonar or radar.

245
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,197
They hone in
on unusual, irregular sounds.

246
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,879
Any rhythmic,
low-frequency vibration.

247
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,831
So there could be one around?

248
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,271
Not necessarily. These wounds could
have been inflicted out to sea.

249
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,359
None were immediately fatal. The
currents could have carried it in.

250
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,154
- We got a hell of a tide.
- Just take care of the crowd!

251
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,189
Dad?

252
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,754
Mr Hendricks, take this down, please.

253
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,596
- No more sailing today, OK?
- We came out in my boat.

254
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,915
- Andy'll take it back.
- I got a date.

255
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,235
- She'll understand.
- She won't.

256
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,316
Mike, give me a break, will you?

257
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,629
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

258
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,591
I'd like to know which.

259
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,154
It's impossible to tell
with that body.

260
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,398
The animal's been ashore for 12 hours
and drifting for a day at least.

261
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,159
Every nibbler
in the sea's taken a bite.

262
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,275
I know dolphins communicate.
I mean, they send signals.

263
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,518
If a shark was destroyed,
could another shark come and...

264
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,597
Sharks don't take things personally,
Mr Brody.

265
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,917
- Dad, can I...
- No.

266
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,309
Don't worry, I'll take it back
and tie it up at the docks.

267
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,715
- Bye, Mike.
- I'm sorry. Bye.

268
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,878
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I appreciate it. Thanks.

269
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,790
Larry. Larry, wait a minute.

270
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,590
I'm showing summer rentals, I think
we have a good season going for us.

271
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,029
Swell. But I have to talk
to you alone.

272
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,513
We're alone.

273
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,669
We may have another shark problem.

274
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,639
- Are you serious?
- You bet I'm serious.

275
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,997
I've got a half-eaten whale on
the beach, got two persons missing.

276
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,508
The whale's got
a bite out of it this big.

277
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,074
No one has seen a shark.
Be realistic.

278
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,511
The selectmen should know about it.
It's just a feeling, but...

279
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,751
Larry, I not only have this attack
but I've got...

280
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,032
- I've got two water-skiers...
- A tragedy, but a boating accident.

281
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,719
No fin, no sharks.
A boating accident.

282
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,355
- They're both still missing.
- We have a lot of deaths

283
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,311
that never turn up.

284
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,190
Are they all shark victims?

285
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,356
Maybe they are.

286
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,356
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

287
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,915
Is it bullshit I got a whale
with a bite in it this big?

288
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,632
What am I? An ass?

289
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,832
When you called me,
I called Elkins and her bosses.

290
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,513
Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

291
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,670
So we're not going to do anything?

292
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,553
Martin, don't press it this time.

293
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,429
Well, I've got to get back to work.

294
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,519
OK, Larry, but you just remember
this conversation.

295
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,152
You just remember it!

296
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,069
Chief?

297
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,355
Yeah.

298
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,231
Chief?

299
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,840
Hi. Missed you at the funeral home.

300
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,075
Santos said you'd be here.

301
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,190
Yeah. Christ, what a mess.

302
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,553
You didn't miss much.

303
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,158
Positive ID?

304
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,431
We're pretty sure
it was the woman aboard the boat.

305
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,075
Yeah?

306
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,594
Thank you, operator.
Just keep trying.

307
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,071
- Anything new on those two divers?
- Nothing.

308
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,829
- We should keep sightseers...
- Did you look at that stuff?

309
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,916
- No.
- How about that camera?

310
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,839
- Might be something in it.
- Yeah, right.

311
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,429
- Take it to get developed.
- First thing in the morning.

312
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,790
- Why not now?
- It's too late.

313
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,115
Christ, I'm late for dinner.

314
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,790
I'm expecting a long distance call.
Send it to the house.

315
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,831
OK, Chief.

316
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,034
Yes, I can hear you.

317
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,675
Yes, I'll give him the message.
Thank you.

318
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,119
That for me?

319
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,310
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, gang.

320
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,635
Well, sort of. Matt Hooper.

321
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,710
He's on a vessel in the Antarctic and
won't be in radio range till spring.

322
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,035
Yeah. I gave him a call.

323
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,118
Martin?

324
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,355
Martin?

325
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,749
Yeah?

326
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,595
You're a mess. Where were you?

327
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,349
Over at Santos', I dragged a body
out of the ocean today.

328
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,516
Have you any idea what happened?

329
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,471
No, we don't know.

330
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,877
Santos thinks it might be a victim
from the boat accident.

331
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,638
Do you wanna talk about it?

332
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,876
Just routine.

333
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,194
OK.

334
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,356
Hey, Mike, come here a minute.

335
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,833
What is it?

336
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,509
- Something for you to do tomorrow.
- I kinda had plans.

337
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,519
Sailing? Forget it.
You're grounded. Beach, that's it.

338
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,676
- Come on, Dad.
- I talked to John.

339
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,075
He's got a job
till you go back to school.

340
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,439
That's all summer.

341
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,917
He wanted a job, now he's got one.
And I want that boat out the water.

342
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,396
- Dad, can I...?
- Tomorrow night. And I mean it.

343
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,153
Now... Everybody here?

344
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,430
- Just about.
- OK, terrific.

345
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,631
Folks, this is the town beach.

346
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,911
The development, naturally,
has its own private access,

347
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,838
but I wanted you to see
the concession area.

348
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,077
Take a look at the sand.
It's like sugar.

349
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,838
It's beautiful.

350
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,716
In the summertime, at sunset,
the whole beach looks incredible.

351
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,593
It can be absolutely breathtaking.

352
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,475
You'll find this little bandstand
interesting. We take pride in this...

353
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,955
Hello. Selling more of the good life?

354
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,879
- Yeah. Piece of this, piece of that.
- Your husband's here.

355
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,593
- What's he doing?
- His job.

356
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,108
- Dad got you working, huh?
- Yeah.

357
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,674
- I'm helping.
- Good.

358
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,280
Do you happen to know
where your dad is?

359
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,753
He's up there.

360
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,151
For Christ's sake.

361
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,718
If you have any questions
about recreational possibilities,

362
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,036
Ellen Brody will be happy
to answer them.

363
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,674
- Can I speak to you?
- Excuse me a moment.

364
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,716
Larry, we've got some live ones.

365
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,109
Brody's riding his tower.

366
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,516
Oh, shit.

367
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,592
You got it, sweetheart.

368
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,073
Come on!

369
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,679
- This fast enough for you?
- No, faster.

370
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,551
- Faster?
- Faster!

371
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,236
Hey, look! There's my dad.

372
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,589
Wave to my son.

373
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,753
Good.

374
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,916
How do we get him
down from there?

375
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,758
Well, maybe nobody noticed.

376
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,268
Let's get them back in the van, huh?

377
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,673
Yeah, come on.

378
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,475
What's that man doing way up there?

379
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,839
What man?

380
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,474
Oh, he's watching.
You know, a lookout.

381
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,919
For what?

382
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,988
It's a shark tower. I saw one
in Florida. He's looking for sharks.

383
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,919
Excuse me, dear,
it's an observation platform.

384
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,236
That's our chief of police.
He's just checking it.

385
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,957
Normally, it's used for...
birdwatching, weather... measurements

386
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,878
and nature observation,
that sort of thing.

387
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,957
Excuse me.
Ellen, we're running a little late.

388
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,228
Ellen?

389
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,229
If we all get on the bus,
we could show you the country club...

390
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,354
Out of the water!
Out of the water, now! Everybody out!

391
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,231
Get out! Get out of there!

392
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,077
Get out!

393
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,509
What the hell is that idiot doing?

394
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,278
Everybody out!

395
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,790
Get out of there! Get out!

396
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,832
Everyone out!

397
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,157
Out of the water! Get out of there!
Get out!

398
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,236
Get out! Get out!

399
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,552
It's just bluefish!

400
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,036
Bluefish!
Chief, it's a school of bluefish!

401
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,916
It's just bluefish.

402
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,554
- Martin?
- Ellen, it's all right.

403
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,230
Let's not make it worse, come on.

404
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,875
OK, it's all over.
Let's get back to the club.

405
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,990
It's OK.

406
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,476
It's just... It's a false alarm.

407
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,158
It's all right, go back.

408
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,677
My God.

409
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,751
Come on, let's go. It's all over.

410
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,789
Polly, no calls now, huh?

411
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,158
Fogarty?

412
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,398
OK, put him on.

413
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,199
Yeah, Phil?

414
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,718
What pictures?

415
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,755
You're kidding! I'll be right over.

416
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,919
Yeah... it's the Orca.

417
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,554
Good lens, too. Fast. 1-4, I think.

418
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,717
- Notice the fusion...
- What else have you got?

419
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,311
Over here. I exposed some more this
morning, I haven't developed 'em yet.

420
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,830
That's it. That's the one.

421
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,758
Speak of the devil.

422
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,995
Martin, this is an official meeting.

423
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,873
Good, I'm glad you're all here.
Look at this.

424
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,152
Fogarty just developed it.
It's from the missing divers' camera.

425
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,239
Seaweed?

426
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,037
I don't know. What is it?

427
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,197
It's underwater.
That's why it's so dark.

428
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,276
There's nothing I can see.

429
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,199
What are you talking about?
Look at this. That's a shark.

430
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,391
Look at the outline,
the mouth, the eyes.

431
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,035
Is that what it is?
Sorry, I just don't see it.

432
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,433
Neither do I.

433
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,277
Martin, it could be anything.

434
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,392
Are you telling me
I don't know what a shark looks like?

435
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,193
This is nothing.
Something in the lens.

436
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,629
- Lens my ass.
- Damn right it's your ass.

437
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,954
Be reasonable.

438
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,956
Reasonable! With him?

439
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,560
Goddamn it,
will you just listen to him?

440
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,160
Be reasonable?! Look, Brody,

441
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,350
you started a panic on that beach.

442
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,597
You shot up the place.
God knows who you injured.

443
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,030
What if somebody sues us?
Did you think about that?

444
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,513
It could ruin us.

445
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,596
Don't worry about being sued.

446
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,076
If this is what I think it is,
there won't be anybody here.

447
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,317
- Now, let's not...
- Let's not what, Larry?

448
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,113
Larry, let's forget it.
He won't listen.

449
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,311
- It's obvious he's made up his mind.
- You bet I have.

450
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,636
I'm telling you
and everybody here, that's a shark.

451
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,399
And I know
because I've seen one up close.

452
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,831
And you better do something because
I won't go through that hell again.

453
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,509
Martin, could you wait
here for a minute?

454
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,357
For what?

455
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,470
Please, just have a seat,

456
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,229
while we look at the picture
and make up our own minds.

457
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,318
All right. I'll have a seat.

458
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,752
For what it's worth.

459
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,472
Thank you.

460
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,550
Gentlemen, please.

461
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,998
Yeah!

462
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,950
Hey, Mike.

463
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,956
I saw your dad over at Town Hall.

464
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,479
I know.

465
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,239
Did he really freak out
on the town beach?

466
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,032
I don't know.

467
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,674
Don't worry about them.
It's all bullshit.

468
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,679
Hey, you know this is the only place
where the garbage man delivers?

469
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,315
Ha ha ha

470
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,193
- Anyone wanna go to the lighthouse?
- Now?

471
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,151
Tomorrow. Maybe spend the day.

472
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,873
My dad left some cases of beer
in the garage.

473
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,038
- Is it still there?
- It's kinda vacationing on my boat!

474
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,310
Mike, are you going to go?

475
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,591
- Yeah, why not?
- You might be painting toilets!

476
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,471
Very funny

477
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,308
- Are we going to have a picnic?
- Yeah, you bring the food.

478
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,397
- Mike?
- Hi.

479
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,079
I'd like to go to the lighthouse
with you.

480
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,712
I'm not sure I can go.

481
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,316
I'm grounded.
Dad won't let me use my boat.

482
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,432
Do you always do what
your parents tell you to?

483
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,558
- No.
- Good. I'll be at the dock at eight.

484
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,836
Eight o'clock, everybody.

485
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,114
I don't know what I'd do.

486
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,029
Hey! What is this?
A wake for a funeral?

487
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,197
- You surprised us.
- I came as soon as I heard.

488
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,234
They only fired me,
they didn't bury me.

489
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,760
- Hello, baby, I'm home.
- I know.

490
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,268
I know you know.

491
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,875
Listen, I've got something for you.

492
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,149
This will look better on you than me
because you're a snappier dresser.

493
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,873
Oh, hey!
You're drinking the good stuff.

494
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,390
How about a toast?
A toast to the new chief.

495
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,555
Come on, the chief's going
to need all the luck he can get.

496
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,272
No? OK, we'll do it together.

497
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,556
A toast to the new chief.

498
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,632
Hail to the chief.

499
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,990
Come on, drink!
This is a milestone in your career.

500
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,554
- Ease up, Martin.
- Look, Chief,

501
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,591
not only don't I want your job,

502
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,871
but I came to tell you
I think you're the greatest.

503
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,276
- And I...
- Oh, Jeff, it's OK.

504
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,392
Come on. It's not your fault,
I know that.

505
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,114
Well, I got to go anyway.

506
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,230
Thanks for coming by, Jeff.

507
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,714
- You've been a big help.
- Thank you.

508
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,876
- Good night, Jeff.
- Good night.

509
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,233
Poor Hendricks.
They'll fire his ass, too.

510
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,516
You'll see.

511
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,479
I showed them a picture
of that shark.

512
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,112
They didn't see it.

513
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,355
They see only what they want to see.

514
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,389
But it's out there, all right.

515
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,353
- It's a big mother, too.
- Is that why they fired you?

516
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,391
It wasn't just that.

517
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,591
What was it? The beach?
I saw what happened.

518
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,995
Oh, I blew it. I blew it.

519
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,316
I shot off my mouth.
I shot off my gun.

520
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,871
Four years down the drain.

521
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,758
Shot to hell.

522
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,708
What a dummy.

523
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,599
What else?

524
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,753
What else?

525
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,431
I've never been fired before.

526
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,716
You know that?

527
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,878
I mean, once when I was 17,
when I was a kid, yeah.

528
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,639
But... never from a real job.

529
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,274
Nobody ever told me
I couldn't hack it.

530
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,834
They're not saying that.

531
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,352
Yes, they are.

532
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,038
They are.

533
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,871
Maybe they're right.

534
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,717
I'm tired.

535
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,398
Tired.

536
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,995
I'm too damn tired.

537
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,317
Too damn drunk.

538
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,158
That's what you are, too damn drunk.

539
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,391
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.

540
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,637
Going sailing?

541
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,717
- Maybe.
- Take me.

542
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,749
No!

543
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,712
- I wanna go with you.
- Shh! Quiet!

544
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,233
Michael.

545
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,670
All right. Come on. But be quiet!

546
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,197
Hello, Denise, love of my life.

547
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,312
If you're grounded,
what are we doing? Practice?

548
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,713
Yeah, practice.

549
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,390
Why are we here and not the beach? We
can fool around, pick up some girls.

550
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,668
If you're gonna get in the way,
go home.

551
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,029
I'm not in the way.
Andy, am I in the way?

552
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,877
You're always in the way.

553
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,512
Is he causing trouble?

554
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,630
Put me down!

555
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,989
- You can go out in my boat.
- Yeah!

556
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,429
You want him? You can have him.

557
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,358
I think you just made
somebody very happy.

558
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,038
- Hi guys.
- Hi.

559
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,197
- Mike, you going out?
- I thought you were grounded.

560
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,993
- I can go out if I want to.
- He can.

561
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,759
Is there enough room
for all of us on the boat?

562
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,031
- I don't know, we're...
- There's plenty of room.

563
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,798
I guess so.

564
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,070
Brooke? I've got room.

565
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,395
Great!

566
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,551
- You'll go with me?
- Sure.

567
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,717
Thanks guys,
but I'm going with Timmy. Come on.

568
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,830
Fantastic!

569
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,189
- It's a big mistake.
- Don't worry.

570
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,470
Come on, you guys, I'm ready.

571
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,716
You said she was coming with us.

572
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,149
Well, obviously, she's not.

573
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,397
- You wanna talk about it?
- You wanna swim home?

574
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,319
- Hey, Tom!
- Nicholas! You should be in class.

575
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,157
I've got company!

576
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,311
- I'm going for lobster.
- Great! Bring me one!

577
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,636
- I want mine with butter.
- Got that, Tom?

578
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,756
So long, turkeys.

579
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,155
Sparky will take you down today.

580
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,760
If you're ready,
let's buddy-up and drop.

581
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:43,171
Get us in!
For Christ's sake, get us in.

582
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:45,933
Let's get him in and keep him warm.

583
01:05:45,974 --> 01:05:47,805
Put him in the forward cabin.

584
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:53,010
He'll be OK. Things'll be OK.

585
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:55,090
Let's go.

586
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:28,772
Thank you.

587
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,926
So?

588
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:45,645
So, I'll go down to the office,
clean out the desk,

589
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,969
turn in the truck,

590
01:07:48,014 --> 01:07:51,450
and maybe get shitfaced
and rap your boss in the mouth.

591
01:07:51,494 --> 01:07:53,132
I better give notice.

592
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:55,642
Take it easy. We may need the income.

593
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,766
Mike's gone.

594
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:04,643
He's making out early these days,
must be a morning man.

595
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,252
Like his father.

596
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:13,647
Good morning. Anything special today?

597
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:17,767
No. Sean's out somewhere.
Let him have whatever he wants.

598
01:08:17,814 --> 01:08:20,726
- Just keep him away from the candy.
- OK.

599
01:08:20,774 --> 01:08:23,288
- Do I still get my ride?
- Mmm.

600
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:28,327
Call your brother, the plumber,
that sink upstairs is screwed up.

601
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:30,649
Frankie? He's my cousin.

602
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:33,606
Ask if he can use an apprentice.

603
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,406
Have a nice day.

604
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,848
Do you want to just leave
her pointing up?

605
01:09:05,894 --> 01:09:07,566
I'm on it.

606
01:09:07,614 --> 01:09:11,493
There we go. Yeah, this is fine.

607
01:09:12,854 --> 01:09:14,446
What about sailing?

608
01:09:14,494 --> 01:09:16,132
What about it?

609
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:18,483
Don't you worry. We're gonna make it.

610
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:21,173
We'll make it to Budapest
if you're not careful!

611
01:09:21,214 --> 01:09:22,966
Hey, what about the others?

612
01:09:23,014 --> 01:09:25,209
What about them?

613
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:27,449
They'll be there when we get there.

614
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:30,292
They'll have their bonfire,
clams, liquor...

615
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,562
Yeah?

616
01:09:31,614 --> 01:09:34,287
What are we gonna do in the meantime?

617
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:38,293
Well, in the meantime,
we'll have to think of something.

618
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:46,813
Wait a minute.

619
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,207
What?

620
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:50,846
Get out the blanket.

621
01:09:50,894 --> 01:09:54,967
I got black marks all over my butt
and mom's getting uptight about it.

622
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:56,367
OK.

623
01:09:57,774 --> 01:09:59,446
Out with the blanket.

624
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:03,366
You really need a blanket?

625
01:10:03,414 --> 01:10:05,211
I don't need one!

626
01:10:13,014 --> 01:10:16,086
Well... here's your blanket.

627
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,330
Eddie! Help!

628
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:29,003
Eddie!

629
01:10:29,054 --> 01:10:31,488
- Tina!
- Help me!

630
01:10:31,534 --> 01:10:33,126
Tina!

631
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:02,570
Oh... Jesus.

632
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:06,448
Eddie, swim!
Swim fast, it's a shark, Eddie.

633
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:07,643
Swim!

634
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:14,008
Oh, God. Eddie, swim!

635
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:16,488
Swim faster! Hurry!

636
01:11:16,534 --> 01:11:19,332
Come on! Swim!

637
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:22,844
Hurry, Eddie. It's a shark!

638
01:11:22,894 --> 01:11:26,603
Eddie, hurry! Faster! Come on. Swim!

639
01:11:26,654 --> 01:11:28,884
Hurry! Hurry, Eddie.

640
01:11:34,054 --> 01:11:35,169
Eddie!

641
01:11:53,694 --> 01:11:55,412
Tina...

642
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:08,086
Oh, Mama...

643
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:13,569
Please make it go away.

644
01:12:16,534 --> 01:12:18,172
Make it go away.

645
01:12:19,494 --> 01:12:21,450
Make it go away.

646
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:34,690
Honey, it's not your job any more.

647
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:36,531
I just wanna look.

648
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,362
Come on, get out of there! Come on.

649
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:23,893
- What happened to him?
- Embolism. Air bubbles in the blood.

650
01:13:23,934 --> 01:13:26,402
He came up too fast, Chief.

651
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:28,285
Something must have scared him.

652
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:30,052
He just panicked.

653
01:13:30,094 --> 01:13:32,847
Don't worry,
we're taking good care of him.

654
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:41,486
How did this happen?

655
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:44,048
Bite reflex, like a spasm.

656
01:13:44,094 --> 01:13:46,528
It happened after the kids went out.

657
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:48,371
What kids?

658
01:13:48,414 --> 01:13:52,327
Junior Vaughan,
Brookie Peters, Jackie, Mike...

659
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:53,966
Our Mike?

660
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:56,448
They're headed
for the lighthouse. Hey!

661
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:12,047
Look, Chief, you're not chief now.
I can't let you take her out.

662
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:15,564
Mrs Brody, look, you can't go.
Neither one of you can go.

663
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:17,809
- Get that line.
- Mike is out there.

664
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:21,005
But I signed for the boat.
Mrs Brody, please.

665
01:14:21,054 --> 01:14:25,093
Shit! Chief, go on up to the bow,
you're doing that wrong.

666
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:27,170
Go ahead, untie the bowline.

667
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,489
They can't fire both of us, right?

668
01:14:29,534 --> 01:14:31,490
Somebody's got to be in charge.

669
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:34,810
All right,
which direction do you wanna go?

670
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:37,448
You said something
about a lighthouse.

671
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:38,643
All right.

672
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:58,648
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

673
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,332
'This is Harbour Patrol. '

674
01:15:00,374 --> 01:15:03,571
Listen, do you think
you can raise me a chopper?

675
01:15:03,614 --> 01:15:06,606
'Is that you Brody? Not right away.

676
01:15:06,654 --> 01:15:08,565
'It's out checking a buoy. '

677
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:10,525
Get it out to the lighthouse.

678
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:14,249
There's some kids sailing out there.
I want them back in port.

679
01:15:14,294 --> 01:15:17,650
'Affirmative.
Turn the kids back to port.

680
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:19,764
'I heard you. Patrol out. '

681
01:15:19,814 --> 01:15:21,691
Brody out.

682
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,522
Hurry up, suckers, you're dragging!

683
01:15:39,854 --> 01:15:44,644
Hey, let's go past the lighthouse.
I know a better spot. Come about.

684
01:15:44,694 --> 01:15:46,366
You got it!

685
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:19,766
I got it, Chief.

686
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:47,083
It's all right. Come on.

687
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:49,813
It's OK.

688
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:53,091
It's all right.

689
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:54,283
No.

690
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,972
No.

691
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,368
Ellen.

692
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:03,329
No, no.

693
01:18:06,894 --> 01:18:08,850
Tina, Tina...

694
01:18:08,894 --> 01:18:11,488
Tina, it's OK.

695
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:13,525
- It's still there.
- What is?

696
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:15,166
What's still there?

697
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:17,853
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

698
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:19,612
Shark!

699
01:18:21,014 --> 01:18:22,811
It's still there.

700
01:18:46,574 --> 01:18:49,850
That boat will take you in.
Where the hell are they?

701
01:18:49,894 --> 01:18:52,931
Ten degrees off your starboard.
Take a heading...

702
01:18:52,974 --> 01:18:54,453
Not that shit! Point!

703
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:55,609
There.

704
01:18:55,654 --> 01:18:57,963
All right, I got it.

705
01:19:15,174 --> 01:19:18,405
Mr Christian! Mr Christian!

706
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:22,447
Pump up this boat! And shave off
that dreadful moustache.

707
01:19:22,494 --> 01:19:26,931
England expects every man
to do his duty. Fire when ready!

708
01:19:27,014 --> 01:19:30,006
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!

709
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:33,205
This will be our finest hour.

710
01:19:35,494 --> 01:19:37,086
Oh, shit.

711
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:39,887
Hey, Bligh, someone pop your balloon?

712
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:42,368
No problem, no problem.

713
01:20:12,294 --> 01:20:14,046
Balance the boat!

714
01:20:28,254 --> 01:20:30,290
Watch out!

715
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:34,726
Do something!

716
01:20:40,574 --> 01:20:42,007
Timmy! Brooke!

717
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:43,652
Hey! Look out.

718
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:50,006
Where is it?

719
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:53,171
- Get me out of here!
- I'll get you out.

720
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:54,363
Larry!

721
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,689
Larry! Turn!

722
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:58,965
Turn!

723
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:05,966
It's OK.

724
01:21:09,014 --> 01:21:12,290
- Hurry up!
- Mike's out there.

725
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,006
Out of the water.

726
01:21:18,214 --> 01:21:21,126
Somebody look out for Mike!

727
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:23,733
Hang on to something!

728
01:21:23,774 --> 01:21:26,163
Mike, get out of there!

729
01:21:27,254 --> 01:21:29,085
Hold on!

730
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:34,527
Oh, my God.

731
01:21:34,574 --> 01:21:36,326
Mike!

732
01:21:37,374 --> 01:21:39,365
Brody!

733
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:40,688
That's it.

734
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:45,087
- Get his arm.
- Come on.

735
01:21:47,094 --> 01:21:48,766
Pull his jacket!

736
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:54,528
Get him clear, it's coming up.

737
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:00,372
Come on! Come on!

738
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:10,131
Shit!

739
01:22:38,614 --> 01:22:40,411
He's bleeding pretty bad.

740
01:22:43,054 --> 01:22:45,488
We got to get Mike to a doctor.

741
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:47,172
Can you sail?

742
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:49,330
Yeah. We'll take him in.

743
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:51,012
OK. Get some help here fast.

744
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:52,806
Let's go.

745
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:11,050
Let's wrap this mess up.

746
01:23:12,294 --> 01:23:14,364
Throw this to Brooke.

747
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:17,768
Brooke, get this
and throw it to Mark.

748
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:23,012
Here, take it.

749
01:23:23,054 --> 01:23:25,966
Tie a bowline around your mast.

750
01:23:28,494 --> 01:23:29,973
Easy.

751
01:23:30,014 --> 01:23:31,686
Come on, pull.

752
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:33,611
I don't know if it'll hold.

753
01:23:33,654 --> 01:23:35,770
All right. Someone put a fender up.

754
01:23:35,814 --> 01:23:38,044
We could use another hand on this.

755
01:23:38,094 --> 01:23:39,766
Take it easy. Just pull.

756
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,646
Tie it off. All right.

757
01:24:14,894 --> 01:24:17,010
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

758
01:24:17,774 --> 01:24:19,969
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

759
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,606
Do you read me?

760
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:24,168
'This is Air Patrol.
That you, Brody?'

761
01:24:24,214 --> 01:24:27,126
Yeah. Do you have
a fix on those kids?

762
01:24:27,174 --> 01:24:28,926
'Negative. I'm still down. '

763
01:24:28,974 --> 01:24:32,284
Get the hell up
because I'm out here alone.

764
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:34,484
'Brody, I got to switch frequencies.

765
01:24:34,534 --> 01:24:37,924
'Call my boss.
I'll meet you by Francis Shoal. Out. '

766
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:42,932
Francis Shoal?
Where the hell is Francis Shoal?

767
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:58,010
Shit.

768
01:24:58,054 --> 01:25:00,204
I'm all alone out here.

769
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:41,891
Anyone want to play charades?

770
01:25:44,094 --> 01:25:45,083
No.

771
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:49,246
All we have to do is land
at Cable Junction and wait.

772
01:25:49,294 --> 01:25:51,683
How will we do that on this garbage?

773
01:25:54,614 --> 01:25:56,764
What's after Cable Junction?

774
01:25:56,814 --> 01:25:59,806
The Atlantic. Then Ireland.

775
01:26:03,494 --> 01:26:05,769
God, I'm hungry.

776
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:36,611
Air Patrol to Base.

777
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:40,329
I have a positive location
on that sailing party.

778
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:42,524
Disabled and adrift,

779
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:46,044
about three quarters of a mile west
of Cable Junction,

780
01:26:46,094 --> 01:26:48,688
wind and tide carrying them due east.

781
01:27:35,014 --> 01:27:37,084
Is everyone OK? Is anybody hurt?

782
01:27:37,134 --> 01:27:38,203
No!

783
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:40,529
I'll tow you to Cable Junction,

784
01:27:40,574 --> 01:27:43,168
then call the Coast Guard.

785
01:27:45,054 --> 01:27:46,965
Throw me a line.

786
01:27:47,014 --> 01:27:49,369
Take it easy. Here we go.

787
01:27:49,414 --> 01:27:51,882
- Oh, what a day
- Here you go!

788
01:28:01,334 --> 01:28:02,687
OK.

789
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:07,248
- Now, hold on to something.
- OK.

790
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:09,569
- Hurry up!
- Better hang on.

791
01:30:05,334 --> 01:30:06,847
Sean.

792
01:30:06,894 --> 01:30:09,613
- Sean!
- Sean!

793
01:30:11,214 --> 01:30:12,932
Sean!

794
01:30:13,894 --> 01:30:15,327
Sean!

795
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:17,813
Get him in the boat.

796
01:30:19,334 --> 01:30:20,847
- Sean!
- Come on!

797
01:30:20,894 --> 01:30:22,213
Get aboard.

798
01:30:22,254 --> 01:30:24,165
- Hurry!
- Come on.

799
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,852
Come on.

800
01:30:33,774 --> 01:30:35,651
I can't get up.

801
01:30:39,854 --> 01:30:41,412
No!

802
01:30:45,174 --> 01:30:46,163
No!

803
01:30:50,214 --> 01:30:53,286
Take her to the hospital
and meet me at the office.

804
01:30:57,174 --> 01:30:59,529
Try to understand my position...

805
01:30:59,574 --> 01:31:01,804
Tina will be all right. Are you OK?

806
01:31:03,294 --> 01:31:06,013
Ellen, I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.

807
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:07,726
I was only thinking of...

808
01:31:07,774 --> 01:31:09,924
I don't give a damn what you think.

809
01:31:09,974 --> 01:31:13,762
A boy is dead and my son and husband
are still out there.

810
01:31:59,054 --> 01:32:01,773
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

811
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:10,085
Amity Launch to Harbour...

812
01:32:11,654 --> 01:32:13,053
Damn it!

813
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,323
Sean, catch the rope!

814
01:32:22,374 --> 01:32:25,366
- Come on, the rope!
- Sean!

815
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:27,006
Sean, catch the rope!

816
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:28,772
Sean, the rope!

817
01:32:28,814 --> 01:32:32,489
- Come on, Sean!
- Come on, Sean!

818
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:34,013
Come on!

819
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:35,123
Sean!

820
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:37,085
Sean, catch the rope!

821
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:38,692
The rope, Sean!

822
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:40,372
Come on, Sean!

823
01:32:40,414 --> 01:32:43,053
Come on!
You've gotta help or it won't work.

824
01:32:43,094 --> 01:32:44,732
Will you stop?

825
01:32:44,774 --> 01:32:47,208
Come on, Sean, wake up!

826
01:32:47,774 --> 01:32:49,366
Pick it up!

827
01:32:51,054 --> 01:32:52,373
Sean!

828
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,052
Sean, goddamn it.

829
01:32:55,094 --> 01:32:58,131
Sean, listen to me
or I'll break your ass!

830
01:33:02,334 --> 01:33:03,562
OK, come on.

831
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,130
OK, Sean, now listen.

832
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:10,371
We'll throw you this rope
and you better catch it.

833
01:33:10,414 --> 01:33:12,052
Sean, you ready?

834
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:14,050
Here it comes, kid.

835
01:33:18,294 --> 01:33:20,012
Get it, Sean.

836
01:33:20,054 --> 01:33:22,204
Sean, get it.

837
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:24,449
Come on, get it.

838
01:33:24,494 --> 01:33:27,930
Good. Now tie it around
the centreboard.

839
01:33:27,974 --> 01:33:29,771
Tie it tight.

840
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:33,767
You ready? Hang on.

841
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:35,088
Hold on.

842
01:33:35,134 --> 01:33:36,806
Hang on, OK?

843
01:33:36,854 --> 01:33:38,890
Here we go. Hold on tight.

844
01:33:49,054 --> 01:33:50,533
OK, kid.

845
01:33:52,094 --> 01:33:54,050
Take it easy.

846
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:57,732
Come on.

847
01:33:57,774 --> 01:33:59,173
OK.

848
01:34:02,774 --> 01:34:05,242
- Get him out!
- Come on.

849
01:34:15,054 --> 01:34:17,204
Oh, God. Are you OK, kid?

850
01:34:17,254 --> 01:34:19,370
I thought we lost you.

851
01:34:26,414 --> 01:34:28,245
Cable Junction's ahead.

852
01:34:29,014 --> 01:34:31,289
- Can we make it?
- I don't know.

853
01:34:31,334 --> 01:34:33,643
- Hey, I was just asking!
- I know.

854
01:34:36,614 --> 01:34:38,206
How's she doing?

855
01:34:38,254 --> 01:34:40,165
Just got to keep her warm.

856
01:34:43,334 --> 01:34:45,768
Somebody help me
and we could steer this.

857
01:34:47,134 --> 01:34:49,443
What are you playing
with a tube for?

858
01:34:49,494 --> 01:34:51,405
- If everyone...
- Shut up!

859
01:34:51,454 --> 01:34:54,412
I'm sorry
but I can't stop thinking about this!

860
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:55,967
Well, you better try!

861
01:34:56,014 --> 01:34:58,767
Oh, God, please help.

862
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,612
Jesus...

863
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,406
Holy Mary,

864
01:35:03,454 --> 01:35:05,331
Mother of Christ,

865
01:35:05,374 --> 01:35:07,046
please help us.

866
01:35:08,974 --> 01:35:10,885
Please help us.

867
01:35:12,054 --> 01:35:13,726
We're begging.

868
01:35:17,374 --> 01:35:19,490
Please save us.

869
01:36:19,494 --> 01:36:21,450
Oh, thank Christ.

870
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,729
Here, take that back to the cleat.

871
01:36:35,934 --> 01:36:38,164
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

872
01:36:38,214 --> 01:36:40,728
- Sure?
- A shark hit us.

873
01:36:40,774 --> 01:36:42,651
Sean's out there.

874
01:36:42,694 --> 01:36:46,084
- What?
- He wanted to come.

875
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:47,408
Where are they?

876
01:36:47,454 --> 01:36:51,049
They're in the current
heading for Cable Junction.

877
01:36:51,094 --> 01:36:54,564
All right, get to the lighthouse
and stay there, OK?

878
01:36:54,614 --> 01:36:57,208
- Stay there.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

879
01:36:57,254 --> 01:36:59,893
Forget it.
Just get to the lighthouse.

880
01:37:09,174 --> 01:37:11,688
- We're almost there.
- It's not gonna work.

881
01:37:11,734 --> 01:37:13,770
Come on, more to port.

882
01:37:13,814 --> 01:37:15,884
Keep it going. We'll make it.

883
01:37:16,734 --> 01:37:18,645
More to port, goddamn it!

884
01:37:18,694 --> 01:37:20,525
All the way over.

885
01:37:21,494 --> 01:37:25,089
Larry, are we going to make it
to the island?

886
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:27,364
We're steering for it, kid.

887
01:37:28,294 --> 01:37:30,205
But the wind drift is lateral.

888
01:37:30,254 --> 01:37:31,687
What does that mean?

889
01:37:31,734 --> 01:37:35,044
It means that we're going sideways.
We're going that way.

890
01:37:35,094 --> 01:37:37,608
- We were heading right for it.
- Not now.

891
01:37:37,654 --> 01:37:40,612
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

892
01:37:51,494 --> 01:37:53,485
Wait! Stop paddling.

893
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:56,446
- What about the island?
- The shark!

894
01:38:20,774 --> 01:38:23,652
- What's happening?
- I think we're stuck.

895
01:38:23,694 --> 01:38:25,685
It's just the bottom.

896
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:28,328
- It's that thing.
- It's just the bottom.

897
01:38:28,374 --> 01:38:33,164
No, it's not the bottom.
It's that thing! It's gonna kill us!

898
01:38:33,214 --> 01:38:34,613
Jackie, shut up!

899
01:38:34,654 --> 01:38:38,533
- No! It's going to kill us!
- Shut up! Shut up!

900
01:38:38,574 --> 01:38:40,212
Leave her alone!

901
01:38:40,254 --> 01:38:42,165
Then you take care of her.

902
01:38:42,214 --> 01:38:45,092
- She's hysterical, beating...
- Sit down.

903
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:46,647
Be quiet!

904
01:38:47,894 --> 01:38:49,373
Shut up!

905
01:38:49,414 --> 01:38:50,847
Listen!

906
01:38:50,894 --> 01:38:53,328
- She shouldn't freak out.
- Listen!

907
01:38:55,414 --> 01:38:57,211
You hear it?

908
01:39:09,774 --> 01:39:12,493
Over there! It's coming towards us.

909
01:39:15,814 --> 01:39:17,167
It's Dad! Dad!

910
01:39:24,574 --> 01:39:25,973
Dad!

911
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:47,447
Oh, cool. Cool, come on...

912
01:40:04,694 --> 01:40:06,764
Pull yourselves over
and we'll get out of here.

913
01:40:06,814 --> 01:40:10,409
We can't.
We're stuck on the bottom here.

914
01:40:10,454 --> 01:40:12,206
I'll get you closer.
We'll come aboard.

915
01:40:12,254 --> 01:40:15,166
- Pull us alongside.
- Please hurry!

916
01:40:15,214 --> 01:40:17,091
All right, hold it steady.

917
01:40:18,614 --> 01:40:19,967
Oh, sh...!

918
01:40:31,014 --> 01:40:32,003
Wait!

919
01:40:38,094 --> 01:40:39,413
Dad!

920
01:40:50,614 --> 01:40:52,650
I'm all right. Hold on.

921
01:41:01,334 --> 01:41:04,167
All right,
take this and I'll get you over.

922
01:41:10,454 --> 01:41:12,410
- All right, tie it on.
- OK.

923
01:41:22,734 --> 01:41:25,965
All right,
pull these hooks over with the rope.

924
01:41:26,014 --> 01:41:30,132
Secure them to the raft then I'll
pull you back with the winch, OK?

925
01:41:30,174 --> 01:41:31,607
OK.

926
01:41:57,014 --> 01:41:58,811
All right, pull it over.

927
01:42:11,574 --> 01:42:12,973
It's stuck.

928
01:42:13,014 --> 01:42:16,609
Wait a minute, I'll put...
I'll put it in reverse.

929
01:42:59,014 --> 01:43:00,333
Lucy!

930
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:03,366
Lucy, look out!

931
01:43:03,414 --> 01:43:06,326
Oh, my God! No! No!

932
01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:11,086
Lucy!

933
01:43:19,614 --> 01:43:21,445
No!

934
01:43:22,254 --> 01:43:24,722
Oh, my God! No!

935
01:43:24,774 --> 01:43:25,923
Dad!

936
01:43:27,774 --> 01:43:29,287
Hold on!

937
01:43:57,734 --> 01:43:59,326
Dad!

938
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:07,893
Get away!

939
01:44:07,934 --> 01:44:09,413
No!

940
01:44:12,894 --> 01:44:14,532
Get away!

941
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:29,407
No!

942
01:44:35,934 --> 01:44:36,923
Sean!

943
01:45:35,494 --> 01:45:38,406
- Where'd he go?
- Where is he?

944
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:01,403
- There he is!
- Over there.

945
01:46:13,974 --> 01:46:16,044
What the hell are you doing?

946
01:46:20,454 --> 01:46:22,172
Get out of there!

947
01:46:24,214 --> 01:46:26,364
He's heading right for you!

948
01:46:30,854 --> 01:46:33,414
All right, you big bastard, come on.

949
01:46:34,094 --> 01:46:35,925
I got something for you now.

950
01:46:38,414 --> 01:46:42,168
That's it! That a boy! Come on!

951
01:46:42,214 --> 01:46:43,567
Right over here!

952
01:46:43,614 --> 01:46:45,172
Dad!

953
01:46:45,214 --> 01:46:47,250
That's it. Come on.

954
01:46:47,294 --> 01:46:50,923
No! Get out of the way!

955
01:46:52,054 --> 01:46:53,203
Don't do it!

956
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,883
Get away! Get away!

957
01:46:56,934 --> 01:46:58,765
Dad! Watch out!

958
01:46:58,814 --> 01:46:59,803
Come on!

959
01:46:59,854 --> 01:47:01,685
Look out!

960
01:47:01,734 --> 01:47:03,133
Open wide!

961
01:47:03,174 --> 01:47:05,608
Open wide, say "ah"!

962
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:37,605
He did it. He got it!

963
01:48:02,254 --> 01:48:05,644
He did it! He did it! He did it!

964
01:48:05,694 --> 01:48:08,208
Did he get it? It's dead?

965
01:48:08,254 --> 01:48:10,245
It's dead!

966
01:48:19,454 --> 01:48:21,285
Oh, thank you.

967
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:24,053
Thank you,
thank you, thank you...

968
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:41,012
- And you...
- They made me go with them.

969
01:48:45,974 --> 01:48:47,168
Sure they did!
