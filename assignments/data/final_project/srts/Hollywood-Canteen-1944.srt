“Welcome to Hollywood," and. "Thanks.“

At first, it looked like a
kind of an abandoned dump...

944
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:20,429
...so we sent a circular around
to all the movie folks...

945
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:22,434
...and asked them to pitch in and help.

blueprints and plans.</i>

and brushes and made the place like new.</i>
