1
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:51,925
-Jer, clean or dirty?
-Marginal.

2
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,360
No, it's not.

3
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,508
I don't know why you use that thing.
I mean, if it's for me, it's not necessary.

4
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:09,479
-Of course, I do like to watch you use it.
-I know.

5
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:15,284
Listen, I think we should wait
with the powder room.

6
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,553
Nope, no more waiting for toilets.

7
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:22,654
I just don't like to see you worrying
about loans and mortgages, that's all.

8
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,324
Then don't look.

9
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:29,596
I don't think we should spend money--

10
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:31,902
No more thinking tonight! Let's watch TV.

11
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,406
Is there any good mail today?

12
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,846
A couple of junk, some bills,
and a letter for you.

13
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,990
Read this.

14
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,557
"God grants you an interview.

15
00:02:57,634 --> 00:03:00,068
"1600 North Hope Street,
Los Angeles, California.

16
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:03,765
"Room 2700. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m."

17
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:07,109
It's a gag.

18
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:11,672
No stamp, no return address?
Pretty crazy gag.

19
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,013
-It's an ad.
-For what?

20
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:20,178
For God oven cleaner, or God detergent,
or I don't know.

21
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,814
Nobody would dare.

22
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,163
Air ball.

23
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,270
Artie Coogan.

24
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:40,101
-What?
-Artie Coogan, that's it.

25
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:41,436
Yeah.

26
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,043
Crazy Artie.

27
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:47,344
No, an English teacher
wouldn't misspell "interview."

28
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,813
Neither would God.

29
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:56,049
I can't meet him tomorrow. I've got
to meet the District Produce Manager.

30
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,093
-Sorry, God.
-Two points.

31
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,594
Did we make love last night?

32
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:11,796
Just checking.

33
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,032
Keep checking.

34
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,377
I love you.

35
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,497
Honey, it's so late.

36
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,043
That was two points.

37
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,908
-Wash your hands, Norman.
-We were just....

38
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,604
Good morning, Mr. McCarthy.
I'm sorry to be late, sir.

39
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,670
Landers. Hold it.

40
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,751
Is this how you've instructed your staff
to prepare romaine lettuce for display?

41
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,052
I know what you're getting at,
and I had the same argument...

42
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:11,116
-...with the last district manager.
-Please answer.

43
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,161
Yes, I do.

44
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,730
Why would anyone buy that...

45
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:24,762
...when they could get this
for the same price?

46
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:30,301
Mr. McCarthy, if I put this head of lettuce
in the bin, it's going to stay there all day...

47
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,904
...it'll be there tomorrow
and the next day...

48
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,007
...and we will wind up
throwing it away.

49
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,142
Our other stores--

50
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,245
They do not have a Ralph's up the street
and a Lucky Market...

51
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:42,086
...right around the corner
who trim even closer than I do.

52
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,752
Now, I know my customers, Mr. McCarthy.

53
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:47,790
I see.

54
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:00,869
Landers?

55
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:05,177
I also noticed that you haven't been
oiling your cukes.

56
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:08,977
-What?
-Why haven't you been oiling your cukes?

57
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:15,650
It takes time, it takes oil,
it's dishonest, Mr. McCarthy.

58
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,694
-Dishonest?
-Sir, there's an interview that I--

59
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,696
Look, our company has
certain policies, which--

60
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,561
I have an interview with....

61
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,725
You have a what?

62
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:28,561
Thank you very much.

63
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,717
<i>Stay.</i>

64
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:58,490
What is this?

65
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,021
<i>You're right on time, I like that.</i>
<i>Close the door.</i>

66
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,601
-Who are you?
<i>-You read the note.</i>

67
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,039
-Who is that, Artie?
<i>-God.</i>

68
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,107
-Come on, Artie.
<i>-No, it's me, God.</i>

69
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:21,248
-God?
<i>-Right, God.</i>

70
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,449
<i>God Almighty, Big "G".</i>

71
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,823
<i>It's not a gag, I promise.</i>

72
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,234
<i>-Where you going?</i>
-I've got this load of plums coming in.

73
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,501
<i>Let the plums wait.</i>
<i>How often do you talk with God?</i>

74
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,301
Practically never.

75
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,345
How do I know you're God?
All I hear is a voice on an intercom.

76
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,582
<i>You're not allowed to see me.</i>

77
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,091
-Why not?
<i>-Because.</i>

78
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,325
-That's no answer.
<i>-Sue me.</i>

79
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,089
-If you're God....
<i>-Yeah?</i>

80
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,328
-If you're really God....
<i>-Yeah?</i>

81
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:18,305
<i>If I'm really God, what?</i>

82
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,774
<i>-You leaving?</i>
-Right the first time.

83
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,372
<i>Where are you leaving?</i>
<i>Where do you think you are?</i>

84
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,317
What do you mean, where?
Right here is where, that's where.

85
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:35,153
<i>-And where is here?</i>
-1600 North Hope Street, Room 2700.

86
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,755
<i>Jerry.</i>

87
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,657
<i>There's no Room 2700 in this building.</i>

88
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,893
<i>There's no 27th floor here.</i>

89
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:51,496
<i>I thought, this way</i>
<i>we'd have a little privacy.</i>

90
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:54,465
<i>Check it out, Go ahead, I'll wait.</i>

91
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,632
-Sir?
-Yes, sir?

92
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,332
How do I get to the 27th floor?

93
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,704
-In this building?
-Yeah.

94
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:29,438
I'm afraid you'd need a can opener.
We only have 17 floors.

95
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,978
Seventeen.

96
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,020
<i>Have a nice ride?</i>

97
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:54,924
<i>Come in.</i>

98
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,256
<i>Close the door.</i>

99
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,168
<i>Sit down.</i>

100
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,750
<i>Go ahead.</i>

101
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,952
<i>Relax.</i>

102
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,994
<i>Don't smoke.</i>

103
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:30,798
-I don't.
<i>-Good.</i>

104
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,325
<i>Tobacco was one of my big mistakes.</i>

105
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,998
-Mistakes?
<i>-You try.</i>

106
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,909
<i>Ostriches were a mistake.</i>
<i>Silly looking things, Avocados.</i>

107
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:47,142
<i>Made the pit too big, Like I say, "You try."</i>

108
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,578
<i>You still don't believe it?</i>

109
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:56,482
Artie, if this is you, you win.

110
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,220
-This is the best gag you've ever pulled.
<i>-I'm not Artie.</i>

111
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:04,027
<i>Went to a lot of trouble to make it</i>
<i>a comfortable interview.</i>

112
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,990
You misspelled it, you know.

113
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:07,797
<i>-What?</i>
-"Interview."

114
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,267
In your note.

115
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:13,975
It's "I"....

116
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:18,138
It's "I" before "E."

117
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:23,308
<i>Give me a break, A few things, I got right.</i>
<i>I put summer before winter, didn't I?</i>

118
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,522
<i>You're scared.</i>

119
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:31,155
Well, sure. But look, if this is a joke,
it's gone too far.

120
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,693
<i>It's no joke.</i>

121
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:37,856
How come you've got such a....
Just a voice, like everybody's?

122
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,533
<i>Empathy, I'm talking to you</i>
<i>in a way you can accept.</i>

123
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,360
<i>I'm relating.</i>

124
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,405
<i>I don't like to brag</i>,
<i>but if I appeared to you just as God...</i>

125
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:51,435
<i>...how I really am, what I really am</i>,
<i>your mind couldn't grasp it.</i>

126
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,816
I think you made a mistake.
I'm not religious.

127
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,009
<i>So?</i>

128
00:14:56,085 --> 00:15:00,419
I'm not one of your believers.
And I sure as heck don't believe this.

129
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,890
<i>That's why I showed up.</i>
<i>Too many nonbelievers.</i>

130
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:07,887
But I read in an article
that religion is on the upswing.

131
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:12,730
<i>Religion is easy, I'm talking about faith.</i>
<i>You're going to help me change that.</i>

132
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,391
Me?

133
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,962
-I don't belong to any church.
<i>-Neither do I.</i>

134
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:22,040
<i>Go back to work.</i>
<i>I don't want you to get in trouble.</i>

135
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,410
Thank you.

136
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,215
<i>We'll talk on the way.</i>

137
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:31,250
-How?
<i>-Trust me, Like it says on the money.</i>

138
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,831
Sir? Are you all right, sir?

139
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,100
No.

140
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,138
<i>Jerry.</i>

141
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,714
<i>-You want me to talk louder?</i>
-Oh, God.

142
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:08,078
<i>I thought you didn't believe in me?</i>

143
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:10,625
That's just an expression.

144
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,628
<i>I'm more than that</i>,
<i>and I want you to spread the word.</i>

145
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,822
Me?

146
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:18,863
-Spread what word?
<i>-That I am, I exist.</i>

147
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,300
<i>That we've spoken.</i>

148
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:25,638
You want me to tell people
that I've spoken with God?

149
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,239
<i>-Yes.</i>
-They'll put me away.

150
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,676
<i>I'm tired of all the talk that I may be dead</i>,
<i>or that I never was at all.</i>

151
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:36,548
<i>Or that God was just</i>
<i>particles of cosmos, Gas.</i>

152
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:40,217
<i>I'm not gas, I found that very insulting.</i>

153
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:45,626
-Do you actually expect people to believe--
<i>-That's your job.</i>

154
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:50,896
But I'm just a man. I'm no Moses.

155
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:54,629
<i>What was Moses?</i>
<i>Do you think Moses was born on Page 1?</i>

156
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,201
<i>Moses was just a messenger</i>,
<i>my messenger.</i>

157
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,208
Look....

158
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,772
God, if....

159
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,875
If I tell people
that I spoke with God, they....

160
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,925
<i>And now an oldie but a goodie</i>,
<i>Jerry Gray and</i> A String of Pearls,

161
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,566
God?

162
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,872
<i>Top-ten time on KGOD, What is it, Jerry?</i>

163
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,410
That guy on the motorcycle thinks
I'm a nut. Is that the kind of God you are?

164
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:49,616
-How come you didn't let him hear you?
<i>-That's a policy of mine.</i>

165
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:52,922
<i>I try not to work with</i>
<i>more than one savior at a time.</i>

166
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:55,259
Savior? Me?

167
00:17:55,931 --> 00:18:00,925
<i>-You do your job right....</i>
-I can't take this job. I don't believe--

168
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:05,370
<i>I know, but even nonbelievers want</i>
<i>what they've got down here to work.</i>

169
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:09,741
Have you read the papers lately?
It ain't working.

170
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:14,309
<i>That's why I came, to tell everybody</i>
<i>I set the world up so it can work.</i>

171
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:18,080
<i>Only, it's up to you.</i>
<i>You can't look to me to do it for you.</i>

172
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,344
No.

173
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,017
<i>You can do it, It's only one message.</i>

174
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:26,720
<i>-Moses had to handle ten.</i>
-But you gave him tablets.

175
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:29,696
<i>-He had a bad memory.</i>
-I need something.

176
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,832
<i>What kind of something?</i>

177
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:36,730
I don't know. Anything. A tape recording.

178
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:40,965
<i>My voice wouldn't come out on tape.</i>
<i>It's very complicated.</i>

179
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:45,403
<i>It's like, you know how Dracula</i>
<i>can't see himself in a mirror?</i>

180
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,412
<i>It's along those lines.</i>

181
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,677
If people could just hear your voice--

182
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:55,382
<i>This isn't even how I sound, I'm talking</i>
<i>like this so that you'll understand me.</i>

183
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:58,722
Understand? I don't understand anything.

184
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:01,622
<i>That's a beginning, Over and out.</i>

185
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:05,328
Hold it. Don't hang up on me.

186
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,061
<i>You just went through a red light.</i>
<i>You're going to get yourself killed.</i>

187
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,536
<i>I need you down here.</i>

188
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:19,903
I have some nice, fresh chicken soup.
Why don't you let me fix you a bowl?

189
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,193
Is that all I can get from you? Soup?

190
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,366
-You know what, darling?
-What?

191
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,473
Why don't you and I take a few days off
and go on a little holiday?

192
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,444
-A holiday?
-Yeah.

193
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:57,277
We could go to San Francisco.

194
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,316
You haven't even seen
your sister's new baby yet.

195
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:08,555
You don't want me to see my sister's baby.
You want me to see my sister's husband.

196
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,623
I am not crazy, and I don't need
some child psychiatrist to tell me...

197
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,602
...that I didn't talk to God, because I did.

198
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,443
-On an intercom.
-And on the car radio.

199
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,846
Yes, Jerry.

200
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:31,216
Do you remember when Artie Coogan
set up that hidden microphone...

201
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:34,949
...and he broadcast those filthy limericks
through the television set?

202
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,854
It was not Artie.

203
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,586
I know all of Artie's voices.

204
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:44,325
Artie is not capable of adding 10 stories
to a building that doesn't have them.

205
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,095
He cannot talk back and forth
through a car radio...

206
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:49,069
...that's been busted for two months.

207
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:52,573
Whoever the hell this guy is,
he's very smart.

208
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:54,940
And I'm going to listen to him.

209
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,946
-For a while.
-And you think it's God?

210
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:04,044
Well, he thinks he's God.
And I'm in no position to argue with him.

211
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:10,747
-I thought you believed in him.
-I do. I believe in God.

212
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:14,091
I just don't believe that he exists.
I mean, in the sense...

213
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:19,122
...that he repaints floor numbers in office
buildings or doubles as a disc jockey.

214
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,593
Well, that is what he does.

215
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:25,968
And he wants you
to give his message to the world?

216
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,099
Yes.

217
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:31,540
Jerry, does he know
how you feel about him?

218
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,916
I told him. Doesn't seem to bother him.

219
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:42,113
So is that all he told you?

220
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,658
That you're going to be the savior?

221
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:48,719
And that to tell everybody,
what we have down here can work?

222
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,086
Yes.

223
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:53,430
He also told me,
he's very disappointed in avocados.

224
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:57,668
-He is?
-He said he made the pit too big.

225
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,401
I am not crazy!

226
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,375
Jerry?

227
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:19,516
I let you sleep a little later.

228
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,196
I'll take the kids to school, okay?

229
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:27,858
How do you feel?

230
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,036
You know, about....

231
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:38,769
I almost forgot. I'm fine.

232
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,477
Good.

233
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,912
Because, you know, I was thinking...

234
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:50,321
...you didn't actually see,
all you did was hear.

235
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,994
And you know what they say.

236
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,928
-What?
-Seeing is believing.

237
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:57,726
Not hearing.

238
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:02,433
-What about Ingrid Bergman?
-Ingrid Bergman?

239
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,673
Joan of Arc. She played Joan of Arc.

240
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,743
Joan of Arc.

241
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:16,477
Joan didn't see either.
She just heard, like me.

242
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:28,289
<i>Jerry?</i>

243
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,592
-Oh, God.
<i>-That's right.</i>

244
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:40,437
-Is that you?
<i>-In person.</i>

245
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,736
-You're not on the radio?
<i>-Have you got a radio out here?</i>

246
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,343
-No.
<i>-Bingo.</i>

247
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,443
You're here?

248
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:56,450
-In my bathroom?
<i>-Come take a look.</i>

249
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:02,286
-I can't. I'm naked.
<i>-You think I don't know what you've got?</i>

250
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,896
That was another little goof of mine.
Shame.

251
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,062
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I thought we needed shame.</i>

252
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:11,537
<i>Come on out.</i>

253
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:26,010
<i>Don't catch cold.</i>

254
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:36,153
Not what you expected?

255
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:44,595
I picked a look you could understand.

256
00:24:44,673 --> 00:24:46,698
For someone else,
I would've looked different.

257
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:50,973
I could do any face, voice, whatever.
I could even be a woman.

258
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:56,410
-Feeling a little strange?
-Very strange.

259
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:58,586
Like you're going to faint?

260
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,182
You know what's good for that?

261
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:03,846
Shaving.

262
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:07,784
-Shaving?
-Sometimes when you don't feel normal...

263
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:10,387
...doing a normal thing
makes you feel normal.

264
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:11,659
Here, start shaving.

265
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:31,982
Go ahead.

266
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,309
I am.

267
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:34,946
I don't mean with the shaving...

268
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,651
...with the questions
that are popping into your head.

269
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:41,153
Yeah.

270
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,323
-Why me?
-Why not you?

271
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:49,194
You mean, there's no special--

272
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:53,105
Life is a crap shoot, like the millionth
customer who crosses a bridge...

273
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:55,404
...gets to shake hands with the governor.

274
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:58,613
You thought I picked you
because you're better than everybody?

275
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,669
I'm not?

276
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:02,046
You're better than some,
but not as good as others.

277
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:04,347
But you crossed the bridge
at the right time.

278
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:09,186
If you wanted to see me,
why didn't you just appear over my bed?

279
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:12,917
Hollywood. Next question.

280
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:24,233
People are always praying to you.
Do you listen?

281
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,008
I can't help hearing. I don't always listen.

282
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:31,206
-Then you don't care?
-Of course I care.

283
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,945
I care plenty. But what can I do?

284
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,006
What can you do?

285
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:37,909
You're God.

286
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:41,217
Only for the big picture.
I don't get into details.

287
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,757
Then whatever happens to us--

288
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,656
Happens. Here, I put in a new blade.

289
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:50,696
You mean, there's no plan...

290
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:54,030
...no scheme to guide our destinies?

291
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:59,133
-A lot of it is luck.
-Luck? Just luck?

292
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:04,207
Put on a little toilet paper.
I'll get you a piece.

293
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:12,085
-You don't control our lives?
-I gave you a world and everything in it.

294
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,451
It's all up to you.

295
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:19,391
-But we need help.
-That's why I gave you each other. Here.

296
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:25,260
With your powers,
you could solve so many problems.

297
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,067
Don't wet it.

298
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:31,564
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?

299
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:34,473
Did I do a good job on the Grand Canyon?

300
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,275
Anyway, why don't you?
Solve all our problems.

301
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:46,648
-Work a few miracles.
-I don't do miracles. They're too flashy.

302
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:49,047
And they upset the natural balance.

303
00:27:49,824 --> 00:27:52,657
No miracles? I knew it.

304
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:56,494
Maybe now and then,
just to keep my hand in.

305
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:59,829
The last miracle I did was the 1969 Mets.

306
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:03,732
Before that,
I think you have to go back to the Red Sea.

307
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:05,696
That was a beauty.

308
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:09,671
No offense,
but I don't believe the Red Sea...

309
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,907
...and I don't believe
six days to create the world.

310
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,445
You're right.

311
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,444
-I am?
-Tell you the truth...

312
00:28:16,518 --> 00:28:20,215
...I thought about it for five days
and did the whole job in one.

313
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,153
I'm really best under pressure.

314
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:27,587
-One day to create the world?
-And the sun. I hate to work in the dark.

315
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,427
You have to remember...

316
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:32,796
...that one of my days
is not exactly one of yours.

317
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:33,891
How long are they?

318
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,404
When I got up this morning,
Sigmund Freud was still in medical school.

319
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:47,177
-If you're so involved with us....
-Yeah?

320
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:51,016
How can you permit all the suffering
that goes on in the world?

321
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:54,778
-How can I permit the suffering?
-Yeah.

322
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:57,347
I don't permit the suffering. You do.

323
00:28:57,425 --> 00:29:00,326
Free will. All the choices are yours.

324
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:03,096
Choices? What choices?

325
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:07,700
You can love, cherish and nurture
each other, or you can kill each other.

326
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,671
Incidentally, "kill" is the word.
It's not "waste."

327
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,667
If I meant "waste," I would have written,
"Thou shalt not waste."

328
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:18,473
You're doing some very funny things
with words here.

329
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:23,347
You're also turning the sky into mud.
I look down, I don't believe the filth.

330
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:27,379
Using rivers for toilets,
poisoning my fishes.

331
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:32,455
You want a miracle?
You make a fish from scratch. You can't.

332
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,788
You think only God can make a tree?
Try coming up with a mackerel.

333
00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:39,994
And when the last one is gone,
that'll be that.

334
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:45,128
Eighty-six on the fishes. Good-bye, sky.
So long, world. Over and out.

335
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,701
-I thought you said we would make it.
-I said, you have to make it work.

336
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,844
-You don't care.
-I do care.

337
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:57,711
-Then do something about it.
-I did. I got you to carry the ball.

338
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:05,048
-I got no ball. How can I carry it?
-I gave you a mouth, didn't l?

339
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,154
Tell people how I feel, what I said.

340
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:11,062
How do I do that?

341
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,566
How did you get to be
an assistant manager?

342
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:16,627
Did you ever hear of
newspapers, reporters?

343
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:21,269
You got a scoop here, an exclusive,
a hold-the-presses.

344
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:22,767
Fine.

345
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:28,779
And how do I convince anybody
that I've actually seen you?

346
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,546
-That you exist?
-Simple.

347
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:35,282
Show them this.

348
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:50,630
-Your card?
-No, it's not my card. It's God's card.

349
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,632
-It's God's card?
-Look at it.

350
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,168
I am.

351
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:59,608
-Do you know where I got it?
-At a novelty store?

352
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:03,248
-God gave it to me.
-Did he?

353
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,222
-May I ask when and where you got it?
-This morning, in my bathroom.

354
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:12,953
God visited you in your bathroom
this morning?

355
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:14,153
Yes.

356
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,795
Sounds crazy to you, doesn't it?

357
00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:21,224
Yesterday,
he was just a voice on an intercom...

358
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:23,532
...and then he was on the radio.

359
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,839
-God spoke to you on the radio?
-In my car.

360
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:28,703
-What station?
-All stations.

361
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:33,270
Right. And then this morning,
he showed up in your bathroom?

362
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:34,739
Yes.

363
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:39,779
Why do you suppose
the Almighty spoke to you, Mr.--

364
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:41,845
-Landers.
-Mr. Landers.

365
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:46,326
Jerry Landers. He said that he wanted
me to be his messenger, like Moses.

366
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:51,388
What sort of work do you do, Mr. Landers?

367
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:54,401
I'm the assistant manager
of Food World in Burbank.

368
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,528
I see. Then you don't speak
to God every day.

369
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:01,107
Never before yesterday.

370
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:09,547
Did God say why he needed a messenger...

371
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:14,281
-...at this particular time, Mr. Landers?
-Yes, he was very specific.

372
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,954
He said that he wanted us to know
that it can work.

373
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:23,090
-What "it" is that?
-Us "it."

374
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:26,797
Our lives, our world, everything.

375
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:32,135
He says that he's given us everything
that we need, and it's entirely up to us.

376
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:36,266
-And those were his exact words?
-Close enough. You can print that.

377
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:39,938
Did God specify the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>?

378
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,746
That was my idea.

379
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,609
Well, we're very grateful.

380
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,347
I'm not a nut.

381
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:52,290
-I didn't say that you were.
-I'm not even religious.

382
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:56,423
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Landers,
for bringing us this story.

383
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:58,522
Look, don't brush me off.

384
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:03,335
Do me a favor, and look at that card again.
Take a good hard look at it.

385
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:04,933
Certainly.

386
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:11,373
Now, does that look like something
I'd get at a novelty shop?

387
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:12,871
Yes.

388
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:34,660
Norman, did you just put a bag of potatoes
on top of that white bread?

389
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,033
No, sir.

390
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,642
-I think you did.
<i>-Mr, Landers, please come to Aisle 10.</i>

391
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:46,407
<i>Aisle 10, please.</i>

392
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:48,875
Did you hear that, Norman?

393
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,714
Yes, never put a bag of potatoes
on top of a white bread.

394
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:54,414
No, the page. I was just paged.
Did you hear that?

395
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:57,253
I didn't hear anything. Did l?

396
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,718
We'll get you a new white bread, ma'am.
Take care of it.

397
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:09,461
God?

398
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:14,672
Chemicals, all chemicals.
Turning kids into garbage cans.

399
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,679
Jerry, I didn't see one word
in the newspapers.

400
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:20,043
Of course not.

401
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:23,606
That guy at the <i>Times</i> kept looking
at me like I was some kind of lunatic.

402
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:24,878
And I felt like one.

403
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:29,221
-Did you show him my card?
-Sure I did.

404
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,748
And he said, "You can get one of those
in any novelty store."

405
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:38,121
Here. You know, I really felt like an idiot.
Please, don't do that to me again.

406
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,802
-You said what I said?
-Absolutely.

407
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,062
And they didn't find God's word
fit to print?

408
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:48,942
Some tough cookies, boy.

409
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,668
-Did you get the Coke?
-Yes.

410
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,406
I have Cup-a-Soup.

411
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,078
-Good morning, Mrs. Levin.
-Hi.

412
00:34:57,151 --> 00:34:59,051
-Mrs. Green.
-Hi, Jerry.

413
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:02,012
You know, I'd like you to meet....

414
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:09,489
-You did it to me again.
-What'd she do?

415
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,525
What?

416
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:15,567
Nothing.

417
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,161
-Can I help you ladies?
-No.

418
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,867
-We're all right.
-Yes, thank you.

419
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,204
-What was that all about?
-I don't know.

420
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:33,809
-Why did you change on me?
-Why did you start to introduce me?

421
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,049
I don't want to be
the only guy in the world--

422
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:39,092
Look, I can't make appearances all over.
Don't you understand?

423
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,527
-No, I don't.
-People would drop dead from hysterics.

424
00:35:42,663 --> 00:35:45,063
-Mr. Landers?
-This place is too busy.

425
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:47,426
Can you sign this, please?

426
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:49,828
<i>Jerry?</i>

427
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:52,728
<i>Up here.</i>

428
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:57,104
<i>-Let's go for a ride.</i>
-I'll meet you.

429
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,806
-Where?
-What? Not you.

430
00:36:08,222 --> 00:36:12,249
I can't understand it. Why wouldn't
a religious editor believe you?

431
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,021
Face it, you goofed again,
just like the avocado pit.

432
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,321
You picked the wrong message boy.

433
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,334
-You don't believe I'm here, do you?
-No, I don't.

434
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:24,869
Then how do you explain
this conversation we're having?

435
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:27,373
I'm having. I'm dreaming you.

436
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:30,902
And I ought to be real glad
when I wake up, too.

437
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:33,212
What color are my eyes?

438
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,309
My eyes?

439
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:38,176
Blue.

440
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:39,714
My shirt?

441
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:43,085
Red plaid.
What does that got to do with anything?

442
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,591
-Do you dream in color?
-No.

443
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,059
Bingo, again.

444
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:50,527
Okay. All right.

445
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,256
You know a lot of things...

446
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,495
...and you've been making things happen...

447
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,866
...but none of it seems....

448
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,304
-Godlike?
-Yeah. Godlike.

449
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,375
Now, what, to you, would be Godlike?

450
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:07,907
-Change the weather.
-Special effects?

451
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:13,283
What would you like?
A little earthquake? Small hurricane?

452
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,921
No, I wouldn't want anybody hurt.

453
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:19,822
I was just thinking, maybe,
what about a little rain?

454
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,688
-Little rain?
-Yeah. A small shower.

455
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:25,458
One small shower. You got it.

456
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,539
It's raining.

457
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:35,201
You made it rain.

458
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:38,907
You didn't even bat an eye.
You didn't lift a finger.

459
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,279
-Rain's not that hard.
-It's unbelievable.

460
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,319
-Would you like it to rain a little harder?
-No, this is fine.

461
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:48,116
-How about bigger drops?
-No. This is fine.

462
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:50,555
Would you care for a little snow?

463
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:52,089
I don't believe it.

464
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:59,663
It's not raining outside. It's just in here.

465
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,332
Why should I spoil everybody's day?

466
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:05,995
-This is fantastic.
-Thank you.

467
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:10,337
-It's just like Noah's ark.
-Same thing, without the smell.

468
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:44,066
-What's the problem, officer?
-I was about to ask you.

469
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:50,643
My radiator must be leaking.
I'm sorry about that.

470
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,789
A radiator doesn't hold that much water.

471
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:07,895
I must have driven through a car wash
with my windows open?

472
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,099
-That'd do it.
-Yeah.

473
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:18,006
-Roll up the windows next time.
-Yes, sir, I will. Yes, sir.

474
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:20,337
Thank you, sir.

475
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:32,220
-He believed that dumb excuse.
-There's an aura of goodness around you.

476
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,218
You.

477
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:37,894
Going to try a little harder
to get the word out?

478
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,470
-Yeah! I'll give it another shot!
-That's my boy.

479
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:45,470
Mr. Briggs.

480
00:39:46,674 --> 00:39:48,699
-You're all wet.
-Of course I'm wet.

481
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:51,973
I didn't dry myself, I wanted you
to see this. Do you remember me?

482
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:55,709
Of course. You're the nonbeliever
who spoke to God, twice, I believe.

483
00:39:55,783 --> 00:39:57,045
Four times, now.

484
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:00,815
-Is he still visiting you in the toilet?
-I just rode with him in my car.

485
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:02,651
This time, I have got the proof.

486
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:06,955
-He gave you another calling card?
-No. He made it rain inside the car.

487
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:10,422
This water that I'm dripping all over here
is water that he made.

488
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:12,298
This is holy water.

489
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,703
-If you'll excuse me, I really am in a hurry.
-I will not excuse you, Mr. Briggs!

490
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,864
You are a reporter of religious events...

491
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,398
...and this is the most important
religious event of our time.

492
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:25,138
And I expect you....

493
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,144
I don't expect, I insist,
that you print his message...

494
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:30,979
...in your paper and give it
the prominence it deserves.

495
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:33,611
Or, by God, you'll hear from me again.

496
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:36,749
Jerry.

497
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:40,918
No, listen to this.

498
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:44,929
"It should come as no surprise to anyone
that in these tense-filled times...

499
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,967
"...religious freaks abound.

500
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:49,832
"From the Bronx cabbie who claims
he drove Mary Magdalene...

501
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:52,304
"...to the airport last Christmas...." Listen.

502
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:54,898
"To the Burbank, California,
supermarket manager...

503
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,809
"...who insists he has had
four conversations with God, no less."

504
00:40:58,879 --> 00:40:59,971
What?

505
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:01,912
"According to this second gentleman...

506
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:05,349
"...who flashes a calling card
with God's name on it...

507
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,746
"...God wants very much for us to know...

508
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:11,416
"...He is alive and well and that
our world can work. It's up to us."

509
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:13,050
Let me see that.

510
00:41:13,894 --> 00:41:15,623
The <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

511
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:18,590
-Where is it?
-How could you, for God's....

512
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,499
It's right here, with some terrific company.

513
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:25,535
See this? A janitor who sleeps all night
tied up on a cross.

514
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:28,131
Did anybody else say they saw God?

515
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:32,612
No, but there's an insurance salesman
selling life-after-death policies.

516
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:38,208
But only you have talked to the Big Boss.
Did you just say that you saw him?

517
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,715
-Yes.
-You didn't just hear him?

518
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:45,349
One line. That's all they gave it is one line.

519
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:49,021
-Are you saying now that you saw God?
-Three times, yeah.

520
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:54,364
-Three times?
-In the bathroom, at work, and in the car.

521
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:59,730
One lousy line. I don't believe it.

522
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:11,244
Let's go away for a couple days, okay?

523
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:16,320
-Bobbie, I know how crazy this all sounds.
-No, you don't.

524
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:23,692
I saw him. He spoke to me.

525
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,830
All right, let's say, for a minute,
that you saw God--

526
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:31,962
Look, don't humor me.
That'll really make me crazy.

527
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:34,803
Okay! You saw him.

528
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,843
-But why is he talking to you?
-Why not me?

529
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,608
Why not the Pope, or Billy Graham,
or somebody way up there?

530
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:45,811
-He doesn't care about religion.
-God doesn't care about religion?

531
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:47,080
That's what he said.

532
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:50,952
He sure picked a funny business
to go into then, didn't he?

533
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:58,530
I'm sorry, Jerry.

534
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,166
I can't seem to accept the concept of you...

535
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:13,577
...actually having a real, honest-to-God
conversation with God.

536
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:17,945
I don't understand
why he wanted to talk to you.

537
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,854
God, listen to me, this whole thing
is making me nuts now, too.

538
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:26,183
Too?

539
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,560
-You do think I'm crazy.
-No.

540
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:33,757
I don't think you're crazy.

541
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,833
Which is why I think I'm crazy.

542
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:41,667
Bobbie, how can I convince anyone at all,
if I can't convince you?

543
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:48,142
Jerry, for some reason
that I can't even begin to fathom...

544
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:51,476
...you really believe all this stuff,
don't you?

545
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,144
Can't you?

546
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,427
I believe...

547
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:03,963
...that you believe.

548
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,331
Which, in some sense,
is the same as believing, I guess, isn't it?

549
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:18,140
Do you understand what I've said?

550
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,805
Do you have any questions?

551
00:44:25,486 --> 00:44:26,646
Adam?

552
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,683
Sounds pretty bananas, Dad.

553
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:40,795
Hello?

554
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:41,992
Who?

555
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:44,997
No, he isn't home right now.

556
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,635
No, that's not him.

557
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:52,070
Yes, you can print that in your paper.

558
00:44:52,146 --> 00:44:54,774
He is definitely not the man
in the <i>Times</i> today.

559
00:44:54,948 --> 00:44:57,473
-Can I go now, Dad?
-Sure, Son.

560
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:00,509
I'll meet you.

561
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:04,815
Look, I'm his wife. You can believe me.
Don't call back.

562
00:45:28,782 --> 00:45:32,741
-What do you think?
-Maybe he's going through a stage.

563
00:45:33,353 --> 00:45:35,218
You know, "mentalpause."

564
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,217
That's "menopause."

565
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:40,292
-Yeah, like Grandma.
-I hope.

566
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:44,655
<i>And finally, this note.</i>

Hello.

Yes, this is Jerry Landers.
It's the <i>Tarzana Daily Review</i>.

580
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:43,113
Yes, I'm the one.

581
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,816
Spoke with him? Absolutely.

582
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,656
About 6 foot, blondish hair....

583
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:52,458
Oh, him.

584
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:56,534
About 5' 7", I guess. Gray hair.

-Everybody, look.
-What?

589
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:15,188
Channel 11? That's the 10:00 news.

590
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,952
-Can we stay up and watch us?
-Jerry, I don't want the kids on TV.

591
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,764
Can't be any worse than watching it.

592
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,558
Don't worry. Come on, kids.

00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:10,936
Not as I claim he has. As he has.

607
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:17,005
I don't know if he'll show up again,
but he gave me his message and--

608
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:19,745
-Dad. It's 10 to.
-Yes, Adam.

609
00:48:20,988 --> 00:48:22,285
That he exists?

610
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:26,315
Yes, and that he would like us
to cherish and nurture each other...

611
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:29,487
<i>-...as opposed to killing one another.</i>
<i>-He said that?</i>

612
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:34,529
<i>Yeah, that he's our shepherd</i>,
<i>and we shall not want.</i>

613
00:48:35,502 --> 00:48:38,471
<i>-We can quote you?</i>
<i>-I didn't make that up.</i>

614
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:45,501
<i>For 10:00 news, this is Mario Machado</i>
<i>and the man who talked to God in Tarzana.</i>

615
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:50,712
<i>The second time</i>,
<i>the first time was in Los Angeles.</i>

616
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:53,076
<i>I stand corrected.</i>

617
00:48:55,188 --> 00:48:59,955
<i>Mr, Landers, please call</i>
<i>Mr, Summers at his office.</i>

618
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,190
<i>Mr, Summers for Mr, Landers.</i>

619
00:49:14,274 --> 00:49:16,071
-Landers.
-Mr. Summers.

620
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:17,735
Glad you could get here so fast.

621
00:49:17,811 --> 00:49:19,676
-Well, you said--
-Right, have a seat.

622
00:49:19,746 --> 00:49:20,713
Thank you.

623
00:49:20,781 --> 00:49:22,840
-How's it going, Landers?
-Fine.

624
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:26,750
-You took over while Slavic is vacationing?
-Yes, sir.

625
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,983
-Think you can handle a store as manager?
-I'm sure I can.

626
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,355
Good.

627
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:35,225
-Everything all right at home?
-Wonderful.

628
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:38,230
The missus? Kids? Adam? Betsy?

629
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:39,356
Becky.

630
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:43,802
Good, what is this "seeing God" crap
all about?

631
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:47,998
It's not crap, Mr. Summers. I've seen him.

632
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:52,142
I've heard it all in this chair.

633
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,141
I know what being a manager
can do to a man.

634
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,110
Trouble with books.

635
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:01,945
-Humping check-out girls in the freezer.
-I'm only the assistant.

636
00:50:02,022 --> 00:50:03,455
You can tell me.

637
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:06,788
There's nothing like that to tell.
I really have seen him.

638
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:13,288
Landers, the founder and
principal stockholder of Food World...

639
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:16,497
...is a man devoted to prayer.

640
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:21,105
Lowell Wilson has personally
gotten down on his knees...

641
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,068
...with three US Presidents.

642
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:27,944
He attended prayer breakfasts
and asked for God's blessing...

643
00:50:28,215 --> 00:50:32,447
...with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
right in the war room of the Pentagon.

644
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:38,252
I don't think that Mr. Wilson
is going to take too kindly to the idea...

645
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:40,589
...that one of his employees...

646
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:45,324
...is claiming to have had a personal
audience with the Almighty himself.

647
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:49,663
I should think that he would be very happy
to know that his prayers are heard.

648
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:52,296
Mr. Wilson has reached
that point in his life...

649
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:54,704
...where he can be sure
his prayers are heard.

650
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,743
He doesn't need any help from you.

651
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,904
It's not me. I'm just kind of like a Moses.

652
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:05,344
Look, Landers.

653
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:09,616
I don't want to pump any sunshine
up your skirt...

654
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:13,625
...but you have a future at Food World.
Don't blow it.

655
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:18,588
Now, you just keep your mouth shut,
and stay away from reporters.

656
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:22,967
And if I don't?

657
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,968
God may have been interested in you
as an assistant manager...

658
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,738
...we'll just see how he feels
about you as a bag stuffer.

659
00:51:35,982 --> 00:51:37,279
Over here!

660
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:40,612
I thought I'd straighten up a little.

661
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:43,485
The mess people make.

662
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:45,718
Take a seat.

663
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:49,228
It's started?

664
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,963
You said you saw me,
and the pressure started.

665
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:56,298
-Is it going to get any worse?
-How should I know?

666
00:51:57,571 --> 00:51:59,505
What do you mean,
how should you know?

667
00:51:59,573 --> 00:52:02,098
-How could I know?
-You know everything.

668
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,768
I only know what is.

669
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:09,441
Also, I'm very big on what was.
On what isn't yet, I haven't got a clue.

670
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:12,209
-But when you said--
-Move your foot.

671
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:13,547
Sit down.

672
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:16,249
When you said
everything would work out...

673
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:18,188
...I thought you could tell the future.

674
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:22,160
Absolutely, I could tell the future,
the minute it becomes the past.

675
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:26,097
I said, everything could work out,
if that's everybody's choice.

676
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:29,325
People have to decide
what's to be done with the world.

677
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:32,496
I can't make a personal decision
for everybody.

678
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,770
Why the face? So far, so good.

679
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:39,175
We hit the papers, a little TV,
we're in business.

680
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:42,037
I'm liable to lose my job.

681
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:47,215
Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal.

682
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:54,458
Hey, Adam.

683
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:06,468
-What are you doing here?
-I got off early from work, Son.

684
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:08,769
I thought I'd give you a lift home.

685
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,833
No thanks, Dad. I'll walk.

686
00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:15,177
-Come on.
-No, I got new tennis shoes on.

687
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:17,513
I want to break them in.

688
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:20,076
See you later.

689
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:23,552
Come on, let's go.

690
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:44,405
<i>Why wouldn't they be embarrassed?</i>

691
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:48,575
-Their friends ribbed the hell out of them.
-That's rotten.

692
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:52,644
They wanted to know if you could
get their test answers from God.

693
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,745
And could he do anything
about their little-league team?

694
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:58,290
They gave them a very rough day.

695
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:01,418
Jerry, what are you going to do
about Mr. Summers?

696
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:04,361
What can I do?
What do you want me to do?

697
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:08,525
I want you to say no more about it,
like he said not to.

698
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:13,466
Bobbie,
Mr. Summers represents Food World.

699
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:17,832
God is with "World World."
It's a slightly bigger obligation.

700
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:21,869
-Bigger than your job?
-I have no choice.

701
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:23,806
That's the problem.

702
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:25,783
The problem is, you do!

703
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:29,786
How far do you intend to take this?
How long is this going to go on?

704
00:54:29,856 --> 00:54:34,850
Until everyone gets the message.
Until I can convince people of this miracle.

705
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:36,861
I mean, that's what it is.

706
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,795
It's a miracle, nothing less.

707
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:42,460
I have to reach the greatest number
of people possible and tell them.

708
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:45,766
It's for you.
The producer of <i>The Dinah Shore Show</i>.

709
00:54:46,439 --> 00:54:50,671
You've been on television a long....
Not that long. I'm sorry.

710
00:54:50,744 --> 00:54:53,144
No, I'm much younger than I look.

711
00:54:53,813 --> 00:54:56,646
-No, I didn't want to say it that way.
-You look....

712
00:54:56,716 --> 00:55:00,311
I'm younger than people think I am,
because I've been around a long time.

713
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:02,855
Everything you've done
has had such tremendous impact.

714
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,982
<i>It's been magnificent.</i>
<i>I've never done anything bad in my life.</i>

715
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:07,458
<i>I'm one of the perfect people.</i>

716
00:55:07,527 --> 00:55:09,495
<i>-That's kind of exciting.</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

717
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:11,792
<i>Do you remember your first moment</i>
<i>on television?</i>

718
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:16,825
<i>Actually, I do, It was in 1948.</i>
<i>It was Maggie McNellis's Crystal Room.</i>

719
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:19,064
<i>We were told to be visual in those days.</i>

720
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:21,539
The Picture of Dorian Grey
<i>was very popular then.</i>

721
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:24,941
<i>I gave a 15-second impression</i>
<i>of</i> The Picture of Dorian Grey,

722
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:27,206
<i>About the man who carouses.</i>

723
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,915
<i>He stays looking good</i>,
<i>but his picture falls apart.</i>

724
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:46,093
-Ready, Mr. Landers?
-Right.

725
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,401
<i>I think I broke a jaw.</i>

726
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,334
America is not ready for this.

727
00:55:57,544 --> 00:56:00,604
Okay, you'll take the empty seat
next to Dinah.

728
00:56:00,947 --> 00:56:05,111
-This show is taped, isn't it?
-Yes, it'll be on a week from today.

729
00:56:05,552 --> 00:56:09,886
You may have read about my next guest
in the newspapers recently.

730
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:14,320
He is a supermarket manager
from Tarzana, California...

731
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:18,621
...who says that he has been instructed
by God to spread the message...

732
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:21,724
...that God lives and God cares.

733
00:56:22,368 --> 00:56:24,734
Please welcome Mr. Jerry Landers.

734
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:31,276
-Am I on?
-Almost, that applause is for you.

735
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:36,577
-Is Dinah nice, Daddy?
-Not now, honey.

736
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,650
<i>-You're not nervous, are you?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

737
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:45,820
<i>I don't mind telling you, I am.</i>
<i>You have some pretty powerful friend.</i>

738
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:50,528
-Why are they laughing?
-Just watch.

739
00:56:51,064 --> 00:56:53,123
Because God is Daddy's friend.

740
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:58,964
<i>-Why do you suppose he picked you, Jerry?</i>
<i>-God only knows, I mean....</i>

741
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,403
<i>You're right.</i>

742
00:57:02,475 --> 00:57:07,139
<i>You said that God wants us to know</i>
<i>that he still cares.</i>

743
00:57:07,514 --> 00:57:10,347
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>that he wants us to know?</i>

744
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:14,113
<i>Yes, that he's given us everything</i>
<i>that we need to make our life work...</i>

745
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:16,519
<i>...make the world work</i>,
<i>and that he's watching us.</i>

746
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,580
<i>-He's watching?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

747
00:57:18,658 --> 00:57:20,091
<i>Watching us?</i>

748
00:57:20,994 --> 00:57:22,393
<i>-Now?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

749
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:31,895
<i>You agreed earlier</i>
<i>to be part of an experiment today...</i>

750
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:34,838
<i>...with the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

751
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:36,967
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to take a lie detector test?</i>

752
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:38,772
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

753
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:43,980
<i>What this is, is a sketch artist</i>
<i>from the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

754
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:48,812
<i>He's an expert and very adept</i>
<i>at making a sketch from a description.</i>

755
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:52,915
<i>I think all of us here would like to know</i>
<i>what God looks like.</i>

756
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:54,550
<i>You would like to know.</i>

757
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:00,093
<i>-Shall we?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

758
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,599
<i>Follow me.</i>

759
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:06,164
<i>-Jerry, this is Mr, Fernando Ponce.</i>
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

760
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,002
<i>-Please sit there.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

761
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:13,311
<i>Mr, Ponce, as I said, is an expert</i>
<i>at eyewitness sketches...</i>

762
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:15,504
<i>...for the LA Police Department.</i>

763
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,749
<i>-How do I start?</i>
<i>-Tell me about the shape of his face.</i>

764
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:22,882
<i>The shape is...</i>

765
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,081
<i>...triangular.</i>

766
00:58:26,526 --> 00:58:27,652
<i>-Good.</i>
<i>-I guess.</i>

767
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:32,556
<i>-He's got large ears.</i>
<i>-He has?</i>

768
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:35,430
Jerry, I don't believe you actually did this.

769
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,991
It was their idea.

770
00:58:37,103 --> 00:58:39,230
<i>He does, He wears glasses.</i>

771
00:58:40,373 --> 00:58:42,034
<i>God wears glasses?</i>

772
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:46,569
<i>He's wearing a fishing cap.</i>

773
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,249
<i>-A fishing cap?</i>
<i>-Maybe it's like a baseball cap.</i>

774
00:58:50,383 --> 00:58:53,477
<i>His lips are kind of thin.</i>
<i>His nose is straight.</i>

775
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:56,953
<i>It's round on the ends.</i>

776
00:58:57,023 --> 00:58:59,082
No one's supposed to know
what God looks like.

777
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:00,716
-I do.
-You do?

778
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,687
Yeah. In <i>Bible Comics</i>,
they had a picture of him last week.

779
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:09,759
<i>They're horn-rimmed glasses.</i>
<i>They're plastic ones, you know?</i>

780
00:59:09,836 --> 00:59:12,999
<i>Where would you suppose</i>
<i>he would get his glasses?</i>

781
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:16,598
<i>I don't know.</i>

782
00:59:18,378 --> 00:59:20,437
<i>-Anywhere he likes.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

783
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:25,882
Boy, I sure hope my friends are
doing their homework.

784
00:59:26,486 --> 00:59:29,683
<i>This is what God looked like to you?</i>

785
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:33,283
<i>He's sort of captured the sense...</i>

786
00:59:34,327 --> 00:59:35,521
<i>...I guess.</i>

787
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,956
<i>America, here it is...</i>

788
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:43,165
<i>...as seen through the eyes</i>
<i>of Jerry Landers.</i>

789
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:44,294
<i>God.</i>

790
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:59,107
Dad, you're going to get God arrested.

791
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:05,852
-You said it would be done by 6:00.
-I'm sorry, but I just got the part.

792
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:12,021
-Weren't you on the <i>Dinah Show</i> last night?
-Yeah.

793
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,563
Yeah, that was real different.

794
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:18,230
Excuse me.

795
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:20,634
How am I supposed to get home now?

796
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,134
Where to, mister?

797
01:00:27,513 --> 01:00:28,741
Get in.

798
01:00:41,294 --> 01:00:43,387
I hope you have a license.

799
01:00:51,137 --> 01:00:54,834
-Did you watch <i>Dinah Shore</i> last night?
-I watch everything.

800
01:00:55,775 --> 01:00:58,938
I got you national exposure.
I hope you're happy.

801
01:00:59,712 --> 01:01:01,441
I could be happier.

802
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:03,474
How?

803
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:05,312
For starters, you do a show like that...

804
01:01:05,385 --> 01:01:07,910
...you don't let them put you on
the last few minutes.

805
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:10,012
That's for fellas who write diet books.

806
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:11,818
It wasn't up to me.

807
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,490
And what was that drawing thing?

808
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,427
-He was a police artist.
-Man draws crooks.

809
01:01:18,131 --> 01:01:22,727
Makes everybody look like a crook.
Made me look like a second-story man.

810
01:01:23,403 --> 01:01:27,066
-It's publicity.
-I'm used to a little better treatment.

811
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:32,143
That painting of me by Michelangelo,
that's a picture.

812
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:35,103
And he did it laying flat on his back.

813
01:01:36,082 --> 01:01:37,310
Now what happens?

814
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:41,979
Now we see who can still believe,
who wants to, who needs to.

815
01:01:42,622 --> 01:01:45,147
A few million people
saw you last night, right?

816
01:01:45,224 --> 01:01:47,624
A few million?
Some of them will believe you.

817
01:01:47,693 --> 01:01:50,389
Some are going to want to
punch me in the head.

818
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,397
Some will want to fire me.

819
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:54,797
Some may decide
I'm too crazy to live with.

820
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:57,961
We can't worry about those.
The ball is rolling.

821
01:01:58,171 --> 01:02:02,301
-Yeah, right over me.
-Don't be a malcontent, I'll watch over you.

822
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,469
While you're watching over me,
would you mind watching the road?

823
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:07,274
I'd rather watch a nice sunset.

824
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,724
<i>Dinah Shore</i> must get a pretty big rating.

825
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,030
You're on, kid.

826
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,813
-Jerry?
-Yes, God?

827
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:49,010
You have the strength
that comes from knowing.

828
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:19,606
Can I have one minute with you?
I have something very important to say.

829
01:03:19,685 --> 01:03:20,947
It just can't wait.

830
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,488
Please, bless my baby.

831
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,684
Touch him, pray for him. Pray for my baby.

832
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,558
If I could just have one second with you....

833
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:34,155
-It's not for me, it's for you.
-Sanctify my body.

834
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,394
Bless him, make him a true believer!

835
01:03:36,469 --> 01:03:39,165
I have something very important.
This is for you!

836
01:03:39,238 --> 01:03:41,729
-Give me your golden staff.
-I can't!

837
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:46,367
-God said it's okay.
-I'll tell you this, it's very important!

838
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:49,072
Officer, could you move
the rest of them along?

839
01:03:49,148 --> 01:03:50,410
Yes, sir.

840
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,179
One little moment, please.
What I have to tell him is--

841
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:55,185
Okay.

842
01:03:55,621 --> 01:03:58,613
I went to empty the garbage,
and two people blessed me.

843
01:03:58,691 --> 01:04:00,886
Then one of them blessed the garbage.

844
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,521
And then he asked me if our children
were conceived immaculately.

845
01:04:04,597 --> 01:04:05,928
Now, calm down, honey.

846
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:08,159
The police had to take our kids
to school today.

847
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:10,794
-They said it was safer.
-That's awful!

848
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:13,494
Yes, that's awful.
You want to hear awfuller?

849
01:04:13,573 --> 01:04:16,064
Mr. Summers said that Lowell Wilson...

850
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:20,203
...is personally deciding
whether or not you can keep your job.

851
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:22,274
Is that awful enough for you?

852
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:24,441
Now, Bobbie, don't let it get to you.

853
01:04:24,517 --> 01:04:26,144
Don't let it get to me?

854
01:04:27,787 --> 01:04:30,449
Jerry, it's gotten to me! Don't you see?

855
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:34,284
Jerry, look, you've got him to talk to.

856
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,660
It's just me here,
me and those religious nuts outside!

857
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:41,456
I have to leave the phone off the hook.

858
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:44,799
People keep calling up
and asking to talk to God.

859
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:49,165
Except, of course, for the guy
who offered to chew on my pantyhose!

860
01:04:50,977 --> 01:04:54,743
Telegrams, notes in the mail box
and the doorways.

861
01:04:55,348 --> 01:04:57,816
Today they even put one
in the dog's mouth.

862
01:04:57,883 --> 01:04:59,282
This is from the university.

863
01:04:59,352 --> 01:05:01,946
I've been invited to appear
before a theology group.

864
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:04,819
<i>-They want to verify the miracle.</i>
<i>-Terrific.</i>

865
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:09,122
<i>It is! This'll give me credibility</i>,
<i>and God'll get his word across.</i>

866
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:10,753
<i>It'll help me keep my job.</i>

867
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:15,229
Mr. Landers,
it is the consensus of this group...

868
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:20,996
...that you are a person of
little or no theological knowledge.

869
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:24,434
You have demonstrated, over the years...

870
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:28,810
...an astonishing lack of interest
in spiritual matters.

871
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:34,679
It strikes me,
as one who has actually heard his voice...

872
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:40,548
...that you have virtually no prerequisites
to make direct contact...

873
01:05:40,626 --> 01:05:43,686
-...with the Almighty, whatsoever.
-You've heard him?

874
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:48,096
He has made his word known to me.

875
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,498
What was he wearing?

876
01:05:50,269 --> 01:05:52,601
I know his word through the scriptures.

877
01:05:52,672 --> 01:05:54,936
It would be blasphemy to suggest...

878
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:57,908
...that we could describe the Creator
in human terms.

879
01:05:57,977 --> 01:05:59,103
Why?

880
01:05:59,178 --> 01:06:00,702
If He created us...

881
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,581
...why wouldn't he appear to us
as one of us?

882
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,640
Don't you....

883
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:16,260
Don't you, young man...

884
01:06:16,862 --> 01:06:20,457
...try to teach this assemblage
the role of the Deity.

885
01:06:22,835 --> 01:06:26,134
Rabbi Silverstone,
my good and great friend...

886
01:06:26,205 --> 01:06:30,574
...brother in the work of the Lord, with
whom we have broke bread many times...

887
01:06:30,643 --> 01:06:33,407
...is a pillar of
the American Jew community.

888
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,677
Bishop Reardon represents millions
of Roman Catholics.

889
01:06:39,485 --> 01:06:43,080
Bishop Marcos,
multitudes of Greek Orthodoxers.

890
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:47,087
Why, we have virtually every
religious persuasion...

891
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:48,717
...represented here today.

892
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:51,695
And I personally have been chosen...

893
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:54,892
...to render the benediction
at this year's Super Bowl.

894
01:06:57,536 --> 01:07:02,496
Mr. Landers, we really find
insufficient documentation...

895
01:07:03,142 --> 01:07:04,803
...to support your claim.

896
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:06,845
But you're not saying it didn't happen.

897
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:10,575
No, we are saying
there is insufficient documentation.

898
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:15,143
Which puts the score at God 7, you 0.

899
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:19,524
We have decided, however,
out of a sense of fairness...

900
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:22,152
...and ecclesiastical curiosity...

901
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:26,363
...to allow you to present us
with certain evidence.

902
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:28,396
What evidence?

903
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:31,231
We have assembled a set of questions...

904
01:07:32,371 --> 01:07:34,805
...for you to ask God.

905
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:37,675
There are 50 questions.

906
01:07:39,211 --> 01:07:40,508
Fifty.

907
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:44,139
You want me to get God to take a quiz?

908
01:07:44,216 --> 01:07:46,650
Unless you've been concealing
an abundant knowledge--

909
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,846
Which I find highly doubtful.

910
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:52,721
There are questions there
that you could not possibly answer.

911
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:57,428
Look, I don't know when...

912
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,821
...or if he'll ever appear again.

913
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:04,427
As a control measure, you will remain
locked in your hotel room...

914
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:06,271
...alone.

915
01:08:07,873 --> 01:08:09,773
-Not even my wife?
-No.

916
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:12,367
There'll be no outside calls, whatsoever.

917
01:08:14,246 --> 01:08:16,180
You could, of course, decline.

918
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:19,445
But then,
that would form the basis of our report.

919
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:30,588
God?

920
01:08:48,214 --> 01:08:50,182
-God?
-Room service.

921
01:08:57,823 --> 01:09:00,018
Just put it right around over here, please.

922
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,052
You can't come in. I understand.

923
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:07,831
Do I need to sign this?

924
01:09:10,736 --> 01:09:12,567
Thank you very much.

925
01:09:26,685 --> 01:09:29,449
-They forgot the ketchup.
-Come in!

926
01:09:30,256 --> 01:09:32,281
They're playing our number.

927
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:45,299
$11 for a steak? Who would have thought?

928
01:09:45,504 --> 01:09:49,565
With me, cows were an afterthought.
Just to give new mothers a little rest.

929
01:09:51,644 --> 01:09:54,772
-Boy, am I glad to see you.
-Eat. It'll get cold.

930
01:10:00,486 --> 01:10:01,612
Pretty cute.

931
01:10:02,187 --> 01:10:05,179
-What is it?
-They made sure you couldn't answer.

932
01:10:05,257 --> 01:10:07,851
The questions are in the ancient tongue
of Aramaic.

933
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:09,656
Is that what that is?

934
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:14,724
They've figured out so many ways to talk
to each other, they're finding nobody can.

935
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:19,236
Let's see.
"What's the true origin of the universe?

936
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:25,433
"What is the source of the planet Earth?"
It's a History final, right?

937
01:10:30,215 --> 01:10:31,807
So many repeats.

938
01:10:32,851 --> 01:10:34,648
Eat the steak, and then get a pen.

939
01:10:39,024 --> 01:10:42,016
"Did man fall from grace
in the Garden of Eden?"

940
01:10:43,362 --> 01:10:47,298
I'll tell you something, never came out.
I made Adam 17.

941
01:10:47,499 --> 01:10:49,990
Eve was 15, 16, tops.

942
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:53,463
I figured then,
16, 17 was middle-age, you know.

943
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:58,067
Who knew people would live so long?
Trees, I figured they had the best chance.

944
01:10:58,143 --> 01:11:00,976
Now I realize that they were kids, babies.

945
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,380
Young people can't fall from my grace.
They're my best things. Put that down.

946
01:11:09,555 --> 01:11:11,682
-"Which of the world's--"
-Wait.

947
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:14,181
Okay.

948
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:18,320
"Which of the world's religions is
the closest to the divine truth?"

949
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:22,895
The divine truth is not in a building
or a book or a story.

950
01:11:24,003 --> 01:11:27,962
Put down that the heart is the temple
wherein all truth resides.

951
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:33,710
"Is Jesus Christ the son of God?"

952
01:11:40,686 --> 01:11:41,983
Jesus was my son.

953
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:45,547
Buddha was my son.

954
01:11:46,091 --> 01:11:48,719
Mohammed, Moses, you...

955
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:52,262
...the man who said there was
no room in the inn was my son.

956
01:11:52,331 --> 01:11:55,528
So is the one who charges $11 for steak
in this one.

957
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:57,034
Let's mush on.

958
01:11:57,536 --> 01:11:59,663
What was that last question?

959
01:12:02,307 --> 01:12:05,674
-"Will there--"
-"Will there be a judgment day for man?"

960
01:12:07,446 --> 01:12:10,847
If they mean a doomsday,
an end-of-the-world thing...

961
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,077
...I'm certainly not going to get into that.

962
01:12:13,152 --> 01:12:16,883
But if you want my personal opinion,
I wouldn't look forward to it.

963
01:12:16,955 --> 01:12:20,413
There'd be a lot of yelling,
and I don't need that anymore than you do.

964
01:12:20,492 --> 01:12:21,720
Got that?

965
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:23,721
Got it.

966
01:12:24,363 --> 01:12:27,332
"What is the meaning of man's existence?"

967
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:31,835
Life is like a glass of tea.

968
01:12:33,005 --> 01:12:37,942
No, I better not go for laughs.
Voltaire may have had me pegged, right?

969
01:12:38,577 --> 01:12:42,741
He said I was a comedian playing
to an audience who's afraid to laugh.

970
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:46,442
But seriously,
put down that man and women-persons...

971
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:50,518
...their existence means
exactly and precisely...

972
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:54,047
...not more, not one tiny bit less,
just what they think it means.

973
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:56,560
What I think doesn't count at all.

974
01:12:57,396 --> 01:13:00,388
-That's very profound.
-Sometimes I get lucky.

975
01:13:03,235 --> 01:13:05,465
-Last question.
-Thank God.

976
01:13:05,537 --> 01:13:06,936
You're welcome.

977
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:11,074
"Why have you chosen
to appear at this time?"

978
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:13,010
You've already said.

979
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:15,239
Maybe they want to hear it
in your own words.

980
01:13:16,882 --> 01:13:20,841
I want to say to everyone that everything
around them that they see and smell...

981
01:13:20,919 --> 01:13:23,717
...and feel and hear,
they should delight in all this.

982
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:26,781
That what is here are
some of my very best ideas.

983
01:13:26,859 --> 01:13:28,554
I want everyone to try very hard...

984
01:13:28,627 --> 01:13:31,118
...to make sure
it doesn't all go down the drain.

985
01:13:32,164 --> 01:13:34,325
Give me, I'll do it.

986
01:13:37,436 --> 01:13:40,894
Can you remember exactly what you said?
It was perfect.

987
01:13:43,575 --> 01:13:46,601
Boy, these answers are
really going to get them.

988
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,972
That's my handwriting!

989
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:52,149
lmagine that.

990
01:13:53,552 --> 01:13:55,679
Shall I call the panel
and tell them I'm ready?

991
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:59,053
Never mind the panel.
You deliver those papers to Rev. Williams...

992
01:13:59,124 --> 01:14:02,321
-...the one who looks like a football player.
-I didn't like him.

993
01:14:02,394 --> 01:14:05,488
He's having one of his big dos
at the Shrine Auditorium.

994
01:14:05,564 --> 01:14:09,125
Every time I turn around,
he's spreading the word, my word.

995
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:13,103
Only, my words he ran out of years ago.
I'll tell you the truth.

996
01:14:14,106 --> 01:14:16,040
The reason I put everybody here naked...

997
01:14:16,108 --> 01:14:20,306
...I wasn't trying to be cute,
I just didn't want to create clothes.

998
01:14:20,379 --> 01:14:24,645
With clothes, there's right away pockets,
and you have to put something in them.

999
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,980
You take these,
and give them to Rev. Bigmouth.

1000
01:14:27,052 --> 01:14:29,577
Tell him that God says he's a phony.

1001
01:14:29,855 --> 01:14:33,621
Also, tell him if he wants to get rich, fine.
Tell him to sell Earth Shoes.

1002
01:14:33,692 --> 01:14:37,560
But personally tell him
I'd like him to shut up. I'll see you.

1003
01:14:41,733 --> 01:14:42,859
God?

1004
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:45,662
Yeah?

1005
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:49,305
-Thank you.
-Hope I get an "A."

1006
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,307
<i>Love.</i>

1007
01:14:56,281 --> 01:14:58,306
<i>Let's talk about love.</i>

1008
01:14:59,518 --> 01:15:00,678
<i>What is it?</i>

1009
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:03,849
<i>You can love your brother, can't you?</i>

1010
01:15:04,223 --> 01:15:07,192
<i>You can love your wife or your husband.</i>

1011
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,953
<i>You can love your new dress.</i>

1012
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,464
<i>You can love my new car.</i>

1013
01:15:15,434 --> 01:15:17,664
<i>You can pass by a pet shop...</i>

1014
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:21,630
<i>...and say, "I just love</i>
<i>that little doggie in the window, "</i>

1015
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:25,705
<i>You can love this, and you can love that.</i>

1016
01:15:26,445 --> 01:15:28,640
<i>But what am I talking about?</i>

1017
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:31,579
<i>Some folks say...</i>

1018
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:35,313
<i>...that love is what they saw</i>
<i>in a pornographic movie.</i>

1019
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:39,254
<i>But that is lust, not love.</i>

1020
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,261
<i>-Is that what you want?</i>
-No!

1021
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:47,061
<i>-Is that love?</i>
-No!

1022
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:50,101
<i>-Is that what the Bible teaches?</i>
-No!

1023
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:52,728
<i>-Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
-No!

1024
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:56,535
<i>No, because what I'm talking about</i>
<i>is the kind of love...</i>

1025
01:15:56,608 --> 01:15:59,168
<i>...that calls for a sacrifice.</i>

1026
01:16:00,812 --> 01:16:03,440
<i>Are you willing to make a sacrifice...</i>

1027
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:06,245
<i>...to show God how much you love him?</i>

1028
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:07,444
Yes!

1029
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:11,888
<i>To show God how you love him</i>
<i>with all of your heart and soul?</i>

1030
01:16:12,424 --> 01:16:13,413
Yes!

1031
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:16,756
<i>-How do we love God? With all our....</i>
-Hearts!

1032
01:16:16,828 --> 01:16:19,695
<i>-How do we love God? With all our....</i>
-Souls!

1033
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:22,529
<i>-Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
-Yes!

1034
01:16:23,702 --> 01:16:25,693
<i>Yes, amen, I say, yes!</i>

1035
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:28,899
<i>-Raise your right hand, and say amen!</i>
-Amen!

1036
01:16:28,974 --> 01:16:30,532
<i>-Say amen!</i>
-Amen!

1037
01:16:38,617 --> 01:16:41,780
<i>And you can show God how you love him...</i>

1038
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:45,413
<i>...by digging down deep...</i>

1039
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:52,119
<i>...so that this ministry will reach</i>
<i>all of the people of the earth!</i>

1040
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:54,725
<i>Because the Bible tells us:</i>

1041
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,668
<i>"Show God you love him</i>,
<i>and he will show you the way, "</i>

1042
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:00,399
Amen!

1043
01:17:01,006 --> 01:17:03,804
<i>Now, I'm going to ask all of you</i>
<i>to come up.</i>

1044
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:06,167
<i>Those of you who haven't come up before...</i>

1045
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:09,179
<i>...I'm going to ask you to come up for God.</i>

1046
01:17:09,981 --> 01:17:14,611
<i>Shake my hand</i>,
<i>and let God see us together.</i>

1047
01:17:15,787 --> 01:17:18,483
<i>Because the Bible tells us...</i>

1048
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:21,958
<i>...that God knows the falling of a sparrow...</i>

1049
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:27,588
<i>...and the depth of a pocket</i>,
<i>and that is what I'm talking about!</i>

1050
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:28,993
Amen!

1051
01:17:30,168 --> 01:17:33,399
<i>Come up, brothers and sisters...</i>

1052
01:17:33,672 --> 01:17:38,405
<i>...and put in our hands</i>
<i>what you would put in God's hands...</i>

1053
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:43,274
<i>...and he will have the whole world</i>
<i>in his hands!</i>

1054
01:17:45,016 --> 01:17:49,578
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1055
01:17:49,654 --> 01:17:53,715
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1056
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:57,751
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1057
01:17:57,829 --> 01:17:59,626
"He's got the whole world..."

1058
01:17:59,698 --> 01:18:02,360
May the Lord bless and keep you.
It's so good to see you.

1059
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:03,492
You can put that right--

1060
01:18:03,568 --> 01:18:06,036
Yes, thank you very much. God bless you.

1061
01:18:07,706 --> 01:18:11,142
May the Lord always bless you
and keep you. It's so good to see you.

1062
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:12,836
Thank you, please keep moving.

1063
01:18:13,912 --> 01:18:15,903
-Rev. Williams.
-That's all right.

1064
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:18,006
He is in need of me.
What are you doing here?

1065
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,847
-God sent me to you.
-One moment!

1066
01:18:22,954 --> 01:18:26,583
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>,
<i>brothers and sisters...</i>

1067
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:31,425
<i>...this is the young man</i>
<i>who has used so much energy...</i>

1068
01:18:31,496 --> 01:18:35,489
<i>...to convince everyone</i>
<i>that he has seen God.</i>

1069
01:18:37,302 --> 01:18:38,360
<i>Now, wait!</i>

1070
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:42,837
<i>Would you repeat</i>
<i>what you just said to me?</i>

1071
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:45,771
<i>God sent me to you.</i>

1072
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:49,747
<i>God sent him to me!</i>

1073
01:18:51,016 --> 01:18:54,110
<i>-Are you certain of that?</i>
<i>-Yes, I just left him.</i>

1074
01:18:55,387 --> 01:18:59,380
<i>He wanted me to give you these answers</i>
<i>to all of those questions.</i>

1075
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,551
<i>-God specified me?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1076
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:05,023
<i>And he also asked me to tell you</i>
<i>that he's very unhappy.</i>

1077
01:19:05,096 --> 01:19:07,826
<i>God is very unhappy.</i>

1078
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:12,393
<i>Yes, he's unhappy that you're</i>
<i>getting rich this way.</i>

1079
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:16,464
<i>And that he'd like you to stop pretending</i>
<i>that you're spreading his word.</i>

1080
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:19,209
<i>In fact, he suggested that you sell shoes.</i>

1081
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:22,742
That's what he said! You're a fake!

1082
01:19:23,748 --> 01:19:25,773
<i>This poor boy is ill.</i>

1083
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:27,179
Get him out of here!

1084
01:19:30,222 --> 01:19:31,883
Rev. Williams!

1085
01:19:33,925 --> 01:19:37,986
Slander, Your Honor.
Slander, surely, cruel and foul.

1086
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:42,531
The Rev. Willie Williams is
on the road for God...

1087
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:45,126
...to the tune of 100,000 miles a year.

1088
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:48,731
He's a tireless, selfless servant of the Lord.

1089
01:19:49,674 --> 01:19:54,668
The idea that he'd line his pockets
in this pursuit is the unkindest cut of all.

1090
01:19:55,947 --> 01:19:58,882
Not only is Willie Williams'
organization nonprofit...

1091
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:03,649
...he personally pays over six figures
in income tax every year.

1092
01:20:04,022 --> 01:20:06,547
Give him back his honor, Your Honor.

1093
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:11,819
Award him the damages we seek
from this defendant.

1094
01:20:13,465 --> 01:20:15,558
A man so out of touch with reality...

1095
01:20:15,634 --> 01:20:19,502
...he even tries to smear the good name
of a religious giant.

1096
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:23,773
A man whom the President of
the United States once called...

1097
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:26,072
..."God's own quarterback."

1098
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,043
Thank you, Your Honor.

1099
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:36,579
Mr. Landers, will you come
to the bench, please?

1100
01:20:41,993 --> 01:20:44,621
-You haven't changed your mind?
-No, sir.

1101
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:49,594
A professional lawyer would be helpful.
This is a tough time for you to be alone.

1102
01:20:51,169 --> 01:20:53,637
I won't be alone, sir.

1103
01:21:00,345 --> 01:21:03,610
-They're just going to kill you today, Jerry.
-We'll see.

1104
01:21:04,115 --> 01:21:07,107
We're going to lose everything
you worked for.

1105
01:21:09,054 --> 01:21:11,420
lsn't there any way
you can say you're sorry?

1106
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:13,252
That it was all a big mistake?

1107
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:17,124
No, because I'm not, and it wasn't.

1108
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:20,625
I just can't believe
that God would set me up...

1109
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:23,099
<i>...to get me into all of this trouble.</i>

1110
01:21:23,168 --> 01:21:25,898
<i>I have to believe that he had a reason...</i>

1111
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:29,907
<i>...and I have to believe</i>
<i>that he'll bail me out.</i>

1112
01:21:30,275 --> 01:21:34,575
<i>And all I want to say is</i>,
<i>that young man is out of his mind.</i>

1113
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:40,213
And the absolute being, the all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-merciful...

1114
01:21:40,285 --> 01:21:43,448
...infinite spirit, the supreme soul...

1115
01:21:43,521 --> 01:21:45,955
...the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords...

1116
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:49,719
...the infinite, everlasting eternal being...

1117
01:21:50,295 --> 01:21:53,389
...last came to you how?

1118
01:21:55,433 --> 01:21:56,798
As a busboy.

1119
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:05,739
Your Honor, I rest my case.

1120
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:12,913
You may step down now, Mr. Landers.

1121
01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:24,057
Call your witnesses, please, Mr. Landers.

1122
01:22:24,262 --> 01:22:28,198
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call
one witness and one witness only.

1123
01:22:37,142 --> 01:22:38,871
I'm waiting, Mr. Landers.

1124
01:22:40,278 --> 01:22:41,336
Yes.

1125
01:22:43,682 --> 01:22:48,119
Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand the Lord God.

1126
01:22:52,257 --> 01:22:56,159
I object. The defendant's trying
to make a mockery of this proceeding.

1127
01:22:56,394 --> 01:22:58,487
Your Honor, I was trying to make a point.

1128
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:00,463
-What point?
-Your Honor...

1129
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:06,794
...when I just asked God
to take the stand...

1130
01:23:07,472 --> 01:23:12,239
...in that brief moment after I called him,
wasn't there a trace of expectation?

1131
01:23:12,444 --> 01:23:14,309
Just a trace, Your Honor?

1132
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:19,444
Wasn't there a hesitation in this room?
Didn't you feel it?

1133
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,051
Didn't we all feel it?

1134
01:23:25,623 --> 01:23:28,820
It was the possibility that God does exist.

1135
01:23:29,094 --> 01:23:33,326
And if he exists, he could materialize
and sit right in that chair.

1136
01:23:34,299 --> 01:23:37,757
In that moment, Your Honor,
when no one in this room knew...

1137
01:23:37,836 --> 01:23:41,363
...what was going to happen next,
in that flash of an instant...

1138
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:46,200
...lies the benefit of the doubt you must
give me to know that my story is true.

1139
01:23:46,277 --> 01:23:49,178
And that I spoke exactly as God asked me.

1140
01:23:50,515 --> 01:23:55,475
Mr. Landers, I cautioned you earlier
that legal representation would be helpful.

1141
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:59,452
I must now warn you that,
in addition to the plaintiff's charges...

1142
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:02,084
...I'm seriously considering
citing you with contempt.

1143
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,149
Amen.

1144
01:24:03,228 --> 01:24:06,095
For what you apparently thought
was a very clever stunt.

1145
01:24:06,164 --> 01:24:10,225
You're getting deeper and deeper
into trouble with this court, Mr. Landers.

1146
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:11,825
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1147
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:16,165
It's him.

1148
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:19,441
Bobbie, it's him.

1149
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:25,039
-This is most irregular.
-Your Honor, he--

1150
01:24:25,116 --> 01:24:26,708
I'll take it from here.

1151
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:30,179
May I ask who you are, sir?

1152
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:33,349
You better swear me in.
You'll never believe it.

1153
01:24:42,066 --> 01:24:45,627
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

1154
01:24:45,703 --> 01:24:47,227
So help me me.

1155
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:49,597
So help you you?

1156
01:24:50,975 --> 01:24:54,604
If it pleases the court,
and even if it doesn't please the court...

1157
01:24:54,679 --> 01:24:56,613
...I'm God, Your Honor.

1158
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,747
Order in the court.

1159
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:09,854
Your Honor, I'd like permission
to question this witness.

1160
01:25:10,228 --> 01:25:13,322
Sit down, Sonny,
I've answered enough questions.

1161
01:25:17,969 --> 01:25:22,201
He saw me, just like he said.
Each word true.

1162
01:25:23,374 --> 01:25:26,810
The man tried to tell a lie,
his tongue would snap off.

1163
01:25:27,345 --> 01:25:30,439
Which I wouldn't say
I could say about everybody.

1164
01:25:30,515 --> 01:25:32,540
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

1165
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:36,053
Is my physical existence
any more improbable than your own?

1166
01:25:37,288 --> 01:25:40,655
What about all that hoo-hah with the devil
a while ago, from that movie?

1167
01:25:40,725 --> 01:25:43,319
Nobody had trouble believing
that the devil took over...

1168
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,692
...and existed in the little girl.

1169
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:47,693
All she had to do was wet the rug...

1170
01:25:47,765 --> 01:25:50,893
...throw up some pea soup,
and everybody believed.

1171
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:54,833
The devil you could believe, but not God?

1172
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:59,870
I work in my own way.
I don't get inside little children.

1173
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:03,312
They got enough to do,
just being themselves.

1174
01:26:04,148 --> 01:26:07,117
I'm not going to go around
to every person in the world and say:

1175
01:26:07,185 --> 01:26:09,619
"Look, it's me, I want to talk to you."

1176
01:26:09,888 --> 01:26:11,549
So I picked one man.

1177
01:26:13,157 --> 01:26:14,818
One very good man.

1178
01:26:16,828 --> 01:26:19,626
I told him God lives. I live.

1179
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:25,761
He had trouble believing, too,
in the beginning. I understood.

1180
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:31,100
I'm not sure how
this whole miracle business started.

1181
01:26:31,175 --> 01:26:35,077
The idea that anything connected with me
has to be a miracle.

1182
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,714
Personally, I'm sorry that it did.

1183
01:26:37,782 --> 01:26:40,751
It makes the distance between us
even greater.

1184
01:26:42,687 --> 01:26:46,748
But if a miracle helps you believe
that I am who I say I am...

1185
01:26:49,961 --> 01:26:52,054
...I'll give you one, a good one.

1186
01:26:52,864 --> 01:26:56,732
Let me see.
What's my most impressive miracle?

1187
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,835
Pick a card.

1188
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:07,500
-What?
-Pick a card, any card.

1189
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:15,886
-I don't know what you think you're doing.
-A cute little miracle. Go ahead, pick one.

1190
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,783
-There are no cards there.
-Look again.

1191
01:27:25,463 --> 01:27:27,931
There's nothing miraculous
about good sleight of hand.

1192
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:30,126
Have you ever seen this one?

1193
01:27:38,543 --> 01:27:42,946
Yes, I've seen them make cards appear
and disappear.

1194
01:27:45,683 --> 01:27:49,084
As a matter of fact, I once saw
a magician make an elephant disappear.

1195
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,617
Good. Now I'll show you one
that you haven't seen.

1196
01:27:56,094 --> 01:27:58,221
Have to get these shoes fixed.

1197
01:28:00,832 --> 01:28:03,198
Watch this, Your Honor.

1198
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:25,718
<i>I know how hard it is, in these times</i>,
<i>to have faith.</i>

1199
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:29,657
<i>But maybe if you could have the faith</i>
<i>to start with...</i>

1200
01:28:29,894 --> 01:28:34,831
<i>...maybe the times would change.</i>
<i>You could change them, Think about it.</i>

1201
01:28:35,767 --> 01:28:38,736
<i>Try, And try not to hurt each other.</i>

1202
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:41,664
<i>There's been enough of that.</i>

1203
01:28:42,106 --> 01:28:44,131
<i>It really gets in the way.</i>

1204
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:48,440
<i>I'm a God of very few words</i>,
<i>and Jerry's already given you mine.</i>

1205
01:28:49,747 --> 01:28:53,740
<i>However hopeless, helpless</i>,
<i>mixed-up and scary it all gets...</i>

1206
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,209
<i>...it can work.</i>

1207
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:59,422
<i>If you find it hard to believe in me...</i>

1208
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:03,151
<i>...maybe it would help you to know</i>
<i>that I believe in you.</i>

1209
01:29:03,828 --> 01:29:05,853
<i>Your Honor, I rest my case.</i>

1210
01:29:18,843 --> 01:29:20,037
What?

1211
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:29,251
This court is now recessed.

1212
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:34,485
May I see both parties
in my chambers, please?

1213
01:29:35,026 --> 01:29:38,860
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth</i>,
<i>the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</i>

1214
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:41,156
<i>So help you you?</i>

1215
01:29:43,634 --> 01:29:44,862
Where's....

1216
01:29:48,539 --> 01:29:50,200
<i>Order in the court.</i>

1217
01:29:51,976 --> 01:29:56,310
<i>Your Honor, I'd like permission</i>
<i>to question this witness.</i>

1218
01:30:06,424 --> 01:30:08,221
That's all there is.

1219
01:30:08,559 --> 01:30:13,428
Not one word of what I assume
we all assume we heard.

1220
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:15,056
Someone must have erased it.

1221
01:30:17,635 --> 01:30:20,126
Nobody erases tapes anymore.

1222
01:30:21,539 --> 01:30:25,100
-Then the machine....
-No. Not a thing wrong with it.

1223
01:30:26,444 --> 01:30:28,776
He said he couldn't be recorded.

1224
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:33,283
God, when he first spoke to me,
he said it wasn't his real voice I heard.

1225
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:36,115
He said he was just using one
that I could understand.

1226
01:30:36,187 --> 01:30:37,916
He did it again today.

1227
01:30:37,989 --> 01:30:40,787
And there's nothing wrong
with your stenotype machine?

1228
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:43,850
It took down every word, Your Honor,
except now...

1229
01:30:43,928 --> 01:30:46,192
...some of them are not on the paper.

1230
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:49,864
Don't you see?
He wants us all to decide for ourselves...

1231
01:30:49,934 --> 01:30:51,993
...whether or not we saw him
and heard him.

1232
01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:55,197
It's what he always said,
that everything is up to us.

1233
01:30:55,273 --> 01:31:00,006
No! There is no proof whatsoever
that God was in that courtroom today.

1234
01:31:00,444 --> 01:31:02,742
No, none whatsoever.

1235
01:31:02,813 --> 01:31:06,408
-We saw Him! We heard Him!
-We did.

1236
01:31:09,053 --> 01:31:12,955
-He made himself and the cards disappear.
-We saw it.

1237
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:18,324
On the basis of our common experience
here today...

1238
01:31:18,996 --> 01:31:22,591
...I can see why you first claimed,
and later maintained...

1239
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:27,161
...that you had seen,
and been in the actual presence of...

1240
01:31:28,406 --> 01:31:29,395
...God.

1241
01:31:29,874 --> 01:31:34,834
And for that reason,
your remarks to the Rev. Williams...

1242
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:37,380
...could be regarded
as a divine assignment.

1243
01:31:38,349 --> 01:31:42,911
I shall rule, therefore,
that the charge of slander be dismissed.

1244
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:44,910
Sam!

1245
01:31:46,023 --> 01:31:49,186
Now, if, as you also claim...

1246
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,957
...it is God's opinion...

1247
01:31:53,197 --> 01:31:57,224
...that we should all make
our own decisions...

1248
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:59,895
...and abide by them accordingly...

1249
01:31:59,971 --> 01:32:03,839
...then I must also rule
that on the basis of the evidence...

1250
01:32:07,878 --> 01:32:11,041
...or rather the lack of it...

1251
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:14,578
...that as much as we all may think...

1252
01:32:14,652 --> 01:32:17,348
...that what we saw here today was real...

1253
01:32:18,456 --> 01:32:22,415
...God did not, in fact,
appear here before us.

1254
01:32:25,896 --> 01:32:29,730
You may, of course,
appeal to a higher court.

1255
01:32:31,736 --> 01:32:33,761
We heard from the highest court.

1256
01:32:36,907 --> 01:32:38,238
Thank you.

1257
01:32:39,076 --> 01:32:42,876
-Good-bye, Mister Slavic.
-And Jer, we'll send you your picture.

1258
01:32:44,482 --> 01:32:46,109
-Would you do that?
-Sure.

1259
01:32:46,183 --> 01:32:47,150
Thank you.

1260
01:34:32,723 --> 01:34:33,917
Hello?

1261
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:36,953
-Where are you?
-Turn around.

1262
01:34:45,503 --> 01:34:47,266
How do you like it?

1263
01:34:47,338 --> 01:34:51,035
I'm going on a trip
to spend a little time with animals.

1264
01:34:51,342 --> 01:34:55,335
I like animals, and sometimes
I don't spend enough time with them.

1265
01:34:56,147 --> 01:34:59,981
-We failed, didn't we?
-What are you talking? We did terrific.

1266
01:35:00,317 --> 01:35:04,754
I gave a message of encouragement,
you passed it along, now we'll see.

1267
01:35:05,256 --> 01:35:08,851
You did good. We both did good.
We're covered.

1268
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:10,957
You think anybody got the message?

1269
01:35:11,028 --> 01:35:14,122
Do you think we have enough apples
in the world?

1270
01:35:14,498 --> 01:35:15,487
Apples?

1271
01:35:15,599 --> 01:35:18,932
We got all the apples we need.
You're Johnny Appleseed.

1272
01:35:19,003 --> 01:35:23,804
You drop a few seeds, and you move on.
If the seeds are good, they'll take root.

1273
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,768
I gave you great seeds, the best.

1274
01:35:27,077 --> 01:35:28,601
I lost my job, you know.

1275
01:35:29,346 --> 01:35:32,406
There are other cities, other supermarkets.

1276
01:35:32,483 --> 01:35:34,212
Everybody thinks I'm a nut.

1277
01:35:34,585 --> 01:35:39,045
Galileo, Pasteur, Einstein, Columbus.

1278
01:35:39,423 --> 01:35:42,017
You're in good company. Hold on.

1279
01:35:45,095 --> 01:35:46,687
Better be going.

1280
01:35:47,097 --> 01:35:49,463
-Aren't you coming back?
-No.

1281
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:53,228
-Ever?
-When ever comes, we'll see.

1282
01:35:53,637 --> 01:35:57,266
Sometimes, now and then...

1283
01:35:58,442 --> 01:35:59,909
...couldn't we just talk?

1284
01:35:59,977 --> 01:36:03,208
I'll tell you what. You talk, I'll listen.
