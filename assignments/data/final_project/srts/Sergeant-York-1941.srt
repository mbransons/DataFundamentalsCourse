1
00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:02,418
Bye, Alvin.

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,954
I'll be a-coming back.

3
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:13,088
Ma.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,593
What are they a-fighting for?

5
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,363
I don't rightly know, child.

6
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:23,600
I don't rightly know.

8
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,544
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

9
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:38,017
Okay, Sarge.

10
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:44,524
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

11
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:46,753
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.

12
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,362
Dig, soldiers, dig.

13
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:50,188
Dig your way straight down to China.

14
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,994
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?

15
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,497
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.

16
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,476
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

17
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:04,940
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,147
Which one of your men is York?

19
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,740
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

20
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,412
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?

21
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:15,484
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

22
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,752
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.

23
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,088
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,664
That'll be a big help.

25
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,825
Dig. Dig. Dig.

26
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:34,608
I've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

27
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,907
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.

28
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,879
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,879
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,612
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

31
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,779
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, I guess.

32
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,415
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

33
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,517
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

34
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,685
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.

35
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,658
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

36
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,996
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?

37
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,968
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

38
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:04,334
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

39
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:08,467
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

40
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,840
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

41
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,607
It goes for miles.

42
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,013
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.

43
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,452
It doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,112
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,382
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.

46
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:25,221
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?

47
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,193
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?

48
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,594
Steam... No. Steam cars.

49
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,599
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.

50
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,999
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

51
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,333
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.

52
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,896
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

53
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,965
I'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

54
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,876
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?

55
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,709
Just a word now and then.

56
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,909
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,542
and they wanna get into the cars
all together.

58
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,348
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.

59
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,187
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

60
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,782
"Move back in the cars," I yell.

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,761
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."

62
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,231
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

63
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,528
That's why they call me "Pusher."

64
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,466
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

65
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,504
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:14,304
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.

67
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:17,444
- 2-4-1-8-0-0.
- Zaranopolis Nick.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,581
2-4-1-8-0-1.

69
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,413
- 2-4-1-8-0-1.
- Ross, Michael T.

70
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,579
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

71
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,418
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.

72
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:34,224
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.

73
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,520
York, Alvin C.

74
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,832
Anything wrong with it?

75
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,695
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

76
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:46,934
I thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

77
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,768
No, sir, I ain't.

78
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:52,438
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

79
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,539
- Next man.
- There you are, York.

80
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:59,144
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.

81
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,744
Thomas, Bert E.

82
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,022
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

83
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,192
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

84
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,428
Not bad.

85
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:18,766
You call that clean?

86
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,274
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.

87
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,706
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.

88
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,440
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

89
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,742
Clean it.

90
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,718
That's a good job, York.

91
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,887
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

92
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:36,617
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.

93
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,352
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

94
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:41,361
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.

95
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,836
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

96
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,035
Okay.

97
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,906
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,643
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

99
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:06,710
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.

100
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,879
So don't start murdering each other.

101
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,687
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

102
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,386
Ready, number 30.

103
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,723
Not yet, we'll try it first.

104
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,067
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

105
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,602
Take a deep breath.

106
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,002
Blow, let a little of it out.

107
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:26,935
Hold it.

108
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,408
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

109
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:31,445
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

110
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:34,948
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

111
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,484
Ready? Aim.

112
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,512
I can't hold it no more.

113
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,989
All right, Ross, take another one.

114
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,551
Aim.

115
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:47,986
Fire.

116
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:51,031
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

117
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,259
Just like that.

118
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,732
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

119
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,099
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?

120
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,535
- Yeah.
- Here.

121
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,631
Load.

122
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,667
Aim.

123
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,979
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.

124
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,507
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

125
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:12,951
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

126
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,684
- A miss.
- Miss.

127
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,890
Ready on number 29.

128
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:24,863
Ready on 29.

129
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,263
Ready, 29.

130
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,370
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

131
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,463
Aim. Fire.

132
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:38,137
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

133
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,737
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

134
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,305
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

135
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,407
Yes, sir.

136
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:46,385
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

137
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,615
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.

138
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,783
You reckon you know about that, do you?

139
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,485
We'll see. Here.

140
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,729
Load. Aim.

141
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:02,460
Fire.

142
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,903
- A miss!
- Miss.

143
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,235
So you know about sighting, do you?

144
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,881
I sure thought I cut plumb center
that time.

145
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,382
You did, huh?

146
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:20,114
I can't no ways see how I can miss
that whole great big target.

147
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,782
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

148
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,015
Re-mark for 29.

149
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,822
Re-mark, 29.

150
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,320
Oh, I didn't see that one.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,992
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.

152
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,737
I can't figure out how I got
way down there on the edge.

153
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:43,174
Well, I reckon I can do a little better
when I get used to this here rifle gun.

154
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,644
Here's five chances to do better.

155
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,510
Fire when ready.

156
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,849
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

157
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,656
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

158
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:04,391
I always wet my sights
when I'm fixing to do some shooting.

159
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,991
Okay, do some shooting.

160
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,938
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.

161
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,310
Okay, York. You're on your own.

162
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:30,146
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

163
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,793
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

164
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,195
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

165
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,836
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

166
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,904
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

167
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,006
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

168
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,111
Bring 29 to the firing line.

169
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,720
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

170
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,696
I reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

171
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,256
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

172
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,063
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

173
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:19,868
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.

174
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,273
But they was exaggerating some.

175
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:28,438
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

176
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,507
a-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

177
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,212
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

178
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,585
I'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

179
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,624
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

180
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:40,524
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.

181
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,154
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.

182
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,429
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

183
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,230
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

184
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,895
Yeah, what's the answer?

185
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,201
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

186
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:55,572
the rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

187
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:58,840
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

188
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,606
and then the next one, see?

189
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:04,316
Kind of coming from back to front.

190
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,243
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

191
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,413
And, if...

192
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:11,390
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

193
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,756
but if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

194
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,818
he's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

195
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:18,558
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

196
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,567
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

197
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:24,103
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

198
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,368
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

199
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,103
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?

200
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:33,442
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.

201
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,572
It's your move.

202
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,882
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.

203
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,058
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

204
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,026
made by your company sergeant.

205
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,357
Yes, sir?

206
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,090
You have a very excellent camp record.

207
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,368
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

208
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:59,099
You applied for exemption, I believe,
as a conscientious objector.

209
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:00,435
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,166
Well, I think we can disregard that.

211
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,242
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

212
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,373
to the rank of corporal with special detail

213
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,078
as instructor in target practice.

214
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,121
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.

215
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,157
I congratulate you, York.

216
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:22,318
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

217
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:26,291
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best I can,

218
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,699
like I already done Pusher and Bert.

219
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:33,365
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

220
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,508
well, I don't want to be no corporal.

221
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:40,672
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.

222
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:43,908
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

223
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:45,745
Well, you see, I...

224
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,549
Is it because of your
religious convictions, York?

225
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,351
Yes, sir. That's it.

226
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,190
You see, I believe in the Bible,

227
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,124
and I'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

228
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,632
is something the Lord done give us.

229
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,499
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

230
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,563
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks

231
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:11,975
ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

232
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,012
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.

233
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,051
York, with your permission, Major?

234
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,609
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

235
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,951
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

236
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,620
Yes, sir.

237
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,351
Well, I do, too.

238
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,992
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

239
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,430
for what he believes to be right?

240
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,463
Well, it done said,

241
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,968
"Blessed are the peacemakers."

242
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,733
Yes, I know, but...

243
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,766
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke,

244
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:48,877
where he says, "He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one"?

245
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,780
He said that to Peter.

246
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:53,276
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

247
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:57,483
He said, "Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword."

248
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,185
That were further on.

249
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:02,523
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

250
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,787
But according to St. John,

251
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:08,364
he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

252
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,068
"If my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight."

253
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,970
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

254
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,135
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

255
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,537
And that... That is different.

256
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:22,138
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.

257
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,011
York, have you ever read this?

258
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:27,650
<i>"History of the United States."</i>

259
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:32,951
It sure is a lot of writing.

260
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,694
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:41,765
You know about him?

262
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,235
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

263
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,465
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

264
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,737
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

265
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:53,346
And that book's full of great men.

266
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:59,147
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

267
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,517
when he went out alone
into the wilderness?

268
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,988
Well, I never thought much on it.

269
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,586
Was he looking for new lands?

270
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,490
- Might be.
- Maybe.

271
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,397
Maybe for something more.

272
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:16,431
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

273
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:21,140
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

274
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,540
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.

275
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,578
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

276
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,509
I think that's what he wanted.

277
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,315
I think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

278
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,089
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?

279
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,283
Yep.

280
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:42,487
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

281
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,031
from the very beginning until now.

282
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:47,191
For we're still struggling.

283
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,893
It's quite a story, York.

284
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,634
How they all got together
and set up a government,

285
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:58,504
whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

286
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,548
and each man
to defend the rights of all men.

287
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,616
We call it a government of the people,

288
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,286
by the people and for the people.

289
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:14,392
Why, I never knowed
it was all written down.

290
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:17,492
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,960
You want to worship God
in your own way.

292
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,194
Yes, sir.

293
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,362
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,701
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

295
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:29,936
and raise your family
according to your own likes?

296
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,878
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

297
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,111
But the cost of that heritage is high.

298
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:40,085
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

299
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,420
How you gonna answer that, York?

300
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,019
Well...

301
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,285
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

302
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,129
Well, take your time.

303
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:59,766
Well, if I could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, I...

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,365
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...

305
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,907
I could figure something out.

306
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,414
I've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

307
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,917
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

308
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:13,716
You mean I can go home?

309
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,954
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

310
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,115
I'll recommend your exemption.

311
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,488
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.

312
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,686
I'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

313
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,627
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

314
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,461
I sure would like to read this here book.

315
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,263
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

316
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,703
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

317
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,022
Come on, boy.

318
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:48,770
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

319
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,110
Can't say, child.

320
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:55,014
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

321
00:17:56,189 --> 00:18:00,489
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

322
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:04,254
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

323
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:06,162
He can't read the Book.

324
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,861
Get the table set.

325
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,975
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

326
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,906
Want George to go get him, Ma?

327
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,215
Let him be.

328
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,500
<i>Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.</i>

329
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,164
<i>But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.</i>

330
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,833
<i>Them that lived by the sword,
will be a-perishing by the sword.</i>

331
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,377
<i>The government of all men
to defend the rights of each man.</i>

332
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,469
<i>And each man
to defend the rights of all men.</i>

333
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,277
<i>Remember, the Lord done said,
"Thou shalt not kill."</i>

334
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,374
<i>But the cost of that heritage is high.</i>

335
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,749
<i>Sometimes all we have to preserve it,
even our lives.</i>

336
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,312
<i>- Obey your God.
- Defend your country.</i>

337
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,087
<i>- Your God.
- Your country.</i>

338
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,589
<i>- Your God.
- Your country.</i>

339
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,549
<i>- God.
- Country.</i>

340
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:08,751
<i>- God.
- Country.</i>

341
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,194
<i>- God.
- Country...</i>

342
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,903
"Render therefore unto Caesar

343
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,610
"the things which were Caesar's,

344
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:32,948
"and unto God
the things that were God's."

345
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,420
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.

346
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,459
And unto God, God's.

347
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,073
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.

348
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,209
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

349
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:13,984
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.

350
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,994
Well, you're welcome, York.

351
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,724
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.

352
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,665
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.

353
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,167
I rather hoped that you would, York.

354
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:27,832
But there's just one thing, sir,
that I ought to tell you.

355
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:29,802
There's lots of things...

356
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,003
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.

357
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,979
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

358
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:38,710
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.

359
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:43,684
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than I be.

360
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:51,063
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

361
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,423
It's enough for me that I trust you.

362
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:58,564
And I believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

363
00:20:58,638 --> 00:20:59,900
Thank you, sir.

364
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:03,807
And I'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

365
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:07,677
Well, I'll sure take care of my men
the best I can, sir.

366
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,612
I know you will, York.

367
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,411
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.

368
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:19,689
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

369
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,060
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

370
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:26,127
No, I don't think so, Captain.

371
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,768
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.

372
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:39,475
"Dear Mom,

373
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:44,045
"am feeling just fine
and have taken in all the sights.

374
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:48,611
"And Bert took me to a church
called Notre Dame Cathedral.

375
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:54,016
"It's big enough inside for a fellow
to plant a crop of corn.

376
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,092
"Pusher just come in.

377
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:02,260
"He's saying our outfit is moving up
to front pretty soon.

378
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:07,169
"I reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training

379
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,108
"and they ain't brought us here
for no sight-seeing tour..."

380
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,168
"Tour, nohow.

381
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:17,848
"Gracie wrote in her letter
she was a-worrying.

382
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,346
"Tell her, don't."

383
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,947
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.

384
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:28,717
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.

385
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,961
Alvin's in good hands.

386
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:36,824
The Lord takes care of 'em
that's a-believing in Him.

387
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,131
- Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

388
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:12,337
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

389
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,336
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

390
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,467
We're running shy of these.

391
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,902
Besides, we can do with some help.

392
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,241
Look out.

393
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:32,858
It takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

394
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,687
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

395
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,923
That's only half the truth.

396
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:41,797
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

397
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:43,861
Duck.

398
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:49,706
See what I mean?

399
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:54,175
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

400
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:58,239
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

401
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,478
See?

402
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,754
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

403
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:09,888
Duck again.

404
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:22,732
If that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

405
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,209
You know, you only flop for...

406
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:29,441
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

407
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:30,847
Hey, Bert!

408
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,596
If one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

409
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:06,583
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

410
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:10,513
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

411
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,650
depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

412
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:16,422
which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

413
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,826
It must be taken.

414
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:19,330
This is all open country ahead,

415
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,232
but you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

416
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:26,204
on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

417
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,774
Synchronize your watches.

418
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,944
Use as a mark, 4:32.

419
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,449
It is now minus 10, eight, six,

420
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:40,613
four, two, mark.

421
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:41,745
Any questions?

422
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,948
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

423
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:46,651
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

424
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,853
Zero hour will be 6:10.

425
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:57,096
I'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

426
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,869
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

427
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,533
First platoon at 6:10,

428
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,078
second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

429
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:07,407
Yes, sir.

430
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,161
- 6:10.
- 6:10. All right.

431
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,416
Come on, men!

432
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,575
Halt and take cover!

433
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,057
We'll never get through.

434
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:18,966
We gotta wipe out those nests.

435
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,769
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

436
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,469
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

437
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:28,480
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

438
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:00,342
Take cover.

439
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:03,775
Listen.

440
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:26,498
Heinie!

441
00:30:27,673 --> 00:30:28,799
Listen.

442
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,544
We're not far enough back.

443
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:35,638
Savage, keep the men quiet.

444
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:37,774
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

445
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,409
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

446
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:09,771
Look! Heinies!

447
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,142
Come on, get 'em.

448
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,431
Hold your fire!

449
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:36,998
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

450
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,337
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!

451
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:42,340
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.

452
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:43,643
Go on.

453
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:24,352
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.

454
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,451
Savage.

455
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:28,484
Savage?

456
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,392
Where's Savage?

457
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,594
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

458
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,827
You're the only noncom left.

459
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,570
York, take over.

460
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:43,803
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

461
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,938
Watch this fellow.

462
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,113
The rest of you keep under cover.

463
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,508
Come back here.

464
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,645
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.

465
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,064
Hey, Alvin!

466
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,538
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

467
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,236
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

468
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:25,777
keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

469
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,540
Don't try anything funny.

470
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:29,581
Belly to the ground, you babies.

471
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:30,672
We better get up there.

472
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,911
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

473
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:48,089
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

474
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,635
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

475
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:53,035
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?

476
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,663
I said tell him it's useless.

477
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,039
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.

478
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,393
Just like a flock of turkeys.

479
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:49,127
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

480
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:52,219
Come this a-way.

481
00:35:57,303 --> 00:36:00,636
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

482
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:08,504
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

483
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,915
Keep a-coming.

484
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,582
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

485
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,760
All right. Keep a-coming.

486
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:25,453
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

487
00:36:25,564 --> 00:36:27,088
All right, get on down!

488
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,832
Come on out and keep your hands up.

489
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,462
Boy, I told you.

490
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:40,002
Look at that mob.

491
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,740
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

492
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:43,441
Sure we can. That's my mate.

493
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,779
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

494
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:47,216
Get going.

495
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:49,779
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.

496
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,518
Move forward, there.

497
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:55,116
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

498
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:01,497
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.

499
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,762
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.

500
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,167
Nice going, York.

501
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:08,331
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.

502
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:11,633
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

503
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,769
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.

504
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:17,111
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

505
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,514
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.

506
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:24,884
Watch them fellows.

507
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,925
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

508
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,193
Pusher.

509
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,097
Pusher.

510
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,196
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

511
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:45,205
The end of the line.

512
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:55,880
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

513
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:04,220
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

514
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:07,191
You know what I'm a-saying?

515
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,858
- You understand?
- Yeah.

516
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:11,164
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

517
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:14,467
you and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

518
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,768
Go ahead.

519
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:20,139
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

520
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,845
Look them fellows over good.

521
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:34,318
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.

522
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,884
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.

523
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,198
Now, get going.

524
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,713
Tell 'em to halt.

525
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,489
If you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

526
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,855
which way would you be a-going?

527
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,188
Up there.

528
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:12,256
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

529
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:24,773
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

530
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:27,970
What's up?

531
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,811
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

532
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:35,885
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.

533
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:37,952
We got enough to take care of already.

534
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,718
And a few more won't make no difference.

535
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,020
Hey, you.

536
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,727
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

537
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:47,732
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

538
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:52,303
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

539
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:42,784
They sure are trained good, Major.

540
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,619
Hey, Sarge, look.

541
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,320
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.

542
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:52,886
Hello, there!

543
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:55,329
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.

544
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,664
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.

545
00:40:57,736 --> 00:40:59,670
- Hello there!
- Who are you?

546
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:03,105
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

547
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,134
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!

548
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,545
That's a Yank, all right.

549
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:11,811
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!

550
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:19,416
Keep 'em covered.

551
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,525
Where you going?

552
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:26,223
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

553
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:27,890
It's up that way someplace.

554
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:31,424
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.

555
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,733
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

556
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,602
What would we do with them?

557
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,604
Well, I don't rightly know.

558
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:39,644
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.

559
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:40,973
Thank you.

560
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,071
Come on.

561
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,376
Forward!

562
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,200
All right. Halt!

563
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,067
Prisoners, hold right there!

564
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,971
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

565
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,078
Beg your pardon, sir.

566
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:20,409
Yeah?

567
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,886
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

568
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:26,547
Put 'em right over there.

569
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,493
Wait a minute.

570
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:31,587
How many have you got?

571
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:34,063
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.

572
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:37,295
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

573
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:39,462
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?

574
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:44,007
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

575
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,135
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

576
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:50,511
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.

577
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:54,050
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

578
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,316
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

579
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:59,814
Well, good Lord.

580
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:02,556
I guess we can give you some help.

581
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,562
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

582
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:14,605
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

583
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:18,404
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his lonesome.

584
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:20,672
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.

585
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:23,112
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.

586
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:25,979
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

587
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:29,020
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!

588
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,884
Hey, what's that? How many?

589
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:33,151
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

590
00:43:33,225 --> 00:43:35,625
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?

591
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:37,685
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

592
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:39,128
- I don't know.
- One guy.

593
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:40,425
How could one guy...

594
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:42,729
- Guy named York.
- What's that?

595
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:45,133
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

596
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:47,637
And brought them all back. They say...

597
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:57,044
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

598
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:03,352
Now, as I understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

599
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:05,390
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

600
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:06,481
Yes, sir.

601
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,389
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

602
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,621
that was right up on this other ridge.

603
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:12,687
Yes, sir. Right up there.

604
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:14,624
Where were you?

605
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,999
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.

606
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,700
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so I worked my way across

607
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,871
up behind that log there under the hill.

608
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,376
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

609
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:32,349
your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

610
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:35,443
I reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

611
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,545
What did you wanna go over there for?

612
00:44:37,622 --> 00:44:39,385
Well, I figured that was a good place to be

613
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,154
because they had to rear up
and show themselves

614
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:44,752
in order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

615
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,695
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.

616
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:47,789
I see.

617
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:51,632
So, I went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

618
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:55,700
then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

619
00:44:55,774 --> 00:44:58,470
and couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

620
00:44:58,577 --> 00:45:01,137
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

621
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:03,078
How many did you kill?

622
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,182
I don't rightly know, sir.

623
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:08,481
I think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

624
00:45:08,553 --> 00:45:11,989
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

625
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:15,186
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

626
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,784
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.

627
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:19,763
I was pretty busy
and I reckon they was, too.

628
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:23,332
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

629
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:26,894
and couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

630
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:29,873
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

631
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:35,908
Corporal.

632
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:40,848
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?

633
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:43,714
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

634
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:47,054
you as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

635
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,717
but not to kill.

636
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,725
What made you
decide to change your mind?

637
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:54,564
Well, sir...

638
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,794
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

639
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,565
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

640
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:02,639
But it was this way, Colonel.

641
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,737
When I started out I felt just like you said.

642
00:46:05,811 --> 00:46:07,904
But when I hear them
machine guns a-going

643
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:10,470
and all them fellows
are dropping around me,

644
00:46:10,582 --> 00:46:14,643
I figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

645
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:17,916
and there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

646
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:19,854
And that's what I done.

647
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:23,120
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

648
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:25,663
Yes, sir. That was why.

649
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:33,197
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

650
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:37,064
<i>Sergeant York!</i>

651
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,261
Thank you, sir.

652
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,500
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

653
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,977
you have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

654
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:23,744
Sergeant York, I am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

655
00:47:23,822 --> 00:47:26,689
It's a privilege to command
such men as you.

656
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,162
Sergeant York,

657
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,996
as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

658
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,695
it is my pleasure to confer upon you

659
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,261
the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor

660
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,830
for heroism beyond the call of duty.

661
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:47,601
Thank you, sir.

662
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:16,303
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

663
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,274
representative from
your district of Tennessee.

664
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:20,470
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

665
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:22,979
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

666
00:48:23,048 --> 00:48:24,982
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

667
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,075
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.

668
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,624
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

669
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,965
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

670
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,796
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

671
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:50,340
may I present you with this key to our city

672
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:52,933
as a token of our very great esteem.

673
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:54,943
And may God bless you.

674
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:58,544
Thank you for what you said,

675
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:01,381
and I'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

676
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:03,944
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

677
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:09,193
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

678
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,023
Is there anything we can do for you?

679
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:13,121
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.

680
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:14,324
And that is?

681
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:15,923
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

682
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:19,835
I sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

683
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:21,533
I think we can arrange that.

684
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,537
Well, here we are.

685
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:34,915
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

686
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:36,851
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.

687
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:39,754
If there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

688
00:49:39,824 --> 00:49:41,724
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

689
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:45,786
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

690
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:04,247
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

691
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:07,113
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

692
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:09,312
So we understand.

693
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:17,256
Representative Hull.

694
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:20,558
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

695
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:22,731
Put them on.

696
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,333
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?

697
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:29,938
Thank you.

698
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:35,270
Hello. Hello there.

699
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:39,575
What?

700
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:42,784
Who is it?

701
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,422
I... I can't hear you.

702
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,088
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?

703
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:52,760
I can't hear you.

704
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:54,799
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

705
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:56,299
Stand closer, Ma.

706
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,699
When are you coming home, Alvin?

707
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:03,101
I said, when are you coming home?

708
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:08,005
Oh, I'm glad, Son.

709
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,238
I'll tell her.

710
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:13,310
She's right here.

711
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:16,585
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

712
00:51:18,556 --> 00:51:21,081
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!

713
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:24,051
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

714
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:26,620
He's got this here phone in here now.

715
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:29,531
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

716
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:31,692
I can't wait to see you.

717
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,069
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

718
00:51:35,573 --> 00:51:36,665
Yeah.

719
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:40,876
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.

720
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:43,471
Bye.

721
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,320
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

722
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,792
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.

723
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,788
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

724
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,493
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

725
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,995
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?

726
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,067
I wanna be a-going home.

727
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:39,069
When do you think I can go?

728
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:41,970
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.

729
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:44,399
I've got to get to work.

730
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:47,808
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

731
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:48,868
What do you mean?

732
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,347
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

733
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,407
You're a pretty famous man now.

734
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:56,112
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

735
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:58,417
it seems a lot of people realize it.

736
00:52:58,489 --> 00:52:59,956
For instance,

737
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:03,258
two companies want you
in motion pictures,

738
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:06,024
<i>Ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new Follies.</i>

739
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:09,294
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

740
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:13,394
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

741
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:15,234
What does that mean?

742
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,468
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

743
00:53:21,112 --> 00:53:24,138
I ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

744
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:26,012
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

745
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:28,575
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far

746
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:31,622
and they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

747
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:33,748
They're offering me all that money?

748
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:36,521
It's just a plain business proposition.

749
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:40,323
I sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

750
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:42,989
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...

751
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,297
Here's your chance to get it.

752
00:53:47,105 --> 00:53:50,666
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

753
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:53,176
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?

754
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:55,843
That's it.

755
00:53:57,248 --> 00:53:59,773
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

756
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:03,818
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.

757
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:05,712
I reckon it is.

758
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,825
Take all the time you want to think it over.

759
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,459
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

760
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:14,362
I ain't proud of what happened over there.

761
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:17,696
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

762
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:20,600
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

763
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:25,736
So, the way I figure,
things like that ain't for buying and selling.

764
00:54:25,843 --> 00:54:27,504
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.

765
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:30,672
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

766
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:33,146
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?

767
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:40,014
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.

768
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,989
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.

769
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:02,337
Oh, there he is!

770
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:19,657
Alvin!

771
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:21,289
Oh, Alvin!

772
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,060
How are you?

773
00:55:44,722 --> 00:55:46,189
Ma, I'm back.

774
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,421
I'm right glad, Son.

775
00:55:52,497 --> 00:55:54,931
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

776
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,293
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.

777
00:55:58,369 --> 00:55:59,597
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

778
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,104
They better be a-something big.

779
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,671
As I was saying, Alvin,

780
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:07,177
of course, I always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

781
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:10,180
but I ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

782
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:12,910
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

783
00:56:12,984 --> 00:56:14,747
since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

784
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,184
Sure are, Alvin.

785
00:56:16,854 --> 00:56:18,378
Hang on, Rosie.

786
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:21,715
Hey,

787
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,787
what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

788
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:28,354
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.

789
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,993
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.

790
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:35,130
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

791
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,572
I sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

792
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:39,872
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

793
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:42,037
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

794
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:46,071
I'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

795
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:49,146
Hang on, everyone.

796
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,281
Hey, look here.

797
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:59,825
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.

798
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:03,099
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.

799
00:57:03,668 --> 00:57:05,533
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.

800
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:08,265
There's something we got to talk about.

801
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:11,569
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?

802
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,507
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

803
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:15,273
and all them people coming here
from all over...

804
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:18,804
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but I reckon we'll get through it all right.

805
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:22,250
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?

806
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,518
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

807
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:28,855
Why, some girls don't even get that.

808
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,454
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

809
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,997
Oh, I don't know.

810
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:36,329
I done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

811
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,460
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

812
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:41,797
I'm expecting my husband to love me.

813
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:44,398
I reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

814
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:46,966
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

815
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:49,035
just a-having you. But...

816
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,909
Well, I was expecting to take over
from here myself.

817
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:55,578
I reckon you'll get to do your share.

818
00:57:56,187 --> 00:57:58,951
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

819
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,479
We got to wait.

820
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:03,857
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

821
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:05,793
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.

822
00:58:05,863 --> 00:58:09,492
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.

823
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:13,563
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till I tell you.

824
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:15,800
Come on.

825
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,770
There! Now you can look.

826
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:26,747
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

827
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,987
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.

828
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:32,887
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

829
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:34,891
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres

830
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:39,020
and the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

831
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:41,289
And it's for us.

832
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,704
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

833
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:52,270
Come on.

834
00:58:53,305 --> 00:59:53,447
