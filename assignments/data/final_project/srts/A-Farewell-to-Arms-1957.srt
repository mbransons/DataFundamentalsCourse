1
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,576
Driver.

2
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:56,975
- Driver, stop!
- What type is in there?
Why do you want to stop?

3
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,774
The man up there. He is bleeding
to death.

4
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:03,572
We can't stop. Not here.

5
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,372
The brakes won't hold.

6
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:54,352
Orderly, Orderly!

7
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:07,547
and just as guilty as a soldier would be.....

8
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,546
...who deserted his post under fire.

9
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,145
Now in making an example of you, I....

10
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:21,341
I beg your pardon sir. I have some
wounded outside. I am looking for the...

11
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:25,940
Oh yes, yes, yes. You want the
Italian unit. We are the English unit you see.

12
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,538
- Yes number 207.
- They're in the other wing. Moved in today.

13
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:31,737
Yes out that way, straight ahead.

14
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,337
Thank-you Major.

15
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,522
What's the girl's friend been doing?

16
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Typical male conceit.

17
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:25,516
I think they're going to send her
back home.

18
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,714
It's a dirty shame.
She'll be disgraced.

19
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:30,962
- It's the regulations.
- At least to have a baby here???

20
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:33,726
If they send her back now, all her friends will know.

21
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,302
She's only herself to blame.

22
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,600
This is war, Fergie. And she loved him.

23
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,313
Shh, here they come.

24
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:52,510
Well, is it necessary for us all to be
here at one time? Get back to your post.

25
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:57,707
You'll be packed and ready to leave
within the hour.

26
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,106
Molly.

27
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,104
Can I help pack.

28
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:11,302
I guess so....if you want to.

29
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,101
Why of course I want to.

30
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,700
- Good girls.
- I beg your pardon?

31
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,098
I say, she's the only human being in
the whole lot of us.

32
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:26,297
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to
sympathize with one....

33
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,095
....that has disgraced the uniform
we all wear.

34
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,887
- Baby!
- Rinaldi!
- Federico!

35
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,886
Get away. You're filthy.

36
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,284
You Anglo-Saxons. You're not to
clean yourself.

37
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:58,083
Did you bring me some good
kisses, baby? Did you have trouble finding us?

38
00:05:58,684 --> 00:05:59,483
No.

39
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:00,682
How do you feel? Is there going to
be an offensive?

40
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,681
Were you under fire? Madonna, but
I worried about you!

41
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,080
Yes, I can see how much you've
been worrying.

42
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,078
I had 7 operations today baby and
one of them was beautiful.

43
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,477
I took the heart out.

44
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:16,476
It lay in my hand, and beat like this.

45
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,675
You should have seen it. It was lovely.

46
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:22,873
Soon Rinaldi will be the best
surgeon in all the court.

47
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:24,873
Then in all the army.....

48
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,072
and some day, in all of Italy.

49
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,071
- Why not in all the world?
- Why not?

50
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,069
You will like it here baby.

51
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,068
What sort of a town is this?
Any girls?

52
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,267
Many beautiful English nurses.

53
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,268
No, I mean girls.

54
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,320
Girls to, the house's full of them.

55
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:41,492
Another villa Rosa?

56
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,831
Some of them have never been to the front before.

57
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:44,992
perhaps...

58
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,297
but the nurses are much nicer

59
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:51,666
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley
I am in love with her.

60
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:52,466
Does she know it?

61
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:53,665
Not yet.

62
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:54,865
Have you any money?

63
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,064
- Yes.
- Lend me 50 lire.

64
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:58,263
What for?

65
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:01,862
I want to make on Miss Barkley the
impression of a man of sufficient wealth.

66
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,462
- All right.
- Thank-you.

67
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,260
You are my great and good friend
and financial protector.

68
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,459
And you're an ass.

69
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,058
Now we will eat and drink and I will
take you to meet Miss Barkley.

70
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,257
But, you must make for me a good
impression upon her.

71
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,855
- Now listen......
- But you must.

72
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:18,855
And you can have a nurse too.

73
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:22,853
There is another one named Miss
Ferguson. She is also very, very nice.

74
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,452
- No.
- No?

75
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:33,158
First we will eat and drink and then
we'll go and see the girls
who have never been to the front before, yes?

76
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,167
Yes.

77
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,057
You know what an American is?

78
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:51,058
yes

79
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:52,059
What is it?

80
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,595
She doesn't know.

81
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,038
Well I'm an American.

82
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,141
Then what are you doing here?

83
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:02,800
Drinking, mostly.

84
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,138
He likes the uniform.

85
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:06,041
He's wrong.

86
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,380
I like them languages.

87
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:11,301
Then what were you doing in Italy?

88
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:13,235
Studying.

89
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:15,268
Studying what?

90
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:17,869
Architecture.

91
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:20,499
You know what that is?

92
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,488
Yes.

93
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:22,443
What?

94
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,547
You see, she doesn't know.

95
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:32,295
Neither do I.

96
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,701
Oh, you've had too much wine.

97
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:38,849
It's filthy wine....it takes the enamel off your
teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.

98
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:41,542
- Where was I?
- Architecture.

99
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,439
Oh yes. Look.....

100
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,039
.....I'll explain.

101
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:51,237
This my dear, is called an arch....

102
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:44,415
The arch my dear, is perhaps the
oldest of architecturial devices.

103
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,014
Arch. Architecture.

104
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:52,413
The very word will tell you how
inextricably the two are one.

105
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:53,812
In a word my dear.....

106
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,211
Architecture.....

107
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,410
...is the most ancient of the arts.

108
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,509
You'd better put your shoe on,
you'll get cold feet.

109
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:11,906
If you please, I'd like to go now.

110
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,906
The air raid seems to be over.

111
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:14,905
Catherine.

112
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,104
Catherine.

113
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:21,103
- Catherine.
- Here I am Fergie. I'm coming.

114
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,701
Oh, I was so worried.

115
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:25,501
Did you think I'd been blown away?

116
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,500
I didn't know what to think. Nobody
saw where you went.

117
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,300
Who's that man.

118
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,098
Oh, I don't know.
Some lunatic.

119
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,697
Come on.

120
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:47,092
What if we take the mountains to
the north. Behind them are more
mountains....

121
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,090
and behind those more yet. And we
take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting.

122
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,289
One side of course will stop.

123
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,688
- It will go on forever.
- Like him.

124
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:11,483
No, no, no. It is not true.

125
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,081
But you don't want us to attack?

126
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,080
If we must have war, I suppose we
have to attack.

127
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,479
But, so many die that way.

128
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,878
But what is death to a Christian.

129
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,673
Don't encourage him Fergie.

130
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,271
Frederico.

131
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:40,471
- You are back safe.
- Hello Father.

132
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,470
- I am so glad.
- He prays and prays for you Frederico.

133
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,468
Every time you go out the door, he
does the same.

134
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,868
Oh, I pray for you all.

135
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,667
You are late baby. How is it up
there? Quiet?

136
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,067
You nearly missed the party.

137
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:52,866
But it is very dull.

138
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:56,065
But Miss Barkley is her and her
friend Miss Ferguson.

139
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,663
The one you will like. Come.

140
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:07,060
Miss Barkley, permit me to present
to you...

141
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,260
... my friend and war brother Lt. Henry.
He has just returned back from the front.

142
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:11,858
How do you do?

143
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,257
How do you do?

144
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,257
And this is Miss Ferguson.

145
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,256
-How do you do?
- How do you do?

146
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:24,853
Now he begins again, that fellow.
Quick let us go into the garden.

147
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,445
Now, you stay here.

148
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:50,043
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?

149
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:52,442
- Which do you like?
- All of them.

150
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:54,242
Then you shall have them.

151
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,834
-Nice out here.
- Isn't it?

152
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,031
We seem fated to bump into each
other in the dark.

153
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:24,430
I'm sorry about that. I mistook you
for someone else.

154
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,829
So I gathered.

155
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,228
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that too.

156
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,226
- Mad?
- No.

157
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:36,025
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

158
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,224
Then what are you doing in the
Italian army?

159
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:41,822
It's not really the army, it's only the
ambulance.

160
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,021
It's very odd. Why did you do it?

161
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:47,021
I don't know. Why did you?

162
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,819
Oh, I joined up in England.

163
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,618
The fact is the boy I was engaged
to had gone across.

164
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,415
- Where is Miss Ferguson.
- Why don't you go and see?

165
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:04,014
Yes, do bring her out Captain
Rinaldi.

166
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:17,409
Have some?

167
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:18,608
Thanks.

168
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:22,406
He's sore.

169
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:24,005
What for?

170
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,004
Because I'm here with you.

171
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,204
Women prefer him as a rule.

172
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,601
Shall we take a walk?

173
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,200
Yes, let's.

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,398
- Where is he now?
- Who?

175
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,197
The boy you were engaged to.

176
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:45,797
He's dead.

177
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:48,596
He was killed in Assam.

178
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,995
Were you engaged long?

179
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:53,194
Eight years. We grew up together.

180
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,794
Why didn't you marry?

181
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,792
I didn't know what the war was like
then

182
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,391
If I had to do over again, I'd marry him.

183
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,787
When I joined up, I had this silly
idea that he may......

184
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,986
.....come to the hospital where I was.

185
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:19,185
With a saber cut I suppose and a
bandage around his head.

186
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:22,584
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

187
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,982
This is a picturesque front. Not
France.

188
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:27,782
He didn't have a saber cut.

189
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,181
They blew him to bits.

190
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
What are you thinking about now?

191
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,560
About whiskey.

192
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,759
What about whiskey?

193
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,758
About how nice it is.

194
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:27,957
You're nice too.

195
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:34,755
No.

196
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:35,954
- Why not?
- No don't.

197
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:37,553
- Yes.
- No please!

198
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:45,949
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

199
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,149
It's all right.

200
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:49,349
I'm dreadly sorry. Really.

201
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:52,948
I just couldn't bear...

202
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,347
...the nurses' evening-off aspect of it.

203
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,145
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.

204
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:00,544
Poor man.

205
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,543
You see......I've been leading a
funny sort of life.

206
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,941
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

207
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,940
You don't have to talk a lot of
nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

208
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,338
We could get along.

209
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:17,937
Couldn't we?

210
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,336
You're sweet.

211
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,535
- No I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

212
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,533
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

213
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:09,273
Your are looking for someone?

214
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:10,565
Have you seen Miss Barkley?

215
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,952
Miss Barkley?

216
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,723
Didn't she go out there with you?

217
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:14,825
With me?

218
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,085
No.

219
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,113
But just a little while ago?

220
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:23,730
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate 
with the lieutenant Henry.

221
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,651
She went out with an officer?
Alone?

222
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:30,036
Well, perhaps I was mistaken, 
you know it is quite dark out there.

223
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:30,991
Oh she wouldn't do that.

224
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,980
No. No I am sure I was mistaken.

225
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:36,052
Where is she then?

226
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:42,425
You're a real girl.

227
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:44,471
I'm a crazy girl.

228
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,329
What?

229
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:47,080
with bad ??? ideals??

230
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,796
It's nice
and enough.

231
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,557
It's nice. I suppose that has to be enough

232
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,430
for people who live as we live.

233
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,653
Back home I'd have courted you and send you flowers.

234
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,287
Out here you crowd it all into one hour.

235
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:11,630
Not the way it's got to be, out here.

236
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,811
look,

237
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,820
tomorrow morning I have to go to the front again.

238
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:20,902
if a shell got me

239
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:23,419
and you never saw me again

240
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,237
then we'd both be sorry that we've been so formal

241
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,736
waiting

242
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,790
besides, what's this so fine,
putting it off

243
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,043
dragging it out?

244
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:37,944
hearing the auditions ??? tonight

245
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:39,810
- you're so.... tomorrow
- no

246
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,434
no wait, no please...

247
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:50,053
Catherine

248
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,286
Catherine

249
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,444
thank you for the lovely concert

250
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,923
I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley?

251
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,238
It's not like her to disappear this way.

252
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,518
Perhaps if she felt ill and went home alone.

253
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:07,435
perhaps

254
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,318
good night

255
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:20,248
why didn't you tell me?

256
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:22,009
it doesn't matter.

257
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:25,601
if it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

258
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:28,801
a new church out???
and those stars

259
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:29,979
why not?

260
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:30,768
why not?

261
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,578
there's a war on.

262
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:36,060
and tonight who cares,
and tomorrow who knows.

263
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,580
what did you say your name was?

264
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:42,498
stop it

265
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:51,811
if you know how I was back home,
you'd feel very sorry.

266
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:54,494
please, stop it

267
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,938
we blame everything on the war,
but that's rot

268
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,318
it's something in ourselves

269
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,966
the lady sat in the public square

270
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,479
and mourned her lost innocence

271
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,504
don't be sorry

272
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,438
I'm not

273
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,220
I love you

274
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,660
oh darling

275
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:56,116
Did you have a nice time baby?

276
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,514
You made progress with her, eh?

277
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:01,514
We're friends.
If that's what you mean?

278
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:06,513
I mean...was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

279
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,213
Shut up!

280
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:10,211
I am a man of extreme delicacy, but
was she.....

281
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:13,010
Rinaldi! Will you please shut up.

282
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,209
If you want to be a friend of mine,
shut up.

283
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,608
I am your best friend and your war
brother.

284
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,007
Then shut up.

285
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:26,005
Miss Barkley prefers you to me.
That is very clear.

286
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:30,403
But Miss Ferguson is very nice too.

287
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:33,202
Do you like her?

288
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,201
No!

289
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,093
That you of all people...

290
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:10,724
you're all geese, that's what you are

291
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,001
silly geese.

292
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:15,188
stop this bunk??? about woman's part in the war

293
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:17,887
we must bring solace to the men who fight

294
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:20,309
sacrifice ourselves,
give ourselves

295
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,580
if you'd known him for a long time,

296
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:26,225
had been in love with him

297
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,835
but you only met him tonight

298
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:32,724
How long must you know a man
before you can love him?

299
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,247
Are you pretending to be in love with that man?

300
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,703
I think I am.

301
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:40,493
I must be.

302
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:43,097
it couldn't have happened.

303
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,825
you're just another humped up steam???

304
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,149
one in a hundred

305
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:50,520
you'll probably never see him again.

306
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:55,184
he said if he'd met me back home

307
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:57,311
he'd have courted me

308
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,334
send me flowers

309
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:01,364
but now

310
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,183
I suppose I won't ever see him again

311
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:36,081
Howdy. Good luck.

312
00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:19,662
- Turn back.
- Back?

313
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,262
Yes, back!

314
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,848
- I want to see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

315
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:57,648
Wait, don't go in there.

316
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,437
Why we come back here for?

317
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:25,037
Lt. knows what he's doing. Please.

318
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:29,035
- What's wrong?
- Aren't we going to get started here?
We have plenty of time.

319
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:33,033
I thought you started. What are you
doing here?

320
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,631
We come back Senor Capitano.
The Lt. forgot something.

321
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:00,822
Hi....you're all right aren't you?

322
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,621
Yes, I'm all right.

323
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,420
I came to..

324
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
I thought.....

325
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:09,819
...you see.

326
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,217
I'm going to be away for a while..

327
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:17,615
...and I didn't want you to think that
I'd just gone away.

328
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,215
No, I...

329
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:20,815
What I mean is.....

330
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,413
....I'd hate to have you feel that...

331
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:26,412
it wasn't important to me..

332
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,410
..about us.

333
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,009
I don't exactly know how to say it.

334
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:35,608
You said it very nicely dear, thank-you.

335
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:39,206
No, no I didn't.

336
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:42,206
- You mustn't feel.
- Will you be gone long?

337
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:44,405
No.

338
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:49,403
Only a few days. There's going to
be a show up above Plava.

339
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,601
A show? You'll be careful won't you?

340
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,600
I won't get hit.

341
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,999
Hold this.

342
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:03,597
Here....

343
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,595
It's a St. Anthony.

344
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:16,191
They said St. Anthony is very
useful to guard you from harm.

345
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,791
I'll take good care of him.

346
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:27,187
But I wish I could kiss you.

347
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:44,980
He is my friend and a good soldier

348
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,180
I would hate to see him lose his
head over a woman.

349
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,378
Aren't you exaggerating a bit.

350
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:51,778
I think not.

351
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,777
Couldn't we send her back to the
base, Major?

352
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:56,376
Oh, if you could send her away it
would simplify everything

353
00:28:57,976 --> 00:28:59,374
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

354
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:03,973
Excellent my dear Major.
Magnificent. No wonder the
English are first in diplomacy.

355
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,569
What did you say her name was?

356
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,867
We won't get anything else to eat,
once the attacks start.

357
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,266
This is all they given me.

358
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,665
Starting to eat the rations?

359
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,863
No, we'll all eat together. Come on
and sit down.

360
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:36,660
Thank-you.

361
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,660
Here, you cut this.

362
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,455
Here, take some cheese.

363
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,453
Wash it down with wine.

364
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:59,451
Who caused the attack?

365
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:16,444
Bersaglieri.

366
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:21,442
If nobody would attack,
the war would be over.

367
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,235
420?
- No, 305...

368
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:42,833
- It sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.

369
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:04,425
Lt.! Are you hurt?

370
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,024
My leg.

371
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:11,622
Both of my legs.

372
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:24,416
Lacerations of the scalp and
possible fracture of the skull.

373
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,835
Multiply superficial wounds of the
left and right thigh

374
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,798
......left and right knee and right
foot.....

375
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:38,211
profound wounds of right knee and foot
in current line of duty. Next patient
please.

376
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:54,205
Lift him up on the table. Carefully.

377
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,999
How do you feel, baby?

378
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,196
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?

379
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:16,796
Boneldo telephoned me.

380
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:19,395
The Major gave me permission to come.

381
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:23,393
No one shall hurt you baby. I won't
let them.

382
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,992
No butcher is going to touch my war
brother.

383
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,991
Only Rinaldi can take you and
never hurt you.

384
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,789
You must forgive baby, for talking
so much...

385
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,189
...but I am, I am very moved to see
you bodily wounded.

386
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,587
I will see that you are decorated for
bravery.

387
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:43,985
Perhaps we can you you the
medallio d'argento, but surely the bronze
one. Did you carry somebody on your back?

388
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:46,984
I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't
move.

389
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,383
Surely there was something very
heroic in what you did.

390
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,982
I was blown up eating cheese.

391
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,979
Don't worry baby. I will fix you so
that you are as good as new.

392
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,177
You will see, everyday, I learn to
do things smoother, quicker.

393
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,976
Soon, very soon, you will be
walking again.

394
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:09,175
I brought a present for you.

395
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:12,374
You will find it under your blanket,
next to your heart.

396
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,572
It is a bottle of brandy baby. Very
good brandy.

397
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:18,771
The infantry captured it from the
Austrians on San Gabrielle.

398
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,370
I have another surprise for you.

399
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,170
Take a deep breath.

400
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,369
Where do you think you will go from
here?

401
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:29,566
To the Italian hospital where they
have the male nurses with the beards?

402
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:30,766
No!

403
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,965
I will arrange everything with my
friend, the British Major.

404
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:38,163
You will go to Milan. To the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

405
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:40,362
That makes you happy?

406
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,562
Poor Rinaldi. So alone with the
war...

407
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:47,359
No one to make fun of. No one to
lend him money.

408
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,557
While you are in Milan with the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

409
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:57,155
Making love in Milan to the chaste
Miss Barkley.

410
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:20,747
Look out for the step.

411
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:43,537
Why do you stop?

412
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:47,335
I am superintendent. May I have
your medical papers please.

413
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:49,934
They're in my coat. In the
buttoned-down pocket.

414
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,133
Take him up those stairs, down the
corridor.

415
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:57,331
His room is the one at the end.
You show him Julio.

416
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,730
Who are you?

417
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,528
I am the porter, Lt. Come follow me.

418
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,523
Now Lt., we must lift you up on the bed.

419
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:21,522
- All right. But keep my legs straight.
- Yes, yes Lt.

420
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,120
Can I get you anything?

421
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,919
- Get me some brandy.
- It is not allowed.

422
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:31,717
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the
glory of Italy?

423
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:35,316
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- As you wish.

424
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:43,513
- So it's you!
- Ferguson.

425
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:46,112
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.

426
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,711
I believe that's why you got
wounded.

427
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:49,111
- Where is she?
-You ought to be still.

428
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,110
Here's your chart. I must take your
temperature.

429
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:53,508
Does she know I'm here?

430
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:56,508
Under the arm please.

431
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:07,704
- Hello darling.
- Catherine.

432
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:10,502
You're lovely.

433
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,502
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely.

434
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:16,700
- Oh my poor darling. It's your leg isn't it?
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw.

435
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,496
I have to go now darling, I can't stay.

436
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:25,895
- Will you come back?
- Later, but we have to be awfully careful.

437
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,895
- You've got to come back.
- I will, when I can.

438
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:30,294
- Tonight?
- I'll try?

439
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:32,493
Somebody's coming.

440
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,492
Tonight.

441
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,490
I'll take that thermometer now.

442
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,087
Good gracious.

443
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:50,286
Fetch the doctor.

444
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:54,085
It's a miracle you're not delirious
with such a fever.

445
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:57,483
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet.

446
00:36:58,282 --> 00:36:59,682
It's not what you think.

447
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,071
I've brought you a few little things.

448
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:29,071
And this is mosquito netting and
this is a bottle of vermouth.

449
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,669
You like vermouth?

450
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:34,069
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you for that.

451
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:35,868
It was very good of you to come.

452
00:37:36,268 --> 00:37:38,667
I mustn't stay long. They warned
me not to tire you.

453
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:40,466
You seem very tired yourself.

454
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:42,865
I am tired. I have no right to be.

455
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,464
You have the war disgusted.

456
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,663
No, I hate the war.

457
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,262
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it.

458
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:54,660
You do not see it. Oh, you must
forgive me. I know that you are wounded.

459
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,859
That was an accident.

460
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,059
Still even wounded, you do not see it.

461
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,457
I can tell. I do not see it myself, but
I feel it a little.

462
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:04,656
Come in Cath.

463
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:09,254
Don't go yet Father. It's still early.

464
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,653
Are you sure. With the operation in
the morning, he should rest.

465
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:13,852
He's strong.

466
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:16,451
He has a lovely temperature. It is
always normal.

467
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:18,650
I'm very proud of his temperature.

468
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,049
Maybe all of our children will have
fine temperatures too.

469
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,848
Our children will probably have
beastly temperatures.

470
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,247
Don't mind us Father. We're in love.

471
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:29,247
I know....

472
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:31,646
I can see it in your faces.

473
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:33,845
You approve, don't you, Father?

474
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:37,443
You spoke of children.

475
00:38:40,642 --> 00:38:44,440
This too is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in Gods grace.

476
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,638
Is it not so?

477
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:54,437
And you?

478
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,434
I hadn't thought about it like that.
But...

479
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:03,033
yes, I suppose so.

480
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:24,824
Father, are you...

481
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:27,223
Is that the marriage service?

482
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:50,813
Don't you realize father
that army regulations prevent us from marrying?

483
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,124
it's in Katano??

484
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:08,711
Poor chap.

485
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,310
It's such a crazy marriage.

486
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,310
At least I'm in white.

487
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:15,908
No orange blossoms.

488
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:17,307
I can smell them.

489
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:20,706
No organ music.

490
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:21,906
I can hear it plainly.

491
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:40,293
It was a foolish notion perhaps.

492
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:43,402
I have not the right to say you are married.

493
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,298
Yet it has made me happy to do this.

494
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:49,097
For now, from my heart, can I say I
bless you in His name.

495
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:50,896
Thank-you Father.

496
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:54,494
Good-bye and be happy, both of you.

497
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:56,094
Thank-you Father.

498
00:40:58,093 --> 00:41:00,293
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.

499
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,491
And get well soon. I will come
again the next time I am in Milan.

500
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,090
- Good-bye my dear.
- Good-bye.

501
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:15,863
Is Miss Barkley here?

502
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:20,531
no.

503
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,730
Shut the door.

504
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:37,526
- But dear!
- please darling

505
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,732
we mustn't do it.
your operation's in the morning.

506
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:49,887
it's our wedding night.

507
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:52,355
oh darling

508
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,210
you'll have to take your oil.

509
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:58,001
castor oil? no!

510
00:41:58,036 --> 00:41:59,176
you'll take it from me

511
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:00,813
I'll take anything from you

512
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,109
if you stay

513
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,650
oh darling darling

514
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:09,390
I want what you want.

515
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:11,483
there isn't any me any more,
just what you want

516
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:12,746
you're sweet

517
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,626
when I think about the way...

518
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:23,359
such a lovely way

519
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:28,366
feel all we feel...

520
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:30,950
no woman in my heart beat..

521
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:33,558
I'm mad about you...

522
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,959
That's the opera I made my debut in
at La Scala.

523
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,358
They threw benches at him.

524
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,757
-That's a lie.
- Yes, they did. I threw six benches myself.

525
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:55,557
That's not funny.

526
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:02,754
Oh now he is offended.

527
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:05,753
He'll get over it. That's his sore
spot. We always tease him.

528
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,151
- You don't care whom you hurt.
- Now don't you get mad too.

529
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:11,751
Catherine and I were thinking of
asking you to our wedding.

530
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,149
Weren't we Catherine?

531
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:15,548
- You'll never get married.
- We will!

532
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,947
No you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.

533
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:19,747
- Oh, we never fight.
- You've time yet.

534
00:44:19,947 --> 00:44:20,947
We won't fight ever.

535
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:22,146
You'll die then.

536
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:25,344
Fight or die. That's what people do.

537
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:27,743
- They don't marry.
- Fergie...

538
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:31,542
I'm not crying.

539
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,541
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.

540
00:44:37,212 --> 00:44:38,482
Watch out you don't get her into trouble.

541
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:39,980
I won't get her into trouble.

542
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:41,112
We've had enough.

543
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:42,209
They'll kill you.

544
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,540
Why, Fergie.....

545
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:46,939
What is the matter with her?

546
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,338
She doesn't like me, that's all.

547
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,937
Oh no. She just likes me more.

548
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,733
Are you on night duty tonight?

549
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,732
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.

550
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,132
You wait and see......

551
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,729
Darling.....how many other girls
have you ever loved?

552
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:12,129
None.

553
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:13,528
How many, really?

554
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:15,527
None.

555
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:17,938
How many have you...

556
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:20,345
how do you say it?

557
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,477
... loved?

558
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:23,925
- None.
- you're lying to me.

559
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:26,124
Of course.

560
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,123
that's right, just keep on lying,
that's what I want you to do.

561
00:45:30,722 --> 00:45:31,721
Were they pretty?

562
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,321
I've never been with anyone.

563
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:35,121
That's right darling.

564
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:37,719
What were they like?

565
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:39,519
I don't know anything about it.

566
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:43,916
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.

567
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:46,916
I don't care if you have though. I'm
not afraid of them.

568
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:48,714
Only don't tell me about them.

569
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,514
You never told them you loved them
did you?

570
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:54,113
- No.
- I knew you wouldn't.

571
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:58,110
-Oh darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.

572
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:00,710
- Right here on the street?
- Yes.

573
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,704
I'll go in first.

574
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:31,298
What is this? If I may ask.

575
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:32,698
What was in it.

576
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:37,496
That's Kümmel. That's the best kind. It comes
in those bear shaped bottles from Russia.

577
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,494
And these.

578
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:43,293
That's brandy, wine and whiskey.

579
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:45,492
And I have been pitying you for
being wounded.

580
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:48,690
Pity is something that is wasted on you.

581
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,291
Thank you.

582
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,089
If you're so anxious not to go back
to the front......

583
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,689
.....I should think you'd try
something more intelligent.

584
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,088
Not self-inflicted alcoholism.

585
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,086
- What?
- I said alcoholism.

586
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:02,686
And I also say, that I'll see you
convalescent leave is canceled.

587
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:05,884
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.

588
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:32,074
Have I time for a drink before the
train leaves?

589
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:33,273
- For the front?
- Yes.

590
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:35,073
In about 20 minutes senor
Capitano.

591
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,696
it's a fine room, a lovely room

592
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:09,787
it's alright

593
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:12,499
the red plush is just the thing.

594
00:48:12,534 --> 00:48:14,913
those mirrors are very attractive too

595
00:48:14,948 --> 00:48:18,967
people who go in for vice
seem to have very good taste about it

596
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:20,895
you're a grand girl

597
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,884
oh darling

598
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,293
I wish you could do something really simple

599
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:30,802
everything we do seems so innocent and right.

600
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:33,172
You're a fine simple girl.

601
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,771
I am a simple girl. Nobody but
you ever realized it.

602
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,170
At first, I thought you were a crazy
girl.

603
00:48:39,569 --> 00:48:40,768
I was a little crazy at first.

604
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:47,166
Is that your train?

605
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,165
Maybe.....

606
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:52,763
It makes a return. But it stays in the
station here until it is time to leave.

607
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,763
There's really lots of time.

608
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:04,360
But at my back, I always hear, time's
wicked chariot hurrying near"....

609
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:08,157
I know that poem. It's by Marlowe.

610
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:10,611
only it's about a girl
who wouldn't live with a man.

611
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:19,755
Listen.

612
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:27,551
It's only the rain.

613
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,550
I hate the rain.

614
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,350
I like it.

615
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,949
I'm afraid of the rain.

616
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:34,748
Afraid, why?

617
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:35,948
I.....

618
00:49:36,747 --> 00:49:38,147
Oh, perhaps it's silly.

619
00:49:38,547 --> 00:49:39,346
What? Tell me.

620
00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:40,946
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.

621
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:43,345
All right.,

622
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:47,943
I'm afraid of the rain, because
sometimes I see me dead in it.

623
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:48,742
No!

624
00:49:49,743 --> 00:49:51,341
And sometimes I see you dead in it.

625
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:55,140
-Well that's more likely.
-Oh no darling, don't say that.

626
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:01,738
That is your train.

627
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,535
"Time's winged chariot".

628
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:13,133
I'll come with you.

629
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,931
No, please, I don't want you. Not
at the station.

630
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:18,730
All right darling.

631
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:20,530
How often will you write?

632
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,529
As often as I can. Do they read
your letters?

633
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:24,728
They can't read English enough to
hurt anything.

634
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:26,327
Well I'll make them very confusing.

635
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:28,127
But not too confusing.

636
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,326
Oh, I should have got you a going-
away gift.

637
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:32,125
A whistle to make you feel better in
the dark.

638
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:35,723
Or a sword. I'm sure we could get
a used sword very cheap.

639
00:50:36,124 --> 00:50:37,323
Swords aren't very useful at the
front.

640
00:50:37,723 --> 00:50:39,722
Oh I see, they get in the way of
your legs when you are running.

641
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:42,720
They might be useful at mess
though.

642
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,119
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.

643
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:51,917
I hate to leave our fine house.

644
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,116
So do I.

645
00:50:56,315 --> 00:50:58,914
We never stay settled very long in a
home, do we?

646
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,514
We will.

647
00:51:02,513 --> 00:51:04,712
I'll have a fine home for you when
you come back.

648
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:08,110
Say I'll come back to Catherine.

649
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:11,509
I'll come back to Catherine.

650
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:20,506
I'll always come back.

651
00:51:24,904 --> 00:51:27,303
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a
little in the foot.

652
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,103
Or the lobe of the ear.

653
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,502
Oh no. I want your ears just the
way they are.

654
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,500
Your feet have been hurt already.

655
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,450
I want a ticket to Switzerland
please.

656
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:44,048
- Where Senora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.

657
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:46,647
- That would be Brissago.
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.

658
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:47,846
All right.

659
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:50,446
Oh Fergie, I was afraid you wouldn't
come.

660
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:52,045
Would you mind telling me what this
is all about?

661
00:53:52,644 --> 00:53:55,397
- I'm going away.
- So I gathered by this, but where, why.....

662
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,193
To Switzerland, to have a baby.

663
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,164
I knew he's get you in trouble.

664
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:03,623
it wasn't his fault

665
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,701
what are you going to do about it?

666
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:05,890
he doesn't know it.

667
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:07,044
You didn't tell him?

668
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:09,843
What would be the good. It would only
worry him and he would have to go anyway.

669
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:11,642
Aren't you going to tell him.

670
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:15,240
Well, not yet.
I may write him from Switzerland.

671
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,240
-You're a fool.
- Here Signora.

672
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:20,639
- On track three.
- Thank-you.

673
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:22,437
What's the hurry?
Why tonight?

674
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:23,837
I couldn't go back to that hospital.

675
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,836
I couldn't stand it. Not with him
gone.

676
00:54:26,236 --> 00:54:29,234
- But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.....
- Now don't worry Fergie, I'll be all right.

677
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:33,833
You're not afraid of anything are you?

678
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:36,431
Only of going back to that hospital.

679
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,030
Don't scold me Fergie.

680
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:44,029
I'll carry it.

681
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:22,413
I've always told you I was a crazy girl.....

682
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:25,012
I couldn't bear Milan while you were away.

683
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:27,812
So, I've chucked the war and come
to live in this little Swiss town....

684
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:29,610
......as near as possible to the
Italian border.....

685
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:30,610
and you.

686
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,408
And darling, it's an adorable place
and we'll be very happy here.

687
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:36,008
I've taken a suite....

688
00:55:40,406 --> 00:55:42,206
....in the best hotel.

689
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:48,003
And I am fairly wallowing in luxury.
The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.

690
00:55:49,003 --> 00:55:51,402
There is a maroon velvet carpet,
ankle deep.......

691
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:54,201
....and a bathroom, or darling the
bathroom.

692
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,599
It's a black marble, with silver
fittings.

693
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:02,197
I've just dined in state, at my sitting-
room window.

694
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:07,196
From which there is a divine view
of the lake, shimmering in moonlight.

695
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:21,790
I'm an awful liar darling.....

696
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:25,988
It's not really a nice place at all. It's
mean, cheap and horrible.

697
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:27,787
But it doesn't matter where I live....

698
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:30,786
....because I don't really live at all,
when I'm not with you.

699
00:56:33,785 --> 00:56:34,985
Darling....

700
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:40,182
What I really want to tell you is...

701
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:44,181
......I shall lie awake in the dark and cry
because you are not here.

702
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,980
I'm lonely and frightened.

703
00:56:48,578 --> 00:56:49,778
And I love you.

704
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:03,973
-Hurry baby.
- Why?

705
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:05,972
- It's time to go.
- Go where?

706
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:09,370
But I told you before to the Villa
Rosa. New girls. Everybody is going.

707
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:10,570
No, not me.

708
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,168
But you must. It will be a fine party
and besides I said that you would go.

709
00:57:14,968 --> 00:57:16,367
I can't. I've got to write a letter.

710
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,966
To that little......everyday, more
letters. You might as well be married.

711
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:23,364
That's my business.

712
00:57:24,365 --> 00:57:27,763
Oh baby. How are you ever going
to come back to me?

713
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:32,361
Serious, like a shopkeeper with a
liver. Where is my war brother, who
used to get drunk with me....

714
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,360
......and go to the Villa Rosa every night?

715
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,559
Leave me alone, will you?

716
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,558
Why? Isn't she just a girl?

717
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:42,957
Keep her out of this.

718
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:46,555
Secrets. Believe me baby.....

719
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:49,954
...secrets subjects are not good for
soldiers.

720
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:53,953
Why don't you be like me? All fire
and smoke.

721
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:55,552
And nothing inside.

722
00:57:56,552 --> 00:57:58,951
- Come on baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.

723
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,549
Of course I am drunk. You come
with me and you will be drunk too.

724
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:04,348
Come on baby.

725
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:08,347
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must
come. There is no more ink.

726
00:58:09,546 --> 00:58:11,345
Get your hands off me and get out!

727
00:58:17,343 --> 00:58:18,543
Poor baby....

728
00:58:19,143 --> 00:58:21,542
Tomorrow I will get you drunk,
and I will take out your liver

729
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:25,140
...and I will put you in a good Italian
liver and make a man of you again.

730
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,539
Ciao baby

731
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:40,534
You're going out Senor Capitano?

732
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:42,534
Yes, why?

733
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,533
The mail just came, Senor
Capitano.

734
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:46,932
You censure it.

735
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:50,130
Senor Capitano.....the officers' mail too?

736
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:09,322
- Aren't you going to open them
Senor Capitano? - No!

737
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:10,922
I'm in a hurry.

738
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:31,314
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Senor Capitano.

739
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,913
I do not like to see himself lose his
head over a woman.

740
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:36,312
Yes Senor Capitano.

741
00:59:59,303 --> 01:00:01,702
And today my letters came back.
Everyone that I'd ever written to her.

742
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:02,901
Came back?

743
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,699
Just marked return to sender.
Person unknown.

744
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,299
Well, that's very strange.

745
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:11,298
-32 letters. She never got one.
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.

746
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:15,296
No, she'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

747
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:18,495
- Have you tried......
- I can't get any information at all.

748
01:00:18,894 --> 01:00:21,493
- I've got to go and find her, myself.
- Now, can you?

749
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,892
I'm going to Milan.
I'll find her.

750
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:27,691
Leave of absence forbidden
since that battle in the north again.

751
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,090
- I'm going anyway.
- that's desertion.

752
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,889
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.

753
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:36,687
- You mustn't do this Frederico
- Yes I must.

754
01:00:37,687 --> 01:00:39,286
That's what I wanted to tell you padre.

755
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:41,885
What does this war mean to me
anymore?

756
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,884
What does anything mean, but
finding her.

757
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:46,883
- But Frederico, consider the.......
- I can depend on you padre?

758
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,080
Say good-bye to Rinaldi and the
others for me.

759
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,879
- When are you leaving?
- Now.

760
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,878
While they are at dinner. And by
morning when they miss me, I'll be
halfway to Milan.

761
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:03,076
If they ask me.....what do I
say...what....

762
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:04,276
Anything you like.

763
01:01:05,675 --> 01:01:08,074
- Good-bye Father.
- Good-bye Frederico.

764
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,473
May the Lord bless and preserve
you.

765
01:07:25,924 --> 01:07:27,723
What are you doing in the yards?

766
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:29,922
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?

767
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:31,721
Send them back to fight invaders.

768
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:34,920
Every foot of Italian soil must be
regained.

769
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,519
- Suppose they don't want to go back?
- Then we shoot them?

770
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:57,711
Who's there?

771
01:07:58,511 --> 01:07:59,310
Where's Catherine?

772
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,109
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Cathy?

773
01:08:04,108 --> 01:08:07,507
I know you. You run away. You're a
deserter.

774
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:10,506
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't. She's gone.

775
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:13,905
- Gone! Where?
- You'd better get out.

776
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:17,904
Has she been transferred?

777
01:08:18,503 --> 01:08:21,102
If you don't get out of here, I'll
scream and bring the whole
hospital down on you.

778
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:23,701
- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!

779
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,202
Tell me where she is!

780
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:28,407
go ahead and choke me, but I won't tell,
you've done her enough harm.

781
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,744
what do you mean?

782
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:31,131
I said you'd get her into trouble.

783
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,327
I hate you.

784
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,999
I hate you, understand? I won't tell
you anything.

785
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:37,398
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you.

786
01:08:38,398 --> 01:08:41,196
To pay you back for what you've
done to her. Making her have a baby.

787
01:08:43,396 --> 01:08:43,995
Baby?

788
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:46,994
I warned you, but you didn't care.
Not about her.

789
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:49,393
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?

790
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,392
Where? For pity's sake, tell me.

791
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:52,592
- Fergie!
- No!

792
01:08:52,992 --> 01:08:54,791
No, no!

793
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:09,785
And get me some clothes. A full
outfit. I can't go around in this uniform.

794
01:09:10,784 --> 01:09:12,983
As long as I don't get mixed up in it
myself.

795
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:17,382
You won't. I just want you to get
some things and put an
advertisement in the newspaper for me.

796
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:20,180
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.

797
01:09:20,981 --> 01:09:24,978
I know I shall have awful gas pains
in the morning as a result of this.

798
01:09:25,379 --> 01:09:26,178
Just say......

799
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:29,776
Catherine, where are you?

800
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,576
I am free at last.

801
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,574
Meet me at the Palace Hotel,
Stressa.

802
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,373
Signed Frederic.

803
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:15,358
The Major made an obituary
speech in your memory and the
priest wanted to say mass for your soul.

804
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:18,357
Vermouth. One for you?
Two vermouth.

805
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:20,756
You see, we all thought you were
dead.

806
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:25,555
It never occurred to us that you
could be shell-shocked, wandered
away, lost your memory.

807
01:10:26,154 --> 01:10:27,353
How did you find me?

808
01:10:28,553 --> 01:10:30,353
I saw your advertisement in the paper.

809
01:10:31,552 --> 01:10:37,391
But as soon as we knew, we arranged everything.
Rinaldi will work on you, one of his miraculous cures.

810
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:37,750
You will go back a hero.

811
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:39,749
I'm not going back.

812
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:42,148
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.

813
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:44,547
No!

814
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:47,346
I'm through the war. Get that
straight.

815
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:51,145
But you can't do that. You can't say
I am through with the war.

816
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:51,944
They will not let you do that.

817
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:53,344
Two vermouth.

818
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,339
- Can I speak to you a moment sir?
- It's all right Harry, he's my friend.

819
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:05,738
I.......

820
01:11:06,338 --> 01:11:09,737
He keeps telling me it is dangerous
for me to stay here any longer.

821
01:11:09,738 --> 01:11:14,521
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabiniere.

822
01:11:14,556 --> 01:11:17,534
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow , who knows......but soon.

823
01:11:18,932 --> 01:11:20,732
My boat is still ready sir.

824
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:23,731
Thank-you Harry.

825
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:27,729
If they arrest you, no one can save you.

826
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:29,928
- I know that.
- They will shoot you.

827
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:34,327
Look! Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

828
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:38,126
I'm going to wait here until I can find
Catherine.

829
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:41,324
And how do you expect to do that?

830
01:11:42,724 --> 01:11:44,124
I've got some people looking for her.

831
01:11:45,522 --> 01:11:48,121
- If that is more important than......
- She's going to have a baby.

832
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,321
My baby.

833
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:59,317
So. That means everything to you.

834
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,315
Yes, it would.

835
01:12:03,515 --> 01:12:05,115
It means that I got to find her...

836
01:12:05,914 --> 01:12:06,914
... and get her out of Italy.

837
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:10,712
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?

838
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:13,311
She is in Switzerland.

839
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,311
Where?

840
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,310
- Brissago.
- Brissago?

841
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:20,308
Harry!

842
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,799
Will you do one for me too?

843
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:47,398
Yes madame. Step around here.

844
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:53,867
No. Just the head please.

845
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,182
Isn't there any mail for me yet?

846
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:34,381
Ah, madame. Yes, yes today there
are letters.

847
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,380
- Many letters.
- Many!

848
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,978
- 20.
- 20! Well that was worth waiting for....

849
01:14:17,963 --> 01:14:21,962
It is across the lake. Off course,
about 55 km.

850
01:14:22,362 --> 01:14:22,961
I'll make it.

851
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,560
- But at the frontier, there will be sentries.
- I know.

852
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,959
And you will have to watch out for
patrol boats. I will.

853
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:31,157
- If it blows too hard......
- I won't drown.

854
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:34,756
Have you enough money? Here.

855
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:38,755
Won't you need it?

856
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:41,554
There must be a Villa Rosa in Ponte None.

857
01:14:42,953 --> 01:14:46,152
Always the same girls, until they
become like old friends. Like war comrades.

858
01:14:46,551 --> 01:14:47,951
Take it baby, please, please.

859
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:49,550
You're a good egg.

860
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:54,148
No, I am not a good egg. I am a
fool.

861
01:14:55,548 --> 01:14:58,746
But, if I had understood how you felt
about her......

862
01:15:00,146 --> 01:15:01,546
Good luck baby.

863
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:18,339
Ciao baby.

864
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,335
It doesn't work.

865
01:15:26,736 --> 01:15:29,934
- Should I get a new cylinder doctor?
- It is a new cylinder.

866
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:34,732
Oh I wanted so to have this baby
and not make any trouble....

867
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,731
....and now I'm all done... All
gone to pieces.

868
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:05,120
She is losing strength fast doctor.

869
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,920
There's no use. I'll have to operate.

870
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:12,317
That was lovely.....

871
01:16:14,117 --> 01:16:17,516
...Frederic....darling.....

872
01:16:22,514 --> 01:16:23,912
You mustn't worry darling.

873
01:16:25,512 --> 01:16:27,112
I'm not going to die now.

874
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:33,708
I got past the place where I was
going to die.

875
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,502
practically.

876
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:41,706
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.

877
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:27,088
- Is she going to be all right?
- Are you her husband?

878
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:27,687
Yes.

879
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:30,686
She kept calling for you all night. lt
would have been better if you'd been here.

880
01:17:31,285 --> 01:17:32,885
I'm sorry.....is she in danger?

881
01:17:33,484 --> 01:17:35,883
- She is very weak.
- Do you suppose I could see her now?

882
01:17:36,283 --> 01:17:38,083
- Later......later.
- It won't be long.

883
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:19,667
You can't die.

884
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:23,665
Did you call?

885
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:30,263
No, I didn't say anything.

886
01:18:51,454 --> 01:18:52,453
Not yet.

887
01:18:55,052 --> 01:18:56,852
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.

888
01:18:57,451 --> 01:18:58,052
The baby?

889
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:01,050
A boy, but it was already dead
before she ever came in here.

890
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:03,049
But she'll be all right?

891
01:19:03,649 --> 01:19:05,448
That's not in my hands any longer.

892
01:19:08,447 --> 01:19:11,246
Go across the street and get
yourself some breakfast.

893
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:13,245
You look as if you need it.

894
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:15,644
It will be some time before she can
see you.

895
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:11,232
You've had children?
What was it like?

896
01:20:11,832 --> 01:20:13,431
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

897
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:20,556
Nothing. Some coffee please
and a brioche.

898
01:20:30,824 --> 01:20:32,823
It's in the papers. Italy has won.

899
01:20:33,223 --> 01:20:34,423
Thank God it's over.

900
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:36,022
This is the beginning of the end....

901
01:20:37,022 --> 01:20:40,820
....but it will be a long time before
they can rebuild.

902
01:20:42,419 --> 01:20:44,618
In the early morning hours of
November 4th.....

903
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:49,216
the Austrio-Hungarian supreme command....

904
01:20:49,817 --> 01:20:52,815
..accepted the armistice conditions laid down
by the General Badoglio.

905
01:20:55,614 --> 01:20:56,613
Don't let her die.

906
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,412
Oh God, please don't let her die.

907
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:05,010
I'll do anything for you, if you don't
let her die.

908
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:09,009
You took the baby......that was all
right..

909
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:11,408
...but don't let her die.

910
01:21:14,406 --> 01:21:18,005
Please, please dear God, don't let
her die.

911
01:21:43,995 --> 01:21:45,395
Her husband's out there.

912
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,593
Might as well let him in.

913
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,591
I knew he was coming.

914
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:58,389
When I went under, I knew he was here.

915
01:22:03,187 --> 01:22:04,387
You won't tell him will you?

916
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:06,386
Tell him what?

917
01:22:08,386 --> 01:22:09,385
That I'm going to die.

918
01:22:13,184 --> 01:22:15,982
- No, we won't tell him.
- Thank-you.

919
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,381
Doctor......

920
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,979
...have I long?

921
01:22:31,976 --> 01:22:32,975
Don't you see?

922
01:22:34,175 --> 01:22:35,374
I have to know.

923
01:22:36,574 --> 01:22:37,973
Not long.

924
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,970
Let him come in.

925
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:48,969
No wait.

926
01:22:51,368 --> 01:22:54,366
Could I have my bag first?

927
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:07,561
Such a mess.

928
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:13,959
He never liked me to be pale.

929
01:23:25,155 --> 01:23:26,354
You can go in now.

930
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:43,547
- Catherine.....
- Darling......

931
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:53,343
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.

932
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:55,742
Did you worry about me?

933
01:23:57,542 --> 01:24:00,340
I came as soon as I found where
you were.

934
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,339
Poor darling.....

935
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:03,938
Let me look at you.

936
01:24:07,737 --> 01:24:09,337
You're wet and tired.....

937
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,335
Sit down now darling.....here.....

938
01:24:19,732 --> 01:24:21,332
You're going to be all right
Catherine.

939
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:31,128
Do you want me to do anything
Cat?

940
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:34,527
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

941
01:24:35,926 --> 01:24:37,325
Just talk to me.

942
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:40,324
Tell me that you haven't stopped
loving me.

943
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:43,723
You know I couldn't stop.

944
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:46,122
I like to hear you say it though.

945
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:48,321
I'll never stop loving you.

946
01:24:48,921 --> 01:24:49,920
Never?

947
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,119
Not even....

948
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:54,318
..if I died.

949
01:24:56,478 --> 01:24:57,724
Never!

950
01:25:02,328 --> 01:25:04,686
You'd never do odd things with any other girls

951
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:06,657
or say the same things, would you?

952
01:25:07,866 --> 01:25:08,734
never

953
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,716
I want you to have other girls.

954
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,116
I don't want them.

955
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:15,714
That's right dear.

956
01:25:23,512 --> 01:25:24,511
Try to sleep, Cat.

957
01:25:30,509 --> 01:25:31,708
When I get well......

958
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,506
...we'll take a little house in the
mountains....

959
01:25:38,306 --> 01:25:41,104
We always planned a house of our
own, remember?

960
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:43,703
I'll get you a fine house.

961
01:25:45,503 --> 01:25:47,702
We'll live in it until the war is over.

962
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:53,700
Then you'll go back to America and
be a splendid architect.

963
01:25:55,498 --> 01:25:58,098
We'll be married all over again......in
a church.

964
01:25:59,097 --> 01:26:00,497
In a church.

965
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:04,495
Darling.....

966
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:06,694
....I'm going to die.

967
01:26:08,094 --> 01:26:09,893
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!

968
01:26:10,892 --> 01:26:13,691
Take me in your arms, hold me
tight.

969
01:26:14,491 --> 01:26:16,290
- Don't let me go........
- Catherine.

970
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,289
It's dark out there alone.

971
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,888
I don't want to leave you anymore.
I've been alone so much.

972
01:26:25,486 --> 01:26:28,086
You can't die. You're too brave to die.

973
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:36,682
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

974
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:39,281
Yes...I....

975
01:26:40,081 --> 01:26:41,680
...I am a brave girl.

976
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Whatever happens, you'll not be
afraid.

977
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:46,878
I'll not be afraid.

978
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:51,076
We've never been apart. Really.
Not since we met.

979
01:26:52,476 --> 01:26:53,676
Not since we met.

980
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,474
We never can be.

981
01:26:56,474 --> 01:26:59,473
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.

982
01:27:00,272 --> 01:27:01,272
Say it, Cat!

983
01:27:02,671 --> 01:27:06,870
In life and in death, we'll never be
parted.

984
01:27:09,269 --> 01:27:11,468
You do believe that? Don't you, Cat?

985
01:27:14,268 --> 01:27:15,067
I believe it...

986
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,066
....and I'm not afraid.

987
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:09,045
Peace.......

988
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:12,400
Peace
