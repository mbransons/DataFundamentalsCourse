1
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:52,755
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on such short notice.

2
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:56,926
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

3
00:00:58,136 --> 00:01:02,056
And now that we're all comfortable,
why don't you sit down?

4
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,603
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

5
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,690
No doubt, Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.

6
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,236
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees

7
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,988
and certain unforeseeable expenses.

8
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,701
- Voilŕ, the receipt.
- Would you like to check my figures?

9
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,789
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

10
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,126
- It's all there.
- I didn't come for the money.

11
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:36,632
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.

12
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,054
I want to know who killed him.

13
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:44,890
- Terrible tragedy.
- I just want a name.

14
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,435
I am merely the middleman.
I'm just trying to do the honorable thing,

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,980
returning the money to its rightful owner.

16
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:54,567
And we know how difficult that can be
for a Swiss banker.

17
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:03,867
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,413
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.

19
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,791
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,

20
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,253
I would have to say
that the numbers are not on your side.

21
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:20,050
Perhaps you failed to take into account
my hidden assets.

22
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,980
You seem to have had
a small reversal of fortune.

23
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,025
- Give me the name.
- I can't tell you.

24
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,860
Let's count to three.

25
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:43,866
You can do that, can't you? One, two...

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,703
All right. All right.
But you'll have to protect me.

27
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:51,326
James. Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

28
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,163
Chocolates? An engagement ring?

29
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,499
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

30
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,210
How romantic.

31
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,465
I know exactly where to put that.

32
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,512
Oh, Moneypenny,

33
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,058
the story of our relationship.
Close, but no cigar.

34
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:18,187
I hate to tear you away
from affairs of state, 007.

35
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:19,396
Would you mind coming in?

36
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:23,192
Right away, M.

37
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,112
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

38
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:32,201
The man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough. Excellent work.

39
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,162
Be careful, M.
I might try to steal him from you.

40
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:38,373
Construction's not exactly my speciality.

41
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,375
Quite the opposite, in fact.

42
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,961
Best to the family.

43
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:51,595
- Old friend?
- We read law at Oxford together.

44
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,934
I always knew he'd conquer the world.
Care for a drink?

45
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:58,519
Yes, thank you.

46
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,772
He's a man of great integrity.

47
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:04,900
Who buys stolen reports
for three million pounds.

48
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,902
Thank you.

49
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,906
- Any leads on the sniper?
- Not one.

50
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:14,409
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.

51
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:17,663
- Is this the stolen report?
- Yes. Classified.

52
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,665
From the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

53
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:21,333
What would King want this for?

54
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,003
He was led to believe the document was
a secret report

55
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,463
identifying the terrorists

56
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:29,758
who'd attacked a new oil pipeline
he's building in the region.

57
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,426
Interesting.

58
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,054
But it doesn't exactly explain

59
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:36,473
why someone would want me
out of their office alive.

60
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,278
- King! The money.
- Moneypenny, stop King.

61
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,913
Move! Move, move! Get out of the way!

62
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:06,044
Stop!

63
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:46,585
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move!

64
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:57,804
Stop, stop! It isn't finished!

65
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,196
What was that?

66
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,070
Let's go!

67
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,239
- What the hell do you think you're...
- Let go!

68
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,271
Listen to me! You can't get away.

69
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:41,982
We can make a deal.
Just tell me who's behind this.

70
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:44,651
Who are you working for? Don't do it!

71
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:47,529
Don't blow us up! I can protect you.

72
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,948
Do you understand? I can protect you.

73
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,408
Not from him!

74
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,742
Hello, my dear.

75
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,925
- Who is that young woman?
- King's daughter.

76
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,762
- Elektra.
- Thank you.

77
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,934
The money was dipped in urea.

78
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,103
In effect, a highly compacted
fertilizer bomb.

79
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,898
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands

80
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:54,817
when he touched the ice
started a chemical reaction.

81
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,654
In one of the notes,
the metal anti-counterfeiting strip

82
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:00,615
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

83
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:04,244
And King's lapel pin
was switched for a copy

84
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:07,914
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

85
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:12,168
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.

86
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,504
We know it was someone close to King,

87
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,882
and our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.

88
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:23,096
But given the size of King's organization,
it could be anyone, anywhere.

89
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:25,139
M.

90
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,644
This will not stand.

91
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:34,148
We will not be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man

92
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,650
and use us as the tool.

93
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:38,027
We'll find the people
who committed this atrocity.

94
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:41,489
We'll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth, if needs be.

95
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:44,742
And we will bring them to justice.

96
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,424
Tanner!

97
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,676
Sorry, James.
M says you're off the active-duty list

98
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,511
until you're cleared by medical.

99
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:10,893
Dislocated collarbone.

100
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:14,606
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you're going to be out of action for weeks.

101
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,030
Molly, I need a clean bill of health.

102
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,033
You have to clear me for duty.

103
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:29,912
- James, that wouldn't really be...
- Ethical?

104
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,750
Practical, smart.

105
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:38,713
Well, let's just skirt the issue, shall we?

106
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:45,303
You'd have to promise to call me
this time.

107
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,181
Whatever the doctor orders.

108
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:52,185
Then I suppose,
if you stayed in constant contact...

109
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,519
Of course.

110
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:56,439
If you showed sufficient stamina.

111
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,985
- Cut out all kinds of...
- Strenuous activity?

112
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:26,135
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

113
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,513
Oh, pipe down, 007.

114
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:33,893
- Was it something I said?
- No. Something you destroyed.

115
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:38,856
My fishing boat
for my retirement away from you.

116
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:44,987
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow

117
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:47,281
I'm grooming to follow me.

118
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,586
Helps if you open the door.

119
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:05,174
- And you might be?
- This is 007!

120
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:07,844
If you're Q, does that make him R?

121
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:11,806
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

122
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:14,308
Or at least half of it.

123
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:19,230
Now, I dare say, 007, that you've
met your match with this machine.

124
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:22,817
Yeah? New model? Improved specs?

125
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,821
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

126
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,948
Yes, well, we'll see about that. So?

127
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:32,660
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.

128
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:36,581
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display

129
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:42,170
and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.

130
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:46,340
- "Fully loaded," I think is the term.
- I think...

131
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:50,011
You're not here to think.
You're here to do what I tell you.

132
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,182
Now, go put on the coat
and demonstrate it for 007.

133
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:55,850
But of course.

134
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,978
Now, watch closely, please, 007.

135
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,857
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus.

136
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:06,611
And the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

137
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:10,239
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

138
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:14,160
Take the lower part of the zipper
and insert it into the...

139
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,870
Pull the tag.

140
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:19,040
You said...

141
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,422
He seems well-suited for the job.

142
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:34,180
You're not retiring anytime soon,
are you?

143
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,432
Now, pay attention, 007.

144
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,060
I've always tried to teach you two things.

145
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:42,146
First, never let them see you bleed.

146
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,692
- And the second?
- Always have an escape plan.

147
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:04,085
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

148
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:07,004
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped

149
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,299
after shooting dead
two of her captors and is...

150
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:15,638
He shouted.

151
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:20,309
Shouted all the time.

152
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,487
Level one, clearance required.

153
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:16,324
Level one, clearance required.

154
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,830
Yes, 007?

155
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:25,875
Tell me about the kidnapping
of Elektra King.

156
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:28,502
I wasn't aware you had an assignment
on this case.

157
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,755
I brought the money in that killed King.

158
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:34,300
- Don't make this personal.
- I'm not. Are you?

159
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,139
You're the only one
who could seal her file.

160
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:45,353
Will you excuse us?

161
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:55,029
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

162
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:03,371
What happened?

163
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,210
After Elektra King was kidnapped,

164
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:14,715
her father tried to deal with it on his own,
with no success.

165
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:17,927
So he came to me.

166
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:32,566
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

167
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:40,741
And against every instinct in my heart,
every emotion as a mother,

168
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:45,746
I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.

169
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,334
You used the girl as bait.

170
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,130
Yes.

171
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:57,883
The money in King's briefcase
was precisely the same amount

172
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:01,137
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

173
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,731
It's a message. Your terrorist is back.

174
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:24,452
- Victor Zokas, a.k. a...
- Renard, the anarchist.

175
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,873
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

176
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:32,710
And he's been spotted
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran,

177
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:34,962
Beirut and Cambodia.

178
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,176
- All the romantic vacation spots.
- His only goal is chaos.

179
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:43,888
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

180
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,641
Before he completed the mission,
Elektra escaped.

181
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:51,062
A week later,
our man caught up with the target.

182
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,815
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet's still there.

183
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,401
How did he survive?

184
00:26:58,028 --> 00:27:00,529
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out,

185
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:02,323
so Renard killed him.

186
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,993
It's moving through
the medulla oblongata,

187
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:09,538
killing off his senses, touch, smell.

188
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:11,207
He feels no pain.

189
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,543
He can push himself harder, longer
than any normal man.

190
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:16,378
The bullet will kill him,

191
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:19,673
but he'll grow stronger every day,
until the day he dies.

192
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:27,389
Robert is dead. Ml6 is humiliated.

193
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:29,433
He's had his revenge.

194
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:32,520
Not quite.

195
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,898
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping,

196
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,193
and there's still one he hasn't touched.

197
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,196
Elektra.

198
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,199
M.

199
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:52,706
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

200
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,252
I'm sure she was touched
by his dedication

201
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,172
to the job in hand.

202
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,635
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

203
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:09,306
She's taken over the construction of
her father's oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.

204
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,392
Find who switched that pin.

205
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,228
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back,

206
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,814
and Elektra will be the next target.

207
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,191
The worm on the hook again.

208
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:22,153
She doesn't need to know
it's the same man that may be after her.

209
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:23,612
Don't frighten her.

210
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:25,656
A shadow operation?

211
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:29,410
Remember, shadows stay
in front or behind,

212
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:31,453
never on top.

213
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,685
You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.

214
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,771
I'm here to see Elektra King.

215
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,148
James Bond, Universal Exports.

216
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,692
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

217
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:46,654
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the villagers.

218
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:50,783
I told Miss King to stay
at the office in Baku.

219
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh, hell.

220
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:16,517
- Miss King, I told you to stay...
- I know what you told me.

221
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,065
Send the pipe around.

222
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,776
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

223
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:11,572
- Your father approved this route.
- Then my father was wrong. Do it.

224
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:14,450
- Davidov.
- I'll talk to her.

225
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,497
I saw you at my father's funeral.

226
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,250
Yes. I'm sorry.

227
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:27,087
M told me she was sending someone. Mr...

228
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,257
Bond. James Bond.

229
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:36,722
- Did you know my father?
- I met him once, briefly.

230
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,351
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

231
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,104
- Saving the church?
- And avoiding the bloodshed.

232
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:48,400
A hundred years ago, my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

233
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,944
When the Soviet Union was formed,

234
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,783
the Communists spent the next 70 years
plundering our countryside for it.

235
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,952
I saw the mess they left on the drive in.

236
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:02,164
The new pipeline
will guarantee our future.

237
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,960
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.

238
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:16,011
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

239
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,096
No.

240
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:18,889
Tell me,

241
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:24,436
have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

242
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:30,401
M sent me because we're afraid
your life might be in danger.

243
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:36,907
Please, I want to show you something.

244
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:41,537
I'm trying to build an 800-mile
pipeline through Turkey,

245
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:46,333
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

246
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:50,671
Up here, the Russians have
three competing pipelines.

247
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,923
And they'll do anything to stop me.

248
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:56,718
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,

249
00:32:57,387 --> 00:33:01,849
and you, Mr. Bond, have come all this way
to tell me that I "might" be in danger?

250
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,980
We suspect there might be an insider.

251
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:13,318
- My father's pin.
- No, a duplicate

252
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:16,947
with a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

253
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:20,409
My family has relied
on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.

254
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,036
I won't make that mistake a third time.

255
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,293
I'm going to finish building this pipeline,

256
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:31,128
and I don't need your help.

257
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:34,631
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

258
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:37,134
I've always wanted to
check the survey lines.

259
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,137
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

260
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:41,638
No.

261
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,393
I hope you know how to ski, then.

262
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:50,230
I came prepared for a cold reception.

263
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,917
Can't land. Wind's too strong.

264
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,835
Hold her steady.

265
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:23,240
- You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
- Seems you enjoy being chased.

266
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,036
- It probably happens all the time.
- Less often than you might think.

267
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:32,541
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline.

268
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,418
Your father's legacy.

269
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:38,005
My family's legacy to the world.

270
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:50,851
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

271
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:00,485
This isn't a social call.

272
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:04,531
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees. Go, go!

273
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:08,822
See you back at the lodge.

274
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:29,486
- Oh, my God!
- It's all right.

275
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,404
- We're buried alive!
- It's all right!

276
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:38,078
- I can't stay here!
- You're not going to. You're not going to.

277
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,956
- Elektra.
- I can't breathe.

278
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,708
- Elektra, Elektra, Elektra!
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

279
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:46,920
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.

280
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,923
Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes!

281
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:51,967
You're all right.

282
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,430
Everything's all right. Trust me. Okay?

283
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,210
She's fine.

284
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:29,546
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.

285
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,132
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov, him.

286
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,900
- Are you all right?
- I need to ask you something.

287
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,528
And I want you to tell me the truth.

288
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:56,907
Who is it? Who's trying to kill me?

289
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,745
I told you I don't know.
But I'm gonna find him.

290
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,164
Not good enough.

291
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,668
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

292
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,588
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.

293
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:14,007
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

294
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:16,843
I was afraid to do anything at all.

295
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:21,014
Until I realized
I can't hide in the shadows.

296
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,352
I can't let fear run my life. I won't.

297
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:30,732
After I find him, you won't have to.

298
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:36,863
Don't go. Stay with me.

299
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,492
Please?

300
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:46,539
I can't do that.

301
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,668
I thought it was your job to protect me.

302
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:55,715
- You'll be safe here.
- I don't want to be safe.

303
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:04,849
I'll be back soon.

304
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,396
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

305
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:25,305
- I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.
- Impossible.

306
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,060
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

307
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:34,105
Tell him James Bond is here.

308
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:36,691
Now.

309
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,407
I don't think you heard me.

310
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,753
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted
to see you.

311
00:44:01,634 --> 00:44:05,678
- After you.
- No. After you.

312
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:08,640
I insist.

313
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:12,727
And a little for you.

314
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,816
Bond! James Bond!

315
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:21,736
Meet Nina and Verushka.

316
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,366
Lose the girls, Valentin. We need to talk.

317
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:31,204
Why am I suddenly worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

318
00:44:31,413 --> 00:44:32,831
Chill out, James.

319
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:39,712
Fine, ladies. Go on. Beat it. Scram.

320
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,798
Bull, give them an inch.

321
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,891
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

322
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,979
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

323
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:58,398
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

324
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:03,361
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.
So, what would you like to talk about?

325
00:45:03,988 --> 00:45:07,740
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

326
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,705
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

327
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:16,457
Take a look at this.

328
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:21,296
Russian Special Services.

329
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:26,801
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?

330
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:30,763
I took it off a parahawk which tried to
kill Elektra King this morning.

331
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,266
Renard is behind this.

332
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:41,316
I think you and I had better have a drink.

333
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:48,948
And then after Afghanistan,

334
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:53,369
the KGB decided Renard was a liability
and just cut him loose.

335
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:56,456
- Now he works freelance.
- But for whom?

336
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,876
There are four competing pipelines.

337
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:03,630
I'm willing to bet half the customers
in this casino would be very happy

338
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:06,174
to see the King pipeline disappear.

339
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:09,385
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

340
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,972
It just appears Miss King does not share
your concern.

341
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:24,734
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are.

342
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,278
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.

343
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,656
Let me take you home. Now.

344
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:32,825
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

345
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:38,122
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We've kept your father's chair free.

346
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:41,125
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

347
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,713
Your father had a credit line with us,
$1 million U.S.

348
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:48,675
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

349
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:54,013
So what's it to be?

350
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,184
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

351
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:00,687
Let's keep it simple.

352
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:04,107
One card. High draw.

353
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,654
A million dollars.

354
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:16,703
Wait. Bury the top three cards.

355
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:21,457
You're determined to protect me,
aren't you?

356
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,127
Perhaps from yourself.
You don't have to do this.

357
00:47:26,505 --> 00:47:30,049
There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.

358
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:43,646
Queen of hearts.

359
00:47:56,535 --> 00:48:01,247
It appears that you have been beaten
by the ace of clubs.

360
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:08,796
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.

361
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:16,137
Shall we?

362
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,768
Elektra, this is a game
I can't afford to play.

363
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,897
I know.

364
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:32,195
- What happened to Davidov?
- I gave him the night off.

365
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,594
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

366
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,808
For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims
have journeyed to this holy place

367
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:07,313
to witness the wonder of the miracle
of the natural flames that never die

368
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:12,485
and to test their devotion to God

369
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:17,156
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands

370
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:22,036
as they said their daily prayers.

371
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,834
Tell me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

372
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:32,130
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

373
00:49:32,256 --> 00:49:35,341
- Yes, but Bond...
- Bond was unarmed.

374
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:41,264
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

375
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:44,016
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car,

376
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:46,811
and I have arranged for a plane tonight,
but...

377
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:51,315
- But what?
- We should scrub the rest of the mission.

378
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,777
The parahawks were meant
to be returned.

379
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:57,196
People will start asking questions,
even of me,

380
00:49:57,281 --> 00:49:59,615
all because of his incompetence.

381
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,619
I see. I see you're right.
You're right, he should be punished.

382
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:06,372
Davidov, hold this for me.

383
00:50:10,669 --> 00:50:13,129
It was wrong of me to expect
so much of you.

384
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:16,382
Kill him.

385
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,928
He failed his test of devotion.

386
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:28,019
You can take his place. Take his ID.

387
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:31,564
And do be on time.

388
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:53,044
Poor shoulder.

389
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:55,880
It looks painful.

390
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:00,593
Needs constant attention.

391
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:07,850
I knew. I knew when I first saw you.

392
00:51:09,603 --> 00:51:11,145
I knew it would be like this.

393
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,743
Enough ice for one day.

394
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:47,974
How did you survive?

395
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:58,651
I seduced the guards, used my body.

396
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,821
It gave me control.

397
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:06,325
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

398
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:13,499
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

399
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:19,839
I take pleasure

400
00:52:21,592 --> 00:52:23,342
in great beauty.

401
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:05,004
Let's go. It's getting late.

402
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,012
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.

403
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:17,099
He was buried with work.

404
00:55:18,101 --> 00:55:20,352
Let's go. Get your stuff.

405
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:35,242
Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.

406
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,540
You're late. Did you bring it? The grease.

407
00:55:44,878 --> 00:55:46,420
Of course.

408
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:54,345
Excellent.

409
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:14,782
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

410
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:16,784
But make sure you wear the ID.

411
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:04,874
I'm gonna go get some air.

412
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:26,353
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

413
00:57:27,063 --> 00:57:30,149
Not often we see someone
of your stature here.

414
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,484
I go where the work takes me.

415
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:34,945
By the way,
you have the transport documents?

416
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:47,166
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.

417
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,835
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- Okay.

418
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:58,844
Look. Our IDA physicist.
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

419
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,554
Take my word for it.

420
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,723
Last year,
we decommissioned four test sites.

421
00:58:02,807 --> 00:58:04,892
Not even a glimmer.

422
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:12,858
Are you here for a reason
or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

423
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,944
And you are?

424
00:58:15,028 --> 00:58:18,697
Mikhail Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

425
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:23,619
- Miss...
- Dr. Jones. Christmas Jones.

426
00:58:23,703 --> 00:58:26,872
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.

427
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:29,166
I don't know any doctor jokes.

428
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:34,129
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hall.

429
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:36,382
Your friends are already down there.

430
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:40,636
- Don't I get some type of protection?
- No, Dr. Arkov.

431
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,596
Down there it's all
weapons-grade plutonium.

432
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:43,973
Reasonably safe.

433
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:46,266
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
that your lab built

434
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:47,309
leaking tritium,

435
00:58:47,394 --> 00:58:49,812
which I've spent the last six months
trying to clean up.

436
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:52,189
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.

437
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:56,902
Your friends are waiting for you.

438
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:04,076
Doctor?

439
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:08,080
Aren't you forgetting?

440
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:13,127
Yes, of course. Thank you.

441
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,254
By the way...

442
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:39,171
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

443
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:43,175
Get off. Keep your mouth shut.

444
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:45,177
You can't kill me, I'm already dead.

445
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:48,430
Yeah, not dead enough for me.

446
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:53,602
You could show a little gratitude,
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

447
01:00:54,187 --> 01:00:58,690
That's right. I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.

448
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,028
You delivered the money, killed King,
and now you brought me the plane.

449
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:07,074
- What's your plan for the bomb?
- You first.

450
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:11,787
- Or could it be you don't have a plan?
- That bomb will never leave this room.

451
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:14,456
Neither will you.

452
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:24,716
How sad to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's involved in.

453
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:28,512
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.

454
01:01:28,596 --> 01:01:32,015
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?

455
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,435
Go ahead, shoot me. I'll welcome it.

456
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:38,438
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

457
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:41,441
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.

458
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:45,070
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes,

459
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:46,446
Elektra dies.

460
01:01:49,075 --> 01:01:52,995
- You're bluffing.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

461
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:57,541
You should have had her before,
when she was innocent.

462
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:02,254
How does it feel
to know I broke her in for you?

463
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:06,800
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

464
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,886
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

465
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,305
A man tires of being executed.

466
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:16,018
But in your case, I feel nothing,
just like you.

467
01:02:16,227 --> 01:02:19,938
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.

468
01:02:23,526 --> 01:02:24,526
Hey!

469
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:27,446
- Drop the gun!
- Keep away, Colonel.

470
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:30,532
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

471
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:34,411
This is your impostor,
along with the men outside on the plane.

472
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,288
They're stealing the bomb.

473
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:39,708
I said drop it!

474
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:51,678
On your knees!

475
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:56,183
Well done.

476
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:01,813
He would've killed us all.
Did you speak to him?

477
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:04,483
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

478
01:03:05,985 --> 01:03:08,487
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.

479
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:18,956
You had me,

480
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:24,503
but I knew you couldn't
shoulder the responsibility.

481
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,178
Now, without any further interruptions,
let's proceed.

482
01:03:33,554 --> 01:03:36,098
There are too many new faces
around here,

483
01:03:36,182 --> 01:03:38,350
including yours.

484
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:41,687
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.

485
01:03:42,146 --> 01:03:45,023
Hey, all of you, to the surface, now.

486
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:08,297
Come on! Go!

487
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:12,050
Move!

488
01:04:19,058 --> 01:04:20,392
They're sealing us in.

489
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:24,062
Who are you?

490
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:27,065
I work for the British government.

491
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,155
Stay calm.

492
01:06:36,863 --> 01:06:40,407
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond,
but we're even.

493
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:43,994
Soon, you'll feel nothing at all.

494
01:07:10,396 --> 01:07:13,106
Seal the door! Close it!

495
01:07:25,536 --> 01:07:26,786
Come on!

496
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:49,893
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

497
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:52,854
So, you're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

498
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:54,105
The name's Bond.

499
01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:00,779
James Bond.

500
01:08:11,165 --> 01:08:13,291
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

501
01:08:34,355 --> 01:08:35,981
They won't get very far.

502
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:39,484
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.

503
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,988
You mean one of these?

504
01:08:50,663 --> 01:08:52,789
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

505
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:54,666
Anywhere in this circle.

506
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,420
Russia, Armenia, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan...

507
01:08:58,504 --> 01:09:01,131
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Elektra King is calling from Baku.

508
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:04,217
- It's on the video line.
- Put her on the wall screen.

509
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:13,602
I'm sorry. I would never call you,
except James has disappeared.

510
01:09:14,395 --> 01:09:16,479
He left my villa in the middle of the night,

511
01:09:16,564 --> 01:09:22,277
and my head of security has been found

512
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:25,113
near your local airstrip, murdered.

513
01:09:26,073 --> 01:09:29,367
- I'll send someone out.
- M, could you come?

514
01:09:30,828 --> 01:09:34,539
I can't help thinking I'm next.

515
01:09:39,045 --> 01:09:40,253
- Get me out there.
- No, listen...

516
01:09:40,338 --> 01:09:42,631
Just get me out there.

517
01:10:00,983 --> 01:10:02,108
Gabor?

518
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:11,409
James?

519
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:15,163
Surprised?

520
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,749
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

521
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,752
Maybe. Maybe I should ask you.

522
01:10:21,754 --> 01:10:26,007
After all, "there's no point in living
if you can't feel alive."

523
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:28,760
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isn’t that your motto?

524
01:10:28,928 --> 01:10:29,969
What are you talking about?

525
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:31,179
Or did you steal it

526
01:10:31,263 --> 01:10:33,306
- from your old friend Renard?
- What?

527
01:10:33,391 --> 01:10:34,891
He and I had a chat this morning.

528
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:37,310
Knew all about us.
Knew about my shoulder.

529
01:10:37,395 --> 01:10:38,937
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

530
01:10:39,105 --> 01:10:41,648
Are you saying Renard is the man
who's trying to kill me?

531
01:10:41,732 --> 01:10:42,816
Drop the act.

532
01:10:44,276 --> 01:10:45,276
It's over.

533
01:10:46,862 --> 01:10:49,864
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

534
01:10:52,118 --> 01:10:54,202
It's called Stockholm syndrome,

535
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:57,247
common in kidnappings.

536
01:10:57,748 --> 01:11:01,710
Young, impressionable victim. Sheltered.

537
01:11:03,295 --> 01:11:05,797
Sexually inexperienced.

538
01:11:06,298 --> 01:11:10,135
A powerful kidnapper
skilled in torture, manipulation.

539
01:11:11,512 --> 01:11:13,847
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

540
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:16,599
The captive falls in love with her captor.

541
01:11:16,976 --> 01:11:18,184
How dare you?

542
01:11:19,186 --> 01:11:22,147
How dare you?
That animal? That monster?

543
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:24,649
He disgusts me.

544
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:27,402
You disgust me.

545
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,197
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

546
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:33,825
You had a sling on your arm
at the funeral.

547
01:11:34,326 --> 01:11:37,120
And I didn't have to sleep with you
to find that out.

548
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:40,165
- He used your exact words.
- So you knew.

549
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:42,250
You knew all the time
that he was out there,

550
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:43,918
that he was coming for me,

551
01:11:44,003 --> 01:11:45,211
and you lied.

552
01:11:46,046 --> 01:11:47,505
You used me.

553
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:50,008
You used me as bait.

554
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:55,221
And you made love to me.

555
01:11:57,141 --> 01:11:58,349
What?

556
01:11:59,018 --> 01:12:02,353
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

557
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:09,444
Hello?

558
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:18,244
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

559
01:12:18,412 --> 01:12:19,704
I'm coming with you.

560
01:12:20,873 --> 01:12:23,583
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.

561
01:12:24,794 --> 01:12:26,836
She's coming to take charge.

562
01:12:41,352 --> 01:12:42,644
Oh, no.

563
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,993
I want an update. Where do we stand?

564
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:03,081
One of Renard's men removed
the locator card from the bomb

565
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:04,749
so we can't track it. But...

566
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,167
But what?

567
01:13:06,836 --> 01:13:08,211
With all due respect,

568
01:13:09,088 --> 01:13:10,922
I don't think you should be here.

569
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:15,426
May I remind you
that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

570
01:13:15,761 --> 01:13:18,304
You disobeyed a direct order
and left that girl alone.

571
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:21,391
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent
as you think.

572
01:13:21,475 --> 01:13:24,143
- What are you saying?
- Suppose the inside man,

573
01:13:24,353 --> 01:13:28,982
the one who switched King's lapel pin,
turned out to be an inside woman?

574
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:34,487
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?

575
01:13:34,572 --> 01:13:36,948
- Why? To what end?
- I don't know, yet.

576
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:45,206
Rig Station 11 - RS

577
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:47,709
Look at that. That's not right.

578
01:13:48,836 --> 01:13:51,880
- What is it?
- An observation rig.

579
01:13:52,089 --> 01:13:55,675
- Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.
- Shut it down.

580
01:13:58,345 --> 01:14:01,055
I don't understand. It won't respond.

581
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:03,391
The place is clean. No sign of the bomb.

582
01:14:03,475 --> 01:14:06,060
- The bomb is in the pipeline.
- Oh, my God!

583
01:14:06,145 --> 01:14:08,980
They must have brought it through here.
That would explain the attack.

584
01:14:09,148 --> 01:14:10,523
Heading for the oil terminal.

585
01:14:10,608 --> 01:14:12,483
Where it would do the most damage.

586
01:14:12,568 --> 01:14:14,569
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

587
01:14:16,822 --> 01:14:18,489
So now do you believe me?

588
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,745
This is an emergency situation.
So, please,

589
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:25,663
clear the room. Do it.

590
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:27,540
- He's going for the oil.
- Of course.

591
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:29,959
The one pipeline the West is counting on

592
01:14:30,044 --> 01:14:33,171
to supply our reserves
for the next century.

593
01:14:33,255 --> 01:14:35,840
- Do you have an idea?
- Maybe.

594
01:14:36,842 --> 01:14:39,928
How far is that rig from the terminal?
And how fast is it traveling?

595
01:14:40,512 --> 01:14:44,933
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.

596
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,268
We've got 78 minutes.
Do you have another rig?

597
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:50,063
There's one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.

598
01:14:50,356 --> 01:14:53,066
- Charles, can you get me out there?
- Of course.

599
01:14:54,193 --> 01:14:55,276
Wait a minute.

600
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:57,070
Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

601
01:14:57,154 --> 01:15:00,365
- What do I need to defuse a nuclear bomb?
- Me.

602
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:15,922
There it is. Hatch to the passageway.

603
01:15:20,803 --> 01:15:21,844
Take the controls.

604
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:24,097
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

605
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:26,391
- I'll be waiting to hear from you.
- Gotcha.

606
01:15:27,101 --> 01:15:28,726
You know how to drive
one of these things?

607
01:15:28,894 --> 01:15:32,021
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.

608
01:15:40,406 --> 01:15:43,491
They're in the pipeline.
They're on the move.

609
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:01,426
Faster!

610
01:16:09,309 --> 01:16:12,270
If there's even the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.

611
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:16,149
He's the best we have,
though I'd never tell him.

612
01:16:17,693 --> 01:16:19,193
I hope you're right.

613
01:16:22,906 --> 01:16:24,240
Here it comes!

614
01:16:28,537 --> 01:16:30,705
It's closing up. Faster!

615
01:16:36,295 --> 01:16:37,795
Sit tight.

616
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:55,313
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

617
01:17:09,787 --> 01:17:13,664
It's a tactical fission device, low yield.
Hold me steady.

618
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,542
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

619
01:17:16,752 --> 01:17:19,003
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

620
01:17:19,088 --> 01:17:22,048
Yeah, well, life's full of small challenges.

621
01:17:24,134 --> 01:17:27,303
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.

622
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:30,640
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

623
01:17:51,036 --> 01:17:53,704
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

624
01:17:54,581 --> 01:17:57,250
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?

625
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:59,919
There's still enough explosive in there
to kill both of us

626
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:01,504
if the trigger charge goes off.

627
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:03,422
- Let it blow.
- But I can stop it.

628
01:18:03,507 --> 01:18:04,549
Let it blow!

629
01:18:10,722 --> 01:18:12,014
Trust me! Leave it!

630
01:18:15,978 --> 01:18:17,728
Move down. Move down!

631
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:19,397
Jump! Go on, jump!

632
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:23,568
Jump!

633
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,750
Robinson's reporting.

634
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,253
The bomb was a dud.

635
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:46,674
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

636
01:18:46,884 --> 01:18:47,967
And Bond?

637
01:18:49,052 --> 01:18:50,052
Nothing.

638
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:53,431
I'm so sorry.

639
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,060
But I have a gift for you.

640
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:03,316
Something that belonged to my father.
He would've wanted you to have it.

641
01:19:04,443 --> 01:19:07,695
- Perhaps this isn't the time.
- Please.

642
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:13,284
He often spoke of how compassionately
you advised him

643
01:19:13,368 --> 01:19:16,662
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.

644
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:22,293
It's very valuable, you know.

645
01:19:23,128 --> 01:19:25,963
I just couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.

646
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:34,222
I was very upset when the money
didn't kill both of you.

647
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:37,350
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

648
01:19:38,185 --> 01:19:41,437
Then you dropped the answer
right in my lap.

649
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:46,400
Bond. And as you say,
he's the best you have.

650
01:19:46,485 --> 01:19:48,486
Or should I say, "had"?

651
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:56,535
Take her to the helicopter.

652
01:20:03,418 --> 01:20:05,795
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump, jump!

653
01:20:07,631 --> 01:20:09,548
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

654
01:20:09,675 --> 01:20:12,176
I could've stopped that bomb.
You almost killed us.

655
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:13,886
I did kill us.

656
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:17,848
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.

657
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:21,477
Do you wanna put that in English for
those of us who don't speak "spy"?

658
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,146
- Who's "she"?
- Elektra King.

659
01:20:24,356 --> 01:20:26,607
Well, why would she blow up
her own pipeline?

660
01:20:26,692 --> 01:20:28,192
It makes her look innocent.

661
01:20:30,028 --> 01:20:32,613
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.

662
01:20:34,533 --> 01:20:36,284
And they make it look
like a terrorist attack.

663
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:38,619
But why leave this half?

664
01:20:38,996 --> 01:20:42,623
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up for the part that they did take.

665
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:44,792
But what are they gonna do
with the other half?

666
01:20:45,043 --> 01:20:47,503
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

667
01:20:47,713 --> 01:20:50,464
- You're the scientist, you tell me.
- I don't know.

668
01:20:51,591 --> 01:20:54,218
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with six kilos

669
01:20:54,303 --> 01:20:56,595
of weapons-grade plutonium
can't be good.

670
01:20:56,888 --> 01:20:59,390
I have to get it back,
or somebody's gonna have my ass.

671
01:21:02,227 --> 01:21:03,602
First things first.

672
01:21:05,856 --> 01:21:07,773
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

673
01:21:07,941 --> 01:21:12,278
By the way, before we go any further,
I just wanna know,

674
01:21:13,572 --> 01:21:18,868
- what's the story with you and Elektra?
- We're strictly platonic. Now.

675
01:21:19,077 --> 01:21:20,953
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

676
01:21:23,623 --> 01:21:27,668
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

677
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:31,047
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.

678
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,175
I read you, 007. Red alert.

679
01:21:34,384 --> 01:21:36,510
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.

680
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,596
Await instructions. Out.

681
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,140
What do we do now?

682
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:48,147
There's one critical element here
I may have overlooked.

683
01:21:48,398 --> 01:21:50,316
- What? More plutonium?
- No.

684
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,902
Beluga.

685
01:21:52,986 --> 01:21:54,236
Caviar.

686
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:25,393
Brought me something?

687
01:22:31,525 --> 01:22:33,818
The power to reshape the world.

688
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:40,116
Go on. It's safe.

689
01:22:41,451 --> 01:22:42,701
Touch your destiny.

690
01:22:56,716 --> 01:22:59,301
I have brought something for you, as well.

691
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:10,104
Your present,
courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

692
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:14,191
- My executioner.
- Overpraise, I'm afraid.

693
01:23:15,068 --> 01:23:17,987
- But my people will finish the job.
- Your people?

694
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:23,868
Your people will leave you here to rot
just like you left me.

695
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,162
You and my father.

696
01:23:26,371 --> 01:23:28,414
- Your father wasn't...
- My father was nothing.

697
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,542
His kingdom, he stole from my mother.

698
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:35,379
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

699
01:23:44,347 --> 01:23:46,807
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.

700
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:50,603
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

701
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:55,941
When I took her, she was promise itself,

702
01:23:56,902 --> 01:23:59,487
and you left her at the mercy
of a man like me.

703
01:24:00,655 --> 01:24:02,281
You ruined her.

704
01:24:02,991 --> 01:24:05,326
For what? To get to me?

705
01:24:06,244 --> 01:24:09,246
- She's worth 50 of me.
- For once, I agree with you.

706
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:15,920
Yes. And now we also share
a common fate.

707
01:24:17,088 --> 01:24:20,382
You will die,
along with everyone in this city

708
01:24:22,385 --> 01:24:26,430
and the bright, starry, oil-driven
future of the West.

709
01:24:32,938 --> 01:24:37,858
Since you sent your man to kill me,
I've been watching time tick slowly away,

710
01:24:38,944 --> 01:24:40,736
marching toward my own death.

711
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:46,617
Now you can have the same pleasure.

712
01:24:50,997 --> 01:24:52,748
Watch these hands, M.

713
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:57,461
By noon tomorrow, your time is up.

714
01:24:59,047 --> 01:25:02,633
And I guarantee you, I will not miss.

715
01:25:25,574 --> 01:25:27,116
So beautiful.

716
01:25:28,702 --> 01:25:30,119
So smooth.

717
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:32,955
So warm.

718
01:25:33,873 --> 01:25:35,457
How would you know?

719
01:25:40,797 --> 01:25:45,009
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?

720
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:50,931
- It's what you wanted.
- Of course it's what I wanted.

721
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:57,688
He was...

722
01:26:00,984 --> 01:26:02,276
He was a good lover?

723
01:26:03,153 --> 01:26:06,196
What do you think?
I wouldn't feel anything?

724
01:26:21,379 --> 01:26:22,880
I feel nothing.

725
01:26:38,897 --> 01:26:40,230
What about this?

726
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:56,705
But surely, you can feel this?

727
01:27:03,922 --> 01:27:09,051
Remember pleasure?

728
01:27:56,725 --> 01:27:57,808
Wait here.

729
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:02,980
Always something.
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

730
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:06,275
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

731
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:20,789
Hello?

732
01:28:22,959 --> 01:28:24,460
Bond is alive.

733
01:28:29,674 --> 01:28:31,967
Is nothing in this place straight?

734
01:28:37,015 --> 01:28:40,225
Who are you? And how did you get in?

735
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:44,480
I'll call security and congratulate them.

736
01:28:45,398 --> 01:28:46,690
Drink?

737
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:52,279
Can't you just say hello
like a normal person?

738
01:28:53,948 --> 01:28:55,282
Get lost.

739
01:28:56,034 --> 01:28:58,660
No, no, no. Down the back.

740
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:02,706
What's your business with Elektra King?

741
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:07,169
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

742
01:29:07,253 --> 01:29:10,672
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.

743
01:29:10,882 --> 01:29:12,716
What's she paying you off for?

744
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:17,387
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that,

745
01:29:17,514 --> 01:29:18,764
I wouldn't bet on it.

746
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:25,479
$5000 of beluga ruined.

747
01:29:25,563 --> 01:29:28,690
That's nothing compared to what a
20-megaton nuclear bomb can do.

748
01:29:28,775 --> 01:29:29,817
What are you talking about?

749
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:32,069
We had a nuclear bomb
stolen this morning.

750
01:29:32,153 --> 01:29:34,488
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.

751
01:29:34,614 --> 01:29:36,365
- I didn't know.
- Well, what do you know?

752
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:02,177
Q's not gonna like this.

753
01:33:19,756 --> 01:33:21,631
Hide!

754
01:33:32,435 --> 01:33:33,518
Get out!

755
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:46,174
Help!

756
01:34:46,259 --> 01:34:48,635
Now, where were we?

757
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,513
- A rope, please!
- No. The truth.

758
01:34:51,597 --> 01:34:52,681
She has M.

759
01:34:52,765 --> 01:34:55,559
- I know nothing about that.
- Those blades were meant for you.

760
01:34:55,643 --> 01:34:58,019
What does Elektra King
want you dead for?

761
01:34:58,771 --> 01:35:03,150
It was you who destroyed my factory,
then you drown my Rolls-Royce,

762
01:35:03,234 --> 01:35:06,736
and now you're trying to drown me
in my own caviar!

763
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:08,446
Let me out!

764
01:35:08,906 --> 01:35:11,783
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

765
01:35:11,868 --> 01:35:13,118
Or sour cream.

766
01:35:13,661 --> 01:35:14,661
Okay, okay.

767
01:35:16,455 --> 01:35:22,460
Occasionally, I get equipment for her.
Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.

768
01:35:22,587 --> 01:35:24,296
And the payoff in the casino?

769
01:35:24,797 --> 01:35:26,047
It was a special job.

770
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:28,592
My nephew is in the navy.

771
01:35:29,969 --> 01:35:33,180
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

772
01:35:33,389 --> 01:35:35,098
- Where?
- Absolutely not!

773
01:35:35,183 --> 01:35:36,224
Where?

774
01:35:39,812 --> 01:35:42,397
- Where?
- Istanbul!

775
01:35:51,782 --> 01:35:55,160
You! Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?

776
01:35:55,244 --> 01:35:57,954
Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.

777
01:35:58,122 --> 01:35:59,748
Oh, really? Get me out of here,

778
01:35:59,832 --> 01:36:02,209
I'll show you
what a bumped head feels like.

779
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:06,546
Look. We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.

780
01:36:19,143 --> 01:36:23,104
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.

781
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:27,544
This used to be
the KGB's Istanbul safe house.

782
01:37:27,628 --> 01:37:30,797
Now it's FSB. Federal Security Bureau.

783
01:37:31,007 --> 01:37:33,675
Same old friendly service
with a new name.

784
01:37:34,093 --> 01:37:36,136
- Did you raise Nikoli?
- Nothing.

785
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:38,763
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

786
01:37:40,516 --> 01:37:41,558
Tragedy.

787
01:37:42,018 --> 01:37:44,978
In the old days,
there were at least a hundred places

788
01:37:45,062 --> 01:37:47,147
where a submarine
could surface undetected.

789
01:37:47,231 --> 01:37:48,315
Submarine?

790
01:37:49,066 --> 01:37:51,026
What class is your nephew running?

791
01:37:53,029 --> 01:37:54,988
- Victor III, you call it.
- Nuclear.

792
01:37:55,072 --> 01:37:57,866
He's not loading cargo. They want the sub.
They want to use the reactor.

793
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:58,992
That's it.

794
01:37:59,076 --> 01:38:01,995
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor,

795
01:38:02,121 --> 01:38:04,497
instant catastrophic meltdown.

796
01:38:04,707 --> 01:38:06,750
Making it all look just like an accident.

797
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:08,918
But why?

798
01:38:09,587 --> 01:38:15,091
Because the existing pipelines from
the Caspian Sea go to the north. Here.

799
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:19,763
The oil is put onboard the tankers, shipped
across the Black Sea, down to Istanbul.

800
01:38:20,514 --> 01:38:25,769
The explosion would destroy Istanbul,
contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

801
01:38:26,937 --> 01:38:29,064
And there'd be only one way
to get the oil out.

802
01:38:29,273 --> 01:38:32,984
Yeah, down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.

803
01:38:33,402 --> 01:38:34,486
Elektra's pipeline.

804
01:38:34,987 --> 01:38:36,780
We must find Nikoli.

805
01:38:38,741 --> 01:38:40,116
Captain Nikoli?

806
01:38:42,244 --> 01:38:43,328
Sir.

807
01:38:44,246 --> 01:38:45,789
Ready to load your cargo.

808
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:47,916
We have only a few hours
before we'll be missed.

809
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,042
You came with a skeleton crew?

810
01:38:49,126 --> 01:38:51,127
- Yeah, that's all we can afford these days.
- Of course.

811
01:38:51,796 --> 01:38:54,130
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.

812
01:38:56,133 --> 01:38:57,217
Thank you.

813
01:39:02,473 --> 01:39:03,640
Good morning.

814
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:09,604
What's the time?

815
01:39:23,202 --> 01:39:25,161
It's time for you to die.

816
01:39:57,778 --> 01:39:59,195
I've got something

817
01:40:00,156 --> 01:40:01,906
on the emergency frequency.

818
01:40:02,116 --> 01:40:04,701
Two six-digit numbers cycled
every 15 seconds.

819
01:40:04,869 --> 01:40:08,830
- A GPS signal. Position coordinates.
- Locator card. M.

820
01:40:12,209 --> 01:40:14,127
- Here.
- Yeah. Maiden's Tower.

821
01:40:14,211 --> 01:40:16,880
- Have you been there?
- No. No. Mr. Bullion.

822
01:40:21,051 --> 01:40:22,177
Bomb!

823
01:40:29,059 --> 01:40:30,477
Come on, come on, come on.

824
01:40:44,241 --> 01:40:47,535
After you. I insist.

825
01:41:04,595 --> 01:41:06,513
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

826
01:41:14,396 --> 01:41:16,523
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

827
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:30,453
The extruder's in here.

828
01:41:31,914 --> 01:41:35,875
It will take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.

829
01:41:42,716 --> 01:41:44,133
Put them in here.

830
01:41:53,686 --> 01:41:57,313
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.

831
01:42:00,067 --> 01:42:03,820
- Is your helicopter ready?
- It's going to pick me up in half an hour.

832
01:42:07,324 --> 01:42:08,866
Then this is the end.

833
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:11,911
No. This is the beginning.

834
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:15,331
The world will never be the same.

835
01:42:29,013 --> 01:42:33,224
The future is yours. Have fun with it.

836
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:42,108
James Bond.

837
01:42:50,618 --> 01:42:51,951
If only you'd kept away,

838
01:42:52,036 --> 01:42:55,455
we might have met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.

839
01:43:05,049 --> 01:43:06,549
Take her to Renard.

840
01:43:09,345 --> 01:43:12,722
Pretty thing. You had her, too?

841
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,896
I could've given you the world.

842
01:43:21,357 --> 01:43:22,940
The world is not enough.

843
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:26,903
- Foolish sentiment.
- Family motto.

844
01:43:30,199 --> 01:43:34,577
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.

845
01:43:35,788 --> 01:43:37,955
They also found this chair.

846
01:43:48,634 --> 01:43:52,720
I think we ignore the old ways
at our peril, don't you?

847
01:43:53,722 --> 01:43:57,308
- Where's M?
- Soon, she'll be everywhere.

848
01:43:58,936 --> 01:44:03,439
All this because you fell for Renard?

849
01:44:06,735 --> 01:44:09,696
Five more turns and your neck will break.

850
01:44:13,158 --> 01:44:15,660
I've always had a power over men.

851
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:22,208
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

852
01:44:22,626 --> 01:44:25,294
I knew I had to form another alliance.

853
01:44:26,672 --> 01:44:30,133
You turned Renard.

854
01:44:31,677 --> 01:44:36,431
Just like you, only you were even easier.

855
01:44:40,185 --> 01:44:44,147
I told him he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.

856
01:44:45,441 --> 01:44:50,737
When he refused,
I told him I would do it myself.

857
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,411
So you killed your father.

858
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:00,830
He killed me.

859
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:04,876
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

860
01:45:05,169 --> 01:45:07,462
Was this all about the oil?

861
01:45:09,214 --> 01:45:11,007
It is my oil.

862
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,343
Mine and my family's.

863
01:45:14,678 --> 01:45:17,847
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

864
01:45:19,016 --> 01:45:21,392
I'm going to redraw the map.

865
01:45:21,643 --> 01:45:24,937
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name,

866
01:45:25,147 --> 01:45:28,357
my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!

867
01:45:28,442 --> 01:45:31,652
No one will believe this meltdown
was an accident.

868
01:45:32,154 --> 01:45:34,614
They will believe. They will all believe.

869
01:45:35,657 --> 01:45:39,285
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

870
01:45:44,249 --> 01:45:47,293
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?

871
01:45:47,377 --> 01:45:50,755
Elektra, it's not too late.

872
01:45:52,758 --> 01:45:55,551
Eight million people need not die.

873
01:45:57,387 --> 01:46:00,056
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

874
01:46:01,183 --> 01:46:04,352
But you couldn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've loved.

875
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,281
You meant nothing to me.

876
01:46:22,746 --> 01:46:28,793
One last screw.

877
01:46:28,919 --> 01:46:30,586
Oh, James.

878
01:46:53,944 --> 01:46:58,447
Boss, you're alive. So glad to see you.

879
01:46:59,241 --> 01:47:00,366
Me too.

880
01:47:06,415 --> 01:47:07,999
I'm looking for a submarine.

881
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:11,294
It's big and black, and the driver
is a very good friend of mine.

882
01:47:16,341 --> 01:47:18,301
Bring it to me.

883
01:47:19,595 --> 01:47:22,471
What a shame. He's just gone.

884
01:48:10,646 --> 01:48:12,730
Zukovsky really hated you.

885
01:48:14,483 --> 01:48:17,193
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?

886
01:48:24,326 --> 01:48:25,952
Time to say good night.

887
01:48:54,815 --> 01:48:58,484
James, you can't kill me,
not in cold blood.

888
01:49:05,283 --> 01:49:06,575
Bond!

889
01:49:28,098 --> 01:49:29,265
Call him off.

890
01:49:36,398 --> 01:49:37,940
I won't ask again.

891
01:49:39,276 --> 01:49:42,945
Call him off. Call him off!

892
01:49:47,659 --> 01:49:48,909
Renard.

893
01:49:53,707 --> 01:49:57,001
You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.

894
01:49:59,463 --> 01:50:00,463
Yes.

895
01:50:01,506 --> 01:50:03,424
Dive! Bond...

896
01:50:09,014 --> 01:50:10,347
I never miss.

897
01:51:18,583 --> 01:51:19,875
Where is she?

898
01:51:37,894 --> 01:51:38,894
James!

899
01:51:39,646 --> 01:51:41,856
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

900
01:52:14,097 --> 01:52:17,474
Level at 100 feet. Hold her steady.

901
01:52:28,278 --> 01:52:29,653
Level at 100 feet.

902
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:39,580
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'll show up on the spy satellite,

903
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:41,457
bring out the navy.

904
01:52:51,843 --> 01:52:53,302
Come on. Get up!

905
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:55,179
Over there. Go! Move!

906
01:52:55,263 --> 01:52:56,472
Move! Go, go, go!

907
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:00,100
Get over there! Stay! Up!

908
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,800
Get us level! Level!

909
01:53:33,009 --> 01:53:34,635
It's all smashed!

910
01:53:34,844 --> 01:53:35,886
Christmas?

911
01:53:37,347 --> 01:53:41,100
- So we're going up, then?
- Slight miscalculation.

912
01:53:53,196 --> 01:53:54,280
Hold on!

913
01:53:56,408 --> 01:53:58,367
Hold on, hold on.

914
01:54:13,675 --> 01:54:15,050
Brace yourself.

915
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:47,499
- It's flooding!
- Get up to the hatch.

916
01:54:55,467 --> 01:54:59,511
Damn! Come on! Go, go!

917
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:03,432
Move! Go on! Get out, now!

918
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:26,789
He's opened up the reactor!

919
01:55:26,873 --> 01:55:28,415
And locked himself in!

920
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,376
I have to get up there to him.

921
01:55:31,127 --> 01:55:32,503
We've got one chance.

922
01:55:32,587 --> 01:55:37,174
I'll get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.

923
01:55:40,678 --> 01:55:44,640
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

924
01:55:45,308 --> 01:55:46,892
James, it's too risky.

925
01:55:46,976 --> 01:55:49,812
If I don't make it,
use this chamber to get out.

926
01:55:49,896 --> 01:55:51,105
Close the hatch.

927
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:53,440
Be sure to exhale all the way up. Close it.

928
01:58:22,757 --> 01:58:23,757
James!

929
01:58:26,135 --> 01:58:27,135
Help!

930
01:58:38,314 --> 01:58:39,565
Come on, come on!

931
01:58:42,777 --> 01:58:44,861
We're safe from the radiation

932
01:58:44,946 --> 01:58:47,781
as long as the reactor coolant
doesn't burst.

933
01:58:47,865 --> 01:58:50,576
If he had gotten the plutonium rod
in the reactor,

934
01:58:50,785 --> 01:58:53,161
we could've written off the whole city.

935
01:58:53,413 --> 01:58:54,413
James!

936
01:58:57,375 --> 01:58:59,334
Welcome to my nuclear family.

937
01:59:25,903 --> 01:59:28,322
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?

938
01:59:28,406 --> 01:59:30,866
You forget, I'm already dead.

939
01:59:31,242 --> 01:59:34,578
Haven't you heard? So is she.

940
01:59:38,625 --> 01:59:41,001
You're lying.

941
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:45,547
Liar!

942
02:01:07,588 --> 02:01:08,964
She's waiting for you.

943
02:01:27,233 --> 02:01:32,237
The hydrogen gas level's too high.
One spark and the reactor will blow.

944
02:01:32,447 --> 02:01:34,030
I have to stop it.

945
02:01:37,702 --> 02:01:40,871
Go to the top of the submarine.
I'll meet you in the torpedo bay. Go!

946
02:01:46,753 --> 02:01:48,295
The reactor is flooded.

947
02:01:50,089 --> 02:01:52,758
So it's safe even if this place blows.

948
02:02:25,166 --> 02:02:26,166
Hey!

949
02:02:29,253 --> 02:02:30,253
Hey!

950
02:02:30,797 --> 02:02:32,923
- Hi!
- Hello!

951
02:02:36,969 --> 02:02:41,723
No, it's simply not the case.
No. Before that.

952
02:02:47,104 --> 02:02:49,815
- Any word?
- No. Still no contact.

953
02:02:54,904 --> 02:02:57,280
Always wanted to have Christmas
in Turkey.

954
02:02:59,826 --> 02:03:04,871
- Was that a Christmas joke?
- From me? No. Never.

955
02:03:05,915 --> 02:03:08,333
So isn't it time
you unwrapped your present?

956
02:03:08,417 --> 02:03:09,876
Oh, I think so.

957
02:03:14,715 --> 02:03:16,258
Look. What's that?

958
02:03:17,176 --> 02:03:18,802
- The card.
- So he must be nearby.

959
02:03:19,095 --> 02:03:20,178
Where?

960
02:03:23,266 --> 02:03:25,016
- Where?
- It picks up body heat,

961
02:03:25,101 --> 02:03:26,893
so humans come out orange.

962
02:03:29,188 --> 02:03:30,230
There.

963
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:35,235
I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?

964
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:41,950
It's getting redder.

965
02:03:49,542 --> 02:03:50,750
007!

966
02:03:56,132 --> 02:03:59,259
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.

967
02:04:02,138 --> 02:04:03,680
I was wrong about you.

968
02:04:04,974 --> 02:04:06,725
Yeah? How so?

969
02:04:08,686 --> 02:04:11,686
I thought Christmas only comes
once a year.
