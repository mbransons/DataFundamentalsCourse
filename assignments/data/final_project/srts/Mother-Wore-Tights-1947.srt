To really understand why Mother
wore tights in the first place,

26
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,620
we must go back to a June night in 1900,

27
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,624
to the night Mother was graduated from
the Oakland, California high school

28
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,047
and was selected to be the leading lady

29
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,876
in the school's annual
musical extravaganza...

30
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,963
An honor which, to this day,
brings a flush of pride to Mother's face.

31
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,208
She was Myrtle McKinley then.

32
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:18,039
And if you want my opinion and grandpa
and Grandma McKinley's opinion,

33
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,044
she was the prettiest girl in school.

34
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:16,143
Her school days were over,
and ahead, across the bay,

35
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,566
lay San Francisco and life...

36
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,645
Life with a capital "L"

37
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,484
A telephone operator. I'd rather be dead.

38
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,694
- Bessie.
- Well, I would.

39
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,825
Anyhow, it beats what I'm gonna do...

40
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,250
Standing on my feet all day
selling camisoles and chemises.

41
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,373
At least you'll be in college, Myrtle.

42
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,173
Business college...
If you can call that college.

43
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,988
What'll we do in town after we get
through with the telephone company?

44
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,175
We could walk around and look
in the store windows, I guess.

45
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,053
- We might go to a show.
- A show?

46
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,289
Well, my brother Clarence sells tickets
at Schneider's opera house.

47
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,396
He said he'd let me in free
any time I wanted to.

48
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,269
You suppose he'd let us all in?

49
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,727
- Well, I don't know. We could ask.
- Oh, Bessie, let's.

50
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,031
I've always wanted to go to Schneider's
opera house, but you know Grandma.

51
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,470
- Hello, bubba.
- What do you want?

52
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,535
You know my girlfriends Myrtle McKinley,
Alice Flemmerhammer?

53
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,174
I've heard their names.

54
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,387
Well, we thought... you always said if I
came over, you'd let me in free, and...

55
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,281
I never said anything
about the whole high school, did I?

56
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,477
- Aw, please, bubba.
- Oh, well.

57
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,235
But if Mr. Schneider ever catches me...

58
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,945
If Mr. Schneider
ever catches you doin' what?

59
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,340
Oh, uh, nothing, Mr. Schneider.
Nothing at all.

60
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,645
- I was just saying...
- Handin' out free tickets, huh?

61
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,023
- Oh, no, Mr. Schneider. They... they...
- They what?

62
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,835
They just wanted to know if...
If they could get a job with the show

63
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,838
in the chorus.

64
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,090
- In the chorus, huh?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,015
Come up to my office.

66
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,217
Well?

67
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,855
All right. Let's see your legs.

68
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,528
Oh, no!

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,294
Well, ain't you scared too?

70
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,459
No, sir.

71
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,717
Hmm.

72
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,721
Mm-hmm.

73
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,976
Mmm.

74
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,023
- So you wanna go on the stage, huh?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,066
Have you ever done any show work?

76
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,317
I took the lead in our high school play.
I-I'm a dancer.

77
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,989
Where'd you learn to dance?

78
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,726
Professor McGuffery,
our dramatics teacher, taught me.

79
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,831
- Your, uh, folks know about this?
- My parents are dead.

80
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,335
- How much do you want a week?
- Would, uh, ten dollars be all right?

81
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,418
- Ten dollars?
- Well, I-I didn't know I...

82
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,721
I was gonna offer you 15, but just to
teach you a lesson in show business,

83
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,548
ten bucks it is.

84
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,180
Come on.
One of the ladies in the front line

85

132
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,925
- What is it, a character part? Go away.
- Come on. He's only kiddin'...

I am at it, but I'd like to try.

Yeah, I've been noticin' you.
Here, let me hear you read this.

Hey, that's a swell accent.

139

You'll do fine. We'll have a bite to eat
after the show, hmm?

140
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,370
- Uh-oh, here it starts.
- Not for you, sweetheart.

141
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,048
- I'll run through the business with you.
- "The business" is right.

142
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,585

- Myrtle McKinley.

143

Anybody ever tell you
you got a nice pair of, uh...

144
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,755
Eyes. Yes, we've heard that.

145
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,466

I really mean "eyes."

Heh, heh.

147

- Good night.

151

- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

152
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,905
- Got a date?
- Sort of, halfway.

153
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,413

buy you a plate of spaghetti?

154
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,166

- Good night.

156
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,675
- Uh, some other time maybe?
- Maybe.

157
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,345
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

158
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,054
Waiting for somebody?
Yes. Mr. Burt.

159
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,727
- Oh, he left a long time ago.
- He did?

160
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,897
Yes. Said somethin'
about having a heavy date.

161
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,599
On.

162
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,606
Of course, uh,
I ain't doing nothin' myself.

163
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,233
What?

164
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,428
Oh, nothin'. I... just wanted to hear
how that would sound again.

165
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,534
- Good night.
- Good night.

166
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,800
- Hey, what's the idea?
- That's what I'd like to know.

167
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,299
What's wrong with a little kiss
between friends?

168
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,846
Nothing, if we were friends.

169
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,972
Okay, okay. Forget it. But don't think
you can fool me with this innocent stuff.

170
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,162
I've been hangin' around theaters
too long.

171
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,641
Wait a minute. Don't get sore.
What about that bite to eat?

172
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,713
I'm not hungry.
You wanna hear about the act?

173
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,882
- Not if this goes with it.
- Okay. You win.

174
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,718
But look. I couldn't take a chance
on puttin' some cheap dame in my act

175
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,011
and gumming it up with love.

176
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,993
I'm gonna be big-time. I had to find out.

177
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,351
- Oh, so you were just testing me, were you?
- Sure. It didn't mean a thing.

178
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,334
If it doesn't mean anything, why do you
want me in your act in the first place?

179
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,359
Hey, what's eatin' you? If I say I wanna
kiss you, you get sore and slap my face.

180
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,737
Then if I don't, you get madder than ever.
What kind of a dame are you?

181
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,128
The kind of a dame who's going
to be just as big-time as you are

182
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,260
and who isn't going to gum it up
with love either.

183
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,519
One night, a couple of months later,

184
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,380
the company had chipped in
to give Frank a party backstage.

185
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,360
He'd rushed out right after the show,

186
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,612
saying he had something important to do,
but he'd promised to hurry back.

187
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,536
Hey, Myrtle, how about doin' that
imitation of Frank while he's gone, huh?

188
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:01,082
- Oh, no, Rosemary. He might not like it.
- Ah, sure he would. Come on.

189
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,536
Hey, listen, everybody. Quiet!

190
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,746
Myrtle does
a wonderful imitation of Frank.

191
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,041
She did it for us in the dressing room.
Would you like to see it?

192
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,711
- You're on, honey.
- Oh, Rosemary, I hate to...

193
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,952
Look now, girlie, you're not gonna
be bashful about it, are you?

194
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,204
- You're among friends.
- Sure you are. Come on, Myrt.

195
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,790
But it's no good
without the right clothes and things.

196
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,056
Well, that's easy. Come on with me.

I'm glad I hired you. I...

224
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,522
Okay, children. Let "er rip!
You can start this shindig now.

225
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,670
- Papa's back.
- It's about time you showed up.

226
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,937
- Boy, did you miss somethin'.
- Kinda stealin' my thunder, ain't ya?

227
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,523
Oh, so that's where you been.
Out shoppin', huh?

228
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,118
Just a few little knickknacks.

229
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,222
It's my birthday.
I gotta get you some presents too.

230
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,246
That's more like it.

231
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,767
- Looks like you bought out the whole town.
- Just about.

232
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,624
Hey, I hope you've got me
a pair of stockings.

233
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,939
- You know what? What'd we get her?
- Stockings.

234
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,830
Stockings!

235
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,588
Come on.
I'll help you get out of those things.

236
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,407
Can you beat that guy?

237
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,038
Can't even let people give him a
birthday party without tryin' to top them.

238
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,053
Oh, I think it's sweet.

239
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,514
Hey, you're not falling
for that big show-off, are you?

240
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:17,479
Oh, of course not. But he is kinda nice.

241
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,136
Look, Myrt. Don't let that "sweetheart"
stuff throw you. He calls 'em all that.

242
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,723
It's just something to say when he can't
think of your name, like "hey, you."

243
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,747
I know.

244
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,060
I've seen dozens of guys like him
in this business,

245
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,978
and not one of them was worth shootin'.

246
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,482
Look at the way he throws his dough away...
Horse racing and those flashy clothes.

247
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,275
Huh. You'd think he was a millionaire.

248
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,549
He says that's part of the act,
that you've got to put on a front.

249
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,657
Sure, but that don't mean
you got to make a splash all the time.

250
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,118
Look, honey. You're just plain dumb
if you let yourself fall for a hoofer.

251
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,892
If you do, you'll wind up in the south end
of a poorhouse, or my name's mud.

252
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,938
I know because I married
one of those guys... a couple of times.

253
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,505
How are ya, Sarah Bernhardt? Still
tossin' that bustle into the third row?

254
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,565
Oh, I'm dyin' laughing.

255
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,550
I brought you some new red flannel,
sweetheart.

256
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:05,318
- You can sew yourself in for the winter.
- Heh, heh, heh.

257
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,366
Mad?

258
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,746
Sure I'm mad.
Nobody ever told me I was that good.

259
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,482
On the level, I never realized
I had all those tricks.

260
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,044
I'm beginning to learn somethin'
about myself. When did you pick it up?

261
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,547
I've had to watch you for eight weeks,
haven't I?

262
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,989
And I've been watching you too.

263
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,299
You know somethin'?
You're my kind of dancer.

264
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:29,037
You got more talent in your little finger
than the rest of these crows put together.

265
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,707
- And you can sing too.
- Oh, that's awfully nice of...

266
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,940
As a matter of fact, I got a funny notion
we might do pretty good as a double.

267
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,026
A double?

268
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,228
Sure. You know, you and me together.
A team.

269
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,155
- Oh, do you think I could?
- Well, sure you could.

270
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,200
- Not afraid, are ya?
- Oh, no. It isn't that...

271
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,308
I've been in this business a long time. I
know talent when I see it. You've got it.

272
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,995
- I'm tellin' you, we could knock 'em cold.
- I-I don't know what to say.

273
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,399
Okay, then don't say. Just keep it
under your hat and leave it to me.

274
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,901
We'll work somethin' out together
and then spring on 'em.

275
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,419
What do you say? Deal? Deal.

276
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:11,096
After that, Mother got her name
on the posters in the lobby too,

277
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:16,352
though of course,
you had to look twice to find it.

278
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,088
Roy Bivens kept telling her that she was
crazy to let Frank get away with it...

279
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,215
That she really made the act.

280
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,260
But Mother was careful to point out
that Frank was still the star

281
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,027
and that, after all,
it was his act and his idea.

282
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,659
But Roy insisted that now was her chance
to go places on her own...

283
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,867
That he could do a lot of good for her,
if she'd only let him.

284
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,873
But Mother only kept shaking
her head... no,

285
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,548
because... well, because
as far as she was concerned,

286
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,468
she'd already gone places.

287
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,012
Well, if your mind's made up,
if that's the way you feel about it...

288
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,307
I'm afraid it is, Roy,
but thanks just the same.

289
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,306
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

290
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,523
Hello, Miz Rastus!

291
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,197
Who was that gentleman
I just seen you with?

292
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,196
Dat was no gentleman, Mr. bones.
Dat was a tenor.

293
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,516
Well, how 'bout you and me
goin' on down to Mr. Capucci's

294
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,997
and leanin' up against
a big piece of catfish?

295
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,747
Mmm, mmm, sugar pie!
You done said yourself a mouthful.

296
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,829
- Well, let's go.
- Well, all right.

297
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,756
Yee-hee, hee!

298
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,835
- Good night, thank you. Come again.
- We will, Papa.

299
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,676
- Good evening, Mr. Burt.
- Papa, how are you?

300
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,724
Papa Capucci's
is one of Frank's favorite hangouts.

301
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,789
The bunch from Schneider's
had seen him come in

302
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:40,273
with many a pretty girl on his arm,
but somehow this was different.

303
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,603
They were wise... even if he wasn't...
That Mother had set her heart,

304
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,064
not on seeing her name in lights,

305
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,637
but on seeing just how soon
she could bring him around

306
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,778
to popping the all-important question.

307
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,476
I'm dying to see you.
You're the one I've always waited for.

308
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,742
- And that's just for you.
- Oh, my ring!

309
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:03,955
Please.
Giuseppe, per favore, the very best.

310
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,041
- Si, padrone.
- Giuseppe, g-g-get me some...

311
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,670
Si, signore. You want some butter.

312
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,132
No, no. I want some b-b-b...

313
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,635
He's just joking.
Spaghetti for two, please.

314
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,705
And put some of that good ol'
horse meat sauce on it, colonel.

315
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,390
Si, signore. I'll fix.

316
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,016
Oh, Frank, you're crazy.

317
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,626
Dat's what mein father says.

318
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,461
You know mein father? He's a Dutchman.

319
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,672
He talks like dis,
and does he hate the theater.

320
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,655
Ach! What kind of a business
is this? A dancer? A "chigger"?

321
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,346
Speaking of chiggin', kid,
I've been working on a new routine,

322
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,530
and I think I got it.

323
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,453
It's like Bowling Green only better.

324
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,907
How about meetin' me at the theater
in the morning about, uh, 11:00?

325
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,460
Frank, I'm not sure
I'm going to stay in the show.

326
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,818
- What do you mean, not stay in the show?
- There's nothing definite yet,

327
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,322
but, well, the truth is, Roy Bivens
is going into a new musical comedy,

328
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,837
and he says he can get me
a job with him too.

329
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,535
- Oh, he does, does he?
- Of course, I don't want to quit,

330
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,331
but, well, I thought maybe you'd be glad
of a chance to try out a new partner.

331
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,220
Just because you gave me my start

332
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,182
is no reason why you have to
stay shackled to me

333
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,815
as though we were shackled together...
Like people who were shackled.

334
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,524
Who said anything about being shackled?
What's itchin' you anyway?

335
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,280
Oh, nothing.
But, well, this is a pretty big chance.

336
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,558
Roy says it's sure to be a hit.
They're gonna open in la next month,

337
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,824
then go east to Chicago,
may even get to New York.

338
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,647
He says they're looking
for new faces and...

339
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,358
And that you've got the looks
and the voice and can hoof,

340
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,610
- and with him behind you...
- How did you know?

341
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,029
And besides you only get
second billing with me, right?

342
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,053
Well, yes, but...

343
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,282
Say, you're not falling
for what a tenor tells you, are ya?

344
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,891
I didn't say I was falling for it.
I just said I was thinking about it.

345
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,310
Honestly, Frank, what do you think?

346
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,042
Well, that's a little hard to say.
You see, I'm prejudiced.

347
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,710
I never did like tenors
in the first place.

348
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,645
Now I like them less than ever.

349
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,193
- Course, I'd hate to lose you.
- You would?

350
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,147
Sure.
It's no joke breakin' in a new partner.

351
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,595
Course, from your angle,
maybe I shouldn't stand in your way.

352
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,235
Maybe you could
make a big name as a single.

353
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,366
Yeah, maybe Roy is right, the rat.

354
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,789
Then you think I should say yes to Roy?

355
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,912
Well, you gotta think of yourself.

356
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,417
Course, if anything goes wrong,
you can always come back.

357
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,507
Thanks.

358
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,653
There's one thing
I wanna get clear though.

359
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,977
This business between you and Roy Bivens
is all business, isn't it?

360
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,757
No monkey business, no funny business,
just business business?

361
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,091
What's that to you?

362
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,927
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I was just thinking about you.

363
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:27,265
Thinking about me? You never thought about
anybody in your life except yourself.

364
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,838
- Now what makes you say that?
- Because it's the truth.

365
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,262
What do you care about a partner anyway?
Just somebody to dance with.

366
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,845
I wasn't going with him, but now I will.
I'm sick of being taken for granted.

367
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,848
Go on. Get yourself another partner.
Teach her your new routine.

368
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,408
What's got into you?

369
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,852
Some sense at last...
Which is more than you'll ever have.

370
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,743
Hey, wait a minute!

371
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,755
And you can charge
the broken dishes to him too!

372
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,966
Roy, I've changed my mind about that show.

373
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,449
If you can give me a chance,
I'll be tickled to death to go.

374
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,473
You will?

375
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,640
Well, swell. Sit down.
We've got business to discuss.

376
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,395
Oh, yes.
Frank missed her. I'm sure of that.

377
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,450
He went right on alone doing the same
old numbers in the same old way,

378
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,736
and to the delight
of the same old audiences.

hello, Frank.

384
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,924
When did you get back?
I thought you were in la.

385
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,816
I was, but... I came back.

386
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,661
Oh, what happened?
That outfit run out on you?

387
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,283
No.

388
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,207
Your tenor didn't start breathin'
down your neck, did he?

389
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,293
No.

390
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,212
As a matter of fact,
he asked me to marry him.

391
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,880
Marry him? He asked you to marry him?

392
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,552
What's wrong with that?
Some people do get married, you know.

393
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,004
What'd you say?

394
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,557
I... thanked him and told him
I'd have to think it over.

395
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,511
On.

396
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,561
Frank. Yeah?

397
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,812
You might as well know
what really happened.

398
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,144
Last week the producer
was watching me rehearse my dance.

399
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,573
It has some of your steps in it. In fact,
it's practically the same dance...

400
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,073
We did in Bowling Green,
except that I do it alone.

401
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,577
Producer didn't like it very much,
and Roy said...

402
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,328
Said what?

403
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,410
- Well...
- Go ahead. Don't be ashamed.

404
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,835
I wanna know the worst.

405
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,837
H-he said, "wait'll she really does it.
Of course, this is just a rehearsal."

406
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,419
- Things like that.
- That all?

407
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,847
Is that all? Why, I wanted
to go right through the floor

408
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,391
because, Frank, I was doing my very best.

409
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,017
I was dancing the way I always did
with you. I-I don't know what was wrong.

410
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,599
I do. Look,
I don't want to hurt you, but...

411
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,936
When you dance with me...
Well, when we dance together...

412
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,113
Yes, Frank?

413
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,553
Well, when we dance together,
it's just different.

414
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,488
How different, Frank?

415
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,286
Oh, I don't know, but we hit it off.

416
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,207
Maybe we oughta stick together...
You know, shackled. Married.

417
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,294
Oh, Frank!

418
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,121
- Anyhow, it's an idea. I'll work on it.
- You...

419
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,629
You'll work on it? Oh! Yeah.

420
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,803
Oh, Frank, I knew I shouldn't have
come back here and humiliated myself!

421
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,257
- Hey, take it easy!
- Oh, I'll show you!

422
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,455
Take your hands off of me.
Let me out of here, or I'll...

423
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,015
You'll what?

424
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,666
- Help! Help!
- Pipe down, will ya?

425
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,793
- There's a show goin' on out there.
- Let me go!

426
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,337
If I'd known you were
gonna behave like this...

427
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,361
Help!

428
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,995
I never would've proposed
to you in the first place!

429
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,488
♪ Oh, oh, I never knew ♪

430
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:11,288
♪ any boy like you ♪

431
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,959
And so they were
married in the sight of god

432
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,161
and these witnesses.

433
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,356
The reverend Mr. Winship,
who'd baptized Mother,

434
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,000
and had seen her through
her Sunday school days,

435
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,258
read the nuptial vows.

436
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,511
It was a lovely wedding and a perfect day.

437
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,844
Grandma had made Mother's dress,
and she was very proud of it.

438
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,739
Of course, Dad, who could charm
the stars out of the sky,

439
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,858
had completely won her and grandpa over.

440
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,778
Alice and Bessie took the whole day off.

441
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,527
It took them all morning to find
exactly the right wedding gift:

442
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,858
A pickle fork.

443
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,622
The ladies of the chorus were busy
with their handkerchiefs throughout,

444
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:59,170
but none enjoyed herself quite as much
as Mrs. Muggins, the character woman.

445
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,964
Even the doorman had donned
his best bib and Tucker.

446
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:11,515
Papa Capucci's wedding present
was his finest 75-cent Italian dinner,

447
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,435
replete with opera singers,
garlic and red wine.

448
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,724
Looking back, Mother says
it was the only time in her life

449
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,232
that she ever saw Dad completely subdued.

450
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,565
Amen. You may kiss the bride.

451
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:33,070
Congratulations, Frank. Congratulations!

452
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,909

The next season was even better.

478
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,324
Dad says they might even have hit Broadway

479
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,377
if suddenly, out of the blue sky,

480
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:49,014
Mother hadn't announced that she
was going home to Grandma because of...

481
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,339
Well, I believe the term
is "an act of god."

482
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,344
Myrt, you're kidding.

483
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:02,178
- Yahoo!
- Oh, Frank, stop it!

484
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,230
You'd think this was first time
anybody had ever had a baby.

485
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,767
Come on. Let's tell the gang.

486
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,357
Don't be silly. Nobody needs to know yet,
not for a month or two anyway.

487
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,448
After that...

488
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,635
After that, we'll take
a couple of months off, both of us.

489
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,743
No kid of mine is gonna be born
in front of a backdrop.

490
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,072
Frank. Yeah?

491
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,409
I'm not going to take just two months off.

492
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,122
- I'm going to quit... for good.
- You're gonna do what?

493
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,653
I don't want my baby born on
the stage any more than you do,

494
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,258
or brought up there either.

495
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,429
I want him to have a home
and a mother to take care of him.

496
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,723
But Myrt, you can't quit. What about me?

497
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,926
Aw, you can get a dozen partners
as good as I am.

498
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,603
But I don't want a dozen partners.
I want you.

499
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,602
Why, Myrt, you... you're the act.

500
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,275
Look, Frank.

501
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:57,279
It's been wonderful together, but this is
going to be something even more wonderful.

502
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,454
You be the papa. We'll let you work
and make the money to send home.

503
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,204
Aw, Frank, this is what
I've wanted all my life.

504
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,878
From now on,
please just let me be the mama.

505
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,760
Frank Burt Jr.

506
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,803
Oh.

507
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,305
"An act of god."
And what an act it was.

508
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,390
"Frank Junior" it was to have been,
but under the circumstances,

509
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,397
Mother thought that perhaps "Iris"
would be a little more appropriate.

510
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,648
Then, three years later, me.

511
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,985
"Frank Junior"
it was to have been this time for sure.

512
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,617
But again, under the circumstances,

513
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,452
Mother thought that perhaps
"Miriam" would be more suitable.

514
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,255
They compromised on "Mikie."

515
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,386
Mikie, don't touch that.

516
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,679
- Stop that, Mikie. Mikie.
- Ow, it hurts!

517
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,353
- It does not.
- It does too. Give me that comb.

518
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,274
- Stop that, Mikie. Stop that. Mikie.
- Mikie, stop it!

519
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,338
- Give me that comb, Mikie.
- Stop it this instant.

520
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,943
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

521
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,364
Do you want me to write Daddy
and tell him what a bad girl he has?

522
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,596
All right, now go upstairs
and get dressed, both of you.

523
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Yes, Mama.

524
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,366
- And, Iris, you help her.
- Yes, Mama.

525
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,201
- Myrtle.
- In here, Grandma.

526
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,376
- This... th-this telegram just came.
- Oh.

527
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,361
Why on earth
do they think up these things?

528
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,071
Scarin' a body half out of their wits.

529
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,795
- Will you open it now?
- Oh, no, Grandma. You open it.

530
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,220
- Heaven be praised.
- Oh, Grandma.

531
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,182
- The man's not dead.
- Then what is it? What's happened?

532
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,631
Now, nothing to worry about. Nothing
to worry about at all. It just says,

533
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,362
"can't get woman to replace Dolly.

534
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,156
Meet me, Albany, 4:00 P.M., Frank."

535
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,907
Let me see it. Why, I can't do that.
I can't just pick up and leave.

536
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,579
Why, it's nearly 10:00 already.

537
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,283
He's your husband, isn't he?
If he says "go," you go.

538
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,336
- But the children...
- The children won't starve with me.

539
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,959
I've filled their stomachs before,
and I can again.

540
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,527
Besides, the idea of a married man

541
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,905
traveling all over the country
with a woman named Dolly,

542
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,215
and her a redhead, aye,
and dyed red at that.

543
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh, they don't travel together.
She's just a part of the act.

544
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,997
Now would I be sayin' anything against me
own grandson-in-law? Why, of course not.

545
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,103
But he was a man before he was a husband.

546
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,335
Oh, Frank's never even
looked at another woman.

547
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,769
Maybe, maybe not.

548
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,340
All I say is, you're his wife,
and a wife's place is with her husband...

549
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,400
First, last and always.

550
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,641
But Grandma, this means
he wants me to work in the act with him.

551
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,287
- All the better to keep an eye on him.
- But I've given up the stage.

552
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,911
We agreed on that. I want to stay home
and look after the children.

553
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,459
Besides, I haven't sung a note
for... for six years.

554
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,038
Singin' for babies
is very good for the voice.

555
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,625
And as for dancing...
Oh, stop it, Grandma.

556
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,699
If your dress is short enough, then never
worry about your singin' and dancin'.

557
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,117
Now you've just time to make it.

558
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,633
Get a move on now, and I'll fix you
a lunch to eat on the train.

559
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,731
Oh, Frank, here I am!

560
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,158
Frank, Frank!

561
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,237
- Myrtle!
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

562
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,953
Baby, have I missed you.

563
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:39,003
- You only gave me one hour.
- Well, it was long enough, wasn't it?

564
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,111
- Frank, what happened?
- Oh, Dolly got an offer to make pictures.

565
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,500
- Pictures?
- Movies.

566
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,239
- Oh, those.
- Where are your bags?

567
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,408
- Right here. These two.
- Yeah, this one and that one.

568
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,468
Taxi, sir? Yeah.

569
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,559
How are the kids?

570
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,763
Wonderful. They sent you a million kisses.

571
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,854
And Grandma?

572
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,875
Oh, she made me come.
You know, she never liked the idea

573
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,502
of your traveling all over the country
with another woman,

574
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,359
"and her a redhead, and dyed red at that."

575
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,382
She says a husband needs
a wife's affection.

576
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,842
Took the words out of my mouth.

577
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,481
- When do we open?
- Tonight.

578
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,659
Tonight? Oh, Frank, I can't.
I wouldn't know what to do.

579
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,516
Don't worry about that. I'll tell
the orchestra to play good and loud.

580
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,393
Oh, couldn't you have gotten
somebody else?

581
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,567
Oh, yeah. I had a dame.

582
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,606
One of them big, gushy mamas.
But she started handin' me a line

583
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,567
about what pretty eyes I've got,
and can't she have equal billing.

584
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,626
So I told her...

585
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,279
Never mind what you told her.
We haven't got time for that.

586
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,073
We've got lots to do.
I've even got to get something to wear.

587
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,097
Bread and butter.

588
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,868
Bread and butter.
You know somethin', Mrs. Burt?

589
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,892
What?

590
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,287
If I wasn't such a good friend
of your husband's,

591
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,223
I'd advise you to keep your door

Meanwhile,
we were growing up, Iris and I.

674
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:51,241
And while we loved to travel with
Mother and Dad as often as we could,

675
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:56,247
every winter, of course, we had to stay
with Grandma and go to school.

676
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,626
I particularly remember
the December I was ten.

677
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,835
Mother and Dad were booked solid
in and around Boston that winter,

678
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,173
and this was going to be...
Our first Christmas apart.

679
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:14,932
Is it a cold you've got now?

680
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,606
No, Ma'am.

681
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,955
Let me see that painting you're making.

682
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:51,051
Ah, now won't your father be
the proud one? I can hear him now,

683
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,805
boasting to the other gentlemen,
what a fine artist we have in the family.

684
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,886
Oh, Grandma.

685
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,565
There, there, child.
I know, I know, I know.

686
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:04,143
But think. Think of the fine, big package
that'll be arriving soon,

687
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,729
and think of all the fun we'll be havin'.

688
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,737
Fun without them?
But how could it be any fun, Grandma?

689
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,432
Are you forgettin' all the fine things
we'll be having to eat?

690
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,434
Turkey and mince pies
and plum puddings and...

691
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,164
I don't want any Turkey!

692
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,743
I don't want anything.
I just want to be with Mother and Daddy!

693
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,830
Yes, yes. I know, child, I know.
And you're right.

694
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,320
Christmas is for mothers
and fathers and children.

695
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,156
It's no time for either of them
to be traveling the world.

696
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,172
But why did they have to take
a booking for Christmas week?

697
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,346
Why?

698
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,788
Do theaters close on Christmas? Come now.
Stop this cryin' and carrying on.

699
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,770
- Remember, there's still Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?

700
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:44,351
What's he got to do with it?
And anyway, there isn't any Santa Claus.

701
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,778
No Santa... saints preserve us,
what a thing to say,

702
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,844
and him with ears that reach
to the north pole and beyond it.

703
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,234
I'll tell you what.
We'll send him a letter.

704
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:56,058
Who knows what the good man will do
when the facts are laid before him?

705
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,413
Just remember this:

706
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,958
Santa Claus and your grandma
workin' together...

707
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,377
They're mighty hard to beat.

708
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,294
It says, "do not open till Christmas."

709
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,821
But I guess it won't do any harm
to look at the packages.

710
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,928
It is Christmas.
Anyway, it will be in about 30 minutes.

711
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,802
And if you think I'm gonna wait...

712
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,134
For you "from Mikie."

713
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,141
Aw, look how cute she wrapped it.

714
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,632
This is from Iris.
I can tell by the handwriting.

715
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:27,059
Oh, she made handkerchiefs again.

716
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,612
"From Grandma." A fruitcake.

717
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,988
- We still have some from last year.
- Yeah, but it'll keep.

718
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,788
For me "from Mikie. To my father"...

719
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,479
A great school these kids are goin' to.
They got their own way of spelling:

720
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:46,121
M-e-r-y, "Mery" Christmas."

721
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,298
Well, let's see what we got here.

722
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:53,253
Well. Look at that.

723
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,720
Just what I needed.

724
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,348
Frank. Yeah?

725
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,523
Listen. "To my wonderful mother.

726
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,271
"There is no other like my mother.

727
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,695
- Her wine-tinted lips, her raven hair"...
- Since when?

728
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,023
"Her beautiful arms...

729
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,952
How I wish I was there. Mikie."

730
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,450
Oh, Frank.

731
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,710
- Now remember what you said.
- I'm not crying.

732
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,538
"Who is it?

733
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,668
I'll get it. Here, figure this out.

734
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,922
I can't tell which is right-side up.

735
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,408
- Another package, Mr. Burt.
- Oh, good. Where is it?

736
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,872
- From Chicago.
- You monkeys!

737
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,388
Daddy!

738
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,895
- This is wonderful!
- Oh, Mother!

739
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,132
How did you get here?
Why didn't you let us know? What happened?

740
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,522
- It was Grandma's idea.
- Good old Grandma.

741
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,387
She made us write Santa Claus
what we wanted most of all.

742
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,411
She did?

743
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,599
Call the desk and tell them
we'll have to have another room.

744
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,623
I will not.

745
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,769
I'll make 'em give us a suite,
and the best one they've got too.

746
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,502
Come on. Let me take off your coats.
I can't get over it.

747
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,877
I'm not over it yet. Uh, room serv...
Room-room... clerk, please.

748
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,676
- I-I can't believe you're really here.
- Well, we are.

749
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,533
What happened to your clothes?
You look like you slept in them.

750
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,843
We did.
We were afraid to take them off.

751
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,205
We were afraid we wouldn't know
when we got to Boston.

752
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,935
Oh, you gooses.

753
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,667
Why didn't you let us know you were coming
so we could have met you?

754
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,057
Grandma wanted it to be a surprise.

755
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,276
Oh, I know, dear, but,
well, we couldn't wait.

756
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,367
Oh, my.

757
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,861
What's the matter, Mother?

758
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,285
Your presents.
We sent everything to Chicago.

759
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,599
Oh, that'll be fine. Thanks.

760
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,185
Frank, do you realize we haven't
a thing here for the children?

761
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,951
- Not even a tree.
- Holy cow.

762
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,458
We don't mind. All we want
is to be with you and Daddy.

763
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,585
I know, but your presents...

764
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,695
- Where are you going?
- To hitch up my reindeer.

765
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,301
But Frank, it's midnight.
Everything will be closed.

766
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,595
I'm surprised at you.

767
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,515
I'm Santy Claus. I use chimneys!

768
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,723
- Well, hurry back.
- I will.

769
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,813
Poor Dad. He'd looked
everywhere, but you know Boston.

770
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,271
He was just about to give up,
when suddenly...

771
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,639
Hey, you!
Where are you goin' with that tree?

772
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,181
Come back here, you! Come back here!

773
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,437
Hey, you! Come back here!

774
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,437
- Merry Christmas, officer.
- "Merry Christmas," is it?

775
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:14,875
You'd think on this one night in the year,
folks would behave themselves!

776
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:19,049
No presents? Well, maybe not.

777
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,469
But no two kids ever had
a happier Christmas morning.

778
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:27,391
The whole troupe, even the headliners,
had volunteered to entertain us

779
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,141
and had brought along
the greatest of all gifts: Their talents.

780
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,395
Ohhh.

781
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,441
♪ Dee, Lee-Dee-Dee-Dee ♪

782
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,315
ohhh!

783
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,490
Ohhh!

784
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,752
Ohhh.

785
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,668
Ohhh.

786
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,773
And now, kids, Santa Claus
has another real treat for ya.

787
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,913
This next artist to entertain you
has appeared

788
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,581
before every crowned head in Europe.

789
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,937
You're lucky,
so keep your royal eyes peeled.

790
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,858
My good friend and fellow thespian,
Senor Wences.

791
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:36,202
Aren't they wonderful
to come to our rescue like this?

792
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,796
You'd almost think actors were human,
wouldn't you?

793
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,140
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

794
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,226
Thank you. You're welcome.

795
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,673
Can you tell me, please,
what is your name?

796
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,697
Yes.

797
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,781
- What?
- Johnny.

798
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,653
- I never remember. And second name?
- Martin.

799
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,735
- Martin. Good boy?
- Good boy.

800
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,306
That's nice. Give me a kiss.

801
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,786
- Nice.
- Thank you.

802
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,492
- What have you done today?
- I was studying my song.

803
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,078
I don't believe you.
I will try your voice.

804
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,164
- Now? Why?
- Now. I will tell you.

805
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,126
Simple. Because I need to know
your lung capacity, your lung resistance.

806
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,699
- All right.
- All right. And if you are a good boy...

807
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,430
- Good boy?
- Yes. I will give you some candy.

808
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,599
- Candy?
- Candy. Lollipop.

809
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,974
- Lollipop?
- Yes. Don't worry.

810
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,350
Listen to me first.

811
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,524
- You first?
- I first.

812
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,101
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

813
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,811
- Don't be silly, eh?
- Sorry.

814
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,943
Sorry. I do.

815
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:57,666
You.

816
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,773
- That's all right. I believe you.
- All right?

817
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,900
- Quite good.
- Very good. How is your throat today?

818
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,209
- No good. No.
- No good?

819
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,736
- Open your mouth. Let me see your throat.
- Why?

820
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,628
Open your mouth. I know. Open more.

821
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,842
Open little more.

822
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,346
Show me your tongue.

823
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,622
- That's right.
- All right?

824
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,248
- Do you want some chewing gum?
- You have?

825
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,981
I have plenty. Sure.
It's very good for you. Open your mouth.

826
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,650
Little more. That's good. There.

827
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,231
- Do you like it?
- It is very sweet.

828
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,902
- How do you feel now?
- I am thirsty.

829
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,098
- Are you thirsty?
- Yes.

830
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,910
- Oh, simple. I will give you some eggnog.
- Eggnog?

831
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,707
- You like? Okay.
- Yes.

832
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,913
Open your mouth. Close. Drink slowly.

833
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:49,301
That's nice.

834
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,865
- What is the matter, Johnny?
- I am drunk.

835
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,515
And now, Johnny, please,
sing me that Spanish song.

836
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,766
Yes.

837
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,918
- You remember?
- Sure.

838
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,479
- Okay. With feeling, eh?
- I know.

839
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,185
- Tempo. Ready?
- Yes.

840
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,111
- Now. One...
- Two, three.

841
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,029
- No, no. I count. I count.
- Sorry.

842
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,861
It's all right.

843
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,881

847
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,725
Now then.

848
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,004
Bravo. Bravo.

849
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,253
For Mother and Dad,
it still wouldn't have been Christmas

850
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,586

Mother had one weakness...

876
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,295
Never could she resist a travel folder.

877
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,975
Every vacation, she decided we needed
a complete change of environment,

878
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:28,475
and this year she selected
the most fashionable

879
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,647
and, according to the travel agencies,

880
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,976
the gayest of all summer resorts...

881
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,357
Berkshire Highlands.

882
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,497
Good morning. Good morning.

883
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,967
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.

884
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,740
I'm Frank Burt.
I made reservations for four.

885
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,764
Oh, yes, Mr. Burt.

886
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:05,557
- Will you sign the register?
- What's the matter? Death in the family?

887
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,636
I beg your pardon, sir.
"When do we view the remains?

888
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,518
Oh. Yes, it does look a bit that way,
doesn't it, sir?

889
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,754
Don't these people ever
do anything or say anything?

890
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:15,778
Hardly ever, sir.

891
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,978
Sometimes they say, "good morning."

892
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,610
Now that's right broad-minded
of them, isn't it?

893
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,861
Yes, sir.

894
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:26,491
Show Mr. and Mrs. Burt
to their rooms, 208 and 209.

895
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,788
- This way, sir.
- Yes, sir.

896
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,040
"Deadpan Alley."

897
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,404
These places are always
much livelier at night.

898
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,295
Yeah, well, it reminds me
of a well-stocked morgue.

899
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,472
Frank.

900
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,228
- Oh!
- Don't break your neck, kid.

901
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,608
You'll never get any laughs in this joint.

902
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,362
Thank you. I-I'm sorry.

903
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,948
- That's all right.
- Well, thank you.

904
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,954
Goin' up!

905
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,135
- Crown it!
- Oh, Frank!

906
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,767
- Shh!
- Oh!

907
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,880
He looks so lonesome.
Why don't you speak to him, Frank?

908
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,940
Introduce him to the girls. Yes!

909
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,131
Iris has been making eyes at him
all night.

910
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,067
- You shut up. I have not.
- I've been watching you.

911
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,211
- Mikie!
- Come on. Let's go to the piano.

912
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,308
Maybe we can liven up this joint a little.

913
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,894
That's a good idea.
I'm sure that's why they have a piano.

914
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,705
Mother, please don't.
Everybody's looking at us already.

915
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,913
Since when did actors
not wanna be looked at?

916
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,749
Especially at these prices.

917
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:53,054
- How about "tra-la-la"?
- Good. Hit it.

01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,651
Hmm.

945
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,530
The next day was every bit as gay...

946
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:42,493
The only difference was,
they changed to the chairs on the lawn.

947
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,970
Beautiful day.

948
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,298
Uh-huh. "Sure, Frank. It's a fine day.

949
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,305
Nice to see you up and around."

950
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,387
I give up.

951
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,393
I'm sorry, dear.
I guess I just made a mistake.

952
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:08,047
If anyone speaks to me while we're here,
I'm gonna keel over in a dead faint.

953
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,155
And I'll join you. Why don't you girls
run along and try to have a good time?

954
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,985
- Doing what?
- Well, at least the view is nice.

955
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,240
Oh, very well. Come on, Mikie.

956
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,811
- Let's go down and look at the fish pond.
- Who cares about old goldfish?

957
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,577
- You heard what Mother said. Now come on.
- Hmph.

958
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,571
Here. Take another look at this.
You've only read it twice.

959
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:34,299
I'd much rather go down by the swimming
pool. Where do you suppose it is?

960
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,550
I don't know.

961
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,096
On! I get it.

962
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,935
Mikie, darling, must you play
with that absurd ball all the time?

963
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,550
I'm trying to bounce it a hundred times
without missing.

964
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,690
But it's all so childish.

965
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,696
Then why'd you beg me
to lend it to you yesterday?

966
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:58,822
Don't be ridiculous.

967
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,121
What in the world would I be doing
with a silly old ball?

968
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,542
If I wanted to waste any time,
I'd much rather waste it on a good book.

969
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,340
On.

970
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:15,043
- This your ball?
- Oh. Yes, it is.

971
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,221
Thank you. It belongs to my little sister.

972
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,015
Here you are, darling.
We have a silly old bet

973
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,581
that she can't bounce it
a hundred times without missing.

974
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,561
- Haven't we, Mikie?
- No!

975
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,627
Of course, we have. Now run along
and play. I'll watch you from here.

976
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,564
Oh, all right.
It'll probably be dull anyway.

977
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,819
But she does love to bounce it too.
And she hates books.

978
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,868
Oh! I'm so sorry.

979
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:43,037
I detest scenes,
but you know how children are

980
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,866
at that age.

981
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,076
Would you... would you like to sit down?

982
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,084
Thank you, but I really better not.

983
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,713
I was just going
for my, uh, constitutional.

984
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:59,011
Oh! Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

985
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:04,684
But then it's early yet. I suppose
there's really no rush, is there?

986
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,103
Oh, no.

987
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,599
On.

988
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,522
Well, uh, are you... enjoying it here?

989
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,279
Oh, yes. It's heavenly, isn't it?

990
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,702
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

991
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,745
- Oh, hello.
- Guten Tag.

992
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,692
I saw you last night when we were singing.

993
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,716
Ja.

994
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,417
- Mama, what is this she does?
- She bounces.

995
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,720
It's a joggling board.
You jump up and down and joggle.

996
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,970
- What she say?
- It's a joggling board, Papa.

997
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,552
Oh. And your mama lets you
joggle like this by yourself?

998
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,480
Oh, sure. She used
to joggle herself when she was little.

999
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,667
She says it helps a woman keep her figure.

1000
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,067
Why does your mama
want to keep her figure?

1001
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,487
Because she's an actress.
"What is?

1002
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,942
Her mama is an actress, Papa.
She has to keep her figure.

1003
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,903
Actress? What does she act, this mama?

1004
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:08,161
Oh, she and Daddy
sing and dance and tell jokes.

1005
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,617
Mama's the straight man.
Daddy's the funny one.

1006
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:13,499
Haven't you ever caught their act...
Burt and McKinley?

1007
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,672
We don't go to the theater anymore.

1008
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,922
You don't? Gee whillikers!
I thought everybody went to the theater.

1009
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:23,005
My husband used to take me
to the academy of music,

1010
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,181
but now he don't hear so good.

1011
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,350
You ought to go to vaudeville sometime.

1012
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,665
My mother looks awfully pretty
from the front.

1013
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:33,273
- What she say?
- Her mama looks nice in the front.

1014
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,943
- Oh!
- And your papa? He sings too, maybe?

1015
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,193
Oh, yes, but he really
just talks his songs.

1016
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,821
- What he does?
- The papa talks when he sings.

1017
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,447
- Huh?
- That what she says.

1018
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,225
He does a number called "chewing gum."
You know "chewing gum."

1019
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,476
- Mm-hmm.
- Have you heard it?

1020
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,331
- No.
- It's cute. Listen.

It's Mikie!

1033
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,372
- What did she do?
- She hit her head.

1034
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,495
Oh! Quick! Get some water! Do something!

1035
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,586
- Hadn't we better get a doctor?
- Mikie.

1036
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,663
Oh, Mikie, darling.

1037
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,748
Oh, Frank! Frank, she's out!

1038
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,049
- Here. Let me have her.
- What happened?

1039
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,878
She was showing us
how you sing and dance. She fell.

1040
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,054
Oh! Are there any bones broken?

1041
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,141
I don't think so, but she's got
a nice goose egg on her head.

1042
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,186
Oh, Mikie.

1043
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,500
Here's the water. Hurry. It's leaking out.
Never mind. She's coming to.

1044
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,890
- Daddy?
- You're all right, kid.

1045
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,526
Daddy, did my pratfall get 'em?

1046
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,855
Get 'em. Why you couldn't make
this bunch of longhairs laugh

1047
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,941
if you split your head wide open.

1048
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,347
Come on, Frank.
I've had all I want of this place.

1049
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,371
- That goes for me too.
- Come on, Iris. We're going to pack.

1050
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:20,081
- Well, I... I guess I have to go.
- For good?

1051
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:24,383
- I don't know. I hope not.
- Oh, me too.

1052
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,587
Well, good-bye.

1053
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,174
Good-bye.

1054
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,271
- Oh.
- What do you got in here?

1055
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,965
We didn't have all this trouble
when we left home.

1056
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:47,483
It always happens when you travel.
Kneel on it.

1057
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:50,114
Oh. Did you call a bellboy
to get the bags?

1058
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,411
- Yeah. He'll be right up.
- We're all ready.

1059
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,560
Iris, take another look
through those bureau drawers,

1060
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,729
and, Mikie, see if I left anything
in the bathroom, will you?

1061
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,120
- I almost got this side.
- What is the matter with this thing?

1062
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,377
Look out. I'll fix it. Oh!

1063
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:08,847
Frank.

1064
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,409
Well, how do you suppose
those got in there?

1065
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,845
The way they always do. Really.

1066
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,768
Mother, why do we have to leave?

1067
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,708
Because I'm not going to have
our whole vacation ruined

1068
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,543
by staying here
with these stick-in-the-muds.

1069
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,980
- I know why Iris doesn't wanna go.
- You shut up. That's not it.

1070
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,758
- Ah, that does it.
- She doesn't wanna leave her fella.

1071
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,318
Stop saying that! "What fella?

1072
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,273
Bob. "Who's Bob?

1073
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:33,532
Oh, you know. Bob Clarkman. The one
she's been behaving so disgusting about.

1074
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,454
- Mother, make her stop.
- Clarkman?

1075
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,312
Isn't his old man
a big something-or-other on wall street?

1076
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,936
If you asked me,
they're all big something-or-others.

1077
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,443
But Mother, Bob's not like the others.
Really he isn't.

1078
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,628
Well, I'm not staying to find out.

1079
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,882
He's been so lonesome here.
His mother and father are in Europe.

1080
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,322
He had to come here
with his old tutor, and I...

1081
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,554
You can let the boy in, Frank.
The bags are ready.

1082
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,886
Okay.

1083
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,470
Mr. Burt?

1084
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,565
No!

1085
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,398
Frank Burt, behave yourself.

1086
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,024
I told ya I'd faint
if anybody here every spoke to me.

1087
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,301
We just wanted to ask
how the little girl is.

1088
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,325
Yes.

1089
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,055
Oh, she's fine. Anyway,
she's able to take a little nourishment.

1090
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,661
- We brought you some candy.
- Gee, thanks.

1091
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,098
We just like to say,
we are sorry you fell down.

1092
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,125
Ja.

1093
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,979
Well, that's awfully nice of you.
Won't you come in?

1094
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,203
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1095
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,211
Not leaving, are you, Mrs. Burt?

1096
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,419
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, we'll be sorry to see you go.

1097
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,327
We were in hopes that, perhaps, you'd stay
on and help give this place a little life.

1098
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,263
I'm afraid that's hopeless.
Yes. I know.

1099
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,554
A few of us were talking
about it downstairs.

1100
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:44,440
And you're right, Mrs. Burt.
We've gotten to be a bunch of old fogeys.

1101
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,672
We've been coming here so long
and doing nothing

1102
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,937
that I guess we've sort of dried up.

1103
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,613
What did he say?
We are dried out.

1104
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,785
- Ja. Completely dried.
- But we have enjoyed your being here.

1105
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,454
And we would like to make
an effort to "limber up"

1106
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,748
if we can persuade you
to change your minds.

1107
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,872
Well, that's up to the missus.
She picked this place.

1108
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,295
Well, we're all packed, ready to leave.

1109
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,795
- Oh, Mother, please, let's stay.
- Ja. Please.

1110
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,628
- We all have good times together.
- Oh, ja.

1111
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,367
What do ya say, Myrt?
We've played tougher audiences than this

1112
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,554
and never walked out on them,
and the kids wanna stay.

1123
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,930
was triumphantly restored.

1124
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:02,351
Even Dad had to admit that it was
the gayest of all summer resorts.

1125
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,601

Aren't you sleepy?

1134
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,818
Iris, what is it?
Is something worrying you?

1135
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:06,704
No, Mother. It's just that it's our last
night here, and... I don't wanna go.

1136
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,911
Oh, but we have to go, darling.
Our month's up.

1137
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:14,090
Daddy and I have to get back to work
and you and Mikie have to go to school.

I know, but I wish we didn't.

Not like this one.

01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,017
You like Bob, don't you?

1142
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,854
He's going to college in the fall...

1143
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,057
To Harvard like his father.

1144
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,268
I don't suppose I'll ever see him again.

1145
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,355
Of course, you will, if you want to.
"Where would I ever see him?

1146
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:41,068
All the girls he knows go to
finishing schools and places like that.

1147
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:45,701
And all we ever see is... oh, I know you
just think I'm being silly, Mother, but...

1148
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,749
Oh, no. I don't.

1149
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,624
I think... well, I think you'd better go in
and get some sleep now.

1150
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,047
We'll talk about it in the morning.

1151
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,559
Good night, Mother. I love you.

1152
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,977
Good night, dear. I love you too.

1153
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,306
And everything's gonna be all right.

1154
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,686
You'll see.

1155
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:26,996
I suppose I'll never get another night's
sleep now that you're in love.

1156
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,449
Mikie, you were eavesdropping.

1157
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,501
Yes, and it was all so boring.

1158
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,330
Oh!

1159
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,126
- Frank.
- Mm-hmm.

1160
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,758
I was just thinking about Mikie and Iris.

1161
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,930
When did you ever not think about 'em?

1162
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,259
I mean, seriously. About their futures.

1163
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,354
What futures?

1164
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,772
Oh, about the kind of people
they'd go with, things like that.

1165
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,504
What's wrong with the people
they been going with?

1166
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,268
Nothing, except,

1167
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,050
well, I was wondering if maybe
we hadn't been a little selfish.

1168
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,658
- Us, selfish?
- Making them lead our kind of life.

1169
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,575
After all, they are individuals.

1170
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,463
They have the right to choose
some things for themselves.

1171
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:12,871
- What do they want now?
- Oh, nothing definite. It's just...

1172
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,512
The trouble with those kids
is they've had too much.

1173
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:19,005
Are you trying to say
the girls are spoiled?

1174
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,049
You mean, you didn't know?

1175
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,116
Frank Burt, that's the meanest thing
I've ever heard you say in your life.

1176
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,133
- Of all the unspoiled children...
- Okay. Skip it. What do ya mean?

1177
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:32,061
- Well, for one thing, school.
- School? They go to school.

1178
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:37,484
Yes, well, I was thinking maybe a
boarding school. And after that, college.

1179
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,812
If that Mikie makes college,
I'll eat my sombrero.

1180
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,522
The stage is all right for us. We love it.

1181
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,654
Maybe they will too,
but we don't wanna force them.

1182
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,267
I'm not forcing anybody. I'm just trying
to find out what you're talkin' about.

1183
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,141
At least we should give them a chance

1184
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,659
to meet nice young girls and boys
their own age

1185
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:59,338
who are interested in other things like,
well, books and, well, things like that.

1186
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:02,917
Books? Great guns, Myrt, you couldn't
get either one of those kids

1187
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,003
to read a book if you tried.

1188
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,088
That's just the point. They should.

1189
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,786
All right. We'll give 'em a book...
Two books. One for each.

1190
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:14,600
Oh, Frank. You're just being stubborn.
Look, Iris is growing up.

1191
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,057
She's beginning to think about boys,
and they like her.

1192
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,255
Are you talking about
this wobbly-legged goof

1193
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,966
that looks like he's gonna break
into a run every time you look at him?

1194
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,106
He's not a goof. He's a wonderful boy.

1195
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,095
Ah, he can't even walk
without falling over himself.

1196
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,119
He's shy!

1197
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:31,446
- I'll bet if I said, "boo," to him...
- Don't you dare!

1198
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:37,125
Would you mind telling me
what we're fightin' about?

1199
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,955
Oh, go to sleep.

1200
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,461
We'll talk about it when we get home, huh?

1201
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,667
Okay.

1202
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,964
They did talk it over and, as usual,

1203
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:53,768
Mother allowed Dad to convince her
that she'd been right all along.

1204
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:57,597
So, the following September,
our hearts in our throats,

1205
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,044
we found ourselves approaching

1206
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:03,152
Miss Ridgeway's exclusive
boarding school for young ladies.

1207
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:07,065
- Oh, Mother! It's beautiful.
- Breathtaking.

1208
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,259
It's like a lovely stage setting,
isn't it?

1209
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,943
Where do you suppose we eat?

1210
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,391
Oh, Mikie, don't you ever think
of anything but your stomach?

1211
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:17,124
- Can I help it if I get hungry?
- Why I'm surprised at you, Mikie.

1212
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,772
You know your mother
wouldn't send you to a school

1213
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:20,899
where the young ladies
were vulgar enough to eat.

1214
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,109
Now, Frank, stop that.
It's a marvelous school.

1215
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:26,091
The catalog said the nicest girls
in the country come here.

1216
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,878
And don't you dare trip
or pull any gags when we go in.

1217
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,172
- Can't even pop my garters?
- No.

1218
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,098
Or mine either.

1219
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,348
Ridgeway's is not just
a finishing school, Mrs. Burt.

1220
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,351
We try to give our girls
a good, solid education,

1221
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,230
one which will make them good citizens,
good wives and good mothers.

1222
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:48,439
All we ask in return is that our girls
be Sincere and unaffected

1223
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:50,934
and help us to bring out
the best that's in them.

1224
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,783
Yes, I know, Miss Ridgeway.
That's why we wanted to send them here.

1225
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,223
I hope you'll come to see us again,
both of you.

1226
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,272
We like to have our parents
visit the school and meet our girls.

1227
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,024
You'll take care of them, won't you,
see that they're happy?

1228
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,777
- We'll do our best.
- They're a little bit on the goofy side,

1229
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,043
- but underneath, they're pretty nice kids.
- I'm sure they are.

1230
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,299
Well, good-bye, Miss Ridgeway. Thank you.

1231
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,869
Not at all. When you girls get through
saying good-bye, you'll come back in here.

1232
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,976
- Yes, they will. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1233
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,486
We'll get back to see you
the first chance we get.

1234
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:33,233
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Mother.

1235
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,661
Good-bye, baby.

1236
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,768
Remember now all the things
I told you about hanging up your clothes.

1237
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,750
- Yes'm.
- And, darling, you will try not to make

1238
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,294
those terrible noises
after you've eaten too much?

1239
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,525
Yes, I'll try not to bu...

1240
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,586
- Mikie!
- I didn't say.

1241
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,669
- You'll be good girls, won't you?
- Yes, we will, Mother.

1242
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,005
Don't forget now,
bear down on your algebra.

1243
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,841
After all, look how well I speak it.

1244
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:01,429
Well, I... I guess you'd better get back
to Miss Ridgeway now.

1245
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,764
Good-bye, Mother.

1246
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:07,317
Bye, darling. Good-bye, baby.

1247
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,920
Let's get 'em, take 'em home.

1248
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:34,378
This is what they need.
This is what they're going to have.

1249
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,717
They didn't have any chicken,
so I got corned beef.

1250
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,447
That'll be fine.

1251
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,651
- Which one is that for? Iris?
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:57,847
I thought you were gonna
save that material

1253
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,140
and have a dress made for yourself.

1254
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,560
I was, but Iris is going on a wonderful
house party with some of her classmates.

1255
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,396
Again? When does she do her schoolwork?

1256
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,315
This is over the Easter
holidays. There's her letter. Read it.

1257
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,817
Better take those pins out of your mouth.

1258
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,127
What do you think you are,
a sword swallower?

1259
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:15,336
They'll be parties every night.
I only hope I can get this to her in time.

1260
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:18,576
- Who are "Bob's father and mother"?
- Well, you know. The Clarkmans.

1261
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,637
That nice boy that Iris liked so much
in Berkshire Highlands.

1262
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,684
- Hold this.
- Oh, the goof!

1263
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,013
Frank!

1264
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,850
Hmm. Sounds pretty swanky.

1265
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,882
Well, they tell me there's nothin' like
a house party to brush up on mathematics...

1266
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,443

That was lovely, children. Don't stop.

1276
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,156
Oh. Anything you and Dad
particularly like, Mother?

1277
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,988
Let Iris choose one.
She's the singer in the crowd.

1278
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,573
Let's see.
"When you wore a tulip"?

1279
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,906
- How about "beach at Waikiki"?
- Does anyone know "stumbling"?

01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,743
Oh, I've heard it.

"Stumbling" happens to be
one of our numbers.

1302
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,829
Yeah, we've been eatin' off it
for two years.

1303
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,832
I hope my voice didn't throw you kids.
I'm one of those I-don't-care singers...

1304
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,543
All hips, who cares about the voice.

1305
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,149
She had one
of the sweetest hog-calling voices

1306
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,648
before I roped her and put shoes on her.

1307
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:42,278
- Oh, ed, you fool. Say, kid, you can sing.
- Oh, I can't really.

1308
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:46,328
The heck you cant.
Hey, ed. Who does she remind you of?

1309
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,685
Somebody I've seen,
but I can't quite place her.

1310
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,825
You know. That kid on the bill in Jersey

1311
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,648
that told you that big Shakespearean ham
was annoying her.

1312
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,663
You remember how cute she was?
Yeah.

1313
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,007
And did I put the kibosh
on his balcony scene.

1314
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,802
"Listen, Romeo," I said, "why don't you
pat my cheek or squeeze my arm

1315
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,800
or smooth my hair."

1316
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,928
I thought I'd die!

1317
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,999
I'm sorry we're getting out at the
next stop. We'd like to join you.

1318
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:14,419
If there's anything we like, it's low-down
Harmony. We gotta get our bags together.

1319
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,255
You know how these trains are.
They don't stop in these hick towns

1320
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,341
long enough to let you get your breath,
especially in these corsets.

1321
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,365
So long, everybody.

1322
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,344
So long, kids.
Don't do anything we wouldn't do...

1323
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:27,031
- Or haven't done.
- Ed, you fool!

1324
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,083
- Boy, were they hams.
- Imagine, breaking in like that.

1325
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:36,037
Did you ever hear
such a laugh in your life?

1326
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,166
And that hair!

1327
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:40,215
Why do all actors
have to be such show-offs?

1328
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,964
I don't know, but they all are.

1329
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:52,178
Dear old Ridgeway's...
How we loathed and loved it.

1330
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,639
But nothing equaled the thrill
of a letter from Mother...

1331
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,771
Even a letter without a check in it.

1332
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:06,404
- Special delivery.
- For me?

1333
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,640
- For both of us, from the family.
- Here. Let me have it.

1334
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:12,060
- I'll read it. It's from Cleveland.
- They must be at the Hippodrome.

1335
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,951
"Dear kids. Daddy and I
have the most wonderful news.

1336
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,732
"We've been keeping it a great secret,
but now you can know.

1337
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:21,248
"We've arranged a booking
in the very town where your school is.

1338
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:25,461
- We'll be there with you"...
- They're... they're going to play here?

1339
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,796
Sure. Isn't that scrumptious?
"When?

1340
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,303
Wait a minute. I'm coming to that.

1341
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:34,057
"Three weeks from this Thursday.
So be sure to tell Miss Ridgeway."

1342
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:36,934
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, but, Mikie, they can't.

1343
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,641
- They mustn't.
- Why mustn't they?

1344
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:43,441
- Oh, don't you see?
- See what?

1345
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,818
Oh, you're too...

1346
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,991
You wouldn't understand anyway.

1347
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,115
They can't come here. They mustn't!

1348
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,663
Iris, you're ashamed for them to come.

1349
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,742
I'm not. That's not it at all.

1350
01:26:56,837 --> 01:27:01,331
It's just that... oh, why do they have to
spoil everything just when I...

1351
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:06,010
Oh, Iris! You are ashamed. You are so.

1352
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,428
Ashamed of Mother and Daddy?

1353
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,676
Oh, Iris.

1354
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,514
You and Mikie wait here.

1355
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,359
- Mother.
- Hello, darling.

1356
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,536
Mother, what are you doing here?

1357
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,954
Mikie wired us you weren't well.

1358
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,201
- Did Daddy come too?
- He's just outside.

1359
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,036
He'll be in to see you later.

1360
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:44,043
Iris, what's wrong?

1361
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,671
Nothing, Mother. I just don't feel well.

1362
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:49,219
Don't you wanna tell me?

1363
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,972
Th-there's nothing to tell.

1364
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,926
Iris, look at me.

1365
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,137
I know what it is.

1366
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,811
Mikie did this. She told you.

1367
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:05,360
Oh, Mikie loves you, dear.
She only did what she thought was best.

1368
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:08,063
Oh, I'll never forgive her
as long as I live.

1369
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,571
- Iris, don't turn away like that.
- I wish I'd never come here!

1370
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:13,806
Oh, you've loved it here.
You've made friends...

1371
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,321
Miss Ridgeway, everybody loves you.

1372
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:20,409
- Don't say things like that.
- Oh, but it's true. I hate it.

1373
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:22,982
Do you think you're being quite fair
to your friends, Iris,

1374
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:25,006
to think that they would stop liking you

1375
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:28,379
because your mother and father
are on the stage?

1376
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,756
Oh, Mother, it's not that.

1377
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,759
It's just that my friends
are different from us.

1378
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,057
They think and they act differently.

1379
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,681
Oh, Mother, it's not you and Daddy.

1380
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,889
You're the sweetest people
in the whole world, but...

1381
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:46,022
But people on the stage
are not as refined as your friends.

1382
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:49,229
Is that it?

1383
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,406
I wish you could see some of their houses

1384
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,576
and how their mothers and fathers...

1385
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,779
Oh, this is what I mean.

1386
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:02,459
Listen. "Yippee! Zippo Grant and
Molly McGuire of Grant and McGuire

1387
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,649
"announce the marriage
of their daughter Trudy

1388
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,959
"to Joe blink of blink and skitch.

1389
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,362
The kids are going to Europe
on their honeymoon,

1390
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,298
and mom and pop are going along. Whoopee!"

1391
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:14,050
Don't you see, Mother?

1392
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,118
They couldn't even let
their daughter get married

1393
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:18,804
without taking
a whole page in variety to...

1394
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,137
To advertise it like a three-ring circus.

1395
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:26,316
And Bob's mother and father and
their friends wouldn't have done that.

1396
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:31,981
Oh, no. They're so nice and dignified.

1397
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:35,442
They want me to come and visit them
and go to the opera and things.

1398
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:38,153
Oh, Mother,

1399
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,330
you don't hate me, do you?

1400
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:44,001
- Of course not, dear.
- You know I love you and Daddy.

1401
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,249
Yes, I know you do.

1402
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,456
Oh, Mother!

1403
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,669
Don't worry, dear.
Daddy and I will talk this over.

1404
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:56,004
We'll figure something out.

1405
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,841
And whatever we decide
will be for your good.

1406
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,096
You know that, don't you?

1407
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,013
- Yes.
- Now get up and get dressed.

1408
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,189
We'll take you out to dinner.

1409
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:10,815
You don't want Daddy to see you
looking like a ghost, do you?

1410
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,989
- No.
- Hurry now.

1411
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:26,289
I can understand it. I'm sure all
young girls go through a phase like this.

1412
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,711
She's just all mixed-up.

1413
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:31,540
- I'll say she's mixed-up.
- Frank, please.

1414
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,798
I'm sure this is the best thing to do.

1415
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,950
I'm grateful to you, Mrs. Burt,
for coming in and telling me this.

1416
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,745
I know what it must mean to you.
How simple it would've been

1417
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:43,706
for you and your husband just to
have canceled your engagement.

1418
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,292
- Then you'll do it?
- I think under the circumstances,

1419
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:49,228
Ridgeway's can stretch its rules that far.

1420
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,810
I told my wife that
what we ought to do is...

1421
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:55,864
Yes, dear. I'm sure you're right, but,
please, let me handle it in my own way.

1422
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,658
But if you want my advice...

1423
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:03,660
- Yes?
- May I come in, Miss Ridgeway?

1424
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,241
Oh, yes. Come in, Iris.

1425
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,918
- Hmph.
- Now, Frank.

1426
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:12,168
- Good afternoon, Iris.
- Good afternoon, Miss Ridgeway.

1427
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,839
Hello, Daddy. Iris.

1428
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,839
Are you feeling better now?
Yes. I think so.

1429
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,215
I'm glad to hear that.

1430
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,992
I know how terribly disappointed you'd be

1431
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,827
not to be able to go to the theater
next week

1432
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,763
to see your mother's
and father's performance.

1433
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,685
Isn't it sweet of Miss Ridgeway?

1434
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:30,015
She's going to let you bring
your whole class to see us.

1435
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:33,443

I would like to sing a song
especially for my father and mother.

Though, of course, in private life,
she's Mrs. Robert Clarkman.

But then I'm sure
you suspected that all along.

01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,932

well, I didn't take to the stage.

their grandparents every Sunday.

01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:22,160

01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,162
- Where they belong.
- Oh. Thanks.

1591
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:34,426
Where's my pipe?

1592
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,926
Where you put it.

1593
01:46:38,017 --> 01:46:40,349
Anything else?

01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,427
Yep. "What?

1595
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,512
A kiss.
