1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,456
My friend gets another one, too!
How awesome!

3
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,712
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,629
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

5
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,930
One more! One more!

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,354
- Come here!
- No.

7
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,065
- Come here.
- No, no. Okay.

8
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,980
- You'll get a shot.
- Okay.

9
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,152
You have to drink it.

10
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,621
- Come on!
- Do it!

11
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,570
Hey!

12
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,704
Do you want some? Here you are.

13
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,336
Shitty little critter.

14
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,548
SORRY. I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY. KIM

15
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,246
Where were you last night?

16
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,207
- Didn't you go home? Did you sleep here?
- What?

17
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,665
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

18
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,880
Franny?

19
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,048
Holly.

20
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,142
Holly? Holly!

21
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,731
I want to go back and put on
the leggings with the stars.

22
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,815
We just spent half an hour
trying to find the right leggings. No!

23
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,571
You don't need to shout, Mom.

24
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,325
I'm sorry. I've got something
really important to do today.

25
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,165
- She's blinding me.
- We'll get the Wonder Woman costume later.

26
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,501
- I'm such a good friend.
- I know. Thank you.

27
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,114
Oh, no! No! No! No!

28
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,155
Shit.

29
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,162
The door. The door!

30
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,198
The door's stuck!

31
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,167
Oh, Shit!

32
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,000
The door's stuck! Oh, my God!

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,295
I don't want to be stuck in here!

34
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,635
Okay...

35
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,763
Okay.

36
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,814
- Franny'? Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

37
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,236
I'm fine.

38
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,324
- The damn door was stuck.
- You just need to twist it.

39
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,830
See? It twists.

40
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,521
"The deerjumps high and wide, but, well,
why not, it's got nothing to hide", right?

41
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,025
What's up with you?

42
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,524
This can't go on.

43
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:55,196
I've got enough "half" women here,
working part-time and such.

44
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,616
Heinze's getting married
and she'll be having kids.

45
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,956
Then she'll be off work
and all that drama.

46
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,373
So, I need women like you,
but I need you to give 100%.

47
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,547
- So, you'll be taking time off.
- Yes.

48
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,009
- What?
- You'll be taking time off.

49
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,844
No, no... I don't need to take time off.

50
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,107
You need to take a break. Do whatever
it is you need to do that will help you.

51
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,270
Go to a spa... Have a manicure
or a pedicure. Some "me" time.

52
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,192
No. Believe me, I don't need...

53
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,610
I just haven't
slept for a while. That's all.

54
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,156
It's not a problem.

55
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,660
Ms. Kinnert, let me rephrase that.

56
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,870
You're no use to me here
with your panic attacks.

57
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,674
They're not panic attacks.
It's just stress.

58
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,967
Do you know how to read?

59
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,179
"Strength doesn't mean
doing everything yourself.

60
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,262
Strength is about asking for help."

61
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,387
So, take some time off.
Stand up for purple, Ms. Kinnert.

62
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,244
My phone!

63
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,297
Ms. Kovnatzky.

64
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,971
Please, follow me. This way.

65
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,270
<i>The "haute de fleur bouquet prestige".</i>

66
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,432
With this, you'll shine next to any man.

67
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,021
We have cars waiting outside
your kids' school

68
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,990
and your house at Stresemannstrasse 233.

69
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,322
We're listening in to the police radio,

70
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,664
so, if you sound the alarm
or call for help, they're dead.

71
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,329
Put the necklace in this,
close the jewel case

72
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,916
and once I'm gone,
you'll put it away and wait.

73
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,755
Got it?

74
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,008
Smile.

75
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,344
Hey, you!

76
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,048
Stay where you are!

77
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,591
Lower your weapon!

78
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,753
Lower your weapon!

79
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,407
Scoot over.

80
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,745
Okay. Start the car.

81
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,789
Wait!

82
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,825
<i>...Ku'Damm. Nothing to report.</i>

83
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,552
<i>...heading north.</i>

84
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,884
<i>Nothing to report. We'll keep driving.</i>

85
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,677
Okay. Now.

86
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,921
Stop the car.

87
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,059
That way.

88
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,823
You'll be free to go soon.

89
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,030
Hey! What are you doing?

90
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,528
- I have to...
- Hey!

91
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,905
- Stop the car!
- I have to...

92
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,531
I just have to... No!

93
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,087
- Give me that! Give me...
- I must...

94
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,083
- Give me that!
- My phone! No! Give me my phone!

95
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,090
I didn't see you. I can't remember faces.
I've already forgotten yours.

96
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,929
Are you nuts?

97
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,979
Shit!

98
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,818
What? Are you going to puke now?

99
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,567
- Keep driving then.
- Okay.

100
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,328
Oh, God!

101
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,873
Timmsen!

102
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,294
Our hostage is Franziska Kinnert.
Her photo is being sent to the press.

103
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,181
We'd like to know why
the security freak decided to draw a gun.

104
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,267
On a pedestrian zone.
Damn rednecks. Amateurs.

105
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,808
- And the perp?
- She was bluffing. There were no cars.

106
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,145
- She acted alone.
- Are you impressed or something?

107
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,689
- What?
- Why are you all fidgety?

108
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,776
What? No. No. What I meant was that the...

109
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,528
We don't have a clear shot of her face.

110
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,992
- It reeks of perfume here.
- Ingrid.

111
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,374
- What?
- Well...

112
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,201
Finally.

113
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,883
Take a hike.

114
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,097
- Happy?
- Did you call me here?

115
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,388
Yep. Lucky you. You're on my team.

116
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,731
- Out of the question.
- It's perfect for your helper syndrome.

117
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,647
Take those stripper clothes off.

118
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,025
Lost your sense of humor?

119
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,326
You really want to be on patrol
for the rest of your life?

120
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,996
- I know you.
- Would that be all?

121
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,041
Come on. Yippee ki-yay?

122
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,590
You can't leave me alone with Timmsen.

123
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,343
Every idiot can be on patrol.

124
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,225
- Drive up there.
- Okay.

125
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,643
Stop the car.

126
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,279
Get out.

127
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,875
Open it.

128
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,416
Empty the contents
of the canister in the car.

129
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,145
- Take off yourjacket and throw it inside.
- Okay.

130
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,690
Okay.

131
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,694
Over there.

132
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,823
Come.

133
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,693
Hey, Leine.

134
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,891
Sorry. I had something to attend to.

135
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,945
Don't ask. She had to "work".

136
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,447
We can't take a baby on patrol!

137
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,076
I didn't want a child.
She went off the pill.

138
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,239
"It gives me depression."
Now the depression is in the back seat.

139
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,623
- Where to?
- Lietzensee Lake.

140
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,627
Someone's throwing stones at ducks.

141
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,459
Or throwing ducks at stones. I'm not sure.

142
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,772
You saw me, so I can't let you go. Hop in.

143
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,481
I can't.

144
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,650
- I lose my cool in confined spaces.
- Get in.

145
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,276
- Your mom should.
- What?

146
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,071
I'll knock you out
to make it easier for you.

147
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,534
Okay, yeah.

148
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,003
Okay.

149
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,451
The money first.

150
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,677
Greetings to Frank Gatsky.

151
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,367
What was that?

152
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,663
- I'm just the hostage!
- Hostage? What hostage?

153
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,784
Are you screwing with us?
Do you work for Gatsky?

154
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,164
We're out.

155
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,122
Hey, hey, hey!

156
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,623
I'm the hostage!

157
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,048
- Don't shit your pants because of Gatsky.
- Bye.

158
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,763
No! No! No! No!

159
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,018
Shit!

160
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,894
I'm just the hostage. I'm the hostage.

161
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,485
I'm the hostage! I'm the hostage!

162
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,490
I'm the hostage! I'm just the hostage!

163
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,491
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm just the hostage.

164
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,083
Oh, God! Oh, God! No! No! No!

165
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,331
Oh, God! No! No! No!

166
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,128
I'm the hostage.

167
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,673
No! No!

168
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,892
What's wrong with you?
Do you want to die? Do you?

169
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,653
Do as I say and if you move
as much as an eyelid, you're dead!

170
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,939
- Do you understand?
- Okay. Okay.

171
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,738
Fuck!

172
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,663
If I can't smoke, I won't say a word.

173
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,507
This is about your daughter
who's been taken hostage...

174
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,214
Coco Chanel could smoke where she liked.

175
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,261
Chanel was...
Sorry, but there's no comparison there.

176
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,008
Why is that? Why is that?

177
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,809
- I raised a kid on my own...
- Give her a lighter.

178
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,773
- I don't have one.
- Go get one. And an ashtray.

179
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,358
Yes, Sir!

180
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,491
- What's your profession?
- I'm a nurse.

181
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,277
- Hmm.
-"Hmm"? What's with the "hmm"?

182
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,538
- Beoause you think I failed as a mother?
- Have you?

183
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,575
Are you taking me for a fool?

184
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,621
I already said everything
to your dumb colleagues on the phone.

185
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:49,501
My daughter left home when she was 16,
and we haven't been in contact since.

186
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,002
And why is that?

187
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,890
- Do you have Children?
- No.

188
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:03,227
Then stop looking down on me and annoying
me with that hypocritical look of yours.

189
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,105
- Finally!
- Here you are.

190
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:11,652
My colleague will be taking over.
Let us know if she gets in touch.

191
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,236
Of course.

192
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,532
- Are you out of coffee?
- W hat?

193
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,070
Coffee?

194
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,997
No, Kim.

195
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,456
Look after her for a bit longer.
I'll pay you for it.

196
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,753
I can't right now.

197
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,125
I don't know how long.

198
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,720
No, it's okay.
You can't take her there now.

199
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,136
You can't take her to Bim Bum Land.

200
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,431
Okay, I'll come by. Yes, I'll hurry.

201
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,854
Kim, wait!
I need you to get something for me.

202
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,433
Okay. Great. I'll text it to you.

203
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,497
Please, be quiet. I have to think.

204
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,058
Why are we here?

205
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,278
- What's going on?
- You're staying here.

206
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,238
What? Why?

207
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,274
Wait, you can't just...

208
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,900
When will you be back?

209
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,698
You are coming back, right?
You can't just leave me here!

210
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,038
- What if something happens?
- You'll be out of my life.

211
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,452
Stop! Come back!

212
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,954
You can't just leave me here!

213
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,715
I'll scream until someone hears me.

214
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,635
Quit that! I'll come back for you.

215
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,226
You're lying!
You're going to leave me here to die!

216
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,887
I'll scream until the cops come.

217
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,855
I'll tell them everything!

218
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,481
- Oh, God! No!
- Shit.

219
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:19,961
Hello?

220
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,427
Hello?

221
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,151
Mom!

222
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,028
Come here!

223
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,260
<i>The perp may have stolen jewelry
worth half a million euros</i>

224
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,221
<i>according to
Ingrid von Kaiten, head of...</i>

225
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,237
Oh, God!

226
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,697
Oh, God. I can't take it anymore, Harry.
I can't take it anymore.

227
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,334
What's wrong with her?
Don't tell me this is normal!

228
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,330
- Oh! What's up with her?
- Ask her.

229
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,299
- Her poop was green.
- Was it foamy?

230
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,006
- What?
- Her stool.

231
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,763
- No.
- It's fine, then.

232
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,595
Everything except purple poop is normal.

233
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,234
- Careful there. Careful.
- See? Everything except purple is normal.

234
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,357
Oh, no...

235
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,612
- What?
- Quack, quack.

236
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,533
- Are you stalking me?
- Have you made a decision, wimp?

237
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,626
Find yourself another gorilla.

238
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,585
Am I invisible?

239
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,635
You're not.
Why doesn't she let the hostage go?

240
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,097
- No idea. Maybe she's not a hostage at all.
- Yeah, you should go investigate.

241
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,867
- What's the plan?
- To dye your hair.

242
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,369
What? Why are we dyeing my hair?

243
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,123
Because they'll recognize you
and I <i>can't</i> have you with me.

244
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,749
Where will we dye it?

245
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,338
No. No. No way.

246
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,512
Forget it.
I'm not sticking my head in there.

247
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,885
It's full of truck driver pee.

248
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,015
I have to try and find
a new buyer because of you.

249
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,355
And I hate not being prepared.

250
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,318
I have no idea what you just said,
but I'm not dying my hair.

251
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,420
- You're a real top prize, aren't you?
- Why'? You in a rush?

252
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,054
That was really fucking mean of you!

253
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,683
- Don't! I hate when people are too close!
- Oh, really?

254
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,776
You have aggression issues.

255
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,580
Stop crying. I had no choice.

256
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,831
How can we prevent your panic attacks?

257
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,921
Your mom has panic attacks.
It's just stress.

258
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,919
Pull yourself together.

259
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,635
You might not believe it,
but I'm the only person you have.

260
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,095
Yippee...

261
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,472
I play "Banana Kong" when I'm stressed.

262
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,187
-"Banana" what?
- Don't you speak English?

263
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,318
- I'll shoot you if you call someone.
- I know.

264
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,747
- What are you doing?
- Playing...

265
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,661
- With sound?
- It's calming.

266
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,173
Okay. I'll do the talking
and you stay quiet. Got it?

267
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,965
If they ask, we're partners
and we work for Gatsky. Okay?

268
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,927
- Who's Gassky?
-"Gatsky". Our protection.

269
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,809
If they realize we're just
two girls on our own, we're screwed.

270
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,512
What?

271
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,103
I've Changed my mind.

272
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,600
I'm out.

273
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,144
Pull yourself together!

274
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,775
Oh, God! Does Brad Pitt live here, too?

275
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,325
What if he asks me something? I can't lie.

276
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,118
Okay. Get down. Down.

277
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,828
Thank you.

278
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,041
- Who's that?
- Shit.

279
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,757
What are you doing?

280
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,095
- Give it back!
- Shut up. You're staying in the car.

281
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,971
It's Mel.

282
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,067
- Sweetheart!
- I've got something for Enno.

283
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,740
It's worth 500, but it's yours for 300.

284
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,009
- And it's from Gatsky?
- Yes.

285
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,943
It's not my field of expertise.
Who says it's real?

286
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,911
- I do.
- Oh...

287
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,250
It's now or never. If you're in,
then Gatsky will have more deals for you.

288
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,623
300,000.

289
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,735
Look what I found.

290
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,117
Hey! Let her go. Come here.

291
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,368
- Boo!
- Hey! Quit that!

292
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,583
Why are you sweating? Scared?

293
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,164
Don't be scared of me.

294
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,672
- I told you to leave her alone.
- We're just chatting.

295
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,926
We're with Gassky! Gassky's team.

296
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,008
Gassky's team...

297
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,781
Let her go.

298
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,612
You're not Gatsky's team.

299
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,447
Come on! Come on!

300
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,288
Shit!

301
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,257
This way.

302
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,380
Shit!

303
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,185
Get in! Get in!

304
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,768
Oh, God! Oh, God!

305
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,783
Shit!

306
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,546
You dirty rabble! Shit!

307
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,875
Oh, God! Oh, God!

308
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,851
Thank you. Thank you.

309
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,263
Thank you.

310
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,273
I emailed you
the information about our hostage.

311
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,811
Oh, God...
It's your hostage.

312
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,731
What do you want?

313
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,449
Oh, my God, Leine! We were a good team.

314
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,419
Don't be like that.
For one mission that we messed up?

315
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,180
It wasn't a mission. He was my friend.

316
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:22,024
Have you been to his house?
To see his wife and kids?

317
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,653
No. That's not really your thing, is it?

318
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,945
Look at what I've sent you.

319
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,909
I'm not your partner anymore. Get it?

320
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,540
Finally!

321
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,837
I know that, you asshole.

322
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,860
Fuck!

323
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,978
Thank you.

324
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,102
You're welcome.

325
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,013
Kim, are you okay? Is Holly okay?

326
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,392
No, everything's fine.
I just wanted to make sure.

327
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,646
What's wrong? What was that?

328
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,660
What's wrong?

329
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,617
Please, tell me...
- Piss off!

330
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,878
Piss off! Piss off, dammit!
Leave me alone!

331
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,872
What?

332
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,966
What... What do you mean?

333
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,507
Just go. Piss off!

334
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:03,393
But... I don't know where we are.
Where shall I go?

335
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,520
No idea. Home?

336
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,352
Don't start crying now...

337
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,395
I can't stand your crying.

338
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,271
But... You can't just
tell me to go, just like that.

339
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,744
I'm sorry that you're
in this mess because of me

340
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,407
and I'd really like
to make it up to you and help you.

341
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,079
You can't help me.

342
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:42,720
"Strength isn't doing everything alone,
but about asking for help."

343
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,012
What?

344
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,476
"Strength isn't doing everything alone,
but about asking for help."

345
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:53,193
- Where did you hear that shit?
- From some "say 'yes' to a 'no'" calendar.

346
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,573
I'm not going.

347
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,189
Sorry for getting you
involved in all of this.

348
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,943
It's not so bad.
I had no plans anyway.

349
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,709
What's your name, anyway?

350
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,128
Mel.

351
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,337
Mel? "Mel" like "Mel Gibson" or something?

352
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,011
Yes, that's it.

353
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:24,906
<i>442. Disorderly conduct at "Desiré".
Could you go check it out?</i>

354
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,324
<i>Sorry.</i>

355
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,117
Yes, we're on our way.

356
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:33,873
What?

357
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,500
- Where to?
-"Desiré".

358
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,426
"Desire"? It's in the sticks.
Who keeps filing complaints?

359
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,922
'Ll
I can't take her to "Desire .
She'll be traumatized.

360
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,841
Take the baby and go. I'll go alone.

361
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,433
Thank you. I've read that
whatever happens in your first two years,

362
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,649
becomes so ingrained
in your subconscious...

363
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,733
She'd become a prostitute.

364
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,073
- I owe you one.
- Close the door.

365
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,034
- Close the door.
- I will.

366
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,494
- Close the door, okay?
- Say "bye".

367
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,870
The door...

368
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,166
My name's Franziska.

369
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,754
- Great.
- But call me Franny. I hate my name. I...

370
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,881
- You look like shit.
- Oh, really?

371
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,793
Did it... Did it...
Didn't it turn out well?

372
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,468
Careful.

373
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,479
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey.

374
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:26,065
- Have you also done all that?
- Stay here and don't do anything.

375
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:29,360
- Don't talk to anyone. Got it?
- Yes. No talking.

376
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,332
- Why is she here?
- Gatsky will be happy.

377
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:41,417
Tarek, calm down. The guy's been banned.
You can't keep causing a fuss.

378
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,173
Coco. Harry's thirsty. Get him a drink.

379
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,668
- You look like shit.
- Yeah, thanks.

380
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,430
Get yourself a missus.
Your bad mood is too much to handle.

381
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,265
What about you? Go get Changed.

382
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,227
I'm all done.

383
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,815
- Is she new?
- Who'?

384
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,565
- Her.
- What? She's way too old and has no tits.

385
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,485
I'll go get my things. Don't go anywhere.

386
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:32,715
I don't want to harm your kid, of course.
I'm not a monster.

387
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,142
How did you imagine it?

388
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:41,565
You want to stop working for me,
take on anyjob you can and go solo?

389
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,024
And you use my name?

390
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,771
I need the money.

391
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,741
What's your plan?

392
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,240
I want out. I want to stop.
I want out of here.

393
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,213
Come on, Ingrid.

394
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,230
Mel'?

395
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,232
Mel'?

396
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,203
It burns! Fuck!

397
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,710
I can't see!

398
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,875
I can't see!

399
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,465
It's simple.
It's the same as always.

400
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,802
If I'm involved,
then I want my share. 50/50.

401
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,714
Those are the rules.
But you already know that.

402
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,632
I can't give you your share.

403
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,013
I don't have it. I've lost it.

404
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,015
- What?
- I've lost it, okay?

405
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,897
Then make sure you find it.

406
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:10,937
I want my share.

407
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,372
If you don't, you'll be my woman at last.

408
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,251
For her, I'd make an exception.

409
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,926
I miss you so much.

410
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,179
Stop.

411
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,309
Think about it.

412
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,155
Could you make us a drink?

413
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,659
- What's that? I <i>can't</i> see.
- Sit down. Come on.

414
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,991
It burns. It burns. It burns.

415
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,950
Thanks, it's been lovely,
but I'm in a rush.

416
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,667
Stay here.

417
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,872
Okay. Yes, okay.

418
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,916
But I don't want to talk.

419
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,302
I've got nothing against strippers.
I really don't.

420
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:20,511
You're cute, but I don't have any money
and you must be expensive.

421
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,925
Yeah. Drink something first.

422
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,188
Your outfit looks so fake.
It's such a turn-off.

423
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,816
I'm not a stripper. I'm a police officer.

424
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,445
Yeah, right.
I bet you have handcuffs and a loaded gun.

425
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,952
Flirting isn't your thing, is it?

426
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,760
Excuse me.
- It's okay.

427
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,135
I'll CONTACT YOU
REGARDING YOUR HISTAGE

428
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,728
- Hey!
- Where were you? I was looking for you.

429
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,354
- Hey!
- Franziska!

430
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,731
Hey, Harry? Hello?

431
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,534
Harry? Hello?

432
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,497
- What? He was a stripper!
- He knows your name!

433
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,458
- No, he doesn't!
- He just said it! He's a cop!

434
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,123
I left you alone for five minutes!

435
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,635
- He started it! It wasn't my fault!
- Are you crazy?

436
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,673
Sorry. You can trust me.

437
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,840
Normally, I'm reliable.
Shit! I'm leaving a trail!

438
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,843
- Get in and drive!
- Why me again?

439
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,227
- I have no idea! It won't go into gear!
- Are you nuts?

440
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,196
- The handbrake is on!
- What's wrong with it?

441
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,073
The handbrake!

442
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,864
- Shit! You're so aggressive!
- Go left.

443
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,279
- Yes, I know.
- Just drive!

444
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,995
Turn right.

445
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,329
See? He was a stripper.

446
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,045
- Oh, God! That wasn't him! It wasn't!
- Stop the car!

447
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,893
Oh, God! We can't just leave him there!
What if I've run him over?

448
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,974
Calm down. I'll go check.

449
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,936
- You stay here.
- Okay. Okay.

450
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,366
Come on. Move.

451
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,102
- Are you done?
- I don't know. Is he alive?

452
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,020
No, he's all crushed.

453
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,405
Tell her you're alive
or she'll puke all over my car.

454
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,400
- I'm still alive.
- Louder.

455
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,823
I'm still alive!

456
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,703
I'm so sorry I ran you over.

457
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,419
- You didn't.
- I didn't mean to. I even liked you.

458
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,920
Must've been a road bump. It wasn't me.

459
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,836
- I panicked...
- You didn't run me over.

460
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,381
- I've never done that before.
- Just a bump.

461
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,047
Enough!
Tie his hands behind his back.

462
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,973
But...

463
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,641
- Do it!
- He's a cop!

464
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,819
You have to do something
about your aggression problem.

465
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,569
You two a team?

466
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,117
- No.
- Why was she alone in the club then?

467
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,537
I told her that if she ran off,
I'd find her and kill her.

468
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,001
Find his cell.

469
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,674
I'm sorry. You're bleeding.

470
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,338
Yep.

471
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,638
Back left pocket.

472
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,061
Back left pocket!

473
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,773
You can't take a cop as a hostage!

474
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,905
Why is he on my case then?

475
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,736
Why is a cop on my case?

476
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,326
- Why all the shouting?
- So you can hear me!

477
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,446
There's no need to shout at me!

478
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,663
- How did you know we'd be there?
- I didn't.

479
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,172
- So you were there out of frustration?
- That's shockingly true.

480
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,083
I was just on patrol.

481
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,877
What's Kaiten like?
The task force boss.

482
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,548
You'll be meeting her soon.

483
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,395
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

484
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,316
Okay, then.

485
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,036
- Okay, then... Undress.
- Very well.

486
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,496
- Wait. I've nearly got it.
- Yeah, yeah. Calm down.

487
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,414
Okay.

488
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,822
Are you the brain or the body?

489
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,158
I haven't figured it out yet.

490
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,204
Am I the Hulk?

491
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,553
I know, darling. It won't take
much longer. I'll be home soon.

492
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,805
Hey! Don't cry.

493
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,177
I'll sing you a song.
What would you like me to sing?

494
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:46,400
I'll sing you the tramp song, okay?

495
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,770
<i>Are you all tucked in?</i>

496
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,731
<i>Okay.</i>

497
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:56,285
<i>Once I had my own house</i>

498
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,743
<i>Now the subtenants are throwing me out</i>

499
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,834
<i>I'm a rascal, a rascal
A slovenly rascal</i>

500
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,871
<i>I'm a merry tramp</i>

501
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,629
<i>Once I had my own bathroom</i>

502
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,841
<i>From now on
I'll be doing it in a bag, I presume</i>

503
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:19,350
<i>I'm a rascal, a rascal
A slovenly rascal</i>

504
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,433
<i>I'm a merry tramp</i>

505
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,388
You have to be careful now.

506
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,897
- Are you always so rough?
- I'm sorry.

507
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,936
- This might hurt.
- What might?

508
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,818
- Fuck!
- Vodka?

509
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,532
- Yes.
- Okay.

510
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,739
Okay.

511
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,828
- Will it even go through the skin?
- Move over.

512
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,955
- W hy'?
- Move away.

513
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,498
What are you doing?

514
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:33,711
Hey! Stop it!

515
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,634
- Untie me.
- Sit down!

516
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,299
Untie me!

517
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,551
You want to help her?
I'm trying to save you!

518
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,596
I'm

521
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,191
Can I have a sip?

522
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,530
- I hate cats.
- W hat?

523
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:02,369
My mother gave me a cat so I wouldn't
feel alone at night when she wasn't there.

524
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,497
She always bit my feet,
and every time I hid,

525
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,118
she'd scratch at the door. 80 creepy!

526
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,663
- I couldn't sleep until Mom was back.
- Where was she?

527
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,290
I told you. On the other side of the door.

528
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,252
- Oh, God!
- No. I meant your mother.

529
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,675
Oh! I have no idea. Looking for men.

530
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:25,093
- She thought that would fix her life.
- Maybe she didn't want to be alone.

531
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,103
Alone with you.

532
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,608
Oh, that's awesome!

533
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,570
Are you for real?

534
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,284
Why? It's great.

535
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,030
Please, don't...

536
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,097
Come on! Come on!

537
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,054
Come on! Come!

538
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,061
Come on!

539
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,988
Timmsen!

540
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:47,034
- You'll be the end of me.
- I can't reach Leine.

541
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:50,742
- What does he have to do with this?
- I checked his cell data.

542
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,248
Of course you did! Just like that.

543
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:58,333
He called and sent me a cryptic text.
"It's about your histage". I don't get it.

544
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,207
He never calls at night.
Something's wrong.

545
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,001
Yeah... He meant to write "hostage".

546
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,591
- What?
- He meant to write "hostage".

547
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:10,303
He mistyped it.
He meant to type an "0" instead of an "I".

548
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,893
- He was at "Desire' .Gatsky owns it.
- You mean "Desire" .

549
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,278
Okay...

550
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,986
Frank Gatsky.
He's in the club business.

551
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,824
He was in Luckau-Duben prison
between 2005 and 2009.

552
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,163
For robbery.

553
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,451
He specialized in robbing... jewelers.

554
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,850
We have to go.

555
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,027
Okay. Where to?

556
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,198
And him? Does he have to pee?
Do you have to pee?

557
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,781
Shake it well.

558
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,041
Franny!

559
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,512
Did you lay me on top of the cop?

560
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:38,603
- Should I be worried?
- What? No. I won't start anything with him.

561
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,892
- Why should I? You nuts? He looks like...
- Can I trust you or not?

562
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,902
- Yes, you can trust me.
- Good.

563
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,993
What do we need these for?

564
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,988
Did you think
we'd just sit and drink coffee?

565
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,783
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

566
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,911
- It's all too brutal.
- You wanted to come along.

567
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:05,001
- I don't even know how to shoot.
- I'll teach you.

568
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,210
Oh, right.

569
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,626
Got it. Yes.

570
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:13,926
Okay.

571
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,136
Okay.

572
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,179
Very good. Okay. Thanks.

573
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,561
No video surveillance at the gas station.

574
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,648
But we know what they bought.
If it was even them.

575
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,359
Plastic gloves,
bananas, cola, shoes, size 7...

576
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,740
Kinnert's size. They've checked.

577
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,370
- He gets to drive that and I get a Golf?
- What? Who?

578
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,957
Isn't it great?
We sacrifice our lives and drive VWs.

579
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,993
Mercedes. We drive a... Mercedes. It's...

580
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,587
Oh! Aren't we going to go inside?

581
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,227
Was he here yesterday?

582
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,275
Ingrid...

583
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:16,736
Tell us, or I'll stick it right in
and you'll be swallowing bullets.

584
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,283
Got something to say?

585
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,408
I don't understand a word.

586
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,327
He was at the bar
and then ran after Gatsky's ex.

587
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,205
- What's her name?
- Mel! That's all I know!

588
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,676
Mel. "Mel" like "Mel Gibson" or something?

589
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,634
-"Melanie"?
- Oh, Timmsen. You're so sweet.

590
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,773
Since we're talking, who's this Gatsky?

591
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,115
- Nobody.
- Your mom's a nobody.

592
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,152
Were you an item?

593
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:04,663
We get the diamonds and he gets his share.
50/50. That's the deal. Now, shut it.

594
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:05,997
-50/50?
- W hat?

595
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,872
- We do the dirty work and he gets 50%'?
- You're so clueless.

596
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,374
- And you can't negotiate.
- Shut up.

597
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,796
Okay, but I have
to do something first. Careful.

598
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,896
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

599
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,102
Is he being sprayed, too?

600
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,566
There was a hole.

601
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,488
Sorry.

602
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,697
Regarding that "nobody"...

603
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,371
Will he just let you 90
once you've given him his share?

604
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,163
- One can't leave such an association.
- Association?

605
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:57,211
- Gang, mafia... Whatever.
- He won't harm me.

606
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,058
Were you an item?

607
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:09,977
- It's complicated.
- Your mom's complicated.

608
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,228
- All that mom-talk is so awkward.
- Your <i>mom's</i> awkward.

609
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,979
I feel embarrassed for you.

610
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,276
- Your mom's embarrassed.
- His name is Frank and we were an item.

611
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,034
-50% is too much.
- You'll negotiate next time then.

612
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,123
Okay. Your mom's a chicken.

613
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,294
- I'm hungry.
- We only just ate!

614
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,798
What a wonk.

615
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,763
Yo! Melanie Rossbach.

616
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,681
Oh, yes. Of course. Listen up.

617
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,895
She was put into a home at five,

618
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,689
parents lost custody,
she didn't finish school, etc.

619
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,901
She worked for Gatsky
in one of his "security" companies.

620
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,153
- Is she in the system?
- No.

621
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:10,080
- Okay. You can leave now.
- Okay. Oh, she has a 5-year-old daughter.

622
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,373
Lucky kid.

623
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,460
I'll go check the workshop.
Can I leave you two alone?

624
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,008
Sure.

625
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,886
What?

626
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,974
Nothing.

627
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,386
What workshop?

628
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,479
Why are you still only on patrol?

629
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,189
Can I have some, too?

630
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,701
Sure.

631
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,887
What's your plan?

632
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,770
Got any gunshot wounds?

633
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,522
Is that why you're only a beat cop?

634
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,106
I don't talk about that.

635
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,910
Are you sad you're just a beat cop?

636
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,539
When this is over, want to meet up again?

637
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,005
We could go for dinner or to the movies.

638
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,011
I mean, what are your plans?

639
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,539
Hello.

640
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,554
He always does that.
When he drinks, then...

641
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,030
She doesn't talk to strange men.

642
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,582
Women can be bad, too, you know.

643
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,963
Yes, but I didn't like him.

644
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,470
Wait a sec.
Why don't you have the key on you?

645
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,009
- Hi.
- Detective Squad.

646
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,932
I'll call you back. Oh, God. Stop!

647
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,268
Bring in the forensic dudes.

648
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,688
Hello! You can't just...

649
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,525
Hello? Hello!
Have you even got a search thingy?

650
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,614
- Where's Ms. Rossbach?
- No idea.

651
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,367
How long have you been
looking after her kid?

652
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:16,784
What happened? I have no idea.
I'm having a mental blackout.

653
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,497
What's going on?

654
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,960
Don't touch me! Has something happened?

655
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,877
We met at the playground.
That was yesterday.

656
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,716
She paid me for looking after Holly.

657
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,768
Waiting for someone?

658
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,701
Are you going on holiday?

659
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:13,177
Did your Mom ask you not to tell anyone?

660
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,478
Will she be coming back?

661
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,445
Here's your frog.

662
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,834
I almost feel sorry for her.

663
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,175
So, she didn't mean it
and accidentally took a hostage?

664
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,886
- No, but take a look around.
- Quit winging.

665
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:03,512
Send her pic to every motel, hotel
and campground in and around Berlin.

666
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,090
How did you know I was here?

667
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,547
Relax. Let's go grab a bite.

668
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,467
Get in. Come on.

669
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,580
<i>A new dress? But why?
No one watches you on TV anyway.</i>

670
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,543
<i>I bought it so I could be prepared.</i>

671
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,624
We're out of candy.

672
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,381
There's some toffee in my pants.

673
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,843
<i>...a one-of-a-kind company.
Isn't that great?</i>

674
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,630
- There's some toffee in your pants?
- Yes.

675
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,339
Some toffee.

676
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,557
<i>I don't believe in horoscopes.</i>

677
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,686
<i>Yet, you believe that a girl in Playboy...</i>

678
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:34,273
- There's no toffee in there.
- And these are not my pants.

679
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:42,737
<i>Let's take a look at your horoscope.
When's your birthday?</i>

680
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,426
We've sat here before. Remember?

681
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:06,509
On these same seats.

682
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,596
This is where I first saw you.

683
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,726
That was a long time ago.

684
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,734
Made a decision yet?

685
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,660
I'll have your share tomorrow.

686
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,256
You think you can manage on your own.

687
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,182
Call home. The cops were there.

688
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,932
Enjoy your gin and tonic.

689
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,330
Fuck it.

690
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:32,520
- Untie my hands so I can use them.
- I like it like this.

691
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,026
We can run off together.

692
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:45,696
Untie me.
They all still think you're a hostage.

693
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,656
Do you always talk so much?

694
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,871
Seriously, now...

695
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,710
What will happen once it's over?
Think she'll take you with her?

696
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,634
I'm not in the mood anymore.

697
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:09,848
Sorry.

698
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,647
Okay, Kim. Who was there?

699
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:26,525
Kim, calm down. There's an envelope
with 1,700 euros in Holly's case.

700
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:30,198
Take Holly to Bim Bum Land
tomorrow morning with her case.

701
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,413
Repeat what I said. With her case.

702
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,701
Okay.

703
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,078
Put these on. We're off.

704
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,534
I didn't untie him.

705
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,292
- What are those for?
- He won't run.

706
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,460
Because you took his dick hostage?

707
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,460
- Why are you being so bitchy?
- What's the plan?

708
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,884
Quit it. This isn't
some sort of adventure trip!

709
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,846
Are you really taking her with you?

710
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,845
- Why are you so flustered?
- What is she to you?

711
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,188
- Is she your chicken?
- Chicken?

712
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,556
No, she's not.

713
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:45,528
- What chicken?
- To distract them and get shot instead.

714
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:50,282
- Am I your chicken?
- You're nothing to me. This was a mistake.

715
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:54,320
You don't know what it means to be needed.
You throw yourself at men.

716
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,790
Did your mom teach you that?
It's all mom's fault.

717
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,328
Why blame yourself?
You'd rather spend your life running.

718
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:02,666
That's right.

719
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,212
Ms. I've-Seen-It-All.
I'm not as stupid as you.

720
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:11,471
At least I put a condom on them
and don't have an abandoned child.

721
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,368
Hey, sweetheart. It's me.

722
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,371
Nice piece.

723
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,711
Know what one can do with it?

724
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,881
Give me the code to the safe.

725
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,141
You're quite a funny
pussy commando, aren't you?

726
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,266
Fuck, man! Are you nuts?
Are you crazy, you cunt?

727
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,564
- God! Stop it!
- The code.

728
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,274
I don't know it!

729
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,899
13-07-19-00! Shit! Fuck!

730
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,077
Shit! Oh, man!

731
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,914
- Why are they loose? Are they all there?
- Cunt!

732
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,165
- You've already called me that.
- You slut!

733
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:32,384
I'll get you! You cunt!

734
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,265
- Okay. At what time exactly?
-11 pm.

735
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,260
- Hey.
- Forensics are on their way.

736
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,182
They're useless, anyway.

737
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,944
They had pizza.

738
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,381
Stay calm. Stay calm.

739
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,343
I'm going to remove the tape now.

740
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:02,800
Don't scream.

741
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,665
You really think I'll let you go?

742
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,880
Hand over the diamonds.

743
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,111
"I'm big, strong Mel.
I can do everything alone.

744
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,275
I'm made of steel.
No one can help me.

745
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,529
Especially not someone
with a pussy name like 'Franny'.

746
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,743
My name is Mel, like Mel Gibson."

747
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,826
Oh, my God. What was that?

748
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,414
- What was that?
- Shit.

749
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,844
What happened to Mel?

750
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:31,722
Okay...

751
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,984
I'm unarmed.

752
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,235
- Nice and easy.
- Hands on the car.

753
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,420
We must go to her.
We have to get her out of there.

754
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,052
- When I say "now", start running.
- Okay.

755
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:03,383
Just run, okay? Now!

756
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,019
- You've been shot!
- Just a flesh wound. Come on.

757
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:17,814
Come on.

758
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:19,945
Behind that.

759
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,081
Come on.

760
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,420
Come on.

761
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,466
- Okay. Stay here.
- Okay.

762
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,089
Okay.

763
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,886
- Harry, she moved! I must go to her.
- Hey! Wait...

764
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,398
Get out of here! Go!

765
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:10,620
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

766
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,454
Where's your gun?

767
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,214
Where's your gun, Mel?

768
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:22,583
Fuck off!

769
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,176
Fuck off! Fuck off!

770
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,133
Fuck off!

771
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,508
Fuck off! Fuck off!

772
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,643
Fuck off! Fuck off!

773
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,609
Oh, God!

774
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,817
Screw it.

775
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,186
Is he dead?

776
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,148
He's dead.

777
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,990
He's dead. Do you hear me?

778
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:17,956
It's all over.

779
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,915
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Okay.

780
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,973
- You must pick Holly up from Bim Bum Land.
- What?

781
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,233
You must pick Holly up from Bim Bum Land.

782
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:56,492
Ingrid, it's Leine. There's been
a shooting at the abandoned power station.

783
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,374
I wasn't able to until now.

784
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:01,659
Come on.

785
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,373
Come on. Come on.

786
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,746
Come on. Come on. Come on.

787
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:08,291
Why explain now? Just come here.

788
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,129
Come on.

789
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:13,795
Hey! Hey! Hey!

790
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,343
What are you doing?

791
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,558
- I'm getting her out of here!
- No, you're not!

792
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,770
You were simply a hostage.
You can just walk away.

793
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,731
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong now?

794
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,773
We have to pick up her kid
from Bim Bum Land.

795
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,029
Bim Bum Land? What's Bim Bum Land?

796
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,191
We have to pick up her kid
from Bim Bum Land!

797
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,817
Put her legs in the car.

798
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,453
- Okay. Close the door.
- No.

799
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,749
I can't protect you anymore.

800
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,100
Shit!

801
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,853
This is just shit!

802
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:11,357
Timmsen!

803
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,152
Send their pictures to every hospital.

804
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,776
I want to know if two women ShOW up.

805
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,282
- They killed Gatsky?
- Self-defense.

806
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,998
- Are they working together?
- No idea.

807
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,162
Don't bullshit to me. Are they?

808
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,629
Who cares what I say?
You never listen to me.

809
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,586
What do you want from me anyway?

810
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,306
I'll call you back.

811
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,490
I need to get back to work.

812
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,924
- Happy shopping!
- I know.

813
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,846
- Shall I take your case?
- No.

814
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:36,985
She's coming out without the kid.

815
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,668
Are you hurt?

816
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,754
But a friend of mine is.

817
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,513
I need your help.

818
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:39,844
- What's up, pumpkin?
- Kinnert's mother... Isn't she a nurse?

819
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,676
Timmsen!

820
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,728
Give her one every six hours.

821
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,195
Keep an eye on the wound.
You need to keep an eye on it.

822
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:02,198
A doctor has to look at it.
By tomorrow. And Franziska, you...

823
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,714
Hey! Bingo!
An ambulance has gone missing!

824
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,133
Wait a sec.

825
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,348
- Hey, Timmsen.
- What is it?

826
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,225
- Give me your phone.
- Huh'?

827
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,478
Hey. I need you to do me a favor.

828
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:47,694
Franny?

829
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:49,616
Yes?

830
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,283
They know who I am.

831
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,702
You have to stop.

832
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:59,081
I'm not going to stop. Screw that!

833
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:03,423
I've got the diamonds.
We'll get Holly and we'll manage somehow.

834
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,382
I bet they've got Holly by now.

835
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:10,475
Oh, God!

836
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,682
Oh, God!

837
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:22,900
Oh, God.

838
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:34,874
<i>Highway 101 is closed off.
Get ready to raid the vehicle.</i>

839
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,043
Lower your weapons!

840
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:43,633
They have to lower their weapons!

841
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,628
Relax. They won't shoot.

842
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,107
- Franny'?
- Stop bugging me. I'm negotiating.

843
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,775
What are you doing?

844
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,739
Ingrid!
The call center received a call.

845
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,659
It's Kinnert
and she'll only speak with you.

846
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:19,043
We need a radio here, damn it!

847
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,095
- Ingrid von Kaiten. Who am I talking to?
<i>- This</i> is <i>Franz/ska Kinnert.</i>

848
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:31,723
<i>The hostage-taker wants to
talk to you alone in the ambulance</i>

849
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,592
<i>or she'll shoot me.</i>

850
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:01,832
I'm scared.

851
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,213
Your mom's scared.

852
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:31,783
And the mother is involved
in a police investigation?

853
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:36,155
- Yes, but that's all I can say.
- And, if I may ask...

854
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:39,704
No! You may not. That's the thing.

855
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:42,498
What are you staring at?

856
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:46,085
Yes! Men are fathers too!

857
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,046
Come along.

858
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,087
Awesome outfit, by the way.

859
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,813
- You can't go in alone!
- Leine.

860
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,271
Can I go in there alone?

861
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:15,615
- Yes.
- Anything else you want to tell me?

862
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,282
Be nice.

863
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,257
<i>Ingrid von Kaiten.
I'm unarmed and coming in.</i>

864
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,358
What's your ideal scenario?

865
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:00,409
What's yours?

866
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:14,837
Why isn't anyone saying anything?
We can't hear anything, damn it!

867
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,006
It was a stupid idea! Let's go in!

868
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:20,888
Leine!

869
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:23,512
Shit!

870
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:25,563
It's showtime, ladies.

871
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,817
Ready?

872
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:38,243
<i>- I</i> hear something!
<i>- There's a video.</i>

873
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,237
<i>He sent it to her, as a threat.</i>

874
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,323
Frank Gatsky?

875
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,665
Yes.

876
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:50,915
<i>I wanted out,
but he wouldn't let me go.</i>

877
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,629
He blackmailed her.

878
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,173
Into robbing the jeweler?

879
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:57,970
Yes.

880
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,433
<i>Let's go, Timmsen.
Just send the paramedics.</i>

881
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,896
What? Why?

882
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:16,694
I'll fill in the gaps in the story later.
You'll still have to be arrested.

883
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,280
Have a lovely evening, ladies. Bye.

884
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:27,163
There's nothing there for you.
You were right. I feel sorry for Rossbach.

885
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:30,545
- But they're all loose!
- Too bad for the insurance.

886
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,082
They were robbed. Isn't that funny?

887
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:45,806
Yippee ki-yay.

888
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:48,934
Motherfucker...

889
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,395
Thank you.

890
01:39:56,073 --> 01:40:00,032
Annett! Stop hiding.
You're taking over. I'm out of here.

891
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,995
SIX MONTHS LATER

892
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:11,809
Look who's here!

893
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,979
- Mom!
- Oh, my God! Come here!

894
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,819
You've grown so much!

895
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:21,531
- I missed you.
- Mom, I was here only yesterday.

896
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,320
- What's that?
- Why'?

897
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:28,614
- Are you for real?
- Yep.

898
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:32,459
Think I gave them all to Kaiten?
That's a bad deal.

899
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:36,371
I told you I never wanted
to see one again. Do you ever listen?

900
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:38,210
I earned it. I have needs.

901
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,921
- You're so annoying.
- Your <i>mom's</i> annoying.

902
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:42,711
Oh, my God!

903
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:44,178
I'll drive.

904
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,350
- Why did you even want them?
- To go to Sweden.

905
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:52,020
What? Sweden? Why Sweden?

906
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:55,349
- I wanted to build a campground.
- A campground?

907
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,187
- Yes.
- In Sweden?

908
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,398
- Yes.
- That's so corny.

909
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:03,440
- Your <i>mom's</i> corny.
- So corny.

910
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:05,029
Your mom's corny.
