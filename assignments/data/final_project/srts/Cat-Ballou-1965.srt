00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,459
<i>Well, now friends just lend an ear</i>
<i>For you're now about to hear</i>

2
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,652
<i>The ballad of Cat Ballou</i>

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,849
<i>It's a song that's newly made</i>
<i>And professor Samuel Shade</i>

4
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,575
<i>And the Sunrise Kid</i>
<i>Are singing it for you</i>

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,180
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,100
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,900
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,659
<i>It's a hanging day</i>
<i>In Wolf City, Wyoming</i>

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,737
<i>Wolf City, Wyoming</i>

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,140
<i>1894</i>

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,654
<i>They're gonna drop Cat Ballou</i>

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,532
<i>Through the gallows's floor</i>

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,092
<i>She killed a man</i>
<i>In Wolf City, Wyoming</i>

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,018
<i>Wolf City, Wyoming</i>

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,132
<i>Killed a man, it's true</i>

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,173
<i>And that is why they're hanging</i>

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,697
<i>Hanging Cat Ballou</i>

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,536
<i>She has the smile of an angel</i>

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,139
<i>Fights like the devil</i>

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,296
<i>The eyes of an angel</i>

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,979
<i>Bites like the devil</i>

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,650
<i>- The face of an angel</i>
<i>- I say she's the devil</i>

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,489
<i>She's mean and evil</i>
<i>Through and through</i>

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,298
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,331
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,055
<i>She's mean and evil</i>
<i>Through and through</i>

27
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,137
<i>Pray, Jezebel, pray</i>

28
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,052
<i>Pray, Jezebel, pray</i>

29
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,049
<i>If ye would seek salvation</i>

30
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,657
<i>Pray, Jezebel, pray</i>

31
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,890
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

32
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,577
<i>Pray, Jezebel, pray</i>

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,932
<i>If ye would seek salvation</i>

<i>Pray, Jezebel, pray</i>

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,459
<i>Cat, your time has come</i>

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,617
<i>As you stand on the brink</i>

37
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,936
<i>It's sure making you think</i>

38
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,216
<i>About your life...</i>

39
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,260
<i>of sin</i>

40
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,252
<i>How come they're now</i>

41
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,860
<i>Gonna hang you?</i>

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,500
<i>And how did you begin?</i>

43
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,459
Sumpqua!
All out for Sumpqua.

44
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,054
All aboard.

45
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,933
Catherine, you are on
the threshold of life!

46
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,656
You have graduated from my academy
with a first-rate education.

47
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,970
Equipped to deal with
the unhappiness...

48
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,978
and stupidity on every hand.

49
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,852
Remember: Teach as I taught you!

50
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,730
Oh, that man looks clean, at least.

51
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,819
This man is in my custody, and
I don't want nobody near him.

52
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,935
Don't look at him, Catherine!

53
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,893
Oh, a man of God.

54
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,852
Sir, would you look after her?

55
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,290
All aboard! All aboard!

56
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,728
Oh, Catherine!

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,733
You were a good student.
I know you'll be a good teacher.

58
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,009
I have to go.

59
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,699
Oh, Mrs. Parker!

60
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,980
Goodbye, darling.
Be a good girl.

61
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,689
She didn't introduce us.
I'm Catherine Ballou.

62
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,017
I'm drunk as a skunk.

63
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,450
I apologize for being
in this disgusting condition.

64
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,891
I assure you, I'll not inflict
myself on you further.

65
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,818
It's the first time in
my life I ever drank.

66
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,217
I took the pledge at
the big temperance meeting...

67
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,093
in Gratzburg, Montana.
You remember that?

68
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,977
It was a great outpouring
of the spirit...

69
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,898
and I'll not inflict myself
on you any further.

70
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,614
Thank you.

71
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Tennyson.

72
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,374
Spins a good yarn, does he, Tennyson?

73
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,219
He's a great poet!

74
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Poet?

75
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,940
May I?

76
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,574
"I stepped out of the
dark barroom...

77
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,857
into the street, where the
sun beat down unmerciful...

78
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,689
and Bent stood a-hollerin'
'Come on out, Kid Shelleen...

79
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,576
I'm gonna blow you clear out of
Tombstone and into hell!'

80
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,850
Tennyson is a good poet.

81
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,693
"Kid Shelleen and the Massacre
at Whiskey Slide."

82
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,534
Ma'am, I apologize for
my disgusting condition.

83
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,813
I assure you, I will not inflict
myself on you any further.

84
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,218
I wish I could do something.

85
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,092
You're very kind...

86
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,768
but I got here
all the help he'll need.

87
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,735
That's very true.

88
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,215
There's good in the Bible
for these times.

89
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Ain't there!

90
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,492
This berth next. If you'll
just step in the aisle.

91
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,178
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Sorry!

92
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,416
I reckon I'll never see you no more.
It's been a pleasure knowing you.

93
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,814
Goodbye.

94
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,854
Hallelujah, brother!

95
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,690
I am here to comfort the sinner
and return the stray lamb to the fold.

96
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,573
- Let him who's troubled...
- Got a match?

97
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,380
Go on.

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,813
Hallelujah, brother!

99
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,730
I am here to comfort the sinner and
return the stray lamb to the fold.

100
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,216
- Let him who's troubled, let him...
- Thanks.

101
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
You're welcome.

102
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,897
You was saying?

103
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,853
Hallelujah, brother!

104
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,132
I am here to comfort the sinner and...

105
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,372
And all like that.

106
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,053
Now just a minute, pilgrim.

107
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,054
All right. Come on in.

108
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,251
My poor fellow, are there any
particular verses you'd like to hear?

109
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,138
I told you.
He's about as religious as a hog.

110
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,059
There's bound to be something
in here to help him.

111
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,208
Keep every sheriff easy, move!

112
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,899
Hands over your head!

113
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,013
- Sure glad to see you, Uncle Jed.
- Likewise.

114
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,574
Keep him covered now.

115
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,452
Open wide!

116
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,418
All right. Come on now!
Handcuff him to the pipe.

117
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,175
Hit him! Hit him!

118
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Hit him!

119
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,850
Hold him! I'll hit him!

120
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,451
I'll cuff him to the pipe.

121
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Come on!

122
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,015
Let me have a gun!

123
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,609
- Didn't you take his?
- Didn't you?

124
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,977
He's gonna blast himself free.
Go ahead, jump!

125
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,334
Jump?!

126
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
What happened?

127
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,172
- He freed my prisoner.
- Who did?

128
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,814
That Bible-thumper that
was with the girl.

129
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,898
- That young lady in lower five?
- Yeah, that's her!

130
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,060
Please!

131
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,295
Right here.

132
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,297
Hey, you in there. Hey, girl!

133
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,209
Come on, miss, wake up! The
sheriff wants to talk to you.

134
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,736
Where'd the parson go?
Did you see him?

135
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,578
And my prisoner?

136
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,170
Maybe he's in the next car.
Come on!

137
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,418
I shouldn't have done that!

138
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,089
Oh, sure you should, honey.

139
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,530
No question about it
in my mind at all.

140
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,776
It was morally wrong.

141
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,537
But it happened so fast,
I didn't know what to think.

142
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,256
I was afraid he'd hurt you.

143
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,688
That's right!

144
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,972
You know,
he'd have blowed my head off!

145
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,289
What are you doing?

146
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,373
I got a catarrhal condition.

147
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,532
Well, you're too close.
Scoot back.

148
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,937
Don't think I was offering
unwelcome advances!

149
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,097
I put women on a pedestal, I do.

150
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Further.

151
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,819
I'm up against the side.

152
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,250
It's gonna get mighty uncomfortable!

153
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,451
You won't be here
long enough for that.

154
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,696
Get out of here
the moment it's safe!

155
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,379
That's what I'm anxious to do!

156
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,413
You think I care to stay
any longer than needed?

157
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,576
There are still people out there.

158
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Darn!

159
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,329
I guess I'll just have to stay put then.

160
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,179
Even though it goes
against my very grain.

161
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,729
You take your arm away this second!

162
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,057
I am supposed to be a schoolteacher!

163
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,091
I'll scream!

164
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,294
I was only gonna see
if the coast is clear!

165
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,011
There's gents out there with shotguns.

166
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,858
What are we going to do?

167
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,376
- You can't stay here!
- I hate shotguns, don't you?

168
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,577
I mean, they leave
such an oozy corpse.

169
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,528
But there's one chance
in 100 I can make it.

170
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,935
I'll take that chance
for your sake!

171
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,778
You a schoolteacher and all.

172
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,208
No, wait!

173
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,131
I'd rather get cut down in the
prime of my young manhood...

174
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,457
than risk compromising
a nice girl like you.

175
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,017
If they get me, though...

176
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,933
I want you should have
my watch and chain.

177
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,336
Oh, this is awful!

178
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,299
Ain't it though?

179
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,893
You get away!

180
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,534
I just gotta watch what's
going on, don't I?

181
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,015
I'll do the watching.
You get away!

182
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,457
I thought you were lying.

183
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,698
You mean I wasn't?

184
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,252
All right, let's get this one.

185
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,851
They're searching the berths.

186
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,651
What's your name
so I can vote for you?

187
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,134
Catherine Ballou.

188
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,614
Mine's Clay Boone.

189
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,050
Goodbye, Miss Ballou.

190
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,817
<i>Cat Ballou, she lived</i>

191
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,817
<i>In Wolf City, Wyoming</i>

192
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,215
<i>And folks here in Wyoming</i>

193
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,457
<i>Live high off the hog</i>

194
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,373
<i>That brand-new firm</i>
<i>Sears and Roebuck</i>

195
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,334
<i>Send them their catalogue</i>

196
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,010
<i>- It's an upright town</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

197
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,216
<i>- With kind, wonderful people</i>
<i>- Oh?</i>

198
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,251
<i>- Reliable people</i>
<i>- Sure</i>

199
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,452
<i>- Friendly as can be</i>
<i>- So they say</i>

200
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,379
<i>- When they say, "Howdy," they mean it</i>
<i>- Ha!</i>

201
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,693
<i>- Yep, they're neighborly</i>
<i>- Yep, yep, yep!</i>

202
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,937
<i>If only Cat had behaved</i>

203
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,971
<i>These folks would befriend her</i>

204
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,932
<i>If Cat had behaved</i>

205
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,937
<i>Their hearts they would lend her</i>

206
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,971
<i>But Cat was depraved</i>

207
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,818
<i>To hell now they'll send her</i>

208
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,649
<i>She could have lived like others do</i>

209
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,691
<i>Cat Ballou</i>

210
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,896
<i>Wicked through and through</i>

211
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,809
<i>They'll now be hanging Cat Ballou</i>

212
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,773
Papa, what happened?

213
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,655
- That corral used to be full of horses.
- I got tired of them.

214
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,057
I sold them all off to
the Army at Fort Huckaby.

215
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,297
You raised those horses
as much as you raised me.

216
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,049
You haven't painted
the house since I left!

217
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,739
I like it that way...

218
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,368
gray, weathered
and full of splinters!

219
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Papa!

220
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,173
Come on, honey.

221
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,568
This is my new bronco buster.

222
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,338
This is my daughter.

223
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,096
- <i>Shalom Aleichem,</i> Jackson Two-Bears.
- Why'd you say <i>Shalom Aleichem?</i>

224
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,252
I'm full Sioux Indian!
I'm not of the Chosen People.

225
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,132
Be stubborn if you want to.

226
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,695
- I ain't stubborn.
- Not much you ain't!

227
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,130
An ex-congressman of
these United States...

228
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,934
said at the
Chautauqua this winter...

229
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,079
Indians is the Lost Tribe.

230
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,209
- But he won't admit it.
- Just ain't true!

231
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,417
He was an ex-congressman
of these United States!

232
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,532
- Papa, maybe he was mistaken.
- Why no, he was not!

233
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,415
Jackson's just got a mean,
stubborn streak in him, is all.

234
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,011
I brought Mr. Bernstein, the telegraph
operator, out here last month.

235
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,211
And he stood right here...

236
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,417
and spoke Hebrew at
Jackson for 10 minutes.

237
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,492
And Jackson pretended he
didn't understand a word.

238
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,213
Now I call that stubborn!

239
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,172
I didn't understand a word!

240
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,859
You see what I mean?

241
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,692
Now you get that trunk out.
I'll get the satchel.

242
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,009
Jackson, what's happening?

243
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,129
Your old man's got
some roughshod ways.

244
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,370
He's rubbed people the wrong way.

245
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,930
He's a sweet old bear who's harmless!

246
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,779
Don't you think I know?

247
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,175
Nobody in this county
would give me a job.

248
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,770
As if I was responsible for
what happened to General Custer.

249
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,500
I swear, I was a little baby
at the time!

250
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
But your daddy...

251
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,651
he gave me a job right off.

252
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,532
Full wages too.

253
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,614
I guess I respect and admire
him more than anybody.

254
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,414
Then why? This used
to be the best spread.

255
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,417
A big outfit's moving in...

256
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,618
building factories...

257
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,574
to make a real city of Wolf City.

258
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,932
They want your daddy's water rights.
He won't sell them.

259
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,859
I'll build us lunch
once the trunk's inside.

260
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,369
I'm gonna do the cooking
now that I'm home.

261
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,411
I'm gonna take care of you.

262
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,459
Frankie Ballou?

263
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,699
Beat it, you.

264
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,692
I didn't mean to scream,
but he came outta nowhere!

265
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,813
And that nose!
Who is he, papa?

266
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,055
Give me a hand!

267
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,294
- Papa, who is he?
- Tim Strawn, I'll bet you.

268
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,209
You don't know nothing when I say
<i>Shalom,</i> but now you're a know-it-all!

269
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,739
Jackson, who is he?

270
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,296
He's a hired killer.
His nose was bit off in a fight.

271
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,449
If I was gonna be scared, I'd be
scared of the one who bit it off!

272
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,538
I can take care of myself.
Don't let it bother you.

273
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,459
- It don't bother me.
- You've gotta do something.

274
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,180
What we're gonna do
is go on living!

275
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,851
We're going to eat,
sleep and work...

276
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,258
and tomorrow we're going to
go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day.

277
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,575
Take care of the horses, Jackson.

278
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,060
Mabel!

279
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Well!

280
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,096
Now, there's a game for a sheriff.

281
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,938
Liar's poker!

282
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,577
Our unemployed are off the streets,
and the town's safe, all in one stroke.

283
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,492
They made Ed Cardigan sheriff.

284
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,375
- He's too lazy to steal and too dumb...
- Ballou!

285
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,172
Show respect for these ladies...

286
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,577
Take off your hat. You're meeting
my daughter, Catherine.

287
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,732
Damn, if it ain't little...

288
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,249
Talk to me any way you please...

289
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,980
but this is my daughter,
so watch your language!

290
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,378
Nice to see you back
in Wolf City, Miss Ballou.

291
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,932
You got any idea who forked
a ton of manure down my well?

292
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,494
Well, no.

293
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,611
"Well, no."

294
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,731
You're some sheriff!

295
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,459
Come on, Catherine!

296
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,978
Are you really a sheriff?

297
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,013
Why is it hard to believe?

298
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,616
Why don't you help him?

299
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,256
I think someone's poisoned
that water to drive him away.

300
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,258
Yesterday, a man named Strawn
came, threatening...

301
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,009
There are ramifications to peace
officing you wouldn't understand.

302
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,536
Now, please believe me.
I'm taking care of it my way.

303
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,612
What ramifications?

304
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,339
Don't worry your pretty little head.
Go and have a good time.

305
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,498
Jackson, am I mad!

306
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,849
I know.

307
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,290
I saw you talking to Sheriff Cardigan.

308
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,734
Just like Papa, he pats me on the
head and tells me to run along.

309
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,378
What am I gonna do?

310
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,258
They got a gunfighter.

311
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,691
You get a gunfighter.

312
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,376
Jackson, there's a funny,
inscrutable look on your face.

313
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,370
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me.

314
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,451
Nobody would bother your daddy with
Wild Bill or Bat Masterson around.

315
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,933
Come on, Jackson.

316
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,573
Come on.

317
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,580
- Who could I get?
- Kid Shelleen.

318
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,691
There really is a Kid Shelleen?

319
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,892
He's real and one of the best,
to my way of thinking.

320
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
What can I do?

321
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,058
Write him a letter.
I'll mail it.

322
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,568
- No call to dance with him.
- No call not to.

323
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,133
He's an Indian!

324
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,979
Scream!

325
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,180
I like Jackson.
You'll make trouble for him.

326
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,296
Look who's talking about trouble.

327
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,092
- Why are you here?
- Looking for you!

328
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,178
- But you're an outlaw.
- Got a price on my head!

329
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,531
Twenty-five dollars for Jed,
$35 for me.

330
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,014
I want to thank you for all
your help to my nephew and I.

331
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Where you staying?

332
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,778
On the run ma'am.
Hiding out in the crowd.

333
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,979
Won't inflict myself
on you any further.

334
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,289
- Have you got a gun?
- Sure do!

335
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,889
Come home with me.

336
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,216
- Say please!
- Please!

337
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,254
You dance so well.

338
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,020
Simple, to what we learn
on the reservation.

339
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,539
Buffalo dance...

340
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,139
rain dance...

341
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,213
war dance.

342
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,850
- Is a square dance like a war dance?
- This one is.

343
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,218
I wanna talk to you, Lo.

344
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,251
My name isn't Lo.

345
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,859
Wait a minute.

346
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Isn't it?

347
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,413
I thought it was " Lo...

348
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,019
the Poor Indian."

349
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,289
It's Custer's Last Stand all over...

350
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,615
with me in the middle.

351
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,497
Jackson, you all right?!

352
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
<i>Shalom!</i>

353
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,494
Attagirl, Mabel!

354
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,852
One, two and a right!

355
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,851
Mabel, my 6-foot dove!

356
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,495
My little schoolteacher.

357
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,930
I guess we showed them,
huh, kitten?

358
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,096
I got north. You take south.

359
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,300
- Where to?
- Straight ahead, on the sofa.

360
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,938
You think those freeloaders
are gonna stop Strawn?

361
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,928
They're gunmen. They got a price
on their head. They told me.

362
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,848
What a fine place, ma'am.

363
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,292
Nice living room.

364
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,613
Kitchen.

365
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,378
Back of the house.

366
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,689
Bedroom.

367
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,819
You sleep in the barn.

368
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,937
Thank you ma'am.
Always deeper in your debt.

369
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,259
What a good time I had today.

370
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,415
You always pucker before retiring?

371
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,532
Get out of here!
How did you get in here?

372
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Why?

373
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,257
If my father saw you,
he'd kill you.

374
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,055
You couldn't wake your father
with a 21 -gun salute!

375
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,494
Let's play spoon.

376
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,811
You are absolutely the most...

377
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,572
Well, I guess I figured wrong.

378
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Where you going?

379
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,530
To the barn. The horse snores,
but I've slept through worse.

380
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,889
Oh no, don't go.

381
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,176
No! Clay, I gotta talk to you.

382
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,979
We'll talk first.

383
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,175
I can't talk with you
sitting on the bed.

384
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
Try.

385
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,733
My father's a wonderful man.
Do you realize that?

386
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,169
I sure do.

387
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,776
They hate him!
They're trying to drive him out.

388
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,858
They put manure in his well,
made him talk to lawyers...

389
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,290
and they sent a gunman
to drive him off.

390
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,049
You're dreaming.

391
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,097
No, he's real.
I saw him!

392
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,209
I'll help you pack.

393
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,736
I suppose, to a man like you,
this little farm is just dirt.

394
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,532
To him, it's his whole life!

395
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,812
Let him dig in and fight like
a man. I'll help you pack.

396
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,610
You are absolutely useless.

397
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,096
You are absolutely right.

398
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,093
Look, why don't you hire
a gunfighter? They got one.

399
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,137
You always make that
little... in the mirror?

400
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,098
Where you going?

401
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,049
- The barn?
- Don't go!

402
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
What now?

403
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,690
Clay, I don't believe it when you say
you're useless and cynical.

404
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,933
Everybody has good in him...

405
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,888
no matter how depraved
and cowardly he thinks he is.

406
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,609
You know...

407
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,209
you are a sugarplum.

408
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,778
You better watch out.

409
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,690
There are lots who are as depraved
and cowardly as they think they are.

410
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,139
And one of them,
one of these days...

411
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,298
is gonna eat you right up.

412
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Evening, ma'am.

413
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,458
Air and moonlight sets the
bulls to talking for sure.

414
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
What do you want?

415
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,129
I wondered if we was
staying the night.

416
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,258
I'd take off my boots
before going to sleep.

417
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,371
I helped you before.
Will you help me?

418
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,013
Certainly ma'am, anything.

419
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,131
Stay here with us.

420
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,450
Somebody's trying to kill my father.

421
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,620
Jed...

422
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,460
We'll stay, ma'am,
to do what we can.

423
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,373
We don't need him then.

424
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,179
I think you do.

425
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,336
My uncle never shot at a man.

426
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,053
It's against his principles.

427
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Is that true?

428
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,093
Yes, ma'am, that's true.
Neither has he.

429
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,775
But we'll stay and do what we can.

430
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,931
As long as there ain't no trouble.

431
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,179
<i>Then there came to town</i>
<i>A gun deadly and frightening</i>

432
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,771
<i>A gun quick er than lightening</i>
<i>Fastest gun you've seen</i>

433
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,368
<i>It was the gun in the hand of</i>

434
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,334
<i>Steel-Eyed Kid Shelleen</i>

435
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,977
<i>Just one look at him</i>

436
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,370
<i>Had folks starting to booger</i>

437
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,292
<i>Wild, wild as a cougar</i>

438
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,652
<i>Proud and fierce and mean</i>

439
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,493
<i>There was no man who was tougher</i>

440
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,893
<i>Tough as Kid Shelleen</i>

441
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,257
<i>He had the eyes of a killer</i>

442
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,331
<i>Cold as the devil</i>

443
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,252
<i>The look of a killer</i>

444
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,217
<i>The look of a devil</i>

445
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,217
<i>The face of a killer</i>

446
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,217
<i>That man was the devil</i>

447
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,856
<i>Just wild and ornery and mean</i>

448
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,852
<i>Kid Shelleen</i>

449
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,772
<i>Kid Shelleen</i>

450
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,497
<i>The fastest gun you've ever seen</i>

451
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,531
Kid Shelleen.

452
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,256
You've had time to sleep it off.

453
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,133
Let me see what Cat
laid out 50 bucks for.

454
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,013
- What's holding you up?
- No gun.

455
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,977
All right. Go get it!

456
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,770
I hocked it, I think.
In St. Louis?

457
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,379
You drank up the whole
50 bucks she sent you?

458
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,372
Fifty bucks!
Look what you did to him!

459
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,539
You could've killed him with
50 bucks of whiskey all at once.

460
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,054
Fifty bucks!

461
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,455
How was I to know he was a drunk?

462
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,298
Go on and shoot, kid.

463
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,132
Bang away, old fellow.

464
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,577
You'd like a drink more than
a sharp stob in your eye.

465
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,571
He did it!
He missed the barn.

466
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,493
Sir, if I could just have
a nip to steady my hands.

467
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,338
I had the typhoid real bad.

468
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,737
I had a rough trip down here.
I didn't get no sleep.

469
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,976
If I had a little nip, you know...

470
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,614
Please!

471
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,977
You got the bottle you carry
to make the sheriff mad?

472
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,934
Give him some.

473
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,258
You're an Indian, ain't you?

474
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,329
It's all right. I got
nothing against Indians.

475
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,094
They was a breed
of men in the Old West!

476
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,537
But it's over for them,
like it is for the gunfighter.

477
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,858
Except we didn't get no reservation
or get taught how to weave rugs.

478
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,738
See you later, son.

479
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,254
It's all over in Dodge.
Tombstone too.

480
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,015
Cheyenne, Deadwood, all gone.
All dead and gone.

481
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,535
Last time I come through Tombstone...

482
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,177
big excitement there was the roller
rink they laid out over the OK Corral.

483
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,373
I used to work the <i>Buffalo Bill Show</i>
<i>and the Congress of Rough Riders.</i>

484
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,936
I've rescued stagecoach riders from
road agents and drunk Indians...

485
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,539
in the nick of time.

486
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,970
Twice a day.
Three times on Saturday.

487
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,733
Where'd it go?

488
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,531
You see a man with his eyes set...

489
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,010
and his head on a bias
and his teeth like a mule's.

490
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,576
He'd as soon hang your guts on
a fence as say, "Good morning."

491
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,138
He's a gunfighter.

492
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,058
Proud and feared of nothing...

493
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,536
because there ain't nothing
he gotta bow down to.

494
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,813
Every man tips his hat.
Every boy knows his name.

495
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,931
Ain't no place he ain't welcome.

496
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,928
When a gunfighter's around,
trouble naturally stays away.

497
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,569
Folks saying, "Hiya, Kid!"

498
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,253
"How you doing, Kid?"

499
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,418
"Come in for a pitcher
of milk and gingerbread!"

500
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,056
Or, "Come up here and cool
your heels. It's hot outside."

501
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,530
Because nobody don't make no fun...

502
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,537
of a friend of Kid Shelleen.

503
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,732
Miss Ballou!
I am here!

504
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,614
I never seen a man get
through a day so fast.

505
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,048
You leave him alone.

506
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,775
I ain't running no dude ranch
for misfits and unemployables.

507
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,811
You keep him away from me.

508
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,537
Where you going now, Kid?

509
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,932
Why, Miss Ballou,
you paid me $50.

510
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,450
I aim to stay and earn it.

511
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,736
He can sleep in the barn, Jackson.

512
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,333
It's my gun.

513
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,139
Mr. Shelleen?

514
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,412
Okay if I carry your valise?

515
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,891
Why, sure, kid.

516
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,819
I ain't got no cash.

517
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,854
No need to tip me, sir. It'll be
a pleasure to see you at work.

518
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,374
- How many in the opposition?
- Just one. Tim Strawn.

519
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,210
Well, waste not want not.
Where's that jug of yours?

520
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,298
Strawn. You sure?

521
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,692
Silver nose and all.

522
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,019
Let Shelleen do it.

523
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,057
Shelleen's in no condition...

524
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,613
He sure isn't.

525
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,414
Look, I'm counting on
all three of you.

526
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,458
Papa's gonna take chances,
and I can't let him.

527
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,259
- You gotta stick with him.
- Yes, ma'am.

528
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,779
No matter where he goes!

529
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,171
All right, you unemployables,
let's get the work done.

530
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,772
For the love of Mike!

531
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,017
A drunk in the bunkhouse,
and a circus following me!

532
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,733
Don't let him out of your sight.

533
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,771
Does Shelleen have tobacco?

534
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,017
- He'd set fire to the barn.
- He's sleeping it off.

535
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,733
Do you mind?

536
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,690
What do you boys think you're doing?

537
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,856
Cat said stick with you,
and stick it is!

538
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,016
She's crazy, I tell you!

539
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,897
Always has been.
She sees things.

540
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,328
Her mother was like that.

541
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,213
In the middle of the night,
she seen moon men...

542
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,258
creeping down the walls.

543
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Get away!

544
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,897
I could trip on you and get
trampled in the crowd.

545
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,130
Why was I cursed in my old age...

546
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,178
with a nutty daughter
and slack-twisted idiots?

547
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,531
Who's here to threaten me?
You see anyone over there?

548
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,139
Or there?

549
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,577
Or over that way?

550
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,689
You see anybody anywhere?

551
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,619
Now stand back and let me breathe!

552
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,730
Drop the gun belts.

553
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,412
You're a murderer!

554
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,740
You're gonna hang!

555
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,578
What is it?
What's wrong?

556
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,895
You killed my father!

557
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,055
That can't be.
He's been here all morning.

558
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
No, I saw him.

559
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,691
- He was in that rocker all morning.
- It's a fact.

560
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,089
Why do you say that?

561
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,134
Just telling the truth.

562
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,736
So that's the way it's gonna be.

563
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,009
Better get outta here.

564
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,813
Get her off of him.
Get her outta here!

565
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,850
Just a minute. Don't you do that!

566
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Put that gun away!

567
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,773
You stop it!

568
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,618
You won't make me cry.

569
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,651
You'll never make me cry.

570
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,218
<i>There are teardrops in her heart</i>

571
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,213
<i>But they can't make her cry</i>

572
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,409
<i>There are teardrops in her heart</i>

573
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,453
<i>But they can't make her cry</i>

574
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,131
<i>She's lost</i> all <i>the kin</i>
<i>That she's known</i>

575
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,888
<i>And the tears will turn into stone</i>

576
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,730
<i>All the teardrops in her heart</i>

577
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,458
<i>'Cause they can't make her cry</i>

578
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,811
<i>It's not very hard to grieve</i>

579
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,617
<i>When you're a little girl</i>

580
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,299
<i>It's not very hard to grieve</i>

581
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,817
<i>When you're a little girl</i>

582
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,937
<i>But they made a little girl feel</i>

583
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,813
<i>like a woman made of steel</i>

584
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,095
<i>makes no difference how they try</i>

585
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,453
<i>They'll never...</i>

586
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,057
<i>make her...</i>

587
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,420
<i>cry</i>

588
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,533
- You're on private property.
- Get out of my way!

589
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,451
What have you done to him?

590
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,016
- Why is he smiling like that?
- That was hard, little lady.

591
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,256
My father never smiled like that.

592
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,020
He'll smile on now, forever,
just as you see him.

593
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,974
Free from Wolf City's
Development Corporation.

594
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,173
- You rat! Get out!
- Have respect for the dead!

595
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,535
We dug a grave behind the barn.

596
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,171
We'll stay to make sure
you leave before morning.

597
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,575
All right, you take the ranch.

598
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,736
I don't want it, now that he's gone.

599
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,052
But you tell Wolf City...

600
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,570
I'll make Sherman's March
look like a bird walk.

601
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,255
Ma'am?

602
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,820
She ain't got no place to go, Clay.

603
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,215
We'll take her with us.

604
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,496
Are you tetched?
We can't take her there.

605
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,930
- Where?
- Hole in the Wall.

606
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,369
Hole in the Wall.

607
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,936
It's no place for school teaching.

608
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,532
Besides, we don't even know
if they'll take us in.

609
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,777
Of course they'll take us.
It's for outlaws, isn't it?

610
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,017
You just need a price on your head,
and you've got that!

611
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,813
We sure do.

612
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,296
It's all settled.
I'm coming with you.

613
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,935
I'm loaded for bear.
Let them come.

614
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,849
Anybody wanna try on Frankie Ballou,
gotta take Kid Shelleen.

615
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,733
Mr. Shelleen, don't you
see what's going on?

616
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,012
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

617
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,774
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frankie</i>

618
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,732
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

619
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,170
<i>So that mournful day</i>

620
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,416
<i>Became part of a legend</i>

621
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,690
<i>The real start of a legend</i>

622
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,699
<i>Known as Cat Ballou</i>

623
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,170
<i>They'll never make her cry</i>

624
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,540
<i>The day the law filled her heart</i>

625
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,298
<i>With a hate that grew</i>

626
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,129
<i>makes no difference how they try</i>

627
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,696
<i>They'll never make her cry</i>

628
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,296
<i>When you have no tears</i>

629
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,531
<i>Then you've gotta have something</i>

630
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,776
<i>Hate really is something</i>

631
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,257
<i>Blood is what you need</i>

632
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,291
<i>They'll never make her cry</i>

633
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,013
<i>And Cat Ballou made her mind up</i>

634
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,492
<i>To make this country bleed</i>

635
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,454
<i>makes no difference how they try</i>

636
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,290
<i>They'll never make her cry</i>

637
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,010
I smell a water hole!

638
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,169
Hi, honey!
How about a little bubbly?

639
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,098
Later, sister.

640
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,774
Bartender!

641
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,537
Hello in there!

642
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,612
I want a drink!

643
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,419
What's all the...

644
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,133
Shelleen!

645
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,934
Think of that, Hedda!
It's Shelleen!

646
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,738
Cassidy!

647
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,051
What happened to you?

648
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,616
Calvary, Pinkertons...

649
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,697
The West has changed.

650
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,289
For us, business is lousy.

651
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,374
If we didn't have a price on our
heads, we'd get out of this hole.

652
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,938
Why don't we have a drink
for old time's sake?

653
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,934
"Old time's sake" means you
got no cash. Nothing doing.

654
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,933
Hold these for me
till I get some money.

655
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,539
Please, Cassidy!

656
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,057
A matched brace of pistols
with carved pearl handles.

657
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,969
Sentimental value alone, they're
worth 5 or $600 each.

658
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,058
Them ain't pearl-handled.

659
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,330
And they ain't your guns.

660
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,140
Anyways, no good no more, Kid.

661
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,178
Nobody cares.

662
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,974
Well, uncle...

663
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,216
I guess we'll go
back into business.

664
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,570
Remember the Herefords
in Yatrona County?

665
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,452
Anybody for buying a round?

666
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,088
You'll need more than just two of us.

667
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,293
What about you, Jackson?

668
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,891
You being an Indian and all. You just
gonna go back to living off the land?

669
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,696
You fooling? You try living in the
mountains with only a stone ax.

670
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,297
We'll all amble over to Yatrona
County and help ourselves to...

671
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,853
50 head.

672
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,488
Fifty head! That's big!

673
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,260
- I'll drink to that!
- Then it's all settled.

674
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,420
Wait a minute!

675
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,094
You got something to say
about our plan?

676
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,813
I'm against it.

677
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,536
I understand your objection to
rustling, a girl with your upbringing.

678
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,453
- It's the only way to raise money.
- No, it's not!

679
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,131
What do you think we ought to do
that's fitting and proper?

680
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,859
Rob a train.

681
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,010
That butcher, Eggers,
he'll take 35 head...

682
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,017
and butcher them himself.

683
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,131
What about what I said?

684
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,132
Look, this is the <i>Wolf City</i>
<i>Tribune</i> of two days ago.

685
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,332
"200 workingmen stand
ready for work on Monday...

686
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,134
on the largest slaughterhouse
outside Chicago."

687
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,217
What's that got to do with a train?

688
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,174
Workingmen gotta be paid, right?
There's gonna be a payroll coming.

689
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,009
- That's maybe 1000, $2000?
- I will drink to that!

690
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,609
- Can't hold up no train.
- Why not?

691
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,378
- Lots of reasons.
- Name them.

692
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,889
We're not robbers.

693
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,694
If you didn't try new things,
there'd be no progress.

694
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,050
Look, you're outta your mind!

695
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,171
Squeeze blood outta
them in your dreams!

696
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,779
Build your life anew.

697
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,609
This studying on revenge is
turning your back on the future...

698
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,936
and letting the past
eat at your heart.

699
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,051
They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.

700
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,491
We can use Shelleen's own plan
for train robbery.

701
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,539
My plan?

702
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,139
"Chapter Seven."

703
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,253
"The Whiskey Slide and
Tuskegon railroad had a car...

704
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,052
that was bandit-proof.

705
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,615
That was a challenge
and a matter of pride...

706
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,176
to see that it was robbed."
And so on and so on.

707
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,138
That plan!

708
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,653
All right!

709
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,292
You all say you love me
and are beholden to me.

710
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,809
"Take it easy.
We'll take care of you!"

711
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,292
The first time I ask you to do one
thing for me, like rob a train...

712
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,057
Listen, Miss Ballou!

713
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,177
Some gang!

714
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,929
A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken
gunfighter, a sex maniac...

715
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,573
and an uncle!

716
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,531
Now look here...

717
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,609
Clay Boone's gang of chicken rustlers.

718
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,498
I'm gonna do it alone!

719
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,452
Hey, did we say no?

720
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,856
Quit your crying.
We'll do it!

721
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,175
- You will?
- This is the last thing. Crazy dame!

722
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,773
That plan?

723
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,410
What in the blue-eyed world?

724
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,453
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd about that?

725
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,332
I'm looking for the baggage car.

726
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,451
Well, it's the other way, man!

727
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,930
- Pull those drapes! I'm freezing!
- Yes, sir.

728
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,414
Much obliged!

729
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,895
More water, more water.

730
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,088
Here she comes!

731
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,255
Come on, we got a job to do.

732
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,300
Do we!

733
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,420
My word!

734
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,452
Hey, let me outta here!

735
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,533
He's alive!

736
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,338
We gotta let him out!

737
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,849
What happened?

738
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,573
Put up your hands!

739
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,460
Keep them up!

740
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Let me in!

741
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,969
- Who's in charge?
- I am.

742
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,499
What's the delay?

743
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,815
It's a train robbery.

744
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,892
Get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.

745
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,492
Here's the safe.

746
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,294
Okay, you, open up!

747
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,620
Nope.

748
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,139
Come on now! Open it!

749
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,774
- I got a gun.
- You'll just have to use it.

750
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,611
- What are we gonna do?
- I told you this could happen.

751
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,620
What's wrong?

752
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,978
He won't open the safe.

753
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,295
That right, mister?

754
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,448
7 left, 26 right, 14 left.

755
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,979
This is more than the
$2000 you said.

756
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,815
Nearer 40 or 50,000, I'd say.

757
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,809
We take this, they'll
booger us forever!

758
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,369
Who's afraid of a little booger?

759
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,537
I give up! Hand me a towel!

760
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,131
- Come on, jump.
- Jump?!

761
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,014
Let's get outta here!

762
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,895
We did it! My little gang
of sweet outlaws!

763
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,295
The messenger seemed like a nice man.

764
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,331
Shelleen, it was a great plan!

765
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,729
Yeah, we're just like clockwork.

766
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,293
You sure?

767
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,134
I am so proud of you!

768
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,774
It's just beginner's luck.
We gotta get moving.

769
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,898
- Clay's right.
- Ask him how we'll get outta here.

770
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,977
You escaped in that book, right?

771
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,978
Of course he did!
You darling, Shelleen!

772
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,849
We ride out separately
in case they track us.

773
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,052
We'll mix up our trails and
meet at Hole in the Wall.

774
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Right!

775
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,094
Come on, boy!

776
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,132
Stupid beast!

777
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,260
Damn!

778
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,255
<i>It took a crafty female brain</i>

779
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,530
<i>To stage the holdup of a train</i>

780
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,095
<i>She planned it to the last detail</i>

781
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,733
<i>Until it couldn't fail</i>

782
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,855
<i>This dash and daring desperado</i>

783
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,290
<i>Lead her gang with cool bravado</i>

784
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,695
<i>They would follow where she lead</i>

785
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,413
<i>They made the country bleed</i>

786
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,730
<i>Round and round and round they went</i>

787
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,090
<i>Till man and gal and beast were spent</i>

788
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,256
<i>Round and round and round they rode</i>

789
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,212
<i>Oh, what an episode!</i>

790
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,136
Cassidy, cut your throat!
We robbed old Number Seven.

791
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,819
Drinks on the house!

792
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,295
Hedda, you old heifer.
We got money!

793
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,095
The train guard, hair all over
6-foot-5 of him, praying:

794
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,768
"Kid, Kid, please don't kill me!"

795
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,330
Everything went slicker than...

796
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,815
- Where are those kids?
- Ain't been seen.

797
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,453
Will you lend me a bullet?

798
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,580
You remember me? Old...

799
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,220
Old...

800
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,618
I'm telling you, Cassidy...

801
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,850
they're coming with the payroll.

802
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,936
It was just like old times.

803
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,375
Money, money, money for a rainy day!

804
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,735
They are here! Cut your throat!

805
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,692
Help me clear this table.

806
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,052
Get it out there.

807
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,533
Where you two been together all alone?

808
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,260
- Losing that posse.
- Was he bothering you?

809
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,651
No siree bob!
His uncle Jed was right on the job.

810
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,693
- Old Steel Eyes is jealous!
- You got no respect!

811
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,539
Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you.

812
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,770
What's the matter with you two?

813
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,689
Give the old man a drink.

814
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,936
There's more where that came from.

815
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,536
You mean it? He really did do it?

816
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,651
We did it, Mr. Cassidy.

817
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,460
My gang!

818
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,853
It's just the beginning.
We'll wipe out Wolf City!

819
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,051
You help me and I'll make you rich.

820
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,536
"Wolf City Development."

821
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,688
"Property: H. Percival."

822
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,331
- She stole their payroll, Hedda.
- Of course.

823
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,215
You ever hear of
Mr. Sir Harry Percival?

824
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,776
He owns Wolf City Development,
which owns Wolf City...

825
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,618
which lets us alone.

826
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,813
We don't bother them nor Sir Harry
Percival, and they don't bother us.

827
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,413
Sir Harry Percival.

828
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,253
That's the man I should be after.

829
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,337
How you gonna find him?

830
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,615
You won't help us?

831
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,214
Cut our own throats?

832
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,938
Hole in the Wall's impregnable.

833
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,893
No such thing.

834
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,455
It's more trouble than we're
worth to dig us out.

835
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,173
Now you made it worthwhile!

836
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,532
Some gang of cutthroats
and murderers.

837
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,815
We whispered your names
when we were kids...

838
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,250
scared to say them out loud.

839
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,940
How sad.

840
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,018
You got old.

841
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,698
Count out the shares.

842
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,050
Give them all drinks on Cat Ballou.

843
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,256
Some schoolteacher! Cat's College
of Bust Them in the Nose!

844
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,889
What was that for?

845
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,451
I think we'll go to St. Louis.

846
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,333
St. Louis?

847
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,172
City on the Missouri...

848
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,690
end of the Santa Fe,
jump off of the Oregon Trail.

849
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,777
Produces beef, beer, shoes...

850
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:11,980
and good times.

851
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,140
But why?

852
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,896
We got the money. Why wait till
they come looking for it?

853
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,859
They're where we want them.
They're desperate!

854
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,738
They're desperate?

855
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,212
Let's go to St. Louis.

856
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,052
I think I love you.

857
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,892
There you go, all serious
all of a sudden.

858
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:48,252
You're like all the rest of them,
you gotta be in love.

859
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,371
Come on! Don't be so serious!

860
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,170
You're nothing like you think you are.

861
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,614
How's that?

862
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,731
Cowardy custard.

863
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,290
You're selfish and a little stupid.

864
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,690
But you're not cowardly at all.

865
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,418
Well, I mean...

866
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,737
when you admire a man,
you just go all out.

867
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:13,649
Love is not blind. I see
all your faults, and I don't care.

868
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,054
I love you anyway!

869
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,694
Love! I was gonna take
you to St. Louis!

870
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,334
Just throw our hats in the air.

871
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,815
Now I don't know.

872
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,330
Trouble's coming,
and not just from them.

873
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,693
Where else do you see it?

874
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,219
Right there...

875
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,055
in those big blue eyes.

876
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,736
Ain't gonna get tied down
with no girl. No, I'm going.

877
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,417
You know, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

878
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,814
What do you care?

879
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:00,296
My death's hardly gonna cause
a ripple in St. Louis.

880
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,129
I'm leaving.

881
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,692
I never promised to be
no hero, did I?

882
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,694
You're no hero,
so don't worry about it.

883
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,729
You've no right to think
what you do about me.

884
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,493
Why don't you just go?

885
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,180
Bye!

886
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,931
What's happening?

887
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,094
It's ghost sickness.

888
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,696
It's Indian religion, see.

889
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:56,290
We believe what the gods did when
they made a man crazy was...

890
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,979
make him fall in love.

891
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,812
Well, that's very poetic.

892
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,771
What's it got to do with us?
Who's in love with who?

893
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,138
With "whom."

894
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,577
That's another question.

895
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,978
What am I gonna do?

896
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,816
Ain't much you can do about us.

897
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,935
I reckon I'll see you later, ma'am.

898
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,049
What about you?
You'll stay, won't you?

899
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,895
I get a kick out of being on
the winning side for a change.

900
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,737
Sir Harry wants his money, fast!

901
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,691
If you wasn't a girl...

902
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,330
I'd split you like a chicken.

903
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,700
Jed!

904
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,094
What do you want, Cat?

905
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,570
That man with the silver nose
was here. He's gonna kill me.

906
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,128
Strawn!

907
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,172
You know that valise of mine?

908
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,892
You go find it.

909
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,739
Get a case of cartridges from Cassidy.

910
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,736
We'll always be here with you, ma'am.

911
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:44,856
It'll be all right, Cat.
Everything's gonna be okay.

912
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,612
What's in this?

913
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,700
Want a drink?

914
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,369
No booze.

915
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,050
Hello, Kid.

916
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,698
Long time.

917
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,460
Sit down.

918
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,971
Where you been keeping yourself?

919
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,932
You want a job?

920
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,254
Some money?

921
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,975
Not money and not a job...

922
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,329
What then?

923
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:07,780
That!

924
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,813
There never was any love
lost between us.

925
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,660
Well?

926
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,779
I can't.

927
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,653
Why not?

928
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,575
A gunfight.

929
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,209
Oh, it was just swell!

930
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,134
Just the way I figured it'd be.

931
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,772
Even when we was kids, he'd sneak
behind some kid and back shoot them.

932
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,379
I know this, see.

933
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:03,413
So when I walk in, I gab with him.

934
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,339
I figure to call his shot
when I turn my back.

935
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,371
He don't even believe it's me.

936
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,010
He thinks I'm still on the booze
like last time in Tombstone.

937
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,495
When was that?
Ten or 12...

938
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,009
How that booze will do your mind!

939
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,257
Fog your mind so you can't
remember a darn thing.

940
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,814
It was just fine.

941
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,380
You and Strawn use to play
when you were children?

942
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,137
He was my brother.

943
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:36,495
It's like that time in Tombstone
when he made me walk...

944
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,658
stripped down to only
my long-handles and my hat.

945
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,335
I took him just like
the dime novel says.

946
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,570
It was just fine.

947
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,976
Kid, your own brother?!

948
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,332
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.

949
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,578
- Old Steel Eyes brought the roof down!
- Hold it!

950
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,010
Half of Wolf City's
on the way up here.

951
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,290
We'll take them like the last time.

952
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,459
Now they got 50 of that Englishman's
goons, and more are coming!

953
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,888
Sir Harry Percival!

954
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,660
He owns Wolf City Development.
He's here himself!

955
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,259
What do they look like?

956
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,500
Are they professional men
or barroom sweeps?

957
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,577
Now you just stop and concentrate...

958
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,850
because you are
scared and confused.

959
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,170
Big men!
Dutchmen from Pennsylvania...

960
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,455
Pols from Chicago...

961
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,776
Swedes from Dakota.
Hard!

962
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,096
With Strawn dead, they're
just barroom sweeps.

963
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,939
Strawn was just a hired hand.
This is an army!

964
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,778
And I'm taking you with me.

965
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,572
Are you sure it's him?

966
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,975
That Englishman wants a fight?

967
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,569
We'll give him the
biggest gunfight ever.

968
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,179
He wants to die!

969
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,770
I've done everything.
There's no place I want to go back to.

970
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,015
It'll be history.

971
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,220
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.

972
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:51,133
You old bag of guts.
You'll get her killed too.

973
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,808
It's better than dying
in some dirty hotel.

974
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,808
I always feared dying in the gutter
with a bellyful of booze.

975
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,056
Then Cat came along.

976
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,616
There's still places I want to see
and things I want to do.

977
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,418
I don't want to die.

978
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,852
Now you're making sense!
Let's go to St. Louis.

979
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,176
You don't ever change, do you?

980
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,338
Not St. Louis?
How about Sioux Falls?

981
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,939
Or any place!

982
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,654
You afraid someone will
see you with me?

983
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,578
I'll even marry you!

984
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,740
Marry me!

985
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,214
That's what I said.

986
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,376
If that's what I gotta
do to save you...

987
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,580
I'll do it!

988
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,176
Of all the self-centered,
egotistical things I ever heard!

989
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,178
Why do men think marriage
is the only thing we want?

990
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,894
Why don't you go fight
or wash your socks?!

991
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,411
I've been studying on it.

992
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,929
And now I'm beginning to see.

993
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:59,096
She loves you. Not me.

994
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,259
Come on now, Steel Eyes.

995
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,974
And you, all the time laughing at me.

996
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,572
Silly old man looking
after that young thing.

997
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,656
- I'm gonna see you do the right thing.
- Right thing?

998
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,335
Guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs...

999
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,610
all the same to me.
The same to you?

1000
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,935
What're you saying?

1001
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,700
- Marry her!
- I will, but she don't want me!

1002
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,811
Don't listen to her! Marry her!

1003
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,897
I'm telling you, she won't marry me!

1004
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,610
First, you can't stand to get hit.

1005
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:37,132
But you can take it because the blood
don't matter, and you're gonna live.

1006
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:40,377
It's a great gift I'm giving you,
to know it don't hurt.

1007
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,809
Fight!

1008
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,497
I'm gonna straighten you out
once and for all!

1009
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,816
Leave him alone!
I'm beating up on him.

1010
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:57,973
He's my kin! His morals have been
a millstone around my neck!

1011
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,373
What was that for?

1012
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,768
Everybody else did it.

1013
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,211
I got a right to, without
regard to race, creed or color...

1014
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,331
according to the 14th Amendment.

1015
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:15,248
Can I have my store back,
now that she's going?

1016
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,690
It's Cat. Where's she going?

1017
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:24,334
Sir, a consolation from the town.

1018
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,092
Sir Harry Percival, I presume?

1019
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,780
Really!

1020
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:41,179
Roughing it on the frontier, what?
Delightful!

1021
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,850
You like our wide open spaces.

1022
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:52,091
Positively charming, lovely country
and lots of fresh air.

1023
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:55,093
I'm getting frightfully
healthy, you know.

1024
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:59,656
It's just simply gorgeous!

1025
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,133
Simply gorgeous.

1026
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,412
Don't let anybody ever
tell you different.

1027
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,570
Look at that!
A painting on the ceiling.

1028
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,778
Yes, that's a Tintoretto.

1029
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,733
- I'll say it is.
- Do you like it?

1030
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:20,728
I think it's even more gorgeous
than the girl above Paige's bar.

1031
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,818
And that's the most
gorgeous thing I ever saw.

1032
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,730
My name's Trixie.

1033
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,976
Oh, Trixie!

1034
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:42,293
May I offer you something
to drink, Trixie?

1035
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,609
What would you like?

1036
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,890
Bubbly, if you got.

1037
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,738
Champagne, Hansen!

1038
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:52,059
They told me you had a wine cellar,
but I didn't believe it.

1039
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,890
Hardly a cellar.
A bin actually, in the pantry.

1040
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,575
I never did see a train
like this before.

1041
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,855
This is the master bedroom.
Do you approve?

1042
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,937
Oh, it's swell!

1043
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,700
A regular Tintoretto.

1044
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,737
Do you like the bed?

1045
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,619
Oh, do I like the bed!

1046
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,650
That will be all, tonight.

1047
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,053
A little wine with music.

1048
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:30,215
Nineteenth century science...

1049
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,537
Stone Age atmosphere...

1050
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,810
caveman passion!

1051
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,609
My wallet is in the top drawer.

1052
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,731
You won't get away with this, Trixie.

1053
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,972
My name isn't Trixie, Sir Harry.
It's Catherine.

1054
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,693
I'm Frankie Ballou's daughter.

1055
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,129
So you're Cat Ballou.

1056
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,700
Sign this.

1057
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,620
What is it?

1058
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,370
A confession that you
hired Tim Strawn...

1059
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,856
and are responsible for
my father's murder. Sign it!

1060
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,011
And if I refuse to sign it?

1061
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,459
I'll kill you.

1062
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,931
Now why do I doubt that?

1063
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,178
Don't you doubt it, Sir Harry.

1064
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,455
But I do.

1065
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,732
I don't think you have
it in you, Miss Ballou.

1066
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:27,939
Give me that gun.

1067
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,256
Well, it's time.

1068
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,858
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.

1069
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,608
Waiting?

1070
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,135
Looking forward to it, I might say.

1071
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:29,096
I'm sorry they don't like me.

1072
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,932
You can't blame them, can you?

1073
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:36,099
Killing Sir Harry put the kibosh on
the whole slaughterhouse, right?

1074
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,894
No jobs. No payroll.

1075
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,850
You took the bread out of
half the mouths of Wolf City.

1076
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:46,538
You haven't got any friends.
Ready, reverend?

1077
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,856
Hallelujah, brothers!

1078
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:53,212
I am here to comfort the sinner
and return the stray lamb to the fold.

1079
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:57,174
Let them what's troubled,
what's vexed of mind, take heart.

1080
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:00,491
There are many good things
in the Bible, sister.

1081
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,292
Indeed there are.

1082
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:05,732
It's a better world,
we're all bound for.

1083
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,170
Where trouble don't
come around, sister.

1084
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,371
And earthly care is forgotten.

1085
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:14,459
Green pastures await the tired
sinner, and honey flows like water.

1086
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,412
What a time for you
to fall off the wagon.

1087
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,455
Look at your eyes!

1088
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,656
What's wrong with my eyes?

1089
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,738
They're red, bloodshot.

1090
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,293
You ought to see them from my side.

1091
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,539
We're counting on you.

1092
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,293
Quiet, please! Quiet!

1093
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,660
Quiet!

1094
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,208
If you have any last words,
say them now.

1095
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:46,939
Let's get on with it.

1096
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:52,377
By the authority vested in me,
this hanging will proceed.

1097
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,697
Thank you, sheriff.
God bless you!

1098
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,331
Go, Jackson! Go!

1099
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:32,739
Where's Shelleen?

1100
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,690
<i>So she rode away</i>

1101
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,731
<i>Just where now is a mystery</i>

1102
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,817
<i>But Cat rode into history</i>

1103
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,337
<i>And her legend grew</i>

1104
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:30,259
<i>She was the queen of the outlaws</i>

1105
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:33,418
<i>Her Highness Cat Ballou</i>

1106
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:41,456
<i>Well, our story now is through</i>

1107
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:50,415
<i>We'll say farewell to Cat Ballou</i>

1108
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,301
