1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,071
Merry.

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,712
No!

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,789
No!

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,309
With a sigh

5
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,029
You turn away

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,034
With a deepening heart

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,751
No more words to say

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,356
You will find

9
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,354
That the world has changed

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,479
Forever

11
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,635
And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,480
And the sun is now fading

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,988
I wish I could hold you

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
Closer

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,669
Merry!

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,156
Merry!

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,792
Merry.

18
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,354
Merry, it's me.

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,359
It's Pippin.

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,955
I knew you'd find me.

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,269
Yes.

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,591
Are you going to leave me?

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,758
No, Merry.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,150
I'm going to look after you.

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,713
Hands off!

26
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,917
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

27
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,153
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

28
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,315
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

29
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,069
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

30
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,638
The scum tried to knife me.

31
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,472
Kill him!

32
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,391
That's for Frodo!

33
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,796
And for the Shire!

34
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,276
And that's for my old Gaffer!

35
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,757
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

36
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,356
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

37
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,992
Not if I stick you first.

38
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,639
Sam!

39
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,436
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

40
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,556
Sorry for everything.

41
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,555
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

42
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,473
They've taken it. Sam...

43
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,673
...they took the Ring.

44
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,994
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

45
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,596
I thought I'd lost you.

46
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,598
So I took it.

47
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,711
Only for safekeeping.

48
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,592
Give it to me.

49
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,116
Give me the Ring, Sam.

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,794
Sam.

51
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,197
Give me the Ring.

52
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,308
You must understand.

53
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,432
The Ring is my burden.

54
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,630
It will destroy you, Sam.

55
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,557
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

56
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,398
We best find you some clothes.

57
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,472
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

58
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,436
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

59
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,115
We made it to Mordor.

60
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,992
There are so many of them.

61
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,388
We'll never get through unseen.

62
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,517
It's him, the Eye.

63
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,434
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

64
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,836
There's nothing for it.

65
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,952
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

66
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,037
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

67
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,039
The darkness is deepening.

68
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,475
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

69
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,596
It's only a matter of time.

70
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,349
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

71
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,672
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

72
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,592
Let him stay there.

73
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
Let him rot! Why should we care?

74
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,429
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

75
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,309
I've sent him to his death.

76
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,028
No.

77
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,829
There is still hope for Frodo.

78
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,119
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

79
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,628
-We can give him that.
-How?

80
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,554
Draw out Sauron's armies.

81
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,756
Empty his lands.

82
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,918
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

83
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,398
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

84
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,073
Not for ourselves.

85
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,638
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

86
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,989
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

87
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,869
A diversion.

88
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,758
Certainty of death...

89
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,559
...small chance of success...

90
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,913
...what are we waiting for?

91
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,789
Sauron will suspect a trap.

92
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,516
He will not take the bait.

93
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,349
Oh, I think he will.

94
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,874
Long have you hunted me.

95
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,948
Long have I eluded you.

96
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,233
No more.

97
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,189
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

98
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,269
The city has fallen silent.

99
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,792
There is no warmth left in the sun.

100
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,198
It grows so cold.

101
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,992
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

102
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,192
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

103
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,159
Look, the Orcs...

104
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,591
...they're moving off.

105
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,591
You see, Mr. Frodo...

106
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,990
...some luck at last.

107
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,912
Move it, you slugs!

108
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,391
Come on! Faster!

109
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,197
Come along, you scum....

110
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,433
I'll whip you down to the bone, you....

111
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,758
Come on!

112
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,150
What have I told you?!

113
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,153
Get up!

114
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,080
Come on, you slugs!

115
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,710
You two are going straight
to the front line!

116
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,590
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

117
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,715
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

118
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,156
Don't you know we're at war?

119
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,313
Company, halt!

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,231
Inspection!

121
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,755
Sam, help me.

122
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,672
Mr. Frodo!

123
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,714
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

124
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,632
It's so heavy.

125
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,515
Oh, no.

126
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,831
What do I do?
What do we do?

127
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,875
-Hit me.
-What?

128
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,996
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

129
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,673
Get off of me!

130
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,550
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

131
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,796
Get off of me!

132
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,511
Break it up! Break it up!

133
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,317
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

134
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,750
Go, Sam. Now!

135
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,799
Move along, scum!

136
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,791
Back in the line!

137
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,998
You maggots!

138
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,518
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

139
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,150
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

140
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,637
Move it!

141
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,916
I can't....

142
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,675
I can't....
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

143
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,949
It's.... It's....

144
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,588
It's such a weight to carry.

145
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,429
It....

146
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,477
Such a weight.

147
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,589
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

148
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,992
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

149
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,312
Mr. Frodo.

150
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,193
Look.

151
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,432
There is light...

152
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,069
...and beauty up there...

153
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,878
...that no shadow can touch.

154
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,398
Take mine.

155
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,916
There's a few drops left.

156
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,988
There will be none left
for the return journey.

157
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,917
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

158
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,710
Frodo, get down!

159
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,231
Hide!

160
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,916
Frodo!

161
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,873
Where are they?

162
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,392
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

163
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,999
Let justice be done upon him!

164
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,508
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

165
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,669
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

166
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,032
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

167
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,033
...faithless and accursed.

168
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,476
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

169
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

170
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,634
Old Greybeard.

171
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,118
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

172
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,194
Frodo.

173
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,319
Frodo.

174
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,429
-Silence.
-No!

175
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,514
Silence!

176
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,835
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

177
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,713
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

178
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,518
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

179
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,076
And he did, Gandalf.

180
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,912
He did.

181
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,073
And who is this?

182
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,231
Isildur's heir?

183
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,278
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

184
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,308
I guess that concludes negotiations.

185
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,509
I do not believe it.

186
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,759
I will not.

187
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,918
Pull back.

188
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,156
Pull back!

189
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,836
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

190
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,078
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

191
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,998
Something's drawn its gaze.

192
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,439
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

193
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,274
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

194
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,837
I see in your eyes...

195
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,079
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

196
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,714
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

197
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,031
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

198
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,760
But it is not this day.

199
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,952
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

200
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,873
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

201
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,395
But it is not this day.

202
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,152
This day we fight!

203
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,035
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

204
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,273
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

205
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,510
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

206
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,190
What about side by side with a friend?

207
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,272
Aye.

208
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,798
I could do that.

209
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,871
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

210
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,870
It'll be spring soon.

211
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,234
And the orchards will be in blossom.

212
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,915
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

213
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,074
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

214
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,278
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

215
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,509
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

216
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,678
No, Sam.

217
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,673
I can't recall the taste of food...

218
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,911
...nor the sound of water...

219
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,516
...nor the touch of grass.

220
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,919
I'm...

221
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,079
...naked in the dark.

222
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,875
There's-- There's nothing.

223
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,556
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

224
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,591
I can see him...

225
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,592
...with my waking eyes.

226
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,955
Then let us be rid of it...

227
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,670
...once and for all.

228
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,351
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

229
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,034
I can't carry it for you...

230
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,396
...but I can carry you.

231
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,592
Come on!

232
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,593
Aragorn.

233
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,194
Elessar.

234
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,989
For Frodo.

235
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,953
Look, Mr. Frodo.

236
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,756
A doorway.

237
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,912
We're almost there.

238
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,948
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

239
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,912
Mustn't go that way.

240
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,755
Mustn't hurt the precious.

241
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,592
You swore!

242
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,751
You swore on the precious!

243
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,437
Sméagol promised!

244
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,231
Sméagol lied.

245
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,397
Frodo!

246
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,072
Eagles.

247
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,873
The eagles are coming!

248
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,557
Frodo!

249
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,828
I'm here, Sam.

250
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,558
Destroy it!

251
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,831
Go on! Now!

252
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,434
Throw it in the fire!

253
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,840
What are you waiting for?

254
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,915
Just let it go!

255
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,910
The Ring is mine.

256
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,992
No.

257
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,628
No.

258
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,280
No!

259
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,237
Yes!

260
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,998
Yes!

261
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,833
Precious! Precious!

262
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,037
Precious! Precious!

263
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,552
Give me your hand!

264
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,869
Take my hand!

265
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,714
No!

266
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,557
Don't you let go.

267
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,473
Don't let go.

268
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,439
Reach!

269
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,713
Frodo!

270
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,158
Frodo!

271
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,952
It's gone.

272
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,912
It's done.

273
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,311
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

274
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,949
It's over now.

275
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,835
I can see the Shire.

276
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,190
The Brandywine River.

277
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,151
Bag End.

278
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,994
Gandalf's fireworks.

279
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,995
The lights in the Party Tree.

280
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,432
Rosie Cotton dancing.

281
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,114
She had ribbons in her hair.

282
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,753
If ever I was to marry someone...

283
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,790
...it would've been her.

284
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,151
It would've been her.

285
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,877
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

286
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,798
...here at the end of all things.

287
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,956
Gandalf?

288
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,711
Frodo!

289
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,432
Gimli!

290
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,795
Now come the days of the king.

291
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,830
May they be blessed.

292
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,840
This day does not belong to one man...

293
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,797
...but to all.

294
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,198
Let us together rebuild this world...

295
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,433
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

296
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,591
My friends...

297
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,240
...you bow to no one.

298
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,636
And thus it was.

299
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,270
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

300
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,874
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

301
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,352
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

302
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,829
...was ended.

303
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,236
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

304
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,439
...we found ourselves
looklng upon a familiar sight.

305
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,474
We were home.

306
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,557
Hi.

307
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,156
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

308
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,793
More of the same, Rosie.

309
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,871
Good night, lads.

310
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,914
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

311
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,316
How do you go on...

312
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,474
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

313
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,513
...there is no going back?

314
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,715
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

315
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,998
...some hurts that go too deep...

316
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,399
...that have taken hold.

317
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,152
There and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

318
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,797
Mr. Frodo?

319
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,319
What is it?

320
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,868
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

321
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,114
It's never really healed.

322
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,948
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

323
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,309
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

324
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,870
You finished it.

325
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,073
Not quite.

326
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,314
There's room for a little more.

327
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,879
Bilbo once told me his part
In this tale would end...

328
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,191
...that each of us must come and go
In the telling.

329
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,759
Bilbo's story was now over.

330
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,038
There would be no more journeys
for him...

331
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,679
...save one.

332
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,836
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

333
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,911
To the harbour, Bilbo.

334
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,674
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

335
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,354
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

336
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,592
Frodo...

337
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,317
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

338
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,070
The one I gave you.

339
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,630
I'm sorry, Uncle.

340
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,594
I'm afraid I lost it.

341
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,478
Oh.

342
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,479
Pity.

343
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,829
I should like to have held it
one last time.

344
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,635
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

345
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,437
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

346
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,873
The time has come...

347
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,191
...for the dominion of Men.

348
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,999
The sea calls us home.

349
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,150
I think I'm...

350
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,518
...quite ready
for another adventure.

351
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,515
Farewell...

352
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,319
...my brave Hobbits.

353
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,111
My work is now finished.

354
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,556
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

355
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,919
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

356
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,709
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

357
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,194
...for not all tears are an evil.

358
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,871
It is time, Frodo.

359
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,111
What does he mean?

360
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,233
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

361
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,399
And it has been saved.

362
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,480
But not for me.

363
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,715
You don't mean that.

364
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,871
You can't leave.

365
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,594
The last pages are for you, Sam.

366
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,713
My dear Sam.

367
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,757
You cannot always be torn in two.

368
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,879
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

369
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,833
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

370
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,077
Your part In the story will go on.

371
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,472
Well...

372
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,918
... I'm back.

373
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,154
Lay down

374
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,912
Your sweet and weary head

375
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,996
Night is falling

376
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,270
You have come
To journey's end

377
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,515
Sleep now

378
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:52,118
And dream
Of the ones who came before

379
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,554
They are calling

380
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,679
From across
The distant shore

381
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,910
Why do you weep?

382
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,870
What are these tears
Upon your face?

383
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,875
Soon you will see

384
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,795
All of your fears
Will pass away

385
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,829
Safe In my arms

386
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,312
You're only sleeping

387
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,270
What can you see

388
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,468
On the horizon?

389
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,952
Why do the white gulls

390
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,636
Call?

391
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,197
Across the sea

392
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,388
A pale moon rises

393
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,154
The ships have come

394
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:10,872
To carry you home

395
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,397
And all will turn

396
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,680
To silver glass

397
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,913
A light on the water

398
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:32,359
All souls pass

399
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,559
Hope fades

400
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,750
Into the world of night

401
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,115
Through shadows falling

402
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,835
Out of memory and time

403
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,069
Don't say

404
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,630
We have come now to the end

405
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,672
White shores are calling

406
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,230
You and I will meet again

407
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,589
And you'll be here
In my arms

408
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,673
Just sleeping

409
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,470
What can you see

410
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,395
On the horizon?

411
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,156
Why do the white gulls

412
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,519
Call?

413
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,549
Across the sea

414
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,510
A pale moon rlses

415
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,353
The ships have come

416
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:01,595
To carry you home

417
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,675
And all will turn

418
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,870
To silver glass

419
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,999
A light on the water

420
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,869
Grey ships pass

421
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,478
Into the West
