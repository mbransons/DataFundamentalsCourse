Your Majesty, it's great
to be back at the palace.

28
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,449
You know what the palace is -
24 living rooms and a dungeon.

29
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,099
But seriously... I love the king. He's one
of the strongest men here, isn't he?

30
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,656
He's the only one amongst us
that can swim the moat lengthwise.

31
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,736
Cos...

32
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,288
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing!

33
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,332
But seriously, ladies and germs,
I wanna say that...

34
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,371
...that plague is really something!

35
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,968
Doesn't everything look black?!

36
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,169
Cos it's a... a black... a black plague!

37
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,098
Save it up and let me hear it
at the end... big.

38
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,133
And, uh... I love the new exercise
His Majesty does to keep in shape.

39
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,216
It's called taxing peasants.

40
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,858
But seriously... the... the best... thing...

41
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,653
I can't stand it any longer!

42
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,657
He's not funny!

43
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,453
I've cut men in half
for making jokes as bad as that!

44
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,969
- But, sire...
- Get me a fool who's funny!

45
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,656
Go on! The feast is over!

46
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,416
Not funny!

47
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,054
Come on! Out, out, out, out!

48
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,648
I do a couple of impressions
that you might like.

49
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,012
L-I'm one of the few guys that can do the
King of France. Not his voice, his walk.

50
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,292
If you've ever noticed, he'll have
that funny motion when he walks.

51
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,891
He's... Don't everybody... burst
into spontaneous applause on this!

52
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,213
- Look where thou goest, fool!
- I beg your puberty.

53
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,979
Thou hast dropped
the royal rubies and emeralds!

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,137
I fain wouldst pick it up
and pin it and fain well on thy fain.

55
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,410
- Aye, pin!
- Yes, extend thy fain, madam.

56
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,010
- And I... On the knocker it hangs. Perfect.
- Knock!

57
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,096
Didst I feel right?

58
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,099
Or didst I feel that thy two hands
did upon my royal body cop a feel?

59
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,213
Oh, madam, not I. I surely would never
lay my hands on the royal tomatoes.

60
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,659
Tomatoes?!

61
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,817
Hearken to me. If my husband the king
and my son the doctor...

62
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,899
...walketh near upon these paved paths
and heareth what thou sayest...

63
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,136
...thy life would not be worth
a plug nickel!

64
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,728
But so beautiful do they lay -
one on either side...

65
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,658
That's the way they were made, fool!
Away with thee!

<i>(groans)</i>

Oh... I... I fell on my bells!

68
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,372
TB...

69
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,456
...or not TB?

70
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,536
That is the congestion.

71
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,096
Consumption be done about it?

72
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,176
Of cough. Of cough.

73
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,096
<i>(guard)</i> Ohhh, Jesus!

74
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,176
My jokes grow stale.

75
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,894
I would my life take for a bare bodkin.

76
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,339
If only I could see
the queen's bare bodkin.

77
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,659
Or anybody's bare bodkin, for that matter.

78
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,419
Or a bodkin with a little clothes on it even.

79
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,976
I'm so melancholy.

80
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,568
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead!

81
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,656
Their tailor shop is closed.

82
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,736
<i>(echoing) Felix!</i>

83
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,816

<i>Felix!</i>

85
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,777
No one knows I'm here.
Not even my service.

<i>I am the ghost of thy father.</i>

87
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,696
Oh... my father.

88
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,573
You who died in childbirth.

89
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,656
<i>I cannot rest...</i>

90
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,970
<i>... unless thee makes it with the queen.</i>

91
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,577
But she is a queen
and I am a baseborn fool.

92
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,730
I can't screw above my station.

93
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,930

94
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,410

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,496
<i>... my father...</i>

96
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,850
<i>... poured hemlock in my ear.</i>

97
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,693
Why?

98
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,776
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

99
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,213
<i>He does that with everybody.</i>

100
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,854
<i>Whenever he sees an ear...</i>

101
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,415
<i>... he likes to pour hemlock in it.</i>

102
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,179
<i>(gasps)</i> Oh, Father!

103
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,736
<i>See the sorcerer, my son.</i>

104
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,816
<i>(fading) The sorcerer!</i>

105
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,930
<i>The sorcerer...</i>

106
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,776
He's gone!

107
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,856
Do I dare sleep with the queen?

108
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,936
And will she sleep with me?

109
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,655
Although she sleeps with the king,
and he wears leotards!

110
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,577
The sorcerer...

111
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,770
Ah! An aphrodisiac!

112
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,656
Do you want a soft one?

113
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,736
A strong one?

114
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,816
Or one that will...

115
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,010
...mmm?

116
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,655
- What can I get without a prescription?
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,253
This, placed softly...

118
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,136
...in the queen's drink...

119
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,216
...will make her blood boil!

120
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,332
Her passion... unbridled.

121
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,856
Lustful.

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,574
- In other words...
- The hots for me.

123
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,656
<i>(chuckles)</i>

124
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,577
Exactly.

125
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,656
But be cautious.

126
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,931
For if His Majesty
should get wind of thy intent...

127
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,416
...he will cut off your legs...

128
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,496
...your arms...

129
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,576
...and your head.

130
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,250
Right... Five out of six is not bad.

131
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,056
Now go.

132
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,533
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,616
I think your eggs are done.

134
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,299
- Halt! Who goes there?
- It's just the fool.

135
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,615
What business have you
in the royal chamber?

136
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,300
I was just bringing Her Majesty
her orange juice.

137
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,411
But why you? Where is her usual servant?

138
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,534
He... He lies ill on the... kitchen floor with
the pox. A terrible pox all over his socks.

139
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,812
- Get thee hence, fool.
- Yes, I'm getting hence. Immediately. I...

140
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,775
D'you like the way I fooled these guys?

141
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,411
Fool, what dost thou in my chamber?

142
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,170
Madam, I fell by for perchance you might
like a drink - a nice, soothing potion.

143
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,734
Aye, well, I do confess a thirst.
Bringst to me.

144
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,569
Yes. Wouldst grab some of this potion
before the fizz goes out.

145
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,373
- Isn't it wonderful? Mm!
- It bubbleth greatly.

146
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,456
Wolf some down, my lady.

147
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,218
Cheerst!

148
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,296
And Roebuck.

149
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,736
It go down bubblest, but it's fine.

150
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,656
Takest away.

151
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,138
Well, I have to go back now
to the dungeon.

152
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,899
There's a...
To get a deposit on the goblet.

153
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,774
Wait!

154
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,777
Fool, come here.

155
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,769
I have o'er me this extraordinary warmth
that is flowing through my veins...

156
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,054
...that makes me wisht - nay, longst - thou
should run amok over my entire body.

157
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,058
Make love to me now.
Ravage me and take me now. Take me.

158
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,695
- It will be my pleasure.
- Take me to the bed. Make love to me.

159
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,778
- Yes. To the... To the bed.
- Lead me there, fool.

160
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,368
- Yes, I am.
- How this passion groweth within me.

161
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,060
- Right. Come quickly.
- I cannot walk fast, fool.

162
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,899
- <i>(queen)</i> The passion is so great.
- Right. To the bed.

163
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,772
Aye. Haste to the bed.

164
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,856
Right, over here.

165
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,572
Here.

166
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,137
The potion will be under the pillow. If you
lose your hots, we can refurbish them.

167
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,216
- Aye. Comest o'er!
- Oh, yes.

168
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,855
- Run thy hands upon my body.
- I shall. I shall reline your brakes.

169
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,936
Aye. Mmm! Oh, God!

170
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,498
Nay, I needst the feel
of naked flesh against flesh.

171
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,612
I'm all out of naked flesh.
But will the velvet do?

172
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,809
- Kiss me quick.
- Yes. Where <i>is</i> your quick?

173
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,091
- Shh. Canst undress me now?
- I'm kissing my own arm!

174
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,698
Yes. Up quickly
and I will remove the royal dress.

175
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,539
<i>(panting)</i>

176
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,890
Oh, God... Mmm! Oh, God!

177
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,818
Takest off. Pullst not upon me so!

178
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,855
On thy feet, fool. This is
not mockery. This is not games.

179
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,936
Ah! Oh, God...

180
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,976
At la! What... What's this?!

181
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,533
Heavy underwear.

182
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,289
'Tis the chastity belt that
the jealous king hath fastened on me...

183
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,617
...that no man but him shallst
havest the goodst of the body.

184
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,459
That's a bad break for
all of us here at the palace.

185
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,536
Yes... Yes... Wait! Wait here.

186
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,616
L-I... I will go.

187
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,169
Here, now, with most grievous dispatch,
I will open the latch...

188
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,256
...and get to her snatch.

189
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,299
- Quickly.
- Aye.

190
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,376
All right, hold that.

191
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,456
This key is too big for that lock.

192
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,775
<i>(key drops to floor)</i>

193
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,616
- Um...
- Agh!

194
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,696
J-J-Just move back.

195
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,933
<i>(clang)</i>

196
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,096
Sorry about that.

197
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,972
I must think quickly.

198
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,252
Before you know it, the Renaissance
will be here and we'll all be painting.

199
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,131
Her Majesty wishes to borrow this.

200
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,253
She has some food stuck between
her teeth and I need to pull it out.

201
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,848
- Forgive me...
- Argh!

202
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,936
Whoops!

203
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,815
Ah!

204
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,896
Ugh!

205
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,612
No! Agh!

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,413
This is what they call beaver shooting.

207
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,856
I wouldst pick this lock.

208
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,569
- There.
- Agh! We did it. It's done.

209
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,053
- Yes.
- And now I am yours.

210
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,650
At last, the portals of ecstasy.
You <i>have</i> got portals of ecstasy?

211
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,250
Be prepared! His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging!

212
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,290
Be prepared! His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging!

213
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,537
- He will cleave thee in twain!
- Yes. Cleave me in twain.

214
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,458
Twain over here and twain
on the other side of the room!

215
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,536
Onst chopping block.

216
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,616
Yes. I do not look good in twain.

217
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,858
- My suits are made for a whole person.
- I shall not have this passion fulfilled!

218
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,179
Well, quickly, lock up the... the thing
that you have there. Lock the royal box!

219
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,018
Quickly! Quickly! Before...

220
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,496
- Help me. Help me.
- I'mst helping, but...

221
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,576
Aye, 'tis done.

222
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,214
'Tis locked solid. More solid than any...

223
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,013
M-My hand! 'Tis caught
in the chastity belt.

224
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,700
I always get my hand
in the cookie jar, so to speak.

225
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,856
The king approaches. What canst we do?

226
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,299
- The king?!
- Aye!

227
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,569
Quickly!

228
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,577
Into the dress immediately.

229
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,618
My queen! Where is my queen?

230
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,208
Very casual. As though
nothing had happened.

231
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,773
Queen!

232
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,379
Oh, my queen.

233
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,889
A most dreadful pounding
did awaken me.

234
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,409
Making my mood most foul!

235
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,735
Oh... My lord didst startle me!

236
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,853
Aye, my lord. Be a good king, wouldst
thou, and go and get me a drink of water?

237
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,655
The fool hath made the most
jestfully quipping in thine absence.

238
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,772
Aye, my lord! Tickling
the royal funny bone, so to speak.

239
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,653
Because, you see,
'tis most Ionely when thou nappest.

240
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,736
Aye, my lord. For me, too.

241
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,851
I still don't...

242
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,936
...think he's funny.

243
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,415
I got some new ones for you, my lord.

244
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,658
What's black and white, black and white,
black and white and black and white?

245
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,736
A nun falling down the stairs.

246
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,816
<i>(nervous giggle)</i>

247
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,896
Come give me a kiss.

248
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,215
- Of course. Stick out your tongue.
- Not you!

249
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,296
Now begone!

250
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,729
- That damn fool!
- No!

251
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,294
I... I will accompany thee to the door.

252
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,212
At last.

253
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,570
At last, we are alone.

254
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,975
- Aye, my lord.
- Come to me.

255
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,056
- My lord, I wouldst...
- Mmm! Mmm!

256
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,136
- Nay! Kiss me not!
- To the bed!

257
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,895
I will soon find that key. Where is't?

258
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,932
Ah! Here it is!

259
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,376
Ha-ha-ha! Tickles!

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,816
Oh!

261
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,332
Aye, my lord.

262
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,738
Remember you said that if I was ever
in town I should look up your wife?

263
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,771
I don't know what everybody's getting so
upset for. I never humped her, you know.

264
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,292
Just... Just clean up my neck a little
and leave the top full.

265
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,496
Your case.

266
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,055
So...

267
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,057
- Give me a good "ah".
- Ah.

268
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,329
Ah.

269
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,690
...down this side of my arm,
mostly at night.

270
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,495
I don't notice it as much in the daytime,
but at night it bothers me.

271
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,373
I don't want to hurt you,
but how far up can you raise it?

272
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,968
Mr Milos, would you
come with me, please?

273
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,691
Come in, Mr Milos. Come in.
Sit down right over here.

274
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,857
I just want to
get some history on you first.

275
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,256
So...

276
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,133
- Your name is?
- Stavros Milos.

277
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,216
- And your address?
- Armenia.

278
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,136
- Armenia?
- I am from Armenia.

279
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,296
- I am visiting my brother.
- I see.

280
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,376
Um... occupation?

281
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,979
Shepherd.

282
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,056
- A shepherd?
- My whole family.

283
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,297
Except for my brother over here,
who is a rug salesman.

284
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,296
Mm-hm.

285
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,218
- Have you had any major illnesses?
- No.

286
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,296
None. Good.

287
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,459
So...

288
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,094
Now... what seems to be the trouble?

289
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,610
- I'm in love with a sheep.
- I beg your pardon?

290
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,254
I am in love with a sheep.

291
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,296
Oh... I see.

292
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,413
You see, doctor, up there in
the mountains where I tend my flocks...

293
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,008
...it's so beautiful under the starry skies.

294
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,018
And I am alone.
And sometimes it gets so Ionely.

295
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,096
And the hours pass.

296
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,211
And soon I desire a woman.

297
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,296
But, doctor, there are no women.

298
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,376
I am not married and...

299
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,614
Well... one night last summer...

300
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,730
...I could stand it no longer.

301
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,055
My body needed to be satisfied.

302
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,016
And then... I saw her.

303
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,812
Her?

304
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,329
- Daisy.
- Sheep?

305
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,815
I took Daisy off to a little cove...

306
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,255
...and there, under the Armenian sky,
had sexual intercourse.

307
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,572
With the sheep?

308
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,213
Naturally.

309
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,895
Ohhh... God!

310
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,456
It was the greatest lay I ever had.

311
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,096
Mr Milos...

312
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,178
Forgive me if I... seemed at all shocked.

313
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,653
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,977
Doctor, Mrs Gallbladder's
on the phone about her rupture.

315
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,056
Later. Later...

316
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,613
Uh...

317
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,696
Mr Milos...

318
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,849
Of course, I'm happy for the two of you.

319
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,459
But, um...

320
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,536
...I do have other patients.

321
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,616
And unless there's some...

322
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,776
...specific way...

323
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,856
...that I could help you...

324
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,255
Doctor. Doctor, please. One minute.

325
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,936
See, the point is...

326
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,576
...she no longer loves me.

327
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,656
That's why I'm here.

328
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,374
Because she's fallen out of love with me.

329
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,456
How can you tell that?

330
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,536
Oh... little things.

331
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,570
She's cold. Indifferent.

332
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,658
- Mm-hm?
- Speak to her. She'll listen to you.

333
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,853
Mr Milos...

334
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,936
You are...

335
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,857
...crazy.

336
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,936
I brought her all the way from Armenia.

337
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,257
My brother says you are a great doctor.
You saved his life once.

338
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,258
You need a psychiatrist.
I am a medical doctor.

339
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,016
Speak to her. Please?

340
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,898
- I can't talk to a sheep! Are you nuts?
- She's outside in my brother's truck.

341
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,375
Would you get out of my office, please!

342
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,730
I'm an MD. I'm not a veterinarian!

343
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,738
- I bring her in.
- Don't bring any sheep in this office!

344
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,058
- My mother just got finished paying for it!
- I know no great men of wisdom.

345
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,091
My brother says you are a great man.

346
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,495
I'm not! I'm just an ordinary GP.

347
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,053
- That's all I am!
- I'll get her.

348
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,809
No! Mr Milos! You don't understand.
It's not normal...

349
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,376
...to experience mature love
for anything with four legs!

350
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,297
Wait till you meet her.

351
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,376
I don't believe this.

352
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,651
- Doctor, the prescription you gave me...
- I can't.

353
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,853
I'm sorry. I can't. Would you sit down?!
Would you sit down, Mrs...

354
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,971
- I'll talk to you...
- <i>(bleating)</i>

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,458
Oh... Good.

357
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,572
Um... Why don't you
take her right into my office?

358
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,380
You'll have to excuse me. His sheep has...

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,456
...a... a strep throat.

360
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,735
Mr Milos, I'm gonna
have to call the police.

361
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,138
Can we talk for a minute? Mr Milos,
don't put that sheep on my desk! Please!

362
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,569
You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't do that.

363
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,692
- Isn't Daisy beautiful?
- Yes, she is beautiful.

364
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,689
Mr Milos... You're a very nice man. I don't
want to see you get into any trouble.

365
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,539
What I don't think you understand is that...

...you have...

...someone in the...

Nothing.

I'm just a little tired, that's all.

Why don't you turn in early, then? Hm?

Oh, just nothing.

No, you were fondling
your lamb's-wool sweater.

I was not fondling
my lamb's-wool sweater!

What would I do something like that for?

You from the hills of Armenia

00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,376
That's what I ordered.

478
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,651
Waiter, I ordered two sauerkraut!
I didn't order cake!

479
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,656
- Waiter!
- Don't call me waiter!

480
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,931
I'm a doctor! You understand that?
I'm not a waiter!

481
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,972
I am a doctor! Don't call me waiter!
I'm a doctor!

482
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,772
Ah. Say "ah".

483
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,536
Come here! Spread your legs apart!

484
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,299
Couldn't you at least
not have eaten this morning?!

485
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,139
Isn't that...
What kind of a mess is that in there?!

486
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,736
Daisy?

487
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,972
Daisy?

488
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,056
Honey?

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,929
I have waited so long for this moment.

496
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,694
Fabrizio, my darling,
go easy on my hymen.

497
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,090
Gina, your body to me is a cathedral.

498
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,410
Now take off your pants.

499
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,256
Didn't you like it?

500
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,091
Yes.

501
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,134
It didn't look like you were
having fun to me.

502
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,535
Yes. You were wonderful.

503
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,659
But you just lay there -
passive - like a lox.

504
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,372
It was my first time -
did you like it?

505
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,652
Me? Are you kidding?
More fun than laughing.

506
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,610
Maybe next time
I'll be more relaxed.

507

<i>Brava! Bravissima!</i>

510
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,057
Marcello, do you know anything
about frigidity?

511
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,649
It's all in the foreplay.

512
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,409
A woman needs to be played with
before you lay her.

513
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,575
How long?

514
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,977
Fifteen minutes, half hour -
depends on the woman.

515
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,616
What about your wife?

516
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,698
Thirty seconds.

517
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,532
Lucky!

518
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,812
Don't tell me Gina's a problem.

519
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,537
Er... no... it's not that.

520
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,935
Do you fondle her before putting it in?

521
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,213
Put what in? Oh!

522
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,012
I don't like to talk about Gina
like she's a whore.

523
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,572
How long have you been married now?

524
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,249
Six weeks.

525
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,098
Play with her. Fondle her.

526
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,697
It's always the man's fault.
Any woman can be made to feel ecstasy.

527
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,732
Last week, in the middle of... of...

528
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,218
She was watching television.

529
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,416
You must be doing something wrong.

530
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,539
Some women take longer.

531
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,091
Find her erogenous zones.

532
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,609
Her father gave me a map
of them, and still...

533
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,488
Okay, turn over.

534
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,336
Huh?

535
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,978
Over. I want to do a quick check
on some parts I missed.

Mmm!

540
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,340
Foreplay...

Fabrizio, there is nothing
the church can do for you.

546
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,858
If I could, I would be glad to try
and make your wife come...

547
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,175
...but that is impossible.

548
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,093
At least you get pleasure from her.

549
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,855
Maybe someday she will get it from you.

550
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,139
And here will be my new offices.
A hundred people will work under me.

551
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:24,333
Yes... Yes, but tell me about
your sex life... your wife.

552
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,330
She moans and screams
and claws my back.

553
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,808
She comes six, seven times.

554
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,978
She's like a wolf in heat.

555
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,375
Mine lays there and stares
at the ceiling. Like a dead one.

556
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,612
Are you... small?

557
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,172
Small? Like a French bread. Small...

558
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,897
Okay, okay... then I don't know.

559
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,451
You're depressed still.

560
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,377
<i>No.</i>

561
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,489
I'm okay.

Take me. Do it to me.

Here?!

571
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,937
Yes... yes...

572
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,890
- There's people all around.
- I don't care.

573
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,739
We could get caught!

Do it.

Oh, my God! Now she wants it!

Life plays strange tricks on me.

578
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,495
She comes - like an express train.

579
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,769
The next night in bed she lays there...

580
00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:00,409
It's the danger, my friend.
The fear of being caught.

581
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,458
The sinful, mischievous, naughty,
tempting of fate...

582
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,978
That's what she needs.

583
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,775
Mark my words.

584
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,375
No question.

585
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,413
She is weird-city.

Did anyone see Fabrizio?

Listen carefully to what I say.
You'll get caught.

588

It's dangerous. Don't do it!

589

We were nearly caught last week.

- Oh, come on. It's just psychosomatic.

609
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,169
A tension headache by you
is psychosomatic.

All of a sudden
you've become a psychiatrist?

Stop complaining. It's Alvin's parents,
so it's an obligation.

Or should I say it's them that
look down their noses at us?

I heard that! I think
you're both a little paranoid.

Very interesting.

636
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,730
I'd love to. I've never seen wood carvings.

637
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,409
Well, I mean African heads,
and we picked them up in, uh...

638
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,578
- <i>(George)</i> Bimini.
- Bimini.

639
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,136
We got them for a steal. You won't
believe the price we paid for them.

640
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,457
You want wood carvings?
I'll show you wood carvings. Tell her.

641
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,299
You simply must see these.
They're absolutely...

642
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,256
<i>(George coughs)</i>

643
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,016
- <i>George!</i>
- Yes, dear?

644
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,449
<i>They're on the top shelf in the closet.</i>

645
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,775
The closet or the bureau?

646
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,856
<i>Top shelf in the closet.</i>

647
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,936
Top shelf? Right.

648
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,896
<i>(humming)</i>

649
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,939
You know, Bimini is a free port
and we got a marvellous buy on them.

650
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,016
- From Bimini. The Bahamas?
- Oh?

651
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,096
- Beautiful, hm?
- Uh... yes.

652
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,097
- Look at that detail.
- They're...

653
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,131
I'd like your husband to see these.

654
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,773
Thief! Purse-snatcher!

655
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,258
Thief! Help! Help! Get him!

656
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,736
<i>(high-pitched voice)</i> Let it go! Don't call
the police! Oh, my God! The police!

657
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,574
You know, I'm wondering, uh...
what could be taking Sam so long?

658
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,136
- Would you excuse me for a second?
- Certainly.

659
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,617
- Are you all right, lady?
- It's just another crime in the street thing.

660
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,255
It's... an everyday happening.
It just happened to me. It's...

661
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,690
- You're really lucky.
- Lucky?! Well, I don't know...

662
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,051
- Oh! I coulda been dead!
- Right. You're absolutely right.

663
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,570
- Did you have any valuables in it?
- No, I don't think so.

664
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,134
- You're probably wondering why...
- Yes.

665
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,378
I got a cold. It's dripping.
I don't feel good altogether, you know...

666
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,015
- Oh, these young people today!
- What can you do? What can you do?

667
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,213
It's the society we're living in.
What I... But don't make a fuss.

668
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,979
<i>(knocks)</i> Sam, what did you do? Fall in?

669
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,216
Are you sure you're all right?

670
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,490
Officer, there was a bag stolen.
He got away.

671
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,498
All right! Who's the lady
whose purse was snatched?

672
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,169
It's perfectly OK, officer.
I forgive the little rascal.

673
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,609
I'm sorry, but I'll have to fill out a report.

674
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,618
I don't wanna press charges.
Really, you silly...

675
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,696
<i>(siren)</i>

676
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,130
- What's all the excitement about?
- There's a crowd. And police!

677
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,216
- Police?
- <i>(Julie)</i> Exciting!

678
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,094
- You got me, too. I follow fire engines.
- <i>(Julie)</i> Let's look.

679
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,696
Do you need some money?

680
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,096
<i>(woman)</i> I don't need any money.
It was her purse that was stolen!

681
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,176
Somebody oughta give her some.

682
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,979
- Name?
- Uh... name? I...

683
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,249
Jasmine.

684
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,291
Jasmine Glit.

685
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,095
- Oh, that's a very unusual name.
- Oh, you're sweet!

686
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,008
- What seems to be the trouble, officer?
- It's just a purse-snatching.

687
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,732
Purse...

688
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,420
Oh! L-I'm sorry, lady.
I'm very sorry for you.

689
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,496
- If I lose my baby, I...
- Baby?

690
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,939
- Yes.
- Come in and lie down.

691
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,290
- I'm three months pregnant.
- I'm sorry.

692
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,093
My gynaecologist told me
to avoid excitement.

693
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,129
- Please come inside and let me...
- Nah...

Huh?! Look at this.

706
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,613
<i>(Tess)</i> Sam, you should have
told me, that's all.

707
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,696
I would have understood.

708
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,971
It's not the kind of thing
that's easy to talk about.

709
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,739
Sam... we've been married for years.

710
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,690
I love you. You love me.

711
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,975
You could have come to me and said...

712
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,376
..."Tess... I have a diseased mind."

713
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,256
"I'm a sick individual."

714
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,336
"I need help."

715
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,735
"I need treatment. I'm perverted."

716
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,051
"I'm unfit to function
with normal, decent people."

717
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,136
I would have understood.

718
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,216
Thank you. Tess?

719
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,132
- I'm going to see Dr Fillmore next week.
- I'm glad.

720
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,216
You're wonderful.

721
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,573
The look on their faces
when the police removed your hat!

Ha-ha!

<i>Brought to you by Lancer,</i>
<i>the hair conditioner for men.</i>

Are you still using
that same old stuff on your hair?

725
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,778
Yeah. Why?

726
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,856
Try this.

727
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,016
- Lancer. Really?
- Go ahead.

728
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,491
Hey, this is great. No grease or oil!

729
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,009
Right. Grooms and conditions
at the same time.

730
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,096
Smells great, too.

731
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,012
Lancer. The conditioner
that grooms and conditions.

Welcome once again
to <i>What's My Perversion?</i>

737
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,491
Panel members, you look splendid.

738
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,772
Pamela and Toni, so beautiful.
And Regis and Robert Q, so handsome.

739
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,970
And, panel members, we have...

740
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,854
...some <i>very</i> interesting guests
this evening. Let's get right to them.

741
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,095
So...

742
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,893
First guest, will you sign in, please?

743
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,496
<i>(Jack)</i> Bernard...

...Jaffe.
- <i>(applause)</i>

745
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,536
Mr Jaffe, would you sit down, sir?

746
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,016
A pleasure to have you with us,
here on <i>What's My Perversion?</i>

747
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,529
- You know the rules of our game.
- Yes, I do.

748
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,697
You get $5 every time the panel
comes up with a "no" answer.

749
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,776
To start our game going...

750
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,778
...would you whisper in my ear
what your perversion is?

751
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,449
While you do that, we will let the studio
and the home audience know...

752
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,775
...exactly <i>what</i> your perversion is.

753
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,296
Good. All right, panel members.

754
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,890
The studio and the home audience
know what his perversion is.

755
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,693
- We'll start with Robert Q Lewis.
- Thank you, Jack.

756
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,539
Mr Jaffe, is this one of
those <i>nice</i> perversions...

757
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,696
...that <i>any</i> guy might indulge in?

758
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,776
<i>(Jaffe)</i> Anybody can do it.

759
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,778
I'm sure you could.
It's just a matter of wanting to.

760
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,494
I see. Thank you. Is this
one of the perversions...

761
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,578
...that might best be...
performed in the home...

762
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,817
...or could you just do it anywhere?
- <i>(Jack)</i> Not necessarily.

763
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,977
I think that will get a "no" answer.
And $5 to you, Mr Jaffe.

764
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,456
And we turn the questioning
over to Pamela Mason. Pamela?

765
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,572
Is it something that is, uh...
done with the hands?

766
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,656
- Do you want to help me on that?
- Yes.

767
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,819
I would think that would not necessarily
have to play a part in the procedure.

768
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,376
And we give you a "no" answer on that.
That's $10 for you, Mr Jaffe.

769
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,456
And Regis Philbin is up next.

770
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,730
When you're doing your perversion...

771
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,693
...do you have any need for... for props?

772
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,048
Props?

773
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,250
You know, uh... whips or leather boots?

774
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,531
- Oh, no!
- No, no. That's definitely not necessary.

775
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,289
- $15, Regis Philbin. And now Toni Holt.
- Mr Jaffe...

776
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,369
...would a telescope or a pair of binoculars
be helpful to you at any time?

777
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,810
It would have to be...
pointed in the right direction.

778
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,376
- <i>(audience laughter)</i>
- I would have to interject to say that...

779
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,458
...it would not be helpful to <i>you,</i>
but to somebody else.

780
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:55,539
In that respect, I think we must give you
a "no" answer, Toni. Robert Q Lewis.

781
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,696
Are you... I'll take a wild guess.

782
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,254
Are you... a rapist?

783
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,176
- Hardly.
- No. No, not at all.

784
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,258
$25. And... Pamela Mason.

785
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,338
- I'll pass to Regis.
- Is it self-contained?

786
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,575
<i>(Jaffe)</i> Yes. I carry it with me at all times.

787
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,613
- <i>(audience laughter)</i>
- I'm gonna take a guess. I think I have it.

788
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,176
Do you molest children?

789
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,495
<i>(Jack)</i> No, you're all on the wrong track.

790
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,329
Would you tell them what your perversion
is? You already have your $50.

791
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,418
Yes. L-I like to...
to expose myself on subways.

792
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,496
On subways.

793
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,736
<i>(applause)</i>

794
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,090
And now the winner
of this week's contest.

795
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,496
Each week, we give you at home
an opportunity to play our game.

796
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,976
We ask you to write and tell us
exactly what your perversion is.

797
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,409
We select the most interesting letter...

798
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:51,136
...and we give that contestant a chance
to act out his fantasy on the programme.

799
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,890
I present this week's winner. Ladies and
gentlemen and members of the panel...

800
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,252
...here from Muncie, Indiana
is our winner - Rabbi Chaim Baumel.

801
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,257
<i>(applause)</i>

802
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,939
Well, congratulations to you,
Chaim Baumel.

803
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,016
Uh, excuse me.

804
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,495
It's not <i>Chaim.</i> It's not <i>Caim.</i>

805
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,052
- It's pronounced <i>Chiam.</i>
- Chiam.

806
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,138
Chiam. Very good. I understand,
in addition to being...

807
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,333
...a very distinguished clergyman,
you have a very fascinating fetish.

808
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,691
- Yes... You mean a hang-up.
- Yes.

809
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,173
Yes.

810
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,256
Silk stockings.

811
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,848
- Silk stockings?
- I love silk stockings.

812
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,130
To touch 'em... To hug them...

813
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,137
To... To...

814
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,332
Now, you wrote in your letter
that what you'd like is to be...

815
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,416
...tied up.

816
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,294
For this we need the help of
one of the members of the panel. Uh...

817
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,298
Someone to tie him up.
Regis Philbin, would you?

818
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,376
Excuse me.

819
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,456
- Must be a girl.
- A girl.

820
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,617
Well, we certainly have
two lovely girls. Pamela...

821
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,096
...will you do the honours and tie him up?
- Love to!

822
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,176
<i>(Jack)</i> Rabbi.

823
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,259
Now, Pamela is going to
tie Rabbi Baumel...

824
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,690
...according to the wishes
as expressed in his letter.

825
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,018
I haven't had a lot of experience, Rabbi,
but... I think I can manage.

826
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,450
If you have any special instructions,
please let me know.

827
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,890
Is there any special area
that you'd like to have tied?

828
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,976
Not too tight! <i>(chuckles)</i>

829
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,818
- There.
- Good!

830
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,171
<i>(Jack)</i> And now a model from
the Lucy Jones Modelling Agency...

831
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,009
...is going to pretend that
she is Rabbi Baumel's governess...

832
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,415
...and she is going to spank the rabbi.

833
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,976
You've been a naughty rabbi!

834
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,854
- <i>(Jack)</i> While at the same time...
- I have to be in the synagogue tomorrow.

835
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:50,132
...Mrs Baumel, the rabbi's wife,
who we've flown in from Indiana...

836
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,296
...will sit at the rabbi's feet...

837
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,376
...and eat pork.

838
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,136
Take that! Naughty rabbi!

839
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,216
Now, don't you do that again!

840
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,256
<i>(model)</i> You're bad!

841
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,689
Naughty, naughty... <i>(giggles)</i>

842
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:09,940
<i>(Jack)</i> Well, there it is, America. Another
lucky winner gets to act out his fantasy.

843
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,338
This is Jack Barry, saying goodbye
and good luck from me and the panel.

844
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,169
We'll see you next week on...
<i>What's My Perversion?</i>

845
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,336
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

846
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,972
- Uh... Let me have 50˘ worth of regular.
- You bet.

847
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,297
Excuse me. My car broke down
about two miles down the road.

848
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,888
- Could you send somebody to get it?
- Sure, ma'am.

849
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,578
Thank you.

850
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,816
Uh, how far is Dr Bernardo's house?

851
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,329
- Uh... about seven miles.
- Oh, dammit!

852
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,936
- Miss?
- Yes?

853
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,654
- You're going to Dr Bernardo's house?
- Uh-huh.

854
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,250
- Would you like a lift? I'm going there.
- Oh... Gee, that'd be swell.

855
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,336
- Yeah? Oh, well, come on.
- OK.

856
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,616
Are you a friend of Dr Bernardo's?

857
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,256
Not exactly. I'm gonna be working
with him, helping with his experiments.

858
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,894
Are you studying sexual phenomena, too?

859
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,978
Yes. I, uh... was a biology major in school.

860
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,935
I'm really looking forward to working with
the doctor. He's a great hero of mine.

861
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,736
He was the first man to ever measure the
sound waves produced by an erection.

862
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,420
- Yes, I know.
- Do you?

863
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,576
Yes, I'm a reporter for <i>The Globe.</i>

864
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,012
I'm going to interview Dr Bernardo
for a story in our Sunday supplement.

865
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,096
- A reporter, huh?
- Mm-hm.

866
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,176
You know, you're kinda cute.

867
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,530
Why don't you just watch the road, huh?

868
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,093
What's your name?

869
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,688
Helen Lacey. What's yours?

870
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,969
Victor.

871
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,056
Victor Shackelpopolous.

872
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,937
<i>(mumbling)</i>

873
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,856
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here?

874
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,056
I think he wants us to come in.

875
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,815
The doctor is expecting us, so, uh...

876
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,856
Look at this place!

877
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,699
It's really great.
Is your decorator still living?

878
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,538
It's chilly!

879
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,696
Uh... So... So, what d'you think?

880
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,175
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here or... what?

881
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,256
I am Dr Bernardo.

882
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,536
You must be Victor.

883
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,537
And Miss Lacey.

884
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,413
Igor!

885
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,929
I thought I told you
to keep to your room.

886
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,856
<i>(mumbling)</i>

887
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,696
Forgive him.

888
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,776
He usually keeps to his room.

889
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,051
I know there's a big problem
with domestics nowadays.

890
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,136
Come.

891
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,216
Shall we have dinner?

892
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,296
<i>(whispers)</i> Yeah.

893
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,298
I understand you're famous
for your potato pancakes.

894
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,253
Dr Bernardo, you don't know
how excited I am to be here.

895
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,336
I've waited so long to meet you!

896
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,770
I'm really looking forward to
helping you with your experiments.

897
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,856
Have you read my latest book...

898
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,972
<i>... Advanced Sexual Positions:</i>
<i>How To Achieve Them Without Laughing?</i>

899
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,056
It's getting to be a classic.

900
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,136
I'm familiar with it.

901
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,569
It's wonderful how you men of science...

902
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,611
...have finally gotten around to sex.

903
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,892
The girls at <i>The Globe</i> are so pleased with
your work on respiration during orgasm.

904
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,170
A mere trifle compared to my real work.

905
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,495
Doctor, I read a statement you made.

906
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,738
You felt the average length
of a man's penis should be 19 inches.

907
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,816
Doesn't that seem a little long?

908
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,219
Long?!

909
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:59,332
My friend, I'm making discoveries
you wouldn't dream of!

910
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,850
Yes, I know. But... But 19 inches...
I mean, that's...

911
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,857
<i>(doctor)</i> Does that sound mad?!

912
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,132
That's what they called me at
Masters' and Johnson's clinic. Mad!

913
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,820
Because I had visions of explorations...

914
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,376
...in sexual areas undreamed of
by lesser human beings!

915
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,937
It was I who first discovered how to
make a man impotent by hiding his hat!

916
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,858
I was the first one
to explain the connection...

917
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,529
...between excessive masturbation
and entering politics.

918
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,616
It was I who first said...

919
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,618
...that clitoral orgasm
should not be only for women.

920
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,493
They laughed at me,
ridiculed me, said I was mad!

921
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,611
Ha-ha! But I showed them!

922
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,413
Ha-ha! They threw me out
of Masters' and Johnson's.

923
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,496
No severance pay. And I had it coming!

924
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,611
But I showed them! <i>(manic laugh)</i>

925
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,896
Are we having dessert?

926
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,538
Oh, come. I want to show you
my laboratory.

927
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,496
Igor!

928
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,975
<i>(mumbling)</i>

929
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,170
Clean up this table, and hurry!

<i>(mumbling)</i>

01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,736
You must forgive Igor.

932
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,011
He was part of an experiment
of mine that backfired.

933
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,179
Using an electrical generator,
I gave him a four-hour orgasm.

934
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,258
He had fun, but he turned out like this.

935
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,256
Well...

936
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,136
Posture. Posture!

937
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,336
Here it is. Here's where
I'm discovering new facts about sex.

Goddammit! Who flashed
the scared expression?! C'mon!

Anybody press "frightened"?

1092
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,415
No one! Must be
a short circuit somewhere.

- D'you think we'll get out this time?

1099

I hope it's not another false alarm.

Yeah, but I heard it was all mental.

Sorry.

1104
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,850
Heart factors are all balanced.
We could use more adrenaline.

This is the adrenal gland.
We're pumping away here.

Oh, my God, Sydney! Can't you wait?

You wanna do it right here
in the parking lot?

Signal the voice to answer yes!

I know you can do it, boys! Pull!

Come on, fellas! What's the matter?
Don't just stand there!

What's the matter, Sydney?

1125
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:40,169
- Maintain hands on breasts.
- We're having trouble with respiration.

1126
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,416
We're <i>way</i> over the limit down here.

If you're not getting an erection,
something's wrong.

1128

Proceed with erection. All systems go.

What the hell's going on down here?

1132

We need an erection.

1133
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:58,255
We need more help from the brain room.

1134

Maybe there's some trouble
in the stomach.

1135
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,136
Fettucine is moving along nicely.

1136
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,212
A couple of injuries from
the veal scallopini, though.

1137
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,615
I'm not laughing, Sydney, honestly!

1138
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,490
Now kiss me.

1139
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,339
We have an erection of 45 degrees.

1140
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,453
- Shall we attempt penetration?
- Prepare for penetration.

1141
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:26,728
- Well, this looks like it.
- Do you know what it's like out there?

1142
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,658
It's like they told us
in training school. It's an ovum.

1143
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,055
I'm scared. I don't wanna go.

1144
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,899
This is what all this training was for.

Who <i>knows</i> what
it's gonna be like out there?

1146
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,536
You saw slides in class.

01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,135
Yeah, but... you hear
these strange stories.

1148
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,820
Like, there's this pill these women take.

1149
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:49,649
Or sometimes the guys slam their heads
up against a wall of hard rubber.

1150

<i>(sperm #1)</i> Oh, that's nonsense.

it's a homosexual encounter?

1152
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,700
<i>(sperm #2)</i> This is no time
to doubt our mission.

1153
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:02,689
You took an oath when you went to sperm
school. To fertilise an ovum, or die trying.

1154
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,334
No, I'm scared. I don't wanna go out there.

1155
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,372
We're too low to attempt penetration.
The men can't hold!

1156
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,092
We <i>gotta</i> hold!

1157
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,176
We need more stimulation.

1158
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,258
Organ room to brain control.
Re-stimulate pleasure centre.

1159
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,611
- Prepare to stroke her thighs.
- We're on the thighs and stroking.

1160
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,619
Attention, mouth. Attention, mouth.
Please blow in her ear.

1161
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,174
Erection is at 45 degrees and holding fast.

1162
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,690
Readjust mouth. We're missing her ear
and blowing into her nose.

1163
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,809
Attempt penetration.

1164
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,453
Thrust!

1165
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,492
Ah, it'll never work. The angle's bad.

1166

Hey, we're gonna make babies!

1167

This is Mission Control. Penetrate!

It's no use! We're losing it!

1174

Start preparing an alibi to save face.

1175
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:20,055
We found him tampering with
the machinery in the cerebral cortex...

1176
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,378
...turning up the guilt reflex.
- That's a lie. I never touched anything!

1177
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,173
- It's a lie, sir.
- I work in the conscience room.

1178
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,417
We found the conscience tied to a chair.
He'd knocked him out.

1179
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,974
- Is this true?
- What if it is?

1180
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,660
Don't you think
you should be ashamed of this?!

1181
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,658
Sexual relations
between unmarried people?!

1182

1183
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,331
...and assault her in a brutal,
sadistic, ungodlike manner is...

01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,212
...blasphemy!

1185
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,296
Lock him up.

1186
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,331
Sabotage is over.

1187
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,416
Blasphemy!

1188
