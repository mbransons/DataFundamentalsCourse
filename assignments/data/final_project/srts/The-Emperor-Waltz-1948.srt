1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,200
- Hello, Countess.
- How did you get here?

3
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,800
Through the window.
Forgot to mail me
my invitation.

4
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,180
- Go away.
- No.

5
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,103
- I said go away.
- And I said no.

6
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,377
- What do you want now?
- I had to see you just once more.

7
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,033
I have nothing to say to you.

8
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,408
Don't want you to say anything.
I want you to listen.

9
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:20,054
Can't we go somewhere
and talk?

10
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,322
I hate you,
loathe you, despise you.

11
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,486
You didn't always.
There was a time you loved me.

12
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,424
- Wasn't there, Countess?
- Swine.

13
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,767
The Emperor will have them
shot, both of them!

14
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:42,453
Let me see.

15
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:45,220
That the lenses of these opera glasses
don't crack for shame!

16
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,619
Isn't that the daughter
of Baron Holenia?

17
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:51,541
Yes. Johanna Augusta
Franziska, Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg,

18
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,416
- disgracing every syllable of her name.
- But who is he?

19
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,580
- That's the man, that's the one.
- That's the who?

20
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,650
The man. Haven't you heard?
Where have you been?

21
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,631
In a mud bath in Bad Nauheim,
trying to cure my poor heart.

22
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,769
- I'd forgotten your heart.
- It's nothing. Don't stop now.

23
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,048
Very well, you've asked for it.

24
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:09,664
It's a love affair that has rocked
all Vienna for the past 4 months.

25
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,094
Who is he?

26
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,634
The most vulgar, impossible,
obnoxious, ill-mannered...

27
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,710
- In one word, an American.
- No!

28
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,310
Yes. And low
even among Americans.

29
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,704
He's what they call
a traveling salesman.

30
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,328
A traveling salesman
and a baron's daughter.

31
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,585
You heard about the attempt
on the Emperor's life?

32
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,159
- That's the man.
- Mercy!

33
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,554
He swindled an appointment
with His Majesty...

34
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,336
by presenting himself
as a great potentate.

35
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:36,477
Later, it transpired he was
a very minor potentate...

36
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,270
in an American organization
known as the Shriners.

37
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:42,948
I remember the day he came
to the palace with his nasty little dog...

38
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,586
and a mysterious,
sinister black box.

39
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,227
Do you know what was
in that box?

40
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:08,415
How are you today?

41
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,377
Will you follow me, please?

42
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,840
Here, Buttons.
Stop chewing that gum.

43
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,844
Here, give it to me.
Come here.

44
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,915
Scheherazade, please.
Remember your manners.

45
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,263
And do stop fidgeting
with your moustache.

46
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,383
I'm not nervous. I know perfectly well
why the Emperor has summoned us.

47
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,899
So do I. He's found out
You belong in jail.

48
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,193
You're talking to your father.

49
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,634
That's what's so depressing.
My own father, a scoundrel.

50
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,620
Mortgaging the mortgage on our castle
which was already mortgaged.

51
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,094
How was I to know?

52
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,574
I'm not a businessman:
I'm a general.

53
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,118
Then taking the money and
gambling it away in a single night.

54
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:38,399
The cards were marked.

55
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,085
Two duels already this season,

56
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,806
Named as corespondent in the divorce
of some suburban pastry baker,

57
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,920
sued by a young lady in
the chorus at the opera...

58
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,330
because you promised her
the lead in Aida.

59
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,870
The little fool.

60
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,454
I'm not the director
of the opera, I'm a general.

61
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,570
As I was trying to say
16 insults ago,

62
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,657
I don't believe
the Emperor summoned us
on account of me at all.

63
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,220
He summoned us
on account of you.

64
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,239
Me? What have I done?

65
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:06,735
I have an idea someone has
expressed an interest in you...

66
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,850
and the Emperor wants
to arrange a marriage.

67
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,821
Oh, nonsense. His Majesty
knows I'm still in mourning.

68
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,852
Two years of mourning for a husband
you couldn't endure, is enough.

69
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,266
Yes, I see a highly satisfactory
new marriage.

70
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,258
Some member of the Belgian
diplomatic corps,

71
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,290
or perhaps
a Russian duke.

72
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:28,008
I like Russians, don't you?
Money just oozes from them.

73
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,118
And, dear Papa,
You could always mortgage the Kremlin.

74
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:44,877
His Excellency
the General Baron Holenia...

75
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,110
and the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

76
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:01,984
Oh, Baron Holenia.

77
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,063
My dear Johanna.
Oh, get up.

78
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,625
Sorry I can't kiss your hand.
Bad cold.

79
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,368
And how is Scheherazade?

80
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,810
You're wearing new perfume,
aren't you?

81
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,172
Even I can smell it
with my stuffed up nose.

82
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,547
Oh, sit down, do.

83
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,560
Louis, come on.
Say hello to Scheherazade.

84
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,102
Why do they always pick a damp day
for me to inaugurate a bridge...

85
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,508
or open a horticultural
exhibition, or...

86
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,901
Oh, well. Mustn't grumble.

87
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,500
It's the hazard
of the profession.

88
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,946
If I may be permitted
a suggestion,

89
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,170
has Your Majesty tried
pine needles in boiling water,

90
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,240
inhaling the vapor
under a towel?

91
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,219
Pine needles?
Certainly not.

92
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,580
Shouldn't want my whiskers
to smell like 2 old Christmas trees.

93
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:53,360
Has, uh, anything particular
come up lately?

94
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:57,258
You ask that?
Look at my desk.

95
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,990
Reports, complaints,
unforgivable stupidities,

96
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,563
downright dishonesty, thievery!

97
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,461
Go on,
look at them.

98
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,370
I'd rather not,
Your Majesty.

99
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,719
I don't blame you.

100
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,179
Now, do you know why
I summoned you here today?

101
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,350
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...

102
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,980
We have rather an inkling,
Your Majesty.

103
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,756
Then what are you
looking so gloomy about?

104
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,047
Don't you approve
of the alliance?

105
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,282
Alliance?

106
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,404
A marriage!

107
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,665
Do you or don't you know
what 'm talking about?

108
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,060
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...

109
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,125
We have rather
an inkling, Your Majesty.

110
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,907
This match
means a great deal to me.

111
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,629
I've given it infinite thought.

112
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,864
I've looked up the blood lines
 on both sides.

113
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,008
Fine, fine.
One couldn't ask for better.

114
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,234
Thank you, Your Majesty.

115
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,980
I brought Johanna up to realize
that blood comes first.

116
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,375
What pleases me most,
both lines are very prolific.

117
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,008
Oh, little embarrassing
to talk about this.

118
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,049
Not at all, Your Majesty.

119
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,350
I anticipate
superb offspring.

120
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,790
And I'm going to be
a little greedy about them.

121
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,756
Greedy?

122
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,485
Well, I'm a lonely man.

123
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,899
I've lost my wife,
my son.

124
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,460
It'll warm my heart to see
the little things crawling around.

125
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,469
A great honor.

126
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,054
If there are five, I want three.
Is that exorbitant?

127
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,032
Your Majesty!

128
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,324
Don't be picayune,
if it will give the Emperor any happiness.

129
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,500
- As for the bridegroom,
- Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:21,170
I think the union should be
brought about as quickly as possible.

131
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,579
Of course, Your Majesty.

132
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,977
Spry as he is,
he's a rather elderly gentleman.

133
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,380
- How old, Your Majesty.
- Twelve.

134
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,873
Twelve!
- Johanna, what possible import...

135
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:33,218
Twelve?

136
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,250
Not quite. He will be
on the 7th of September.

137
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,230
I suggest that the nuptials
take place in my kennels.

138
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,592
Kennels?
With all that barking going on?

139
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,724
We're talking about the poodles!

140
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,305
His Majesty's dog is asking
for the paw of Scheherazade.

141
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,110
Ohhh. Of course.
I'm no fool.

142
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,227
Scheherazade,
did you hear of your engagement?

143
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,825
What do you say?

144
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,555
How about
a piece of sugar?

145
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:58,786
I'd love it.

146
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,782
Buttons, come here, come here.
Pull yourself together.

147
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,665
You'll spoil the sale for me.
You want to eat, don't you?

148
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,985
Must have wound
the mainspring too tight.

149
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,220
It's not supposed to do that
'til I pull the switch.

150
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,680
There's a plot on the life of the Emperor.
A time bomb!

151
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,360
That black box!

152
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,758
What's the matter?

153
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,665
I guess you'd like to know
what this is.

154
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,790
I'm not telling.
I'm gonna work it on the Emperor first.

155
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,160
What a bang he's gonna get out of it.
This is gonna kill him!

156
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,875
Ho-ho! Am I laughing?
Got a match? Here we are.

157
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,600
He'll be in sections.
This is gonna kill him.

158
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,297
You'll pardon my intrusion,
Your Majesty.

159
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,590
Will Your Majesty please
make all the haste possible?

160
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,390
- What is it now?
- A precautionary measure, Your Majesty.

161
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,438
- There seems to be an assassin.
- Oh, dear.

162
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,200
This gets to be
such a bore. Sorry.

163
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,160
Here. Here now!
What's the idea? Come here!

164
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,860
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, you! Wait a minute!

165
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:38,766
What's the matter with you?

166
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,102
Are you crazy?
You're under arrest!

167
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,980
- Let go of me!
- And drop that dog, you dogs!

168
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,010
Search him! Now,
who are your confederates?
We want every name.

169
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,650
Is this the Emperor's palace
or a loony bin?

170
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,320
You came here as a potentate.
Are you a potentate?

171
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,450
I may have stretched things a little,
but I'm a Shriner. Paid up.

172
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,930
- You're a nihilist.
- I am not. I'm a Presbyterian.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,590
A lie again. It says here
that you're a salesman.

174
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,500
Listen, wobble-face, isn't it possible
to be a Presbyterian Shriner salesman?

175
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,454
- You're trying to confuse me.
- I am also a registered Democrat,

176
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,440
a member of the Chamber of Commerce,
a sandlot third baseman, and I...

177
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,450
Not so fast!
I have to talk fast.

178
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,280
If I don't, my sample's
gonna rust in your fish pond.

179
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,920
Careful!
It might explode.

180
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,157
- I wish it would.
- It cannot. The powder's all wet.

181
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,490
It must be some new model
with a cannon attached.

182
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,227
You must be an old windbag
with a blabbermouth attached.

183
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,712
I never saw such
a bunch of ignoramuses.

184
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,946
Here, Buttons,
we'll show 'em the trademark.

185
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,508
Does that mean anything to you?

186
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,602
It doesn't, hey?

187
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:44,030
Well, it's an invention.
A talking machine.

188
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:47,165
A new kind of American thingamabob.
Watch this.

189
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,235
We have a record, we put it
on the machine thus.

190
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,010
We start the works in this manner.
Drop the needle in that fashion.

191
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,243
Something wrong here.
What do you... What's going on?

192
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:07,399
This is not standard equipment.

193
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,415
With Your Majesty's permission,
Your Majesty may come out now.

194
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,431
About time. I was beginning
to feel like a corkscrew.

195
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,230
- What was it this time?
- A false alarm, Your Majesty.

196
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,783
An American salesman
trying to force his way in.

197
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,322
A most persistent breed,
these Americans.

198
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,970
One threw himself
in front of my carriage.

199
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,386
He was selling brushes.

200
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:46,525
Wanted me to buy
two for my whiskers.

201
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,270
Also a clothes brush, shoe brush,
nail brush and a tooth brush.

202
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,174
Incredible.

203
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:53,454
We finally bought a mop
and had him deported.

204
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:54,929
Where were we now?

205
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:57,165
The dogs, Your Majesty.
The final arrangements.

206
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:00,697
Oh, yes. Louis and I will be
at my hunting lodge in the Tyrol...

207
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,033
for the next three weeks.

208
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:04,950
I want you to come and stay with me
and bring Scheherazade.

209
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,353
We are most honored,
Your Majesty.

210
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,556
I think the happy couple will find
the mountain air quite invigorating.

211
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,939
As to transportation, have you
any objections to the horseless carriage?

212
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,205
None whatever, Your Majesty.

213
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:17,184
Then I'll send my automobile
to bring you up next Tuesday.

214
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,430
Good-bye, Baron.
Good-bye, my dear Johanna.

215
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,200
May I personally guarantee Your Majesty
a most glorious litter?

216
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,978
Thank you.
I shall see you in the mountains.

217
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,870
Everybody return
to his quarters.

218
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,369
No tradesperson
is permitted in the palace.

219
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,009
You will pack that squalling abomination
and leave at once!

220
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,550
- Out! Out! Out!
- Oh, no, I don't.

221
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,690
I'm gonna wait 'til it dries
and show it to the old boy,

222
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,509
as per my appointment!

223
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,079
- To whom will you show it?
- To the Emperor.

224
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,000
If you play ball, I won't tell him
what a monkey You made out of yourself.

225
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,447
You will never see
the Emperor.

226
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:54,210
I'd protect His Majesty from that object
as I'd protect him from a bomb.

227
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,710
You listen to me, chubby, I didn't come
to Austria to run into that kind of guff.

228
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,884
I came here to put that machine
over and I'm gonna.

229
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:02,510
I'm gonna sell 5,000,
10,000, 20,000.

230
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,710
Not in Austria,
I assure you.

231
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,050
We do not take to cheap,
blatant innovations.

232
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,890
You're a bunch of dusty old aunties,
scared of anything new.

233
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,890
You wouldn't have put in
the electric light,

234
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,950
bought an automobile,
only the Emperor did.

235
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,830
He's gonna buy the first one
of these and endorse it.

236
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,432
And when he does,
you watch the sales skyrocket.

237
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,154
Yo-ho! They're going up.

238
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,570
And perhaps you will take
a photograph of our Emperor...

239
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,853
looking into that horn,
in place of your dog.

240
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,697
Don't you realize this is the greatest thing
that's happened to the Holenias...

241
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,822
in ten generations?
- Will it pay the butcher's bill?

242
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,931
What butcher would dare present his bill
to the Emperor's brother-in-law?

243
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,380
- What was that?
- My poor demented daughter...

244
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,850
don't you realize we've just become
part of the Emperor's family?

245
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,150
All because of some
arrangement about puppies?

246
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,190
Thanks to those puppies
Your father is now...

247
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,320
the most important man in the monarchy,
inseparable from the Emperor.

248
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,947
He and I will sit together
waiting for them to be born.

249
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,173
We'll feed the little things
with medicine droppers,

250
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,751
spread newspapers for them,
take them on walks.

251
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,494
I shall have the Emperor's ear
and advise him on matters of state.

252
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,087
I may become
ambassador to Paris,

253
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,314
or minister of finance.
-  Oh, not that, Father.

254
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:09,759
As for you, Johanna,
magnificent vistas have opened up.

255
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:14,180
What's wrong with the young king of Spain?
Or there's an English princeling.

256
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,120
Father, to return to the butcher,
how are we to provide...

257
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,420
meat for the bride, if she's
to be kept alive for the happy event?

258
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,525
Don't be ridiculous. We now have
all the credit in the world.

259
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,619
So Vienna thought
we had gone to the dogs?

260
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,603
Gone to the dogs, indeed!

261
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,947
Stop dawdling. We've endured
your presence long enough.

262
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,680
Aw, your emperor's sideburns!

263
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,621
What are you doing now?

264
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,790
Disrobing in the palace grounds?

265
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,213
What a fussy old dude you are.

266
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:46,034
You're worse than a
worm on a hot rock.

267
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,423
I'll give you one more minute
to get that object out of here!

268
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,275
That's what's known
as Viennese charm, Buttons.

269
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,460
If you ever see me order
wienerschnitzel again,

270
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,298
you can spit right in my eye!

271
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,517
Here, Buttons.
Come back here.

272
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,267
- Hey, Buttons!
- Go away, You nasty mongrel!

273
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:16,556
What are you up to?
You bad dog, you. Here!

274
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,611
What's the matter?

275
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,610
Hey! Hey, you!

276
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,287
This dog is bleedin'.
What did you do to my dog?

277
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,056
- Stop! Hey!
- That's enough!

278
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:26,969
You bet it is.

279
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,944
We've been kicked around,
thrown in the water, snapped at, bitten.

280
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,930
Who do those people
think they are?

281
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,090
They are His Excellency,
Baron Holenia...

282
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,111
and the Countess Von
Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

283
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,824
Where do they live?

284
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,070
The Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg palace
on Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg Square.

285
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,119
That's a lot of Stolzenberg.

286
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,404
And don't tell us to get out
'cause we're gittin'.

287
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,940
- You rang, sir?
- Does a black dog live here?

288
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,140
- I beg your pardon?
- A French poodle about that size.

289
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,300
Tell her she has to see
a man about a dog.

290
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,767
Perhaps if you would clarify
the nature of your business, S Ir.

291
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,560
Hey, you!

292
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,384
What's the idea of just running off
after your dog has bitten my dog?

293
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:31,024
I don't expect decent
manners of that thing,

294
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,514
but human beings we expect
to act halfway human.

295
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:37,517
Take off your hat.

296
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,231
Look at that leg.

297
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:43,346
Bitten clear to the bone.
It bled all over my rented suit.

298
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,600
I doubt if my birds
care for the smell of your hat.

299
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,962
Fry your birds!
I'm talkin' about my dog.

300
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:52,077
Your dog ought to have a muzzle
and not a leather muzzle, a steel one.

301
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,994
Don't let him upset you, darling.

302
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,250
Look at that silly haircut.

303
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,634
Who trims her,
the guy that trims your hedges?

304
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,806
What is it that you want?

305
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,844
Damages for your mongrel,
money for cleaning your trousers?

306
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:05,119
I want a saliva test made of her,
and I want it right now

307
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,527
You want what?

308
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,994
A saliva test.
She may be mad.

309
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,030
That silly lookin' thing
may have the rabies!

310
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,260
I'll thank you not to use such vile words
when you talk about her.

311
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,712
All right, hydrophobia, then.

312
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,424
Have you watched
her for symptoms?

313
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,853
Has she been frothing
at the mouth?

314
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,392
Does her bark sound croupy?

315
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,861
My dear man, if either of these
two dogs is mad, it's yours.

316
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,147
My veterinary goes over Scheherazade
from snout to tail every week.

317
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,210
She's a dog of superb pedigree
and she gets superb care.

318
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, listen, any mutt
can have rabies.

319
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,572
For the last time, will you stop
referring to her as a mutt?

320
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,020
Have you ever heard of blood lines?
Hers goes back to the 18th century.

321
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:43,460
Hmpf. His goes back to as far
as they've been havin' dogs.

322
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,281
Perhaps you've heard
of one of her ancestors,

323
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,284
Papillion,
the poodle of Marie Antoinette.

324
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,283
They were both guillotined
in the French Revolution.

325
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,197
Smart move.

326
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,270
Her father belongs
to Czar Nicholas of Russia.

327
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,400
- You don't say.
- Her mother to the Infanta of Spain.

328
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,070
His mother belongs to a milkman
in Springfield, Illinois. And his father...

329
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,200
His father. Well,
You've got me there.

330
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,197
Her twin brothers belong to a Cardinal
and live in the Vatican.

331
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,810
As for Scheherazade herself,
she has just become engaged...

332
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,910
to the dog of His Majesty,
Francis Joseph the First.

333
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,980
Yeah? Well, Buttons' brother helps a kid
named Stinky O'Hara deliver newspapers...

334
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,320
and his sister was making an
honest living as a watchdog...

335
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,390
until she was hit
by the Baltimore and Ohio.

336
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,030
- How really fascinating.
- If your poodle is so classy...

337
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,900
how come she doesn't know better than
to go around biting a nice little dog?

338
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,400
If your animal is so clever, it should
know better than to approach a dog...

339
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,410
of an entirely different class.

340
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,085
All he did is go up to her and say,
"How do you do?" That's all.

341
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,710
He thrust his ugly, ill-bred
little face right at hers.

342
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,173
- And for that she bit him.
- Certainly.

343
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,173
And she was right?

344
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,548
Absolutely. There are such
things as class distinctions.

345
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,880
- How's that?
- Class distinctions, I said.

346
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:43,250
I thought that's what you said.
Two kinds of blood you mean?

347
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,634
Blue blood and the kind we have.

348
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:46,650
The kind you get at the
five and ten cent store.

349
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,060
Precisely. You must admit
there's a difference between...

350
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:52,212
Stinky O-something-or-other
and the Emperor of Austria.

351
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,298
There is the lowbred
and the highbred.

352
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:57,230
If the lowbred has the impertinence
to come distastefully close,

353
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,962
what can he expect
but to be bitten?

354
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,798
- Is that so?
- It is.

355
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,361
Okay.
Now you bite me.

356
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:49,245
I would have horsewhipped him
then and there, the revolting little plebian.

357
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,650
You saw him. Ears like a bat
and the rest of him like a plucked duck.

358
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,634
Perhaps there's more to him
than meets the eye.

359
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,860
So it would seem
from what happened in the mountains.

360
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,674
What happened in the mountains?

361
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,095
A conflagration of
the wildest passion...

362
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:05,400
- Please! Remember the archduchess's heart.
- Go on. What happened?

363
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,670
- For your own sake, Isabella.
- Oh, go on,

364
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,140
or I shall fling myself
from this balcony.

365
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,150
All right, it's your heart.
It seems that that little horror...

366
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,150
found out the Emperor
was going to the Tyrol.

367
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,745
So being an American...

368
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,212
They'll do anything in their
mad pursuit of the almighty dollar.

369
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,267
 If you feel a song

370
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,697
 Then let the song begin

371
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:22,301
 And you'll find the friendly mountains
joining in

372
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,980
Joining in

373
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:33,033
 Loosen up your pipes

374
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,900
 And brother you can bet

375
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:41,225
 It's as pretty
as a barbershop quartet

376
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,230
 Quartet
 Quartet

377
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,610
 Quartet
 Quartet

378
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,440
 Quartet
 Quartet

379
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,540
 Quartet

380
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,820
 Quartet

381
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,190
 You can raise your voice

382
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,130
 And sing out hip-hooray

383
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,130
 But it always comes back

384
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,680
 Give the birds a break

385
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,163
 And hustle up a song

386
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,480
 And let the friendly mountains

387
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,585
 Sing along

388
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,950
 If you feel a song

389
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,038
 Then let the song begin

390
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,624
 And you'll find the friendly mountains
joining in

391
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,499
 When your melody

392
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,070
 Goes rollin' 'round the sky

393
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,522
 Well you'll feel that
You're a pretty nifty guy

394
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,913
Pretty nifty guy

395
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,983
Pretty nifty guy

396
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,569
Pretty nifty guy

397
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,311
You there, halt!

398
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,686
I just wanted
to look the place over.

399
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,600
It's very nice too.
Come on, Buttons.

400
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,342
No visitors while
our Emperor's in residence.

401
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:52,428
- Is he in there now?
- It's the hunting season.

402
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,120
When he hunts, doesn't he
come out here once in a while?

403
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,320
- Every morning. Early. 4 o'clock.
- Through this gate?

404
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,690
Through this gate, down that road,
through this gorge and up that mountain.

405
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,600
Down that road, through that gorge
and up that mountain, huh?

406
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:26,650
With your very kind permission,
the car is boiling.

407
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,480
Well, don't stand there.
Get some cool water from some brook.

408
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,670
With your very kind permission,
I shall.

409
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,620
We're almost there,
Scheherazade.

410
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,990
You better take her goggles off.
They give her a headache.

411
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,389
She's perfectly all right,
Father.

412
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,538
Her nose is dry and hot.
She's running a temperature.

413
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,491
- I told you she should have worn her blanket!
- Don't be hysterical, Father.

414
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,070
How can I help
being hysterical?

415
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,741
If she should come down
with distemper... Heaven forbid!

416
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:52,686
Relax. Breathe in
this heavenly air!

417
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,928
Yes, it'll do her good.

418
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,174
This Tyrol...
It's like a vast oxygen tent.

419
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,288
Listen to that yodel.
It's the voice of Austria.

420
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,053
Mountain-born,
deep-rooted, eternal.

421
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:14,819
What is it, Scheherazade?

422
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,295
What's biting you,
anyway?

423
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,733
Here, Buttons.
Come here.

424
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:30,999
Scheherazade!
Catch her!

425
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:33,741
Come here!

426
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,350
Scheherazade!

427
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,330
Let her go!
He's biting her, he's killing her!

428
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,890
Take that black beast
out of here! Whoa!

429
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,561
Here, here, here.

430
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,428
There.

431
00:33:58,225 --> 00:33:59,180
Yoo-hoo.

432
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,310
- This I find outrageous!
- Small world, isn't it?

433
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,510
- Are you following me?
- No. Are you?

434
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,319
This is the same objectionable American,
isn't it?

435
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:08,304
I'll take care of him.
Get Scheherazade in the car.

436
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:09,991
I'll give her some brandy.

437
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:13,124
If you don't mind,
I should like to ask you a few questions.

438
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,754
You look mighty sweet in that.

439
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,614
Like a piece of candy
wrapped up in tissue paper.

440
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,514
Exactly why are you here,
dressed like that?

441
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:21,700
If I wanted to make a deal with the Sultan
of Morocco, I'd come dressed like a dervish.

442
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,672
You're here on business?

443
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:25,354
They don't pay my expenses
to come up here and yodel.

444
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,077
Ah, yes, I've heard of that
peculiar object you're peddling.

445
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,240
- You wish to sell it to the Emperor?
- That's right.

446
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,063
You're here at His
Majesty's request?

447
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:33,424
Let's not get technical.

448
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,546
Where are you staying?

449
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,404
Down in the village
at the Golden Fiddle Inn.

450
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,980
They have a very attractive
upstairs maid. A redhead.

451
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,389
Exactly how will you manage
to see His Majesty?

452
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,944
I shan't see him: he's going
to see me. Or hear me.

453
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,320
- Or rather, he's gonna hear my machine.
- Go on.

454
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,560
Every morning he goes out
shooting deer.

455
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,928
He goes out his gate, down that gorge
and up that mountain.

456
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,660
One of these mornings I shall
hide behind a tree or something,

457
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,730
get my machine set up
and suddenly...

458
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,040
- And then?
- Once he hears it it'll be a cinch.

459
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,810
He'll say, "How come that beautiful band
is up here playing...

460
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,070
in these little bitty
old doggone hills of mine?

461
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,358
That's what he'll say?

462
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:11,460
Yes. And I shall pop from
behind my tree and say,

463
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:13,811
"Emp, that's no band,
that's a phonograph.

464
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,580
Come over here
and see for yourself."

465
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,342
Very clever. Only it won't work.

466
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,174
Why won't it?

467
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,850
Because the Emperor will not
hear that loathsome apparatus.

468
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,160
Because you will not be
hiding behind any trees.

469
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,260
Because no tradesman can presume
on the Emperor of Austria.

470
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,539
You're to go straight to your
hotel, pack and leave immediately,

471
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:29,624
you and that dog.

472
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,124
- Who'd gonna make us?
- The police.

473
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:33,063
Like fun, they will.
I'm an American citizen.

474
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,394
He's an American dog.

475
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,022
I have a passport.
He has a dog licence.

476
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,510
If you don't leave voluntarily,
the gendarmes will come...

477
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,655
and take you and your dog by the nape
of your necks and throw you on the train.

478
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,010
Try anything like that and you're
gonna get in a peck of trouble.

479
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,080
Don't forget that Teddy Roosevelt
still carries a big stick.

480
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,881
- Who carries what?
- You start a fight with me...

481
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:53,190
and he'll have the United States Army
here so fast it'll make your head swim.

482
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,460
Johanna, get in the car.
Scheherazade has fainted twice.

483
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,381
The Army, Navy and the Marines,
You understand?

484
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:02,069
And don't forget we're building a little
something called the Panama Canal.

485
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:03,235
What's he talking about?

486
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,006
You'll find out when we
won't let your ships through.

487
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:08,000
You'll have to go all the way
down around South America.

488
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,670
Or else you'll have to go all the way
up north where it's so cold that...

489
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,577
The first train out of here.
You, your apparatus and dog.

490
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:14,851
Especially that dog.

491
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:18,039
We'll fix you in Washington.
What we'll do to your ambassador!

492
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,605
We'll boycott your product!

493
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,644
The Blue Danube forbidden
by act of congress!

494
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,342
Shut up!

495
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,920
- Johanna.
- Come in, Father.

496
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:46,163
Aren't you getting dressed?

497
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:47,731
They're all downstairs
on the terrace.

498
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,819
- Quiet, Father.
- Have you glanced out the window?

499
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,178
The Emperor has invited us with a group
that offers rather interesting possibilities.

500
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:56,592
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. It's Scheherazade.

501
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,561
- What's wrong now?
- The Emperor's veterinary is with her.

502
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,210
- She's had a nervous breakdown.
- A nervous...

503
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,639
- No!
- A complete collapse.

504
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:09,483
They were bathing her and
she was perfectly all right...

505
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,881
'til she saw another dog,
a small dachshund.

506
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,140
She began screaming.
They tested her with another dog,

507
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,592
a tiny chihuahua:
the same hysteria.

508
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:20,447
When they brought in the
Emperor's dog to calm her,

509
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,874
she broke loose, jumped through
a window and ran amok.

510
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,624
Apparently, she can't stand
the sight of another dog.

511
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,180
- Has the Emperor been told?
- Not yet.

512
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,389
We hope the veterinary
will be able to do something.

513
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,850
That inconsiderate,
ungrateful black animal!

514
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:35,256
Jeopardizing all our chances!

515
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,803
Come here.

516
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,100
The Hungarian officer
playing cards,

517
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:51,038
that's Prince Istvan
Barlossy de Baloshasa.

518
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:53,030
I met him in Budapest.
Didn't like him very much.

519
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,913
Nonsense. Since then he's inherited
half of Buda and a large part of Pest.

520
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,936
What have you against the
Marques Alonso Lafuente?

521
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:01,104
Which one is he?

522
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,642
The handsome one with
the tennis racket.

523
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,819
Greatest family in Andalusia.

524
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,280
Castles in Spain, literally.
Seven of them.

525
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,733
You still haven't mentioned
the best possibility.

526
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,022
Do you mean
Duke Ferdi Lindendorf?

527
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,913
No, the Princess Bitotska.
I'm thinking of you, Father.

528
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:18,210
Don't be disgusting.

529
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:20,182
She's had her one good eye
on you for years.

530
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:21,598
She's old enough
to be my mother.

531
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:23,389
She still plays tennis.

532
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,163
She ought to be in a wheelchair,
the arthritic old horror.

533
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:29,491
Let's go and see if that beast
of yours is feeling any better.

534
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:38,428
I repeat: It is extremely important
that the patient speak anything in her mind.

535
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:39,834
Anything at all.

536
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:42,351
We need a complete
stream of consciousness.

537
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,694
Is that clear?

538
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:46,795
Thank you very much.

539
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,519
Now, I would like to know
all about your dreams.

540
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:50,991
You dream,
I presume?

541
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:54,952
All right.
What do you dream?

542
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,577
Is it a recurrent dream?

543
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:01,474
Very good.

544
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:03,725
A typical anxiety dream.

545
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,131
What is all this, Doctor?

546
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,983
Please! This is
a very serious case.

547
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:12,702
Indubitably a psychoneurosis,
sometimes called a neuropsychosis.

548
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,890
Fortunately, I went
to the University of Vienna...

549
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,905
with a young doctor
by the name Freud.

550
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:20,295
He has created
a curative method:

551
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:25,235
the analysis of the psyche
by delving into the subconscious.

552
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,522
Now I must ask
for your earliest recollections.

553
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,350
Your father and mother:
Was their home life congenial?

554
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,238
Doctor, stop torturing her.
I can tell you what's wrong.

555
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,796
She had a fight with a dog.

556
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:41,830
She did?

557
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,936
Twice. Once in Vienna and
once this very afternoon.

558
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:45,913
The same dog.

559
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,545
You see? That's what
leads to wrong diagnoses.

560
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:51,428
Patients withhold things.
What kind of a dog?

561
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,272
American.
Small, white, male.

562
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,470
- What was his name?
- Buttons.

563
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,694
Let's test it.

564
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,077
Buttons!

565
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,184
Absolutely clear now.

566
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:08,889
A fear complex.

567
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,553
Frightened by one dog,
now afraid of all dogs.

568
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,085
- I may kill her.
- Is there a cure?

569
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:17,634
In some cases. The patient has developed
what I and my colleague, Dr. Freud, call

570
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,730
a mental block.

571
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,920
What is the cure,
Doctor?

572
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,170
The frightened one must realize
she has nothing to be afraid of.

573
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:27,302
In other words, we must
bring the two dogs together.

574
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,420
- That's impossible.
- It is imperative.

575
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,970
I gave orders to have them both removed.
The man and the dog.

576
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,295
I may kill you.

577
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:35,724
Without the other dog,
I see very black.

578
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,982
Maybe it's not too late.

579
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,464
Come, darling,
don't tremble like that.

580
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,850
Don't be nervous.
Everything's going to be...

581
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,931
With your very kind permission,
exactly what inn was it?

582
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:00,144
The Fiddle Inn.

583
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,292
There are three Fiddle
Inns: the Green Fiddle,

584
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,103
the Golden Fiddle and
the Broken Fiddle.

585
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,124
How idiotic.

586
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,940
With your very kind permission,
the whole village is fiddles.

587
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,056
That's what they make here.
Fiddles.

588
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:12,392
I've got to find him
before it's too late.

589
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,558
The American, has he left?

590
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,644
No, but he is leaving.
Number 7.

591
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,740
If you do not hurry,
you will miss the train.

592
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,414
So we miss the train. So what?

593
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,204
So you will be pulled
out of here by ox cart.

594
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,350
I think you're full of pickled pumpernickel,
the both of you.

595
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,720
All right, you little
bundle of joy. Come on.

596
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:04,508
Up! In you go.

597
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,337
Well, if it isn't the Countess!

598
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,291
Don't you trust them?
We're leaving.

599
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:13,011
Step outside, you two.
And close the door.

600
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:14,697
I have to talk to you.

601
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,705
We'll miss the train.

602
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,094
You're not going on that train.

603
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,970
What are you gonna do,
shoot us out of a cannon?

604
00:42:19,254 --> 00:42:20,760
I need your help.

605
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,244
Well. You don't say.

606
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
My dog is outside
in a state of complete collapse.

607
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,510
Small wonder. You people
take those high-strung critters,

608
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,560
breed them, interbreed them,
over breed them,

609
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,560
something in their noggins
is bound to start rattling.

610
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:35,705
She was perfectly all right
until she saw your dog...

611
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,676
All Buttons did was walk up...

612
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:38,754
Let's not go into it.

613
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,955
I'm here to demand your cooperation.

614
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,400
The reason for Scheherazade's
breakdown is fear...

615
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,400
and the reason for her fear
is your dog.

616
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,369
The only cure is to get back
to the source of that fear,

617
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,044
thus eliminating the mental block.
Are you following me?

618
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:53,524
Countess, you lost me back
there around "cooperation."

619
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:57,010
To put it simply, if she could realize
he is not a danger.

620
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,310
If your dog could be
nice to my dog.

621
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,650
Oh, no. She might
throw a flea on him.

622
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,020
I assure you this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

623
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,080
It goes far beyond
just curing a dog.

624
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,890
So we do you a favor
and you kick us out. Is that it?

625
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,010
No, you can stay as long as you like,
do what you like. I don't care.

626
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,100
Well, now you're talkin' sense.

627
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,930
I'll bring her in. There's no time
to waste. See that your dog behaves.

628
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,564
Hold it, Countess,
there's a word missing.

629
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:19,724
I beg your pardon?

630
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,033
- The word is please.
- Please.

631
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:24,822
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
You can do better than that.

632
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,244
- Please.
- Come again.

633
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,349
Please.

634
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,304
Getting warmer.

635
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,185
Please.

636
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,111
Bring in the mutt!

637
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,588
Leopold...

638
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:44,627
Put her on the bed here.

639
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,720
She's got it pretty bad, huh?

640
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,424
Here, you, quiet.
Shh!

641
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,791
The doctor says that
she might go c-r-a-z-y.

642
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,549
We'll see what we can d-o.

643
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,127
Now, now, now.

644
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,392
Don't say no until you and I have
had a chance to talk, man to man.

645
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:08,898
I'm gonna open this basket

646
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:11,252
and you're gonna go and apologize
like a little gentleman.

647
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:12,564
You understand?

648
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,447
Don't open the basket.

649
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:16,713
Let me handle this.
Come on, Buttons.

650
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,002
Come on, boy.
Gotta help me out now.

651
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,713
Remember that time in Munich when
you became involved with the police...

652
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,800
'cause you lapped up
all that beer in the ratskeller.

653
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,340
Who got you out of that?
Old Virgil, huh?

654
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,870
We won't talk about it
now, no.

655
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,540
You've gotta help me out.
Go over there and apologize.

656
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,270
Go on. All right,
so she did hurt your feelings.

657
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,480
So she's snooty
and highfalutin.

658
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,280
But you're a pretty fresh
little mutt yourself, you know.

659
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,861
But you're a man and it's up to the man
to apologize. Now go ahead. Go on.

660
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,439
Her heart's beating like mad.

661
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,724
Proud, huh? And stubborn.

662
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:52,642
Look at her.

663
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,830
For once in your life you meet
a real lady. And a mighty pretty one.

664
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,064
Look at those trim
little ankles, hmm?

665
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:01,213
And that pompadour.

666
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,541
That's super deluxe, that's class.
Better than class: it's "clarss."

667
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,580
Go on, be nice to here.
Go ahead, move in.

668
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,740
Take charge. Atta boy.
Go on, Buttons.

669
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,103
Don't be afraid, Scheherazade.
He's a nice little dog.

670
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,760
Maybe he hasn't had
some of the advantages.

671
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,130
It's no use.
Maybe we'd better stop.

672
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,119
Hey, Buttons. Hey.

673
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:36,885
I kiss your little hand, Madame...

674
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,861
 Your dainty fingertips

675
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,900
 And while in slumberland,
Madame...

676
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,041
 I'm begging for your lips

677
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:52,119
- I haven't any right, Madame
- I think she likes that.

678
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,420
 Sometimes I wonder

679
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,720
 If hearts are broken

680
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,080
 By little love words
that are left unspoken

681
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,400
 I always tremble

682
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,744
 When you are near me

683
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,840
 I'm looking for a ray of hope

684
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,142
 To cheer me

685
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,135
 I hope to keep my kisses warm

686
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,520
Until we meet in shadow form

687
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,345
 In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame

688
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:38,119
 Your dainty fingertips

689
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:46,300
And while in slumberland, Madame

690
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,940
 I'm begging for your lips

691
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,329
 I haven't any right, Madame

692
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,017
 To do the things I do

693
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,626
Just when I hold you tight, Madame

694
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,962
 You vanish with the night, Madame

695
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,040
 In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame

696
00:47:21,848 --> 00:47:24,978
 And pray my dreams

697
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,048
 come true

698
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,720
I'm just putting it on a little...
to give them the idea.

699
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,380
Oh.

700
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,793
- Nothing personal, you understand.
- Oh, I understand perfectly.

701
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,652
- I wouldn't presume...
- No, of course you wouldn't.

702
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:31,375
I haven't any right, Madame

703
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,344
 To do the things I do

704
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,945
Just when I hold you tight, Madame

705
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:47,547
 You vanish with the night, Madame

706
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,606
Thank you so much.

707
00:51:16,317 --> 00:51:18,334
You've been most kind.

708
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,935
Oh, not at all.

709
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:22,411
It's a pleasure
to do business with you.

710
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:28,895
Good-bye.

711
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:31,955
Good-bye.

712
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:41,966
Oh, Countess.
Yes?

713
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,778
You forgot something.

714
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:46,804
I did? What?

715
00:51:47,622 --> 00:51:49,270
Your d-o-g.

716
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,200
Oh, of course.

717
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,606
He has missed the train.

718
00:51:58,192 --> 00:51:59,204
What train?

719
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,614
The one he was going on.

720
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:02,435
Oh, he's not going.

721
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,040
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.

722
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,153
Buttons.

723
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,161
She seems so wonderfully well.

724
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:27,896
Doesn't she, though?

725
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,638
Come on, Scheherazade,
come on.

726
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,169
Come on, Buttons.
Here, boy.

727
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,190
Come on, Scheherazade,
Give Buttons back his ball.

728
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,060
Oh, no. Let her have it.
Compliments of the house.

729
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,620
You're very kind.
Good-bye.

730
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,630
- So long, Countess.
- Come on, Scheherazade.

731
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,364
If she should have a relapse,
bring her back.

732
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,040
Thank you so much.

733
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,013
Any time.

734
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,888
Go on home,
You two.

735
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:07,855
You're telling me.

736
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,136
It's the biggest stag they've had up here
in years, Your Majesty. I saw it myself.

737
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,222
Already I can see its head
above Your Majesty's desk.

738
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,127
Those magnificent antlers,
18 points.

739
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,790
You can see the antlers but
I don't seem to see the stag.

740
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,308
It is up there in the glen,
I assure, Your Majesty. Listen.

741
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:51,558
Every morning for a week they've
promised me that stag and no stag.

742
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,994
Not a shadow of a stag.

743
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,518
Today it will be there.

744
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:58,294
It must be. That stag dare not
disappoint his emperor again.

745
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,840
Look at all those other men,
Putzi. I'm very angry with you.

746
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,222
Do you mind, Princess?
I do not like the name Putzi.

747
00:54:04,247 --> 00:54:05,863
Not only am I angry,
I'm disappointed.

748
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,816
I did hope you'd wear
those nice short leather pants.

749
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,136
Why?

750
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:12,285
For years I've wanted
to see your knees.

751
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,943
You must have very good knees,
my dear Putzi.

752
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,824
They're handsome knees.
They're my knees and I'm nobody's Putzi.

753
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:21,214
Aren't you being a little cold
to the richest woman in Austria?

754
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:22,620
Not rich enough.

755
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:25,042
Besides, I have other prospects.

756
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:29,840
Such an exciting contrast,
Countess.

757
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,220
You, pale and blond

758
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,094
against the brunette
Spanish landscape.

759
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,445
Spain is for bulls.

760
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:38,800
For a beautiful woman is Hungary...
is Budapest,

761
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,636
that wicked boudoir of a city.

762
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,324
No, entirely too much paprika,
don't you think, Countess?

763
00:54:43,956 --> 00:54:46,820
Let me show you Granada:
toreadors, orange trees,

764
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:50,105
a thousand fountains
dancing in a sunlight.

765
00:54:50,342 --> 00:54:54,237
You offer the Countess sunlight.
I offer her fierce midnights...

766
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,816
and czardas and wild gypsies.

767
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:11,370
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did someone say something?

768
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,347
There,
Your Majesty.

769
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,816
What is it?
Music here in my own forest?

770
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,847
- How dare they?
- I don't know, Your Majesty.

771
00:56:15,144 --> 00:56:17,467
I want my stag!

772
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,667
It must be a band
marching down the highway.

773
00:56:19,894 --> 00:56:22,449
- Maybe it's an echo from the village.
- I want that band apprehended.

774
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:25,847
I will have them punished.
Every instrument, especially the brasses!

775
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,753
Your Majesty,
may offer my profound apologies?

776
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:30,628
You may not!

777
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,425
- Oh, certainly not.
- Silence!

778
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:41,240
- Turn that thing off.
- Hi, Countess.

779
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:42,344
Turn it off immediately.

780
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,494
Now that I got him here?
You're crazy.

781
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,140
- Stop it, I tell you.
- You're gonna scratch my record.

782
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,081
You scared off the Emperor's stag.
They're combing the woods with loaded guns.

783
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:51,551
Let me demonstrate...

784
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,542
Did you find that band?

785
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:56,730
Not yet, Countess.
They must be hiding in the underbrush.

786
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:57,972
Who is this man?

787
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,628
A tourist picking strawberries.

788
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,582
What is that?

789
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:04,814
Well, that's what I was asking.

790
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,245
It's apparently
for the strawberries.

791
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:08,769
How?

792
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,644
How. Oh-Oh, "how?"

793
00:57:10,782 --> 00:57:14,082
Oh, why you... You put
the strawberries in here...

794
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,940
and then you grind them up with this,
you see, and the jam collects down yonder.

795
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,808
This, uh, black platter...
You serve them n the platter.

796
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,120
The hole is for the juice.

797
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,542
Any other questions,
please?

798
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:31,870
Yes. Will it work
with gooseberries?

799
00:57:32,222 --> 00:57:34,630
Gooseberries.
Great with gooseberries,

800
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,160
huckleberries,
strawberries, raspberries.

801
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,357
It's particularly
smashing with raspberries.

802
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:41,816
You get the jam and the sound.
You see?

803
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:43,570
Go find the band.!

804
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:45,167
Yes, Countess.

805
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,373
Thank you, Countess.
You're a pip.

806
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:51,441
I'm a what?

807
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:54,417
A sweetheart. Put down that gun
and have a chair.

808
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,170
I'm afraid you'll have to think up
another scheme for your talking machine.

809
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,745
- Say, how's Scheherazade?
- She's much better.

810
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:02,550
- Too bad.
- What did you say?

811
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:03,814
I said "too bad".

812
00:58:03,972 --> 00:58:07,344
Buttons and I were hoping she'd have
a relapse and you'd have to come back.

813
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,019
That won't be necessary.
She's as gay as a lark.

814
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:11,714
Busy with her wedding plans.

815
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,901
Being trimmed, a new collar,
sniffing over her wedding presents.

816
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:15,824
Is that right?

817
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,357
Buttons and I keep talking about
you, night and day.

818
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:19,754
No sleep. No appetite.

819
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,941
Oh, I'm so sorry.

820
00:58:21,003 --> 00:58:24,402
You don't suppose, do you,
that that mental block business...

821
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:26,365
Now, could that be contagious?

822
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,604
Nonsense! Buttons is a sturdy,
well-adjusted little dog.

823
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,807
Oh, I know Buttons is
but I'm talking about me.

824
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:33,839
I'm the one that's
got the shivers.

825
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,730
Don't laugh. One night there'll
be a knock at your door.

826
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:38,977
When you come to open it,
Buttons will be standing there,

827
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:40,636
with me in his arms.

828
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:42,138
Like you came with Scheherazade.

829
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:44,214
He'll put me down...

830
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:46,630
and I'll lie there
quaking all over,

831
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,550
with my eyes rolled back until
just the white is showing.

832
00:58:49,637 --> 00:58:51,643
There'll be nasty gossip
at the castle.

833
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,921
We'll sneak up
the servant's stairs.

834
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:58,097
There I'll be, lying there
in pitiable condition.

835
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,049
You'd have to help me
then, wouldn't you?

836
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,370
How?

837
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,683
You'd bend over me...

838
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,644
You remember the cure we found.

839
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,832
I never sing.

840
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,597
Well, come on, force yourself.

841
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:10,191
Just hum a little, huh?

842
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,785
Countess Von
Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

843
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:29,400
Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg!

844
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:31,535
Good-bye.

845
00:59:31,566 --> 00:59:35,240
Oh, wait, Countess, don't go.
Don't you feel it too?

846
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,763
Feel what, Mr. Smith?

847
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:38,175
Oh, that funny stir
inside of you.

848
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,605
Those bubbles that start
down in the tips of your toes

849
00:59:40,886 --> 00:59:42,128
and tingle up
through your spine...

850
00:59:42,238 --> 00:59:44,574
'til they reach your brain
where they pop like a firecracker.

851
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:46,559
I know nothing about
any such bubbles.

852
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,488
They're in your veins.
In your arteries.

853
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,833
They beat in your throat
and pound in your ears.

854
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,084
What does, Mr. Smith?

855
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,417
Your blood. It's all out of whack.
It goes so fast and every which-way.

856
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,887
Mine's going counterclockwise.
How's yours?

857
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,424
Perfectly normal, I assure you.

858
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,543
I don't believe it.

859
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:02,694
Mine's the weak,
watery different sort of blood.

860
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:04,316
You said so yourself.

861
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:32,980
In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame

862
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,128
 Your dainty fingertips

863
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:44,770
And while in slumberland, Madame

864
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,510
I'm begging for your lips

865
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:51,738
Go to sleep, Scheherazade.

866
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,402
Go to sleep.

867
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,300
Now, really!

868
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:03,900
Scheherazade,
come back to bed.

869
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:07,363
Scheherazade!

870
01:01:09,305 --> 01:01:11,229
Stop thinking about him.

871
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:14,160
He's just an ordinary little dog,
like a million other little dogs.

872
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:17,940
All right, he has some charm
and he knows some tricks,

873
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:21,081
but he's not for you:
he's not your sort.

874
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,090
I think I better give you a sleeping pill.
It'll relax you. Come on.

875
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,191
Come to bed.
Come on.

876
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,870
Get in.
That's a good girl.

877
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,691
Take this and lie down
and go to sleep.

878
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:49,222
Oh, go to sleep, do.

879
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,290
Tomorrow you're going to be the
most important dog in Austria.

880
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:55,566
You want to look your best.

881
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,245
Scheherazade, you're an adult,
intelligent woman.

882
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,738
A little self control, a little dignity.
Is that too much to ask?

883
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,417
What would happen
if we all let ourselves go?

884
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:14,886
Just make up your mind to this.
It cannot be.

885
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,339
Shut out every thought
in that direction.

886
01:02:19,089 --> 01:02:21,300
Fight it.
Suppress it.

887
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:25,850
In dreams I kiss your hand

888
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,433
 Your dainty fingertips

889
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,988
And while in slumberland, Madame

890
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,292
I'm begging for your lips

891
01:02:43,248 --> 01:02:47,003
I haven't any right, Madame

892
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,777
 To do the things I do

893
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,810
Just when I hold you tight

894
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,613
 You vanish with the night

895
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,831
A fine pair we make.

896
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:18,830
Not another cold,
Your Majesty?

897
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,191
Certainly not.
The same one.

898
01:03:21,437 --> 01:03:24,128
I might again suggest inhaling
the vapor of pine needles.

899
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:25,941
No, Holenia, no.

900
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,253
Forty-15.

901
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,313
Any news from the kennels?

902
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,535
We took Scheherazade
down after luncheon.

903
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:48,449
She asked me to thank Your Majesty
for the bridal bouquet.

904
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,550
You've seen poodle puppies,
haven't you, Holenia?

905
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,391
Charming little beasts.

906
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:56,308
Look as if they were made
of black wool and licorice.

907
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:57,550
Good shot.

908
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,933
If I might be excused,
Your Majesty.

909
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,921
What is it? What's happening?

910
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:19,914
She's run away. She's gone.

911
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:21,910
It's a disgrace to our kennels.
Well, where is she?

912
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,400
I don't know. She just jumped over
a 6-foot fence and disappeared.

913
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:27,511
That filthy animal!
I must inform His Majesty.

914
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,628
You will do nothing of the kind.

915
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,504
We mustn't disquiet the Emperor.
He has a cold.

916
01:04:30,589 --> 01:04:32,223
Then what am I to do?

917
01:04:32,363 --> 01:04:34,034
We'll catch her.
We'll bring her back.

918
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,245
You return to the kennels.
That's an order!

919
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:37,503
Yes, Baron.

920
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,761
Advantage, receiver.

921
01:04:51,035 --> 01:04:52,331
Johanna.

922
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,527
The game.
Johanna.

923
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,980
Yes, Father?
We're in trouble.

924
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,285
What is it?

925
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,760
Scheherazade!
Scheherazade!

926
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,870
Scheherazade.!

927
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,019
Scheherazade!
Look at the silly beast!

928
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,620
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.
Where's Scheherazade?

929
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,612
I don't know.

930
01:06:29,682 --> 01:06:31,791
For heaven's sake, don't just lie there.
She's run away.

931
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:33,580
She must be with Buttons.
Where's Buttons?

932
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:38,017
Look at there. You threw me off.
What's your problem?

933
01:06:38,103 --> 01:06:39,094
Where's Buttons?

934
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,291
- He isn't here.
- He's not? Where is he?

935
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,930
He got feeling so miserable
I put him out on the island.

936
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:44,754
What island?

937
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:46,275
Out here.
I'll show you.

938
01:06:47,697 --> 01:06:49,950
He was unhappy, crying all night
and everything...

939
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:53,172
I thought if I disconnected him from
the mainland, put him on that island...

940
01:06:53,197 --> 01:06:54,127
Look!

941
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,894
That idiot.!

942
01:06:56,455 --> 01:06:57,885
That wonderful gal.

943
01:06:57,923 --> 01:07:00,494
No mountain too high.
No ocean too wide.

944
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:01,703
Go it, Scheherazade!

945
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:03,908
- Oh, I hate you.
- The way, you say it, I don't mind it.

946
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,019
We've got to stop her.

947
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:07,354
Oh, forget her. Stick around,
I'll open up a bottle of glue.

948
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,097
I've gotta catch her and
you're going to help me.

949
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,056
Wait a minute. Wait!

950
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,900
Johanna,
what is it?

951
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,486
Where are you going?
Johanna!

952
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:45,904
Scheherazade!

953
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,108
Scheherazade!

954
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:49,754
Do you know how
to row this thing?

955
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,350
Sure. I used to travel
for a Venetian blind company.

956
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,139
Scheherazade!

957
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:59,241
 Santa Lucia

958
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,380
 Santa Lucia

959
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,701
 Scheherazade!

960
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,256
Scheherazade!

961
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,881
Johanna!

962
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:19,857
Johanna!

963
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,834
- Scheherazade.
- Hold it, Buttons. I'm a'comin'!

964
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,193
Oh, boy,
You're all mixed up here.

965
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:43,139
- He isn't hurt, is he?
- No, not him, he's too tough.

966
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:45,920
You kept telling me
she didn't care, huh?

967
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,975
- Don't let him off that leash.
- Oh, don't worry.

968
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,139
Well, you've had your moment,
You lucky little coot.

969
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:56,576
It isn't every guy, has the lovely
Countess swim across a lake for them.

970
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,358
Stop trembling, Scheherazade.

971
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:00,545
I won't scold you. No.

972
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,084
I won't even mention it
to anybody, ever. I promise.

973
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,357
What's that noise?

974
01:09:12,478 --> 01:09:14,970
Oh, that?
That, uh, comes from the village.

975
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,206
You know,
in the daytime they make violins,

976
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,615
and in the evening, they fiddle.

977
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,306
Mighty pleasant,
isn't it?

978
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:41,510
It's probably due to the echo.

979
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:45,166
Yeah. Like sittin' way up
in the balcony, huh?

980
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,002
No, no, no, we must go back,
Scheherazade and I.

981
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:53,580
Well, then I'll...
I'll get Buttons ready for the night.

982
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:57,260
 You can say your lips

983
01:10:58,345 --> 01:11:00,549
Are not for me

984
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,931
But you can't hide the kiss

985
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:09,408
That's in your eyes...

986
01:11:09,518 --> 01:11:10,734
Would you mind not singing?

987
01:11:10,924 --> 01:11:12,010
What was that?

988
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:13,885
I said, please stop singing.

989
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:15,783
Oh, sure.

990
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,958
What's a matter, Countess?
You afraid or something?

991
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:20,274
Afraid?

992
01:11:20,328 --> 01:11:23,932
You know, this silly island,
the silly sunset, all those fiddles

993
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:26,728
 tearing away, a man's voice.

994
01:11:26,877 --> 01:11:28,330
You have to be
more explicit.

995
01:11:28,674 --> 01:11:30,293
But you needn't be afraid.
It's just that...

996
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:31,822
sometimes sounds
do funny things.

997
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,954
Now, you take a big chandelier,

998
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:36,445
one of those high-class,
well brought up chandeliers,

999
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:39,752
and you hit a particular note,
 ping.

1000
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:43,300
You make that chandelier
tinkle all over.

1001
01:11:43,697 --> 01:11:46,877
Are you under the impression that
your voice could, as you put it,

1002
01:11:47,252 --> 01:11:48,764
make me... tinkle?

1003
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:51,750
Well, yes, maybe,
a little around the edges.

1004
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,797
Who do you think I am?
Some half-witted shop girl...

1005
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,620
or some maudlin little waitress
from a beer garden?

1006
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:00,025
You're a chandelier,
Countess.

1007
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:03,439
The loveliest chandelier
I ever saw.

1008
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,865
Go on, sing!

1009
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,017
Oh. No.

1010
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:09,744
This is insulting.
Sing and sing at once!

1011
01:12:16,517 --> 01:12:19,502
 You can say your lips

1012
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,424
 Are not for me

1013
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,088
 But you can't hide the kiss

1014
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,588
 That's in your eyes

1015
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,869
 And you can say my arms

1016
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,931
 Would only leave you cold

1017
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:50,322
 But wait 'til they hold you

1018
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:55,056
 And then look wise

1019
01:12:56,318 --> 01:13:00,848
 Yes, and you can say

1020
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,950
 Tonight will come and go

1021
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:14,690
 Without a single moment's worth of sighs

1022
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,549
 But why should I agree

1023
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,627
 When I know what will be

1024
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:30,095
 It's plain to me

1025
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:35,595
 Plain as the kiss

1026
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:43,674
 In your eyes

1027
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,181
Plain as the kiss...

1028
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,924
Stop it!

1029
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:10,534
I had a husband.

1030
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:13,345
He was suave and distinguished.

1031
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:16,190
He was dark and dashing.
He was six feet two.

1032
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,502
He was the handsomest man
in Austria.

1033
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,978
You're so different.

1034
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:43,792
Imagine, a thousand years
of civilization crumbling

1035
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:45,166
because of a drummer's
vocal chords.

1036
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:48,490
- Isn't it utterly past belief?
- Aren't you a little harsh?

1037
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,385
I remember once when
I was listening to Caruso.

1038
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,364
Caruso is excusable,
but that man's voice is...

1039
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:57,330
A cheap bathroom yowl.

1040
01:14:57,463 --> 01:15:00,460
Ah, Therese, think of
their nearness and the lake...

1041
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,408
and the fragrance of the summer night
in the Tyrol.

1042
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,032
Why begrudge them a
moment of happiness?

1043
01:15:06,057 --> 01:15:07,104
Had it only stopped there.

1044
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:10,770
But for two whole weeks they were
having secret rendezvous on that island.

1045
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,672
- The four of them.
- How shocking!

1046
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:15,455
How divinely shocking!

1047
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:47,560
Could I trouble you for another kiss,
honey Countess?

1048
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,740
No trouble at all.

1049
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,100
I shall never forget you, Virgil.

1050
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:00,030
Impertinent, unpardonable,
ridiculous Virgil.

1051
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,572
You bet you won't because I'm
gonna be around to remind you.

1052
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:03,524
You are?

1053
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,625
I got it all worked
out, honey Countess.

1054
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:07,394
You pack Your bags. I pack mine.

1055
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,670
We get the dogs. Take the first train,
first boat, and then one day your folks...

1056
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,646
are gonna get a postcard
from Newark, New Jersey.

1057
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:18,910
It'll say, "Merry Christmas from
Mr and Mrs Virgil H. Smith."

1058
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,033
It sounds so wonderful,
and so impossible.

1059
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:22,274
Oh, a few small problems.

1060
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:23,522
A few? A million.

1061
01:16:23,693 --> 01:16:25,967
Where I come from,
there's only one real problem:

1062
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,820
Have you got two
bucks for the licence,

1063
01:16:28,178 --> 01:16:29,374
and two bucks I got.

1064
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,160
Where I come from there are
traditions and conventions...

1065
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,936
and family ties and
responsibilities...

1066
01:16:34,961 --> 01:16:36,170
Oh, forget 'em, Countess.

1067
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,341
We can't afford
a scandal in my family.

1068
01:16:38,693 --> 01:16:39,854
I have a young brother.

1069
01:16:40,021 --> 01:16:44,350
By the grace of the Emperor, he's just been
admitted to the Imperial Cadet School.

1070
01:16:44,514 --> 01:16:46,955
Good. So he'll hustle
and get himself a job

1071
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,064
setting up pins in the
Imperial Bowling Academy.

1072
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,061
I have a young sister, 17.

1073
01:16:51,396 --> 01:16:54,304
She's to be presented at court,
her first great glamourous ball.

1074
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,596
She'll call in the
neighborhood kids instead.

1075
01:16:56,803 --> 01:16:58,451
She'll have herself
a big taffy pull.

1076
01:16:58,592 --> 01:17:01,777
Then there's my father,
very bankrupt and slightly dishonest.

1077
01:17:02,225 --> 01:17:03,670
If we affront the Emperor...

1078
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,390
The Emperor, the Emperor...

1079
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,114
- Nobody's that important.
- The Emperor is.

1080
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:11,295
Why don't you tell him how things
are with us, how we stand?

1081
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,717
- That we're crazy about each other.
- Don't be naive.

1082
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,779
All right then,
let me talk to him.

1083
01:17:15,928 --> 01:17:16,670
You?

1084
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,430
Why, sure! You just get me in there.
I'll tell him a thing or two.

1085
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,878
You're not ashamed of
me, are you?

1086
01:17:22,107 --> 01:17:23,024
Of course not.

1087
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,329
Because I have no title,
I'm just a businessman?

1088
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:26,560
No, it's impossible.

1089
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:28,011
The Emperor wouldn't
listen to you.

1090
01:17:28,201 --> 01:17:30,325
Even if he did,
he wouldn't believe his ears.

1091
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:32,493
I'll reason it out with him.

1092
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,674
You don't reason with
an emperor, darling.

1093
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:38,021
You bow and listen to what he has
to say and what he has to say is no.

1094
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,054
It's always no.

1095
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,568
And you bow again and leave.

1096
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,554
Not me. I don't take no's.

1097
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,264
I get my foot in the door and
I talk and talk and talk fast.

1098
01:17:45,289 --> 01:17:46,998
I'm a good salesman.

1099
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:48,287
So I've noticed.

1100
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,967
Come on, honey Countess.
Let me see him, huh?

1101
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,521
I'm no saint. Heaven knows.
I'm no Puritan.

1102
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,830
I've allowed my affections to get involved
with the lower classes, more than once.

1103
01:18:26,975 --> 01:18:28,531
But I had some
sense of proportion.

1104
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:29,967
I love him, Father.

1105
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:38,755
But at the proper time, I had the good taste
to consign her regretfully to the garbage can.

1106
01:18:38,818 --> 01:18:41,418
I didn't put on a silver platter
and present her to my emperor.

1107
01:18:41,732 --> 01:18:43,930
He doesn't accept
our silly little prejudices.

1108
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:45,771
He's better than we are.

1109
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:49,592
Garbage! He's a cheap
little drummer with some
cheap business on his mind.

1110
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:51,333
No, Father, with me on his mind,

1111
01:18:51,654 --> 01:18:53,631
and a wonderful shining love.

1112
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:55,201
Garbage!

1113
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:16,542
Virgil.

1114
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:18,403
Hello, Countess.

1115
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,403
- He's waiting for you.
- Good. I'm ready myself.

1116
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:23,395
- Now, don't be nervous.
- Look who's talking.

1117
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:24,091
Hi!

1118
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:25,458
Garbage.

1119
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:26,812
What are you going to say?

1120
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,213
I don't know, I'll do something.

1121
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:31,654
I'll talk or play him a song
or stand on my hands.

1122
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,614
If he doesn't like me,
maybe he'll like my associate.

1123
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:35,153
He said 3 o'clock.

1124
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,910
He's got a little cold,
but I hope he's in a good mood.

1125
01:19:45,471 --> 01:19:46,442
Come in.

1126
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,072
Step inside and
bow from the waist

1127
01:19:52,145 --> 01:19:54,075
and don't straighten up
till he gives you the signal.

1128
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,208
I got it. Come on, Buttons.
Keep your paws crossed.

1129
01:19:57,504 --> 01:19:58,646
I love you.

1130
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:00,224
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1131
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,411
Who ever told me to
try these nasty fumes?

1132
01:20:29,552 --> 01:20:30,560
Thank you.

1133
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:31,921
You're quite welcome, I'm sure.

1134
01:20:31,946 --> 01:20:33,387
And my whiskers.

1135
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,863
Just as I thought.
Now, they smell.

1136
01:20:36,098 --> 01:20:37,895
You could always shave
them off, Your Majesty.

1137
01:20:38,059 --> 01:20:39,067
What was that?

1138
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,713
Come here.

1139
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,607
I think you'd look much
nicer without all that...

1140
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,325
whipped cream.

1141
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,839
An excellent idea.

1142
01:20:49,223 --> 01:20:51,286
They've bored me for
the last 40 years.

1143
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,278
Thank you, Your Honour...
I mean, Your Majesty.

1144
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:54,965
Only it cannot be done.

1145
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,018
Why not, Your Majesty?

1146
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,294
Young man, if I were to
shave off these whiskers,

1147
01:20:58,356 --> 01:21:00,700
Austria would be thrown
into a state of turmoil.

1148
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,348
Think what it would do to our stamps,
our coins, our bank-notes.

1149
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,510
I guess you're stuck, all right.

1150
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,398
I'm glad you see my point.

1151
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:10,705
Straighten up.

1152
01:21:11,411 --> 01:21:12,264
Who are you?

1153
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,432
I'm the man who, uh...

1154
01:21:14,044 --> 01:21:16,324
Well, an appointment was made for me.
I was to be here at 3 o'clock

1155
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,480
You are Mr Smith,
the American.

1156
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,657
Yes, Your Majesty.

1157
01:21:20,044 --> 01:21:22,604
It's in connection with the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

1158
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:25,392
Uh, what I want, Your Majesty...

1159
01:21:25,559 --> 01:21:28,145
Well, it's a hard for me to
explain exactly what I do want.

1160
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,800
Exactly what you want is
the Countess Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

1161
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,833
Exactly.

1162
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,199
How long have you
two known each other?

1163
01:21:35,387 --> 01:21:36,942
Three weeks, roughly speaking.

1164
01:21:37,223 --> 01:21:38,840
Not too roughly, I trust.

1165
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,440
You love her, Mr Smith?

1166
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,310
Yes, I do, Your Majesty. And she loves me.
I know it sounds crazy...

1167
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,299
considering who she is
and where I come from,

1168
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:50,034
way, way the other
side of the tracks.

1169
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:51,817
It is somewhat unorthodox.

1170
01:21:52,137 --> 01:21:55,200
Should you marry Johanna,
what kind of life do you envision?

1171
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:57,590
Do you intend to live
with her here in Vienna?

1172
01:21:57,887 --> 01:22:00,317
Move into her palace?
I should say not.

1173
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,905
There's too many forks to
know which one to pick up.

1174
01:22:03,137 --> 01:22:04,454
I plan to take her home with me.

1175
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:05,362
Home?

1176
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:07,684
Which one of the United
States do you come from?

1177
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:10,481
New Jersey. Newark, New Jersey.
My mother has a place there.

1178
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,879
A place?
That is, uh... an estate?

1179
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,724
No, it's a house.
Sort of a half house.

1180
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:17,387
Two family deal.

1181
01:22:17,473 --> 01:22:19,298
Dr. Coleman lives in the other half.
He's a dentist.

1182
01:22:19,323 --> 01:22:22,024
Nice fellow. We belong
to the same bowling club.

1183
01:22:24,262 --> 01:22:26,215
You and Johanna will live
with your mother?

1184
01:22:26,334 --> 01:22:28,604
Oh, yes. Wouldn't want her
alone while 'm out on the road.

1185
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:29,550
On the road?

1186
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:33,380
Look, I could've come in here and thrown
a big bluff, being a rich Wall Street man...

1187
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,572
just cruising around the world.

1188
01:22:34,597 --> 01:22:36,354
But actually, I don't have
a yacht to my name.

1189
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:41,208
I'm just a traveling salesman and I earn
$22.50 a week or 4 percent commission.

1190
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:44,723
Which isn't bad when you consider what
an up-and-coming product I handle.

1191
01:22:45,004 --> 01:22:49,731
That mechanical orchestra with which you
pursued me from Vienna to that forest?

1192
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,833
I'm sorry about the stag.

1193
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:53,817
Oh, I probably would
have missed him anyway.

1194
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:56,528
I'm a very poor shot.
This machine...

1195
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,980
Is it practical?
Is it, uh, really good?

1196
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:04,465
Oh, that's the gosh darndest,
Jim-dandiest machi...

1197
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,684
Listen, Your Majesty,
I didn't come here to sell that machine.

1198
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,274
I came here to sell myself...

1199
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:11,778
so you wouldn't think the Countess
was throwing herself away on a hoodlum.

1200
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:15,060
You are not a hoodlum.
You are a businessman.

1201
01:23:15,285 --> 01:23:16,375
Yes, Your Majesty.

1202
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,450
A good one, I'm sure:
quick, clever, enterprising.

1203
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,004
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

1204
01:23:22,053 --> 01:23:24,976
If a good proposition
offered itself...

1205
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:26,947
you wouldn't let it slip
through your fingers.

1206
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,457
Oh, I should say not, sir.

1207
01:23:28,559 --> 01:23:31,715
Good. It so happens
I have one for you.

1208
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:32,911
You have?

1209
01:23:33,379 --> 01:23:34,840
It's a very simple one.

1210
01:23:35,363 --> 01:23:38,590
Give up Johanna
and I will endorse that machine.

1211
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:39,877
Come again?

1212
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:42,270
I'm sure you heard what I said.

1213
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,426
Look, you,
I love her!

1214
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,645
That, Mr Smith,
is what I am counting on.

1215
01:23:49,801 --> 01:23:51,323
I'm not narrow-minded.

1216
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:53,036
I could even forgive
him being an American...

1217
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:57,770
if he belonged to one of those
Vander, Astor, or Rocker families.

1218
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,606
But a Mr Smith!?

1219
01:23:59,764 --> 01:24:01,164
I love him.

1220
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,809
- If you say that once more...
- I love him.

1221
01:24:03,981 --> 01:24:04,882
Garbage!

1222
01:24:05,114 --> 01:24:07,442
Father,
if you say that once more...

1223
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,223
I've seen these things
happen before, Mr Smith.

1224
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:15,153
I've seen them happen
over and over again.

1225
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:18,950
There was a grandniece of mine
who ran away with a fencing master.

1226
01:24:19,306 --> 01:24:22,551
An archduchess who fell in love
with a tourist guide in Egypt.

1227
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:26,379
Princes have eloped with soubrettes,
princesses with headwaiters.

1228
01:24:26,576 --> 01:24:28,600
And why not if they
loved each other?

1229
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:29,676
Why not?

1230
01:24:29,914 --> 01:24:31,426
Let me tell you why not.

1231
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:34,289
My grandniece and
her fencing master.

1232
01:24:34,395 --> 01:24:35,645
What happened?

1233
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:37,524
A few beautiful months in Naples

1234
01:24:37,549 --> 01:24:40,888
and then she began to want
to go back to the life she left.

1235
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,567
There's no going back.

1236
01:24:44,272 --> 01:24:48,239
Eventually, she threw herself
from the 5th story window of her hotel.

1237
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:53,169
The archduchess with her tourist guide
had less luck, or less character.

1238
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:57,970
She's living still... in a cheap
Viennese boarding house...

1239
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,630
on sleeping pills and brandy
to forget where she came from.

1240
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:02,622
Where she came from?

1241
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:04,724
Because you're so much
better than we are?

1242
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:06,708
I don't say
we are better.

1243
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:10,122
As a matter of fact,
I think you are better.

1244
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,544
You are simpler.
You are stronger.

1245
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:15,404
Ultimately,
the world will be yours.

1246
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,794
You bet it will!

1247
01:25:17,465 --> 01:25:19,840
What I'm trying to explain,
Mr Smith, is that...

1248
01:25:21,114 --> 01:25:22,590
we are different.

1249
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:26,614
We are like snails living in
lovely twisted little shells.

1250
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,370
Have you ever observed
a snail, Mr Smith?

1251
01:25:31,786 --> 01:25:33,170
They are
majestic creatures...

1252
01:25:33,403 --> 01:25:37,536
with small coronetted heads that peer
very proudly from their tiny castles.

1253
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,985
They move with dignity.

1254
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,223
I imagine they have a great
sense of their own importance.

1255
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:46,403
But you take them from their shells,
and they die.

1256
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,910
- That is us, Mr Smith.
- Aw, that's a lot of...

1257
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:50,465
I know my class.

1258
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,038
Take Johanna with you
and you destroy her.

1259
01:25:53,465 --> 01:25:55,301
Do you want to destroy
someone you love?

1260
01:25:55,512 --> 01:25:57,117
I don't want to and
I'm not going to!

1261
01:25:57,262 --> 01:25:58,505
I'm gonna make her happy.

1262
01:25:58,551 --> 01:26:00,090
One chance
in a million.

1263
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,645
Bring that apparatus here.

1264
01:26:10,442 --> 01:26:12,247
I don't know whether
she mentioned it...

1265
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:15,426
but there are two other offers
for Johanna's hand...

1266
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:18,780
the Prince Baloshaza
and the Marques Lafuente.

1267
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,958
- And they're both idiots.
- I agree.

1268
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,387
No chance of
any wild love there.

1269
01:26:23,602 --> 01:26:25,567
But let's look ahead.

1270
01:26:26,102 --> 01:26:29,231
Picture Johanna
in the two-family house in Newark.

1271
01:26:29,704 --> 01:26:31,153
Oh, she may still love you.

1272
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:34,020
And yet as she dries the dishes,
won't she think...

1273
01:26:34,301 --> 01:26:37,528
"Tonight, there is the gala opening
of the opera in Vienna.

1274
01:26:37,848 --> 01:26:40,091
"Last week should have
been at the races at Ascot

1275
01:26:40,184 --> 01:26:41,512
in the Royal enclosure.

1276
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,142
I wonder how the season
is at Biarritz. "

1277
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,512
She won't think that.

1278
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,919
Because she has you?

1279
01:26:48,426 --> 01:26:49,528
That's right.

1280
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:52,911
Are you enough,
Mr Smith?

1281
01:26:53,534 --> 01:26:56,536
Twenty-two fifty a week
with a four percent commission.

1282
01:27:04,651 --> 01:27:05,738
Play it,
please.

1283
01:27:10,122 --> 01:27:12,200
- Do you think I should go in?
- No, Father.

1284
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,015
On hearing such a
fantastic proposal,

1285
01:27:14,213 --> 01:27:16,814
I wager His Majesty
fainted or had a stroke.

1286
01:27:18,799 --> 01:27:20,064
What's he playing
music for?

1287
01:27:20,139 --> 01:27:21,620
Because everything's
going so well.

1288
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,478
Because His Majesty's
listened to him.

1289
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:27,072
And that song...

1290
01:27:27,557 --> 01:27:30,658
Tricking an old man into a sentimental mood.
It's not fair.

1291
01:27:30,985 --> 01:27:33,299
It's yes, it's yes.

1292
01:27:33,705 --> 01:27:34,724
It's yes!

1293
01:27:35,502 --> 01:27:37,614
The Emperor's cracking up.
Heaven help our poor monarchy.

1294
01:27:37,675 --> 01:27:40,431
Oh, monarchy, monarchy.
Crowns, titles, crests.

1295
01:27:40,456 --> 01:27:42,588
Who cares, Father? Who cares?

1296
01:27:59,663 --> 01:28:02,049
Well, don't just stand there,
Virgil, what happened?

1297
01:28:06,525 --> 01:28:08,577
What does that mean?
Is it all right?

1298
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,307
All right? It's great.

1299
01:28:11,230 --> 01:28:12,640
Oh, it's great.
Do you hear that?

1300
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,344
What did His Majesty say?

1301
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,672
Oh, exactly what I
wanted him to say.

1302
01:28:15,822 --> 01:28:16,713
Virgil!

1303
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:18,275
I sure wanna thank
you, honey Countess,

1304
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,221
both for myself and on
behalf of the company.

1305
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:22,417
Oh, it's all so wonderful.
What company?

1306
01:28:22,442 --> 01:28:24,025
The phonograph company.
My bosses.

1307
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,096
They better send you a
bathtub full of roses.

1308
01:28:26,283 --> 01:28:27,377
Me, why?

1309
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:29,932
- I sold him a deal, didn't I?
- What deal?

1310
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,260
I sold him the phonograph.

1311
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,010
You sold him...

1312
01:28:34,424 --> 01:28:36,050
What's he talking about?

1313
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:37,573
Hush, Father. Go on, please.

1314
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,814
I knew I could sell him if
I could just get to him.

1315
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,050
He's a wonderful old guy.
He fell for it like that.

1316
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,721
He did?

1317
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:46,471
Now it'll be a cinch.

1318
01:28:46,564 --> 01:28:50,174
Virgil H. Smith, by appointment
to His Majesty, Franz Joseph I.

1319
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,010
Who made that appointment?

1320
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:53,869
My little honey Countess.

1321
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,970
My mind isn't as quick as yours.
Let's be quite clear about this.

1322
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:00,986
It was that phonograph
from the very beginning?

1323
01:29:01,322 --> 01:29:02,504
Oh, come now, Countess.

1324
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:05,760
What's a salesman after, first,
last and all the time? A sale.

1325
01:29:05,947 --> 01:29:08,697
Of course. And everything
that happened between us,

1326
01:29:08,822 --> 01:29:10,174
all those words,
those silly dreams,

1327
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,020
that was all part of what you call...
a sales campaign?

1328
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:15,861
I had a hunch you'd
be a little sore, but...

1329
01:29:16,094 --> 01:29:17,614
you couldn't have
taken it seriously.

1330
01:29:17,706 --> 01:29:19,806
A Countess and a drummer,
come on!

1331
01:29:20,474 --> 01:29:23,111
No, not really.
Only for a short time, perhaps,

1332
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:27,213
which makes me very stupid,
or you a very good salesman, indeed.

1333
01:29:27,508 --> 01:29:30,338
The company thinks so. They send me
on all the tough assignments.

1334
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:31,826
It wasn't so tough, was it?

1335
01:29:32,088 --> 01:29:34,194
This is what you get
for stooping so low.

1336
01:29:35,385 --> 01:29:36,940
You're right, Father.

1337
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,478
The blood rushes to one's head
and one gets a little dizzy...

1338
01:29:40,143 --> 01:29:41,725
but I'm quite all right now.

1339
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,510
- No hard feelings?
- No feelings at all.

1340
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:48,353
It's so preposterous, it's funny.
It's nothing but funny.

1341
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:51,861
You and that island and
that nasty little dog,

1342
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,635
and my going
to the Emperor for you.

1343
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:58,166
It's funny and it's asinine
and humiliating and a little disgusting,

1344
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,833
but it's mostly funny.

1345
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,018
Not so funny as me taking
a life-size countess to Newark.

1346
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,610
- This is yours, I believe.
- So it is.

1347
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,096
Come on, Buttons.

1348
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:11,616
Good-bye, Countess.

1349
01:30:12,244 --> 01:30:14,572
His respectful regards
to Scheherazade.

1350
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:17,660
I never suspected that even
garbage could be so cheap.

1351
01:30:17,893 --> 01:30:19,461
Don't you know us Americans?

1352
01:30:19,759 --> 01:30:21,346
Anything for a dollar.

1353
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,830
Everything seemed so perfect with
that dreadful man out of her life.

1354
01:31:07,855 --> 01:31:10,369
Johanna engaged to
the Marques Lafuente.

1355
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,619
Half a dozen castles.

1356
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:13,901
Seven. The Lafuentes
have more of everything.

1357
01:31:13,994 --> 01:31:15,932
Most of their children
were born with 11 fingers.

1358
01:31:16,049 --> 01:31:19,486
And the poor American,
what happened to him?

1359
01:31:19,748 --> 01:31:21,189
Poor? What's poor about him?

1360
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,588
He made a gigantic success selling those
machines by the thousands, the little worm.

1361
01:31:25,686 --> 01:31:26,711
Worm indeed.

1362
01:31:27,033 --> 01:31:29,550
By what possible right did he
come to the Emperor's Ball?

1363
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,914
Oh, why can't he
leave Johanna alone?

1364
01:31:32,088 --> 01:31:33,822
What does he want from her now?

1365
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,895
I wouldn't have broken
into that ballroom

1366
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,331
if it wasn't a matter
of life and death.

1367
01:31:37,393 --> 01:31:39,119
Mr Smith,
I am not interested.

1368
01:31:39,197 --> 01:31:41,369
Countess, after this
you'll never see me again.

1369
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,384
We're ready to go back home.

1370
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,580
Only he'll never make it.

1371
01:31:44,635 --> 01:31:47,018
He'll never live to see America
again unless you help us.

1372
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:47,728
No.

1373
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:50,557
He's out there in a sleigh, all bundled up.
You ought to see him.

1374
01:31:50,717 --> 01:31:52,042
Poor little rack of bones.

1375
01:31:52,189 --> 01:31:54,331
Hasn't slept in I don't know how long.
Won't eat.

1376
01:31:54,465 --> 01:31:58,125
Just lies there with his eyes like a couple
of candles that are just about burned out.

1377
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,174
I'm extremely sorry.

1378
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,018
Last night he dragged
himself out of the hotel.

1379
01:32:01,088 --> 01:32:02,088
You know where I found him?

1380
01:32:02,175 --> 01:32:04,072
Down in front of your house.
I rang the bell.

1381
01:32:04,143 --> 01:32:06,418
One of your servants told me
Scheherazade was at the Palace.

1382
01:32:06,518 --> 01:32:08,744
She cannot be disturbed.

1383
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,078
What are you trying to do?

1384
01:32:10,322 --> 01:32:12,353
You trying to take it out
on him for something I did?

1385
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,958
Buttons isn't a businessman.

1386
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:17,324
All Buttons did was
to lose his fool heart.

1387
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,705
One doesn't die
of a lost heart, Mr Smith,

1388
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:23,500
except in those syrupy songs
chambermaids play on your phonograph.

1389
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,148
Aw, let him see her
just once more.

1390
01:32:25,447 --> 01:32:28,674
Give them one moment together
so the dog can breathe again.

1391
01:32:51,102 --> 01:32:52,248
You're not gonna let him die.

1392
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:53,534
Let me go out to the
sleigh and get him.

1393
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,810
Release my arm, Mr Smith.
I'm expected back in the ballroom.

1394
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,633
I forgot the word, maybe.
Please.

1395
01:33:00,435 --> 01:33:01,680
Please.

1396
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:11,330
- Johanna, where have you been?
- What is it, Father?

1397
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,567
It's Scheherazade.
Word's just come from the stables.

1398
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:15,102
The veterinary says any moment.

1399
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,892
Well, aren't you coming
for the great event?

1400
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,211
Of course, Father.

1401
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,451
What are you doing here?

1402
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:46,804
I thought I told you to wait
for me and stay covered up.

1403
01:33:47,992 --> 01:33:51,203
She isn't here and you
wouldn't want to see her.

1404
01:33:51,711 --> 01:33:54,135
Not anymore.
Take my word for it.

1405
01:33:55,438 --> 01:33:56,867
All right, you asked for it.

1406
01:33:57,133 --> 01:33:59,688
She took the other fellow after
all, that royal stuffed shirt.

1407
01:34:00,324 --> 01:34:02,633
Seems at this very moment she's
presenting him with a family.

1408
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,922
Now, do you give up?

1409
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:08,910
Here, Buttons.
Where are you going? Here!

1410
01:34:28,203 --> 01:34:29,196
Your Majesty.

1411
01:34:29,221 --> 01:34:31,219
Good evening, Dr. Zweiback.
Have they arrived yet?

1412
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:33,367
Not quite yet, Your Majesty.

1413
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:34,298
How is the patient?

1414
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:37,985
Admirable. Temperature normal,
pulse full, soft and regular.

1415
01:34:38,078 --> 01:34:39,541
We have no apprehensions.

1416
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:42,914
I warn you, Dr Zweiback, I expect
every care taken in the delivery.

1417
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:44,701
They shall be ushered
into the world

1418
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:47,524
with all the solicitude of
which my hands are capable.

1419
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:49,445
Stop that nonsense.
Go back to your patient.

1420
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:53,406
If Your Majesty will excuse me,
I feel that I should be with her now.

1421
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:57,617
What shall we call
the little black things, Holania?

1422
01:34:57,844 --> 01:34:59,430
I've made a list
of a few dark names.

1423
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,258
For the first born,
I should suggest Othello.

1424
01:35:01,789 --> 01:35:05,015
For the second,
perhaps Cafe Noir.

1425
01:35:05,336 --> 01:35:07,660
If he's very small,
Demi-tasse.

1426
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,989
And if it's a female, Sheba.

1427
01:35:10,014 --> 01:35:12,006
Queen of Sheba, you know.
She was dark.

1428
01:35:12,031 --> 01:35:14,062
Simply inspired,
Your Majesty.

1429
01:35:30,484 --> 01:35:32,172
Hey, hey, Buttons.
Buttons.

1430
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:42,531
Come on, Buttons, let's go home.

1431
01:35:42,829 --> 01:35:44,531
What do you got there?
What's the matter?

1432
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:56,898
Quiet, darling.
How long, Dr Zweiback?

1433
01:35:57,156 --> 01:35:58,547
Not long at all, Countess.

1434
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,515
Not an hour. Not a minute.
Not a second...

1435
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:04,930
because, Hocus-pocus,
announcing the first arrival.

1436
01:36:27,555 --> 01:36:30,243
Your Majesty had promised
Rome to the Duke Von Bregens.

1437
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:31,194
Oh, not definitely.

1438
01:36:31,531 --> 01:36:34,133
There's an interesting
possibility in the Hague.

1439
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:35,810
How so?

1440
01:36:54,195 --> 01:36:55,807
The puppies
have arrived.

1441
01:36:56,008 --> 01:36:57,758
Well?
You've lost one of them?

1442
01:36:57,805 --> 01:36:58,397
No.

1443
01:36:58,422 --> 01:37:00,203
Are they deformed?
Have they got two heads?

1444
01:37:00,242 --> 01:37:01,594
- No.
- What is it?

1445
01:37:01,648 --> 01:37:03,836
Brace yourself,
Baron Holenia.

1446
01:37:09,101 --> 01:37:10,914
- No.
- Yes.

1447
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:16,193
That blasted black Jezebel!

1448
01:37:16,382 --> 01:37:18,297
Father, please, don't. Not now.

1449
01:37:18,453 --> 01:37:20,602
Isn't there one of them that
hasn't got so much white?

1450
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,444
That's all there is, Baron.

1451
01:37:22,898 --> 01:37:26,750
Cursed. Cursed.
She can't do this to me.

1452
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:28,937
She seems to have done it,
Father.

1453
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,464
Your Majesty would like to know
if there are any developments.

1454
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:34,937
There are.

1455
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:47,033
What is it, Holenia?

1456
01:37:47,072 --> 01:37:49,297
I was told to come here because
it would happen at any minute.

1457
01:37:49,422 --> 01:37:50,438
When will it happen?

1458
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:51,797
It has happened, Your Majesty.

1459
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:53,214
It has? How many?

1460
01:37:53,508 --> 01:37:54,562
Three, Your Majesty.

1461
01:37:54,797 --> 01:37:56,458
Three? Is that all?

1462
01:37:57,351 --> 01:37:59,476
It's not many but I dare say
it will have to do.

1463
01:37:59,648 --> 01:38:01,851
Where are my glasses?
I want to see them at once.

1464
01:38:01,945 --> 01:38:03,286
I don't think Your
Majesty should.

1465
01:38:03,664 --> 01:38:05,242
Why? Why shouldn't I see them?

1466
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:09,411
Your Majesty,
great grief has befallen us.

1467
01:38:09,922 --> 01:38:10,873
The puppies...

1468
01:38:10,898 --> 01:38:13,578
- Come, come, come.
- It was beyond my control, Your Majesty.

1469
01:38:13,648 --> 01:38:15,172
The puppies
were born dead.

1470
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:18,523
Dead?

1471
01:38:18,624 --> 01:38:20,672
One of those rare,
unpredictable occurrences.

1472
01:38:20,836 --> 01:38:22,704
The expected mother
must've had a fall.

1473
01:38:23,172 --> 01:38:24,674
Dead? All three of them?

1474
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:26,517
Yes, Your Majesty.

1475
01:38:27,656 --> 01:38:29,359
Dead is such an ugly word.

1476
01:38:29,531 --> 01:38:32,257
We're bitterly sorry for Your
Majesty's disappointment.

1477
01:38:32,523 --> 01:38:33,695
How is Scheherazade?

1478
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:35,930
She's recovering nicely,
thank you, Your Majesty.

1479
01:38:36,461 --> 01:38:38,600
Poor Louis.
It will be quite a blow.

1480
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:42,730
In this our moment of sorrow,
may I venture to offer some consolation?

1481
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:44,113
There will be other days.

1482
01:38:44,406 --> 01:38:45,774
She'll give us some puppies yet.

1483
01:38:45,976 --> 01:38:47,414
That's the way to look at it.

1484
01:38:47,617 --> 01:38:49,980
Come spring and we can count
on another litter.

1485
01:38:50,273 --> 01:38:52,719
The question is,
can I count on another spring?

1486
01:38:52,882 --> 01:38:55,000
If I may be permitted,
Your Majesty, it's almost 11:00.

1487
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:55,930
What of it?

1488
01:38:55,992 --> 01:38:58,797
The ball, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty is to appear at 11:00.

1489
01:38:58,953 --> 01:39:00,762
His Majesty is in
no mood for a ball.

1490
01:39:00,922 --> 01:39:01,953
You're quite right.

1491
01:39:02,008 --> 01:39:03,768
I'm in the mood for a cemetery.

1492
01:39:04,515 --> 01:39:06,484
Let us proceed to the ball.

1493
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,344
Baron Holenia.

1494
01:39:15,656 --> 01:39:17,905
The puppies.
What about the puppies?

1495
01:39:18,047 --> 01:39:19,304
Didn't you hear? They're dead.

1496
01:39:19,648 --> 01:39:20,383
They are?

1497
01:39:20,508 --> 01:39:22,484
They must be.
Dead, buried, forgotten.

1498
01:39:22,695 --> 01:39:24,812
See to it at once.
That's an order.

1499
01:39:29,055 --> 01:39:32,180
All right, Andreas.
You heard the orders.

1500
01:39:38,896 --> 01:39:40,109
Cover up the head.

1501
01:40:30,645 --> 01:40:31,705
Hi!

1502
01:40:33,398 --> 01:40:35,723
May I come in or is it
past visiting hours?

1503
01:40:35,914 --> 01:40:37,820
Who are you?
Get out of here!

1504
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:39,453
Oh, aren't you
being a little rude?

1505
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,314
This little gentlemen
is a very close relative.

1506
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:42,531
Nobody's allowed in here.

1507
01:40:42,556 --> 01:40:44,250
Oh, well, he is.
Say hello to them.

1508
01:40:44,437 --> 01:40:45,744
Keep away from her.

1509
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:47,149
Here, look out.
What are you doing?

1510
01:40:49,664 --> 01:40:50,515
Where are the pups?

1511
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:51,468
Throw him out!

1512
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:55,007
Wait a minute. Where are those pups?
What goes on here?

1513
01:40:55,828 --> 01:40:57,294
Orders have been given.

1514
01:40:57,319 --> 01:40:58,515
What orders?
What are you gonna do?

1515
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:00,156
Get out of here!

1516
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:04,609
Hold him.!

1517
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:19,234
I flatter myself I handled
the puppy situation rather well.

1518
01:41:19,476 --> 01:41:21,875
Do you think it's ever
wise to lie to His Majesty?

1519
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,441
The puppies are dead.
I gave orders.

1520
01:41:23,539 --> 01:41:25,125
Father!

1521
01:42:22,968 --> 01:42:26,193
You're not gonna kill 'em.
You're not gonna, understand?

1522
01:42:26,281 --> 01:42:27,781
I'm not gonna let you!

1523
01:42:28,164 --> 01:42:30,445
I don't care how many
of you there are.

1524
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:33,164
It's probably a good thing
there are so many of you.

1525
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:35,801
Maybe all of you can
scrape up decency

1526
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:38,860
to lay off three little duffers
who've just begun to breathe!

1527
01:42:39,711 --> 01:42:41,297
There not pure enough
for you, huh?

1528
01:42:41,429 --> 01:42:42,988
Not quite your sort. Freaks!

1529
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,781
Little mongrels
you wouldn't have around!

1530
01:42:45,937 --> 01:42:47,093
So what are you gonna do?

1531
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,937
You're gonna shake 'em off that
great, big noble family tree...

1532
01:42:49,992 --> 01:42:52,593
and let them rot
as if nothing had happened!

1533
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:54,820
What have you there,
Mr Smith?

1534
01:42:55,093 --> 01:42:57,867
Scheherazade's puppies,
and you know it!

1535
01:42:59,289 --> 01:43:00,446
Baron Holenia...?

1536
01:43:01,336 --> 01:43:04,406
It seemed wiser.
I didn't want to shock Your Majesty.

1537
01:43:05,015 --> 01:43:06,507
Bring them here,
Mr Smith.

1538
01:43:06,968 --> 01:43:11,054
And as my hearing is not impaired,
please do not shout at me.

1539
01:43:11,773 --> 01:43:14,968
Well, I wanted to get my two cents worth in,
before YOU started talking.

1540
01:43:15,062 --> 01:43:17,880
Last time, like a chump,
I kept my mouth shut, remember?

1541
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,461
Are we discussing the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg

1542
01:43:20,867 --> 01:43:22,234
or the contents of that basket?

1543
01:43:22,265 --> 01:43:25,336
Well, it amounts to the same thing.
Only now I know,

1544
01:43:25,476 --> 01:43:28,843
with your very kind permission,
that you were full of cracked ice!

1545
01:43:29,062 --> 01:43:32,578
Or maybe I was to fall for it and walk out
and make a heel out of myself!

1546
01:43:32,672 --> 01:43:35,945
Virgil, will you say that again, please,
 slowly and plainly and simply?

1547
01:43:36,492 --> 01:43:38,700
Not now, honey Countess.

1548
01:43:39,828 --> 01:43:42,547
Your Majesty,
was it me that you made him give up?

1549
01:43:42,819 --> 01:43:43,859
Yes, Johanna, yes.

1550
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:47,437
We both agreed that with him, you had
only one chance in a million to be happy.

1551
01:43:47,696 --> 01:43:49,420
Your Majesty thinks
that I am happy?

1552
01:43:50,109 --> 01:43:52,648
Isn't one chance in a million
better than no chance?

1553
01:43:52,756 --> 01:43:54,907
My dear, you're much too
pretty for mathematics.

1554
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,310
They're all boys.

1555
01:43:57,826 --> 01:44:00,054
That's right.
Boys run in Buttons' family.

1556
01:44:00,289 --> 01:44:02,679
This tiny one has a
bite like a nutcracker.

1557
01:44:02,804 --> 01:44:04,132
They're sweet, Your Majesty.

1558
01:44:04,172 --> 01:44:06,414
They'll be the strongest,
the smartest, the funniest...

1559
01:44:06,886 --> 01:44:08,083
And between Buttons and me,

1560
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:10,179
we'll bring 'em up right
when we get 'em back home.

1561
01:44:10,516 --> 01:44:12,570
- Can I have 'em back now, sir?
- You cannot.

1562
01:44:12,683 --> 01:44:16,203
Why should you have Buttons, Johanna,
Scheherazade and the puppies?

1563
01:44:16,267 --> 01:44:18,209
Maybe we could leave one.

1564
01:44:18,297 --> 01:44:20,451
The one who's so attached
to His Majesty's finger.

1565
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:21,731
Sounds like a good deal.

1566
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:24,500
I'd even be willing
to withdraw the cracked ice crack.

1567
01:44:24,662 --> 01:44:25,915
I'm keeping them all.

1568
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:28,383
Now leave me alone.
Go on, dance, all of you.

1569
01:44:31,976 --> 01:44:33,590
Your Majesty, if I may...

1570
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,406
You may not, Holenia.
I will talk to you later.

1571
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,507
Putzi, how do I
look to you now?

1572
01:44:47,289 --> 01:44:49,273
I think the word is ravishing.

1573
01:44:49,437 --> 01:44:50,781
Shall we dance?

1574
01:45:03,172 --> 01:45:06,093
Love is a dream

1575
01:45:07,006 --> 01:45:09,976
 Yet it's so real

1576
01:45:10,108 --> 01:45:12,742
 Hard to explain

1577
01:45:13,233 --> 01:45:16,086
Just how you feel

1578
01:45:16,594 --> 01:45:19,007
 Deep in your heart

1579
01:45:19,642 --> 01:45:22,211
Joy seems to dwell

1580
01:45:22,526 --> 01:45:26,656
 Like poets say

1581
01:45:26,878 --> 01:45:30,221
 It's perfectly swell
