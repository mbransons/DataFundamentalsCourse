1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:45,797
One, two, three, four.

3
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,287
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

4
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,163
Hiya, Prew.

5
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,963
What are you doing over here?

6
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,200
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

7
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:45,800
- You quit the Bugle Corps?- Yup.

8
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:47,203
For here?

9
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,927
I didn't pick it.

10
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:51,160
You made a very bad mistake.

11
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:53,483
This outfit, they can give back Custer.

12
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,479
Yeah?

13
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,686
Captain ain't in yet.

14
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:04,766
I'll look around.

15
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,724
What do you think you're doing?

16
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:28,288
- What's your name?- Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

17
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,437
I heard about you.

18
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,919
I heard about you, too, Sergeant.

19
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,881
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

20
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,607
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourselfbefore sundown.

21
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,963
Put up your cue and come along.

22
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,085
Grand went to the hospital yesterday. You put him in the sick book?

23
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:55,683
- Didn't have time. - You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.

24
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:59,204
The medics returned the sick booklate yesterday. I'll do it now.

25
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,723
Thanks, I already done it for you.

26
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:09,643
You're the best buglerthey got over at Shafter.

27
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,199
- You're the best bugler on this island. - That's true.

28
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,561
I feel for you, pal.

29
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,641
But from my position,I can't quite reach you.

30
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:26,957
Ten-hut!

31
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,437
At ease.

32
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,326
- 'Morning, sir. - 'Morning, men.

33
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:34,764
Anything special for me?I've only a few minutes.

34
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,805
Yes, sir. New man here.

35
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,640
Oh, yes. Come in.

36
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,797
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, reportingto the Company Commander, as ordered.

37
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:51,561
At ease. Where's that service record?

38
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:56,487
"Born in Kentucky. Enlisted first at Fort Meyer, Virginia.

39
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,638
"Bugle Corps, First Bugler. "

40
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:03,166
Prewitt, I always make it a policyto talk to my new men.

41
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,319
Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

42
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:09,641
If I like a soldier, he can becomea non-commissioned officer quickly.

43
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:13,160
But he has to show methat he's got it on the ball.

44
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,284
What trouble were you in,in the Bugle Corps?

45
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,403
No trouble, sir.

46
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,121
What made you transfer out, then?

47
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,803
It was a personal matter.

48
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:24,126
- Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?- Why, yes, sir.

49
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,523
Prewitt, you was a corporalin the Bugle Corps.

50
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:30,965
You took a bust to buck privateto transfer to an infantry outfit. Why?

51
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:34,484
Because you like to hike, or was itbecause you couldn't stand to bugle?

52
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,488
It was a personal matter.

53
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,203
That's up to the Company Commanderto decide.

54
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,278
Well?

55
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,564
I was First Bugler for two years.

56
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:46,766
The Top Kick had a friendwho transferred in from another outfit.

57
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:49,124
The next day he was madeFirst Bugler over me.

58
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,042
I was a better bugler.

59
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,722
And you asked out on account of that?

60
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,969
Maybe it ain't sensible,but that's the reason.

61
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,847
His feelings were hurt. Kids they send us now!

62
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,484
We'll get your stripes back for you,maybe an extra one for good measure.

63
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,763
- Know why you're assigned to G Company?- No, sir.

64
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,723
I pulled a few strings. I'm the regimentalboxing coach, you know.

65
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:11,563
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:15,567
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowlyear before last. You should have won.

67
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,638
Thank you, sir.

68
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,887
Our regiment got beaten in the finalslast December, but I mean to win this year.

69
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,800
All I've needed is a top middleweight.

70
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,086
I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.

71
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,558
Quit fighting? When? What for?

72
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,720
Well, over a year ago.

73
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,957
Maybe you heard about what happenedwith Dixie Wells?

74
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,162
- You mean that fellow that got hurt?- Yes, sir.

75
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,966
Yes, I heard about that. It's too bad.

76
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,642
I can understand how you feel,but those things happen.

77
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,719
That's why I decided I would quit, sir.

78
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,320
You might as well say stop warbecause one man got killed.

79
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,924
Our fighting programmeis the best morale builder we have.

80
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,923
I've got a mighty sour company bugler. How'd you like the job?

81
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,078
Not if it means fighting.

82
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,958
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquirea reputation as a lone wolf.

83
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,640
You should know that in the Armyit's not the individual that counts.

84
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:17,278
You'll find that we won't putany pressure on you in my outfit.

85
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,486
Just don't make any mistakes in it,that's all.

86
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:23,004
I'm going to town. Anything else, Sergeant?

87
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,044
Company fund report's due tomorrow.

88
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,688
- You make it out. Is that all?- No, sir.

89
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,724
Whatever it is, you fix it up.

90
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,322
If anything has to go in this afternoon,sign my name.

91
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,524
- I won't be back. - Yes, sir.

92
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:40,647
He'd strangle in his own spitif I wasn't here to swab his throat out.

93
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,038
Come on.

94
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,922
You been in the Army what now?Five years? Five and a half?

95
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:57,998
Yeah.

96
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,080
Don't you think it's about timeyou got smart?

97
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,281
You know what you did just now,turning down Dynamite Holmes?

98
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,007
You put your head in the noose.

99
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,039
Things are soft for a boxer in this outfit.

100
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,040
Otherwise, you better know how to soldier.

101
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,165
I can soldier with any man.

102
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:28,757
This place is getting to be likethe Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

103
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,527
- Who's that?- She's Captain Holmes' wife.

104
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,767
You'll fight, Prewitt, becauseCaptain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

105
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,841
He's got an idea he'll make itif he gets a winning team.

106
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,004
If you don't do it for him, do it for me.

107
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:47,920
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

108
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,366
More he's happy, the less he bothers me,and the better I run this company.

109
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:56,043
So, we know where we stand,don't we, kid?

110
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:59,359
I know where I stand. A man don't go his own way he's nothing.

111
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:03,320
Maybe back in the days of the pioneersa man could go his own way.

112
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:05,684
But today, you got to play ball.

113
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,318
Leva!

114
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,526
Can't I once find you in the supply roomworking with both hands?

115
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,077
I can't do no betteron what you people pay me.

116
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,887
Draw this man some supplies.

117
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:23,485
G Company squad room is on the top floor. Take your bags then come here.

118
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:27,846
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs. Save you making four or five trips.

119
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,918
Thanks.

120
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,127
I just hate to see energy wasted. Besides, you'll be needing yours.

121
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,679
Looks like a good man.

122
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,717
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

123
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,203
Her and them sweaters.

124
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,800
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

125
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,166
Not her, Top. She knows the score. Like I been telling you.

126
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,727
Is that right?

127
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:05,719
Not around here, but when I soldieredat Fort Bliss, I heard plenty about this lady.

128
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,960
- You did?- Okay, not me.

129
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,439
But I know some of the guysshe played around with, so don't tell me.

130
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,167
I'm not telling you. You're telling me.

131
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,398
- Good morning, Sergeant. - 'Morning, ma'am.

132
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:22,604
I'm looking for my husband.

133
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,277
Captain Holmes just went into town. On business.

134
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,686
He was to have left some things for me. Do you know about them?

135
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:31,602
No, I don't, ma'am. Anything I can do for you?

136
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,601
No, thanks.

137
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,078
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

138
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,399
My husband's been telling mea lot about you, Sergeant.

139
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,961
He says you're very efficient.

140
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:51,837
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,763
What is it that makes youso efficient, Sergeant?

142
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,441
I was born smart, ma'am.

143
00:09:58,289 --> 00:09:59,721
I love that.

144
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:02,640
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

145
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,925
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

146
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,124
One what?

147
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,437
One woman.

148
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,167
I've seen better.

149
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,163
Karen?

150
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:34,756
- Sorry I'm late. - It doesn't matter.

151
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,597
I got tied up with General Slater. I bumped into him in the Officers' Club.

152
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,327
Yeah? What did the General have to say?

153
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,046
Success, he said.

154
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:45,881
Success in war, success in peacetime.

155
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,682
Not a word about my promotion.

156
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,927
Sometimes I think the old man'sjust waiting to ship me down.

157
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,762
Less time buttering generalsand more with your company...

158
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:59,206
- ... maybe you'd get that promotion. - The company takes care of itself.

159
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:02,042
I went over there today looking for you.

160
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,246
I had some business to attend toat Kaneohe.

161
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,725
That was all right, wasn't it?

162
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,127
Of course.

163
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,720
I've no right to inquire into your actions. That was our agreement.

164
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,128
Then why bring it up?

165
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,996
Because I wanted you to know I'm notas stupid as you maintain all women are.

166
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,680
Now, just what does that mean?

167
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,201
What are you accusing me of now?

168
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,324
Of nothing.

169
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:25,367
It's no longer my businesshow many women you go out with.

170
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,361
But I wish you could just be honestabout it once.

171
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,917
No reason I should try to hide anything,is there...

172
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,443
...the way things are between us now?

173
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:36,800
What right have youto always be accusing me?

174
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,556
What right?

175
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:43,797
Are you going back to that again?

176
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:47,483
How long will it be, I wonder,before I'm allowed to live that down?

177
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,765
How many times must I sayit was an accident?

178
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,206
Please, Dana.

179
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,317
I'm going to bed.

180
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,243
Please get out of my bedroom.

181
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:27,444
Captain Holmes says you don't wantto come out and fight for us.

182
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,723
That's right.

183
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:31,926
We thought we'd buy you a beerand talk it over.

184
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,717
We're the company boxers.

185
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,968
I figured.

186
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:51,284
What I wouldn't give to have this guyin a corner poolroom in my hometown!

187
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:57,046
If you box as good as you used to,we'd be a cinch this year.

188
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:01,407
You ain't forget, division champsget ten-day furloughs, did you, son?

189
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:08,405
I'm Ike Galovitch. Platoon guide of your platoon.

190
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,877
And don't thinkyou're a tough guy, Prewitt.

191
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:14,483
You no talk now, but out in the fieldwith us you sing different song.

192
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,685
He don't have to fight if he don't wantwithout being kicked around.

193
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,248
We're playing pool. Take off.

194
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:20,966
- You want busted head, Maggio?- No.

195
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,279
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

196
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,677
Training starts next week. Pick up your stuff-

197
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:29,364
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you...

198
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,365
...I ain't fighting. I quit fighting!

199
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,603
You guys want to put the screws on,go right ahead.

200
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,919
I can take anything you can dish out.

201
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,488
Okay, Prewitt.

202
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,882
Thanks.

203
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,238
I just hate to see a good guyget it in the gut.

204
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:55,920
You'd better get used to it, kid.

205
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,045
You'll probably see a lot of itbefore you die.

206
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,607
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

207
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,603
You know anything in Army regulationsays I got to box?

208
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:14,561
Every boxer in this outfit's a non-com.

209
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,603
I guess you've never seena bunch of them get together...

210
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,041
...and give a man "The Treatment. "

211
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:24,477
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

212
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:25,967
She's still too young for you.

213
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:29,325
I'm a better man than you any dayand don't forget it.

214
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:30,397
I won't forget it.

215
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:35,804
What's the deal with him, anyway?

216
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,486
With Warden. I don't figure him.

217
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,117
Warden?

218
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,484
He ain't like the others.

219
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,604
He'll make it tough on you.

220
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:52,000
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,and he won't come over it.

221
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:55,087
You don't see many top kickslike him no more.

222
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,237
He was with the 15th in Shanghaiwhen they saw their action.

223
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:01,603
I heard about itdown in the Philippines, even.

224
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,726
All I know is,he's the best soldier I ever saw.

225
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,246
Count cadence, count!

226
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,843
One, two, three, four.

227
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,726
Prewitt! Get in step!

228
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,086
Hut! Hut!

229
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,288
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic!Get in step!

230
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,929
Hut! Hut! Hut!

231
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,083
Halt!

232
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,322
Left face!

233
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:00,159
Prewitt! One step forward. March!

234
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:06,364
You march like a drunken gooney bird. I got to teach you how to drill. Stay here.

235
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:09,008
Platoon, dismissed!

236
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:14,997
Detail, right face!

237
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,559
Detail, forward march!

238
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,639
Half left march!

239
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,640
Half right march!

240
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,803
Assemble your weapons.

241
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,286
All right, start.

242
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,681
A rifle's your best friend.

243
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:52,085
In the case it jams in combat,could mean life or death.

244
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:57,208
You got to learn to strip them downand put them back together, blindfolded.

245
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,006
Your rear sight's way off!

246
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,722
You'd be 50 feet off-target at 300 yards.

247
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,319
That's what happens when a soldierdon't know how to assemble his rifle.

248
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,482
Seven laps around the track, double time. Keep the rifle at high port!

249
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,239
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

250
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,042
Maybe seven more lapswill teach you to watch yourself.

251
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,040
Are you crazy? I saw what you did.

252
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,203
Nothing but trouble. Better keep your mind off her.

253
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:29,247
What do you wanna do,wind up in Leavenworth?

254
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,287
I won't be back in time to take retreat. Or reveille, either.

255
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,439
All work and no play, Sergeant.

256
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,720
All you do is sit aroundsweating over papers.

257
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,117
There are other things in the worldbeside work.

258
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,199
You ought to get outmore yourself, Warden.

259
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:58,564
I've been considering it.

260
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:02,163
Well, I'm going. I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

261
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:04,922
It'll be here when you get back, sir.

262
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,686
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

263
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,646
You'd better step inside or you'll get wet.

264
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,442
I am wet.

265
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:52,206
If you're looking for the Captain,he isn't here.

266
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,484
And if I'm not looking for him?

267
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,046
He still isn't here.

268
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,801
I'm looking for him. You know where he is?

269
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,967
I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town on business.

270
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,246
That's the way you put itthe other day, isn't it?

271
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,560
I got some papersit's important for him to sign.

272
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,800
I'll try phoning him at the club.

273
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:17,197
- Maybe he's there. - Don't do that.

274
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,122
I never like to disturb a manwhen he's drinking.

275
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,718
I could use a drink myself.

276
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,404
Do you wanna ask me in?

277
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:39,807
The liquor's there, Sergeant. In the cabinet.

278
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,644
You're taking an awful chance, you know.

279
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,367
My maid is liable to be home anytime.

280
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,926
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

281
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,005
You think of everything, don't you?

282
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,727
I try. In my position, you have to.

283
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,207
Are these really important?

284
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:13,918
Yes. But not importantthey get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

285
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,646
I got copies at the office.

286
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,402
So it won't be much work to fix them up.

287
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:25,520
That's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence.

288
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,564
It's also what I dislike about you.

289
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:29,287
It's not confidence, ma'am.

290
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:30,802
It's honesty.

291
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,449
I hate to see a beautiful womangoing to waste.

292
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,207
"Waste" did you say?

293
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,325
There's a subjectI might tell you something about.

294
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,448
I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

295
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,565
You're probably not even remotely awareof some of them.

296
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,559
Would you like to hear?

297
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:51,006
For instance,what about the house without a child?

298
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:53,079
There's one sort for you.

299
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:56,840
Then there's another...

300
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,279
You're doing fine, Sergeant.

301
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,607
My husband's off somewhere,it's raining and we're both drinking now.

302
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,758
You've probably only got one thing wrong:

303
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:11,600
The lady herself.

304
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,078
The lady's not what she seems.

305
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:18,288
She's a washout,if you know what I mean...

306
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:21,162
...and I'm sure you know what I mean.

307
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,167
You gonna cry?

308
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,846
Not if I can help it.

309
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:35,326
What are you doing?

310
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:41,042
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

311
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,525
I don't know, Sergeant.

312
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,720
I don't know.

313
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,605
- Speed it up. - I'm speeding.

314
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,007
"Payday"

315
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,838
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?Knock it off.

316
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,922
Angelo! A dollar he's wrong, coming up.

317
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:39,164
Sorry, I already won my bankrollin the latrine.

318
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:41,557
Besides, it's a penny-ante game.

319
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:50,442
Come on, buddy boy, we're going to town.

320
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,765
Look, don't let them get your goat.

321
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:05,965
We dress up in civviesand we're as good as the rest of the world.

322
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,240
Here, wear this.

323
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:13,604
My sister sent it to me.

324
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,919
She buys everything too big.

325
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,879
Look, first we hit a few bars, see?

326
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:25,006
Then we go to a place where I'ma member: The New Congress Club.

327
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:26,801
Girls!

328
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,606
Any prejudices against girls?

329
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:34,320
That's what I thought.

330
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,008
Well, it looks like you're all primedfor a big night.

331
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:40,204
Hello, Stark.

332
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:42,803
- You want some company?- No, thanks. All tied up.

333
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:46,717
Leva says you've been eyeing the Captain'swife like a hound at hunting.

334
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:49,481
He has, huh?What else did that character tell you?

335
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,959
She took up with a lot of menback at Fort Bliss.

336
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,516
I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

337
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,326
This ain't no story.

338
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,963
Because I was one of them myself.

339
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,528
Not for long, though.

340
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,758
Sure is something strangeabout that woman.

341
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,760
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

342
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:06,403
See you.

343
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:15,917
Hello.

344
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,277
- I didn't think you were coming. - Why not? I ain't late.

345
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,246
No, I guess you're not.

346
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:26,246
But I got here a little early. I must have been over-anxious.

347
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:30,037
- You weren't, though, were you?- I stopped along the way for a few drinks.

348
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,085
You chose a lovely spot for our meeting.

349
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:34,762
I've had three chances to be picked upin five minutes.

350
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:36,726
That's par for the course around here.

351
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:38,844
Well, I don't care for it.

352
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,164
I never went in much for back-alley loving.

353
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,681
Take it easy.

354
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:46,486
You probably think I'm a tramp.

355
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:50,281
What makes you thinkI'd think a thing like that?

356
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:51,642
Don't try to be gallant.

357
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:55,358
If you think this is a mistake,come right out and say so.

358
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:01,842
Well, I guess it's about time for meto be getting home, isn't it?

359
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,324
Isn't it?

360
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,923
What's the matter?What started all this, anyway?

361
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:08,363
You think I'd be hereif I thought it was a mistake?

362
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:12,680
Risking 20 years in Leavenworthfor a date with the Commander's wife?

363
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:16,681
And her acting like Lady Astor's horse,and all because I got here on time!

364
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:23,727
On the other hand,I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

365
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:25,756
Me, too.

366
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:08,602
Why, it's Angelo Maggio.

367
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:10,599
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

368
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:21,247
There you are, sweetie-pie. Dues all paid up.

369
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:24,078
Who you got playing the piano, a hippo?

370
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,160
Angelo, I don't think I've met your friend.

371
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:28,204
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

372
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:31,041
You know how I hate itwhen you boys are in this condition.

373
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:32,117
You see that, buddy boy?

374
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,246
A woman sees a soldier and, like that,she figures he's drunk.

375
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,843
- You know why?- Because he is.

376
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:41,279
Heavy drinking simply doesn't mixwith the entertainment business.

377
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,439
A respectable placemust consider its future.

378
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,886
Mrs. Kipfer, you have my solemn wordyour future will be safe with us.

379
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,238
Angelo is one of my favourites.

380
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,487
Annette, dear, take care of this gentlemanfor me, will you, please?

381
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:57,164
That'll be $4, babyface.

382
00:27:57,448 --> 00:28:00,520
$2 for initiation fee,$2 for this month's dues.

383
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:01,643
What do I get for it?

384
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,884
Entitlement to all privileges of the club:

385
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:06,318
Dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar.

386
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,717
Gentlemanly relaxationwith the opposite gender.

387
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:11,488
So long as they are gentlemen. No liquor is permitted.

388
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:12,364
Got it?

389
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:13,802
I've got it.

390
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,880
Girls, here's some new poison.

391
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,646
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

392
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,487
- Nice meeting you. - Hi, there.

393
00:28:57,248 --> 00:29:00,047
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

394
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,958
This is Suzanne and Roxanne.

395
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:06,204
Hello, there.

396
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,007
- Would you like to dance, honey?- Hey!

397
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:14,560
Much as I adore your company...

398
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:17,044
...I hope I may be allowedto tear myself away.

399
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:18,766
I just saw a few friends at the door.

400
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:22,524
I can also see that I will beof no further use to you.

401
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,765
Hi. You busy?

402
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,008
What's your name?

403
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,203
I'm Lorene.

404
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:42,042
Lorene?

405
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:46,440
I haven't seen you in here before.

406
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:48,447
I haven't been in here before.

407
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,357
My friend brought me. He and I are stationed out at Schofield.

408
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:55,604
I didn't think you were a soldier.

409
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:57,441
What do you mean?

410
00:29:57,808 --> 00:30:00,276
- Well, I- I'm a 30-year man, in for the whole ride.

411
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,526
I suppose it's differentwhen a fellow makes a career of it.

412
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:08,840
Nothing wrong with a soldierthat isn't wrong with everyone else.

413
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,325
I like you just the same.

414
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:13,964
I liked you the minuteI saw Annette bring you in.

415
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:15,283
You did?

416
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:19,243
It's funny, I came in and stood thereand saw you sitting over here.

417
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:21,922
Knock it off, buddy. Put a mute in that thing.

418
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,886
I'll play as loud as I want, you little wop!

419
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:26,037
"Little wop"?

420
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:29,045
Mess with me, fatstuff, I'll bust you up.

421
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:31,847
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

422
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,280
- Wait right here for me, will you?- Yeah, sure.

423
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:37,518
I will not have this.

424
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:41,487
- Mussolini's telling me how to play. - Busting my eardrums with his noise!

425
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,002
- Let's not be cruel. - Break it up.

426
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,885
You'll have to go if you can't behave.

427
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,244
Only my friends call me "wop"!

428
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,886
- You know who that guy is?- What do I care?

429
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:50,958
Who is he?

430
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:53,609
Fatso Judson. Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade.

431
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,318
Let him alone.

432
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:01,844
I seen him nearly murder a guy once. He likes it.

433
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,806
Okay, bullyboy, now you won the war. Let's dance, huh?

434
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:06,003
Yeah, we'll dance.

435
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,886
First I got to calm my nerves.

436
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:11,677
Let's go to a phone boothwhere I'll unveil a fifth of whisky...

437
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:14,646
...I have hidden hereunder my loose-flowing sports shirt.

438
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,481
Don't get hurt, pal.

439
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:29,321
Your balance has got to be letter-perfect.

440
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,601
I thought you were gonna wait?

441
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,446
Bill was telling me about surfboarding.

442
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,517
Hello, friend.

443
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:37,242
Just sit down and listen. He describes it thrillingly.

444
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,081
You know anything about surfboarding?

445
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:41,205
No, nothing. Not a thing.

446
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:44,684
You must be stationed inland. At DeRussey I get lots of chances.

447
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,760
Yeah, but we got mountains.

448
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:49,561
- Know anything about mountain climbing?- A little bit.

449
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,725
- You a mountain climber?- No.

450
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:54,442
- Know about flying a plane?- I've had a few lessons.

451
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,086
I can't fly, either.

452
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,921
What do you know about deepsea diving?

453
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:01,924
Bill, shall we move into another room?

454
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:05,285
Sure. The air in here seemsto have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

455
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:07,200
- I noticed that. - Listen, fella.

456
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,960
Come on, let's go.

457
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,845
How's the deepsea diver?

458
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:14,806
That was a terrible way you acted.

459
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,643
Maybe I was jealous.

460
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:20,877
You're a funny one.

461
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:24,282
What do you dames want?To tease a man to death?

462
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:28,044
Mrs. Kipfer pays us to be niceto all the boys.

463
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:30,961
They're all alike. Is it so important?

464
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:34,724
It is important. We may seem all alike, we ain't all alike.

465
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:41,162
I'm sorry.

466
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,767
Look...

467
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,845
Let's go sit up in Mrs. Kipfer's parlour.

468
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:50,159
She lets us use it sometimesfor somebody special.

469
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:51,806
I'll go ask her.

470
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:55,000
- Then you're not mad?- No, I'm not mad.

471
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:59,240
Because if you're still mad,I'd just rather we call the whole thing off.

472
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,318
You certainly are a funny one.

473
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,164
I never knew it could be like this.

474
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:45,078
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

475
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:46,764
Nobody?

476
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:48,846
No. Nobody.

477
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:53,044
Not even one? Out of all the menyou've been kissed by?

478
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,926
Now, that'd take some figuring.

479
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:58,001
How many do you think there have been?

480
00:34:58,088 --> 00:34:59,077
I wouldn't know.

481
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,406
- Can't you give me a rough estimate?- Not without an adding machine.

482
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:04,285
Do you haveyour adding machine with you?

483
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,040
I forgot to bring it.

484
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,926
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

485
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,406
Maybe I already know.

486
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,120
What's the matter?

487
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:20,478
What are you hinting at?

488
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:22,964
Why? Is there something to hint at?

489
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:26,480
Maybe there's been a long lineof beach parties.

490
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,758
You must be crazy.

491
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,077
Am I?

492
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,728
What about when you and Holmeswere back at Fort Bliss?

493
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:34,802
Did you ever hearof a soldier named Stark?

494
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,401
Maylon Stark?

495
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:42,362
Why, yes.

496
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:43,883
"Why, yes. "

497
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:46,044
You knew him, too, didn't you?

498
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,681
Didn't you?

499
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:51,166
I had to go and forgetyou were like all the rest of them.

500
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,647
Only it's true, ain't it?

501
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:54,242
Well, ain't it?

502
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,207
Why don't you tell me about it?

503
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:06,403
Tell me the story.

504
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,127
There's always a story.

505
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:11,601
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

506
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:31,602
Come back here, Sergeant. I'll tell you the story.

507
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,524
You can take it backto the barracks with you.

508
00:36:42,728 --> 00:36:47,165
I'd only been married to Dana two yearswhen I found out he was cheating.

509
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,558
But by that time, I was pregnant.

510
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:51,878
I thought I had something to hope for.

511
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,926
I was almost happythe night the pains began.

512
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:58,282
I rememberDana was going to an officers' conference.

513
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,843
I told him to get home early,to bring the doctor.

514
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:04,080
He might have, if his conferencehadn't been with a hatcheck girl.

515
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,608
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a. m.

516
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,805
I was lying on the floor.

517
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:14,480
I begged him to go for the doctor,but he fell on the couch and passed out.

518
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:17,242
The baby was born about an hour later.

519
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:19,206
Of course it was dead.

520
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:20,763
It was a boy.

521
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,847
But they worked over me at the hospital,fixed me up fine.

522
00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:26,647
They even took my appendix out,threw that in free.

523
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:27,764
Karen.

524
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:30,646
And one more thing: No more children.

525
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:36,127
Sure, I went out with men after that. And if I'd ever found one that-

526
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,638
Karen, listen to me, listen.

527
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,162
I know.

528
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:47,598
Until I met you,I didn't think it was possible either.

529
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,478
I enlisted too.

530
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:07,526
Came out here on my ownto get away from my hometown in Oregon.

531
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:10,003
How come?

532
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,240
I had a boyfriend.

533
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,806
I was a waitress, and he wasfrom the richest family in town.

534
00:38:15,888 --> 00:38:18,766
He just married a girlsuitable for his position.

535
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,682
After three years of going around with me.

536
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:25,279
A pretty story, isn't it?Maybe they could write a book about it.

537
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,518
They did. Thousands of them.

538
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,164
So I left and went to Seattle.

539
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:32,479
When I got thereI met a girl back from Hawaii.

540
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:34,560
She said she'd made a lot of money there.

541
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,367
So I caught the first boat.

542
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,923
I've been here a year and two months.

543
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:40,726
You don't like it very much, do you?

544
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:42,884
Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it.

545
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:44,964
Anyway, I won't be here forever.

546
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:47,438
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

547
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:49,128
I got it all figured out.

548
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:52,685
In another year, I'll be back home,with a stocking full of money.

549
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:55,202
And I'll be all set for life.

550
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:56,717
Who is it?

551
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,319
I didn't hear no sounds of combat,so I thought you might want a drink.

552
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,286
You've been hogging the whisky, Angelo.

553
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:13,282
Not me, buddy. It's that Sandra. She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

554
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,797
I hope there's a cop under that.

555
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:22,407
Keep pouring.

556
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:27,324
No, thanks. I don't drink.

557
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,604
I think it's a weakness.

558
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,846
I grant you that.

559
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,603
I don't like weakness. Do you?

560
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:39,963
No, I don't like weakness. But I like to drink.

561
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:48,359
What are you going to do, marry this guy?

562
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,679
You're grinning at him like you're his wife.

563
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,481
Get out of here!

564
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,085
Okay. I'm going.

565
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:57,559
Back to old long-legged Sandra.

566
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,117
I love them tall. Acres and acres.

567
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,119
Enjoy yourself, paisan.

568
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,682
You need this more than I do.

569
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,038
Tomorrow you'll be backwith "The Treatment. "

570
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,201
What does he mean?

571
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:19,841
That was nice before.

572
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,839
The way you snuggled up in front of him.

573
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:23,680
What's "The Treatment"?

574
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,204
Some of the guys putting meover the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.

575
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,118
Fight?

576
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,127
Yeah. On the boxing team.

577
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,847
I don't want to box. I don't even want to think about it.

578
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,566
Why should you have to box?

579
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:40,998
Well, see, I used to fight, middleweight.

580
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,317
I was pretty good, and they know it.

581
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:46,728
Well, anyway...

582
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:50,446
Well, come on. Tell me. I want to hear.

583
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,438
Well, the thing is, see...

584
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,762
I used to work out with this guy,Dixie Wells.

585
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,925
He's a real good friend of mine.

586
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:02,125
He loved to box. People on the outside had their eye on him.

587
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,405
He was gonna come out of the Armyand go right up to the top.

588
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:08,280
Well, one afternoon...

589
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,484
...he and I were sparring in the gym.

590
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:13,003
You know, kind of friendly-like.

591
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:16,598
He must have been set pretty flaton his feet...

592
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:19,681
...'cause I caught him...

593
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:24,398
...with a no-more-than-ordinary right cross.

594
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,406
He didn't get up. He didn't move.

595
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,039
He was in a coma for a week.

596
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:35,279
Finally, he did pull out of it.

597
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:38,324
Only, the thing was, he was blind.

598
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:47,357
I went to see him at the hospitala couple of times.

599
00:41:48,648 --> 00:41:50,718
Finally, I just couldn't go back.

600
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,437
The last time he and I started talkingabout fighting and...

601
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:58,680
He started to cry.

602
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:04,200
Seeing tears coming out of those eyesthat couldn't see anything...

603
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:31,087
I thought I ought to tell you.

604
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:33,045
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

605
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,199
From now on, it's no holds barred.

606
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:38,087
They aim to run youright into the stockade if they got to.

607
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:39,396
Let them.

608
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,800
I'll help you as much as I can.

609
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,279
But I can't go too far out on a limb.

610
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,086
I ain't risking losing my stripes.

611
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,487
I like this outfit.

612
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:50,800
So do I. That's funny, ain't it?

613
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:52,640
Yeah, that is funny.

614
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:01,040
Keep going in a straight line, Prewitt.

615
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:04,921
Keep going!

616
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:13,520
All right, that's enough.

617
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:28,884
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

618
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,884
Time!

619
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,239
Clean up the mess, Prewitt.

620
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,925
Hurry it up. You're on fatigue detail, not vacation.

621
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:00,921
Come on, clean it up!

622
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,326
Clean it up yourself!

623
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,117
What?

624
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,404
You heard me. Rub your own nose in it a while.

625
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:10,878
Prewitt, you know better than talk backto a non-commissioned officer.

626
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:15,206
Yes, sir, but I've never liked being spit on,not even by a non-commissioned officer.

627
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:17,286
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

628
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:20,121
I don't think so. Sergeant Galovitch owes me an apology.

629
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,688
Corporal Peluso?

630
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:24,727
Have this man roll a full field pack,extra shoes and helmet.

631
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:27,527
Take a bicycle and hike him upto Kole Kole Pass and back.

632
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,724
- Then bring him to me. - Yes, sir.

633
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:31,447
All right, Prewitt, let's go.

634
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,644
Time!

635
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:44,240
Hold it a minute.

636
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:49,566
Go ahead and have a cigarette.

637
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:51,604
I don't like this any more than you do.

638
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:52,882
Thanks.

639
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:59,717
I take it you're ready to apologiseto Sergeant Galovitch now?

640
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:01,526
No, sir, I'm not.

641
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:05,481
Peluso, take him up there again.

642
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:09,002
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.

643
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:28,680
You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to treat him like an animal.

644
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:33,479
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

645
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:36,004
Insubordinationto a non-commissioned officer.

646
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:38,040
Yes, sir.

647
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:49,768
Only, it's a shame.

648
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,837
What is?

649
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:53,601
I was thinking,too bad you'll lose a good middleweight.

650
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:55,918
I don't care. I don't have to tolerate such insolence.

651
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,965
No, sir, you sure don't.

652
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:02,523
I'll prepare the papers then.

653
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:06,007
Trouble is,even if he gets just three months...

654
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,239
...he'll still be in the stockadefor the boxing finals.

655
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:12,082
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

656
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:16,163
You could double upon company punishment, sir.

657
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:18,716
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

658
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:21,602
If you think that's the way to do it.

659
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,321
Nice going, Sarge.

660
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:37,040
Keep looking, you'll find yourselfscrubbing this orderly room floor!

661
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:56,041
Coming through! Watch it.

662
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:58,164
Me and my waitersare working our tails off.

663
00:47:58,248 --> 00:47:59,887
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

664
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:04,763
How you doing, buddy boy?

665
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:08,124
Better than being thrown in the stockade,ain't it?

666
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:12,076
How am I doing, Sarge? I'm a rough man.

667
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,363
Slow up a little, stop sweating in the food.

668
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:17,485
Don't hold me back, Sarge. I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.

669
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:18,603
You'll never make it.

670
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:20,520
- Hi, Sarge. - Hi, Top.

671
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,364
Life in a rifle company.

672
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:38,965
You look awful tired, kid.

673
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:42,644
How do you like straight duty?

674
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:44,168
What makes you think I mind it?

675
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:45,886
I didn't say you minded it.

676
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:49,517
I just said you looked tired. You know, drawn to a fine edge.

677
00:48:49,648 --> 00:48:51,923
I like this life. It's a great life.

678
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,124
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.

679
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,926
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

680
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:59,285
If you didn't put me here,I'd have no chance to find it, right?

681
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:01,757
Now, there's a man for you. What do you know?

682
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,920
Since you like it so much,I'll see if I can find more for you.

683
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,999
How about garbage detail?

684
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,681
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

685
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:11,566
So, you did. What about street cleaning?

686
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,563
Yesterday.

687
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:15,684
You got a better memory than me.

688
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,520
Of course, if you were smart...

689
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:19,596
Yeah, but I ain't smart.

690
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:22,805
I know. But if you were,you wouldn't have to pull KP.

691
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:24,766
Or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

692
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:30,603
If you think you can bribe me into boxing,Warden, you're wrong.

693
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:33,880
Not you and Dynamite Holmesand "The Treatment. "

694
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:43,965
How long are you guys gonna keepbreaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

695
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:47,082
You've had him on that extra duty rostera month already.

696
00:49:47,248 --> 00:49:48,966
- I can't see why you- Can't you, Pete?

697
00:49:49,368 --> 00:49:52,441
Getting soft in your old age?Maybe I want to teach him a lesson.

698
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,564
- Maybe you like it. - Maybe I do.

699
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:57,999
I'm getting sick and tiredwatching you being a stooge for Holmes.

700
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:02,484
You won't see it much longer. I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.

701
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:05,367
I'm through, Pete. Any day now. And I mean it.

702
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:08,606
Listen, if Holmes'd let me,I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

703
00:50:08,728 --> 00:50:12,004
Half a dozen companies in this regimentwould grab me, in grade, too.

704
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:14,523
Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too.

705
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:17,076
Only I just can't think of leavingmy old buddies.

706
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:18,800
Where're you going, Little Sir Echo?

707
00:50:18,888 --> 00:50:22,164
To take my shower, if the stinkingFirst Sergeant has no objections.

708
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:24,318
Where'd you think?To the movies in this towel?

709
00:50:24,408 --> 00:50:25,727
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

710
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:28,607
I wouldn't drink with youif it was the last beer on Earth.

711
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:30,042
I'm buying.

712
00:50:30,848 --> 00:50:32,440
That's different.

713
00:50:56,528 --> 00:50:58,803
Do you know why I liketo have you serve me beer?

714
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,641
So as I can watch youwhen you walk away.

715
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:07,162
It's in regulations. You got a right to complain.

716
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:10,001
You've a right to take your caseto the Inspector General.

717
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:12,842
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

718
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:15,841
Nope. I ain't gonna complain.

719
00:51:16,248 --> 00:51:19,126
They ain't going to get that satisfaction.

720
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,246
This soldier's got a real big family. Fifteen of them.

721
00:51:25,328 --> 00:51:27,126
'Course this is only half of them.

722
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,039
You see the gentlemanwith the handlebars?

723
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,961
That's Mr. Maggio. Mr. Maggio is my father.

724
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:37,247
I never saw anyone so stubborn.

725
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:40,605
- How long since they let you go into town?- Six weeks.

726
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:41,804
Liable to be six years.

727
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:44,198
How'd you like it?Six years before you see a dame?

728
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:47,122
Look, why don't you justmind your own business?

729
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:50,041
And why don't you learn to play the bugle?

730
00:52:24,128 --> 00:52:25,403
That's my buddy boy!

731
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:41,400
Who's the broad?

732
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:43,202
It's my sister.

733
00:52:56,928 --> 00:52:57,918
You hit me!

734
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,762
Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.

735
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:04,286
Why, you dirty wop!

736
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:06,205
If you want to fight, take it outside!

737
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:07,767
I'll cut this wop's heart out.

738
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:10,840
Anybody steps in here,I give it to him first.

739
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:15,481
One step further, Fatso,and I'm going to de-brain you.

740
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,560
Nobody's doing nothing. Anybody does any killing, I'll do it!

741
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:20,087
It's a private affair, Warden.

742
00:53:20,169 --> 00:53:22,728
No, it isn't! This man's in my company!

743
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:27,046
And you ain't making twoextra weeks' paperwork for me for nothing.

744
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:28,508
Out for blood, huh?

745
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:30,471
You'd puke at the sight of a dead man.

746
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:32,988
Put down that stool. Put it down!

747
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:40,466
Drop that knife.

748
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:48,302
Okay, Fatso,if it's killing you want, come on.

749
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,912
Well, come on!

750
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,823
On the floor!

751
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:11,421
Killers, huh?

752
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:14,950
I'd trade the pair of youfor a good Camp Fire Girl!

753
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:24,391
Tough monkey.

754
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:28,311
Guys like you end up in the stockadesooner or later.

755
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:31,387
Some day you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

756
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,430
I'll show you a couple of things.

757
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:54,463
I'm going to get a breath of air.

758
00:55:03,114 --> 00:55:05,025
I'm glad he stopped it.

759
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,625
He's a good man.

760
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:29,188
You keep it. Keep it for a souvenir.

761
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:32,549
Okay, I'll keep it.

762
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:35,584
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

763
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,868
Could you stand a weekend pass?

764
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:48,912
Could I...

765
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:52,069
What about Holmes?

766
00:55:52,194 --> 00:55:53,673
Don't worry about Holmes.

767
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:55,984
He signs anything without reading it.

768
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,026
I sure could use it.

769
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:06,270
I hear you've gone dippy over some damedown at the New Congress Club.

770
00:56:06,754 --> 00:56:08,028
What'd you say her name was?

771
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,308
Lorene.

772
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:11,465
It's a beautiful name.

773
00:56:26,914 --> 00:56:28,472
Hey, paisan!

774
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:30,785
What's holding you up? Let's get going.

775
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:34,230
What's wrong? Don't you like it here?Something better to do in town?

776
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,908
The bus is leaving right away. I'm taking the bus.

777
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,906
Take off. You're talking to a rich man. I'll hop a taxi.

778
00:56:39,993 --> 00:56:41,984
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

779
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:53,825
Maggio. Get ready for guard.

780
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:57,669
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon. Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

781
00:56:57,754 --> 00:56:59,392
What? I got a pass!

782
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:02,148
Not anymore. Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

783
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:04,225
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

784
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,743
I'll tell you why, you. You should have gotten dressed faster.

785
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:17,992
I sure never figuredon your giving me the runaround.

786
00:57:18,154 --> 00:57:19,792
They didn't even want to let me in.

787
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:20,943
We're mobbed, that's why.

788
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:23,423
A big crowd from Hickam Fieldgot in here first.

789
00:57:23,514 --> 00:57:25,823
- Did you expect a brass band to meet you?- No.

790
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:27,188
Thought you'd want to see me.

791
00:57:27,274 --> 00:57:28,626
I'm busy, can't you see? Look.

792
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:29,908
Yes, I see it's crowded.

793
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,029
Well, I am.

794
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:36,026
Maggio's going to beat the Kalakaua Inn later.

795
00:57:36,274 --> 00:57:38,071
Is there no way you can get out of here?

796
00:57:39,154 --> 00:57:40,472
What's the matter with you?

797
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:42,146
I work here, you know, after all.

798
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:43,462
Can't you understand?

799
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:49,263
Yes, I do. I understand. I understand very well.

800
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:54,146
You haven't been here in weeks. Now you turn up all of a sudden-

801
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:56,463
Watch it, Mack!Watch where you're going!

802
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:58,306
Come on out of here.

803
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:10,187
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?I can't just walk out.

804
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:13,107
- Even if I could, she doesn't like us- All right, look.

805
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:15,788
If you feel that way,just forget about it, okay?

806
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,704
You haven't any claims on me, mister.

807
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:19,352
You're not my husband, you know.

808
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,503
There you are.

809
00:58:20,594 --> 00:58:23,506
I vastly admire your taste,but we really need Lorene now.

810
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:25,346
So many gentlemen are unattended.

811
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,992
- It is such a rush, isn't it?- Yeah.

812
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:30,544
Almost like one of those bigpolitical conventions in Philadelphia.

813
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:31,953
You are coming, Lorene?

814
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:33,467
In a minute.

815
00:58:36,194 --> 00:58:37,182
I'm sorry.

816
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:41,827
How do you think I feel?I may not get another pass for months.

817
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:45,744
I've been counting on thislike a kid counts on Christmas.

818
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,548
But forget it.

819
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:50,989
Lorene's busy, she's got work to do. Lorene's sorry.

820
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:52,984
Stop calling me Lorene! My name's Alma!

821
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:54,826
- Alma?- Yes, Alma Burke!

822
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,148
Alma?

823
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:02,589
Mrs. Kipfer picked Loreneout of a perfume ad.

824
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:05,944
She thought it sounded French.

825
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:25,993
Hey, how did you get away?

826
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:28,151
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

827
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,993
- But I bet she doesn't believe it. - I bet she doesn't.

828
00:59:31,074 --> 00:59:33,668
- What'll you have?- A Coke, please.

829
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:35,870
Give her a big Coke.

830
00:59:36,194 --> 00:59:37,752
It's great you meeting me here.

831
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,870
You know, I'm just lucky getting in town.

832
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:42,181
Top Kick gave me a break.

833
00:59:42,474 --> 00:59:43,907
They still pouring it on?

834
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:46,792
Holmes and those others,they really got me on the edge.

835
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,150
- You must hate the Army. - No, I don't hate the Army.

836
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:52,152
But look what it's doing to you.

837
00:59:52,874 --> 00:59:54,148
I love the Army.

838
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:57,868
But it sure doesn't love you.

839
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:02,707
A man loves a thing,that don't mean it's got to love him back.

840
01:00:03,194 --> 01:00:05,264
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

841
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:10,032
You love a thing, you've got to be grateful.

842
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:11,992
I left home when I was 17.

843
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:13,671
Both my folks is dead.

844
01:00:13,754 --> 01:00:17,190
I didn't belong no placetill I entered the Army.

845
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:19,384
That's where I learned to bugle.

846
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,103
To bugle?

847
01:00:22,594 --> 01:00:25,631
That's the mouthpiece I usedwhen I played a taps at Arlington.

848
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:31,303
They picked me to play a tapsat Arlington Cemetery on Armistice Day.

849
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:33,470
The President was there.

850
01:00:36,394 --> 01:00:38,225
I play the bugle well.

851
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:40,105
Hello, citizens!

852
01:00:41,714 --> 01:00:43,227
Hey, where you been?

853
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:47,029
Hi, pals. I've been in three barsand I put a dent in all three of them.

854
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:48,473
Yeah, you look it.

855
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:50,425
Give me a nail. I'm hungry for a nail.

856
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:52,152
What you doing in uniform?

857
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,623
I'm thinking of joining the Army.

858
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:58,152
Or maybe I'll go to Mexicoand become a cowboy.

859
01:00:58,234 --> 01:00:59,428
You want to go with me?

860
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:03,513
You keep on drinking,you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

861
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:08,187
You're absolutely right. Bartender! Large whisky.

862
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,465
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

863
01:01:13,074 --> 01:01:14,223
Sam!

864
01:01:15,434 --> 01:01:19,268
Hey, coming out, fellas,the terror of Gimbels' basement.

865
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:20,821
Stand back. Here we go.

866
01:01:20,914 --> 01:01:22,552
A seven for Daddy, five deuce.

867
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:24,988
Seven.

868
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:27,386
Snake eyes.

869
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:29,153
The story of my life.

870
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:36,585
Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotelaround the corner...

871
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:38,744
...where all those movie stars stay.

872
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:40,666
Paisan, you'd better simmer down.

873
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,904
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

874
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,746
That's what you say, buddy.

875
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,348
What do you mean?They only gave you an overnight pass?

876
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:48,423
No pass.

877
01:01:48,593 --> 01:01:50,471
No pass. They put me on guard duty.

878
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:52,590
But old Angelo, he foxed them.

879
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:54,706
You walked off guard?

880
01:01:54,834 --> 01:01:57,268
I checked in and I checked right out again.

881
01:01:57,354 --> 01:02:01,313
Get your tail right back to the post. You're in trouble, you know that.

882
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,710
I got a good idea. Let's go swimming!

883
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,945
We'll go swimming with a movie star. That's what I'm gonna do.

884
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:08,223
Listen, Angelo.

885
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,982
Twenty feet tall,I'm going swimming with a movie star.

886
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,226
You'd better go.

887
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,153
Hey, Angelo.

888
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:32,023
You jerk, get up. Wake up.

889
01:02:32,194 --> 01:02:34,344
I'm awake. What are you hollering about?

890
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:36,425
Yeah, you're awake. Put your clothes on.

891
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:39,665
Give them back to the Indians. They need the clothes.

892
01:02:39,874 --> 01:02:41,785
All they wear is G-strings.

893
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:45,668
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

894
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:51,503
I am waiting here for a movie starto come out of the hotel.

895
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:54,188
I'm not going until she shows up.

896
01:02:54,713 --> 01:02:56,466
Put your clothes on.

897
01:02:57,593 --> 01:03:00,392
Let's get out of herebefore we get in trouble. Okay?

898
01:03:00,594 --> 01:03:01,993
What's the matter with you?

899
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:03,911
Can't a man get drunk?

900
01:03:04,234 --> 01:03:06,145
Can't a man do nothing?

901
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:11,106
Can't he put his lousy handsin his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

902
01:03:12,194 --> 01:03:14,707
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

903
01:03:15,154 --> 01:03:17,270
I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

904
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:19,028
I ain't no coward!

905
01:03:19,114 --> 01:03:20,751
Buddy boy, look...

906
01:03:22,554 --> 01:03:25,148
Get dressed, put your clothes on.

907
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:28,432
- Wait for me? I'll get a cab. - Yeah, sure.

908
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,789
- Will you wait?- You get a cab.

909
01:03:45,674 --> 01:03:48,791
Hey, MPs! Come and get me, you guys!

910
01:03:48,874 --> 01:03:50,387
Here I am!

911
01:03:55,434 --> 01:03:56,992
Is that the best you can do?

912
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:59,223
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

913
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:10,110
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

914
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:11,827
It's on right now.

915
01:04:12,154 --> 01:04:13,473
He'll get the stockade sure.

916
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:17,905
Maybe he won't get it.

917
01:04:18,513 --> 01:04:19,947
All he did was to get drunk.

918
01:04:20,554 --> 01:04:23,943
It's a soldier's nature. It's almost a sacred duty once in a while.

919
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:25,832
But he walked off guard. He went AWOL.

920
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,552
What are you hanging around here for?

921
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:28,783
Can't a man rest a minute?

922
01:04:28,874 --> 01:04:31,786
What man? You got no work?Maybe I can scare you up some.

923
01:04:39,394 --> 01:04:42,112
Go shoot some pool. Any word comes, I'll let you know.

924
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:49,346
Company G,First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

925
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:57,465
Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.

926
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:01,944
He got it. Six months.

927
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:15,187
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

928
01:05:15,274 --> 01:05:17,912
Gimbels' basement couldn't hold me,neither can this.

929
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:20,224
- Shut up!- Whatever you say, Brownie.

930
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:23,106
Prisoner! Halt!

931
01:05:40,154 --> 01:05:41,906
Hello, tough monkey.

932
01:05:56,433 --> 01:06:01,189
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it. This is a very fashionable district.

933
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:04,145
I have another key made for you.

934
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:08,028
You can use it any time you want to,even when I'm not here.

935
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:17,867
- Hi. - Hi.

936
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:20,663
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

937
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:23,667
- This is Georgette, my roommate. - Well, welcome, friend.

938
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:26,348
Hasn't been a man around the housesince the cat died.

939
01:06:27,074 --> 01:06:30,146
I belong to the Book Guild Club. I always take every book.

940
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:31,986
That's the way I get all the dividends.

941
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:37,185
She'll be great for your friendwhen he gets out of the stockade.

942
01:06:37,274 --> 01:06:39,504
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

943
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:44,827
Just sit down and get comfortable.

944
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:48,543
I'll make you a martiniand see what's to cook for dinner.

945
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:51,589
This is like being married, ain't it?

946
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,073
It's better.

947
01:07:12,713 --> 01:07:14,033
You okay?

948
01:07:35,073 --> 01:07:36,632
Glad you came?

949
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,947
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

950
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:44,308
It can't go on like this much longer.

951
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,310
Even though we sneaked acrossthe island...

952
01:08:48,394 --> 01:08:51,988
...we had to run out like jailbirds.

953
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:59,309
If there was only some way we...

954
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:05,389
Holmes'd probably give you a divorce,but never let me transfer out of his outfit.

955
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:08,067
There is a way.

956
01:09:09,594 --> 01:09:11,470
I've been thinking about it.

957
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:13,187
You've got to become an officer.

958
01:09:13,994 --> 01:09:17,303
You can take the new extension course,the one they passed last May.

959
01:09:17,394 --> 01:09:20,669
- Once commissioned you go to the States. - An officer?

960
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:24,664
Yes. Then I could divorce Danaand marry you.

961
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:27,753
I hate officers. I've always hated officers!

962
01:09:28,193 --> 01:09:30,992
Well, that's a fine, intelligent point of view.

963
01:09:31,073 --> 01:09:34,987
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants. That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

964
01:09:35,794 --> 01:09:38,592
You sure made a complete study of it.

965
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:43,549
Okay, suppose I did it. And don't think it's a cinch.

966
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:46,985
You'd be here, I'd be in the States,we'd be apart six months!

967
01:09:47,074 --> 01:09:49,748
- We're sure to be into a war- Tell the truth.

968
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:53,712
You don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me.

969
01:09:53,794 --> 01:09:56,103
You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you.

970
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,707
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

971
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,390
So they were marriedand lived unhappily ever after.

972
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:14,032
I've never been so miserable in my lifeas I have since I met you.

973
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:15,866
Neither have I.

974
01:10:16,154 --> 01:10:19,351
- I wouldn't trade a minute of it. - Neither would I.

975
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:26,225
I'll probably make the lousiest officerin this man's Army you ever saw.

976
01:10:26,714 --> 01:10:28,783
You'll make a fine officer.

977
01:10:29,514 --> 01:10:31,425
A remarkable officer.

978
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:38,307
Thank you.

979
01:10:40,514 --> 01:10:42,151
Come here.

980
01:10:45,593 --> 01:10:48,188
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

981
01:10:50,754 --> 01:10:51,948
Honey...

982
01:10:53,474 --> 01:10:54,873
...I want to marry you.

983
01:10:56,994 --> 01:10:58,507
You're a funny one.

984
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:01,466
Why's it funny if a guywants to marry you?

985
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:05,747
Because I'm a girl you metat the New Congress Club.

986
01:11:05,915 --> 01:11:08,109
That's about two stepsup from the pavement.

987
01:11:08,193 --> 01:11:11,744
Well, what am I?I'm a private, no-class dogface.

988
01:11:12,154 --> 01:11:16,113
The way most civilians look at that,that's two steps up from nothing.

989
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:19,783
Prew, I thought we were happy.

990
01:11:19,994 --> 01:11:21,746
Why do you want to spoil things?

991
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:24,951
Look, I've got a year to gobefore I re-enlist.

992
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:29,592
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,they'll let me go back to the States.

993
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:30,869
We can go back together...

994
01:11:31,113 --> 01:11:32,547
...if you'll wait.

995
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:35,626
How do you expect to become a sergeantunder Captain Holmes?

996
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:37,989
It's all you can doto keep out of the stockade.

997
01:11:41,354 --> 01:11:42,707
I'll fight.

998
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:44,103
You're not gonna fight.

999
01:11:44,194 --> 01:11:45,468
It'd be worth it.

1000
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,232
Prew, it's true we love each other now.

1001
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:56,106
We need each other.

1002
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,986
But back in the Statesit might be different.

1003
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:02,910
That ain't the real reason.

1004
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,827
- All right, it's not. - What is the real reason?

1005
01:12:11,114 --> 01:12:15,232
I won't marry you becauseI don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

1006
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:23,505
Well, that would be about the bestI could ever do for you.

1007
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:30,588
Because nobody's going to stop mefrom my plan. Nobody, nothing.

1008
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:32,546
Because I want to be proper.

1009
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:33,863
"Proper"?

1010
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:35,513
Yes, proper.

1011
01:12:36,673 --> 01:12:39,393
In another year,I'll have enough money saved.

1012
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:41,345
I'll go back to my hometown in Oregon.

1013
01:12:41,434 --> 01:12:43,948
I'll build a house for my mother and myself.

1014
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:46,594
Join the country club and take up golf.

1015
01:12:47,673 --> 01:12:51,189
I'll meet the proper manwith the proper position.

1016
01:12:51,674 --> 01:12:53,904
I'll make a proper wifewho can run a proper home.

1017
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,871
Raise proper children.

1018
01:12:57,034 --> 01:13:00,470
I'll be happy because when you're proper,you're safe.

1019
01:13:02,634 --> 01:13:04,386
You got guts, honey.

1020
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,584
I hope you can pull it off.

1021
01:13:15,194 --> 01:13:19,233
I do mean it when I say I need you,'cause I'm lonely.

1022
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:23,232
You think I'm lying, don't you?

1023
01:13:24,514 --> 01:13:27,028
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1024
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,865
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1025
01:13:37,954 --> 01:13:42,106
Why? Because the scandalwould spoil your chances for a promotion?

1026
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:45,509
I ask you once more: I want to knowwho he is and where you met him.

1027
01:13:45,594 --> 01:13:47,232
I'm not going to tell you.

1028
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:51,032
One thing I know: I know he's a civilian.

1029
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:53,389
You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.

1030
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,511
I wonder which is hurt more,your pride or your curiosity?

1031
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:58,585
You can't know how I feel about this.

1032
01:13:58,994 --> 01:14:01,792
I wonder why men feel so differentlyabout it than women?

1033
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,265
It's just not the same.

1034
01:14:08,873 --> 01:14:11,866
It's a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

1035
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:21,187
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

1036
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:24,792
It was rugged. Kept my mouth shut, didn't get in trouble.

1037
01:14:25,114 --> 01:14:26,672
Did you see Maggio?

1038
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:30,542
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio. He's using a billy, too.

1039
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:34,628
In places where it won't show. On the back, on the chest.

1040
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:36,592
He's got it down to a system.

1041
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:38,630
He kicks him a lot, too.

1042
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,385
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1043
01:14:41,874 --> 01:14:44,512
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

1044
01:14:45,234 --> 01:14:46,952
Ain't he a hot one?

1045
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,185
Well, he's a good man.

1046
01:14:51,594 --> 01:14:53,869
Fatso can't make a dent in him.

1047
01:14:54,394 --> 01:14:58,387
But, that Fatso, he's smart. He makes surethe O.D. never sees nothing.

1048
01:14:58,514 --> 01:15:00,311
Why don't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?

1049
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:02,544
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

1050
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:04,669
That boy's the toughest nut in the woods.

1051
01:15:05,113 --> 01:15:07,753
You think he's going to be all right?

1052
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,348
Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.

1053
01:15:09,434 --> 01:15:10,423
What do you mean?

1054
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,025
After Fatso threw him in the Hole-That's solitary...

1055
01:15:14,153 --> 01:15:17,624
...he started talking a couple of timesabout how he's gonna escape.

1056
01:15:17,794 --> 01:15:20,228
He said to tell youhe'll look you up one night.

1057
01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:24,585
Still on your knees, Prewitt?

1058
01:15:25,074 --> 01:15:28,305
Boxing finals next month: December 15.

1059
01:15:28,394 --> 01:15:31,829
You've still got time to help uswin the championship.

1060
01:15:33,474 --> 01:15:35,509
Are you proud to be in this companyor not?

1061
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:45,830
I ain't gonna move around you again.

1062
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,634
Something tells me you need a lesson.

1063
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:50,585
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

1064
01:15:54,954 --> 01:15:56,945
Leave him alone. He's in my detail.

1065
01:15:57,034 --> 01:15:59,912
You'll get in trouble if you fight here. Get back to work.

1066
01:15:59,995 --> 01:16:01,712
Get out of my way!

1067
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,625
I'll be glad to recommend you.

1068
01:16:32,874 --> 01:16:34,910
You've got service, experience, grade.

1069
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:37,507
- You'll make an excellent officer. - Thank you, sir.

1070
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:41,109
It'd be a feather in my cap, too. A man from my company.

1071
01:16:42,794 --> 01:16:44,670
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

1072
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:47,746
They're fighting outside, sir. Galovitch and Prewitt.

1073
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:48,790
Prewitt?

1074
01:16:48,874 --> 01:16:51,388
Galovitch looks likehe's going to murder him.

1075
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:53,271
I'll take care of it.

1076
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,667
Don't you want to see?

1077
01:16:58,754 --> 01:17:01,393
No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

1078
01:17:09,193 --> 01:17:10,547
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1079
01:17:10,634 --> 01:17:13,068
Blinded a guy once. Must be scared of the same thing.

1080
01:17:21,194 --> 01:17:22,912
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

1081
01:17:41,794 --> 01:17:43,147
Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!

1082
01:17:43,274 --> 01:17:44,627
I'll fight any way I want.

1083
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:48,185
Come on, Prew, get up!

1084
01:18:19,474 --> 01:18:21,783
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1085
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:24,502
- What's his name, Major?- Captain Holmes, sir.

1086
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:54,350
At ease. What started this?

1087
01:18:54,514 --> 01:18:58,473
Prewitt refused an order I gave him. Talked back and started a fight.

1088
01:18:58,594 --> 01:18:59,709
I taught him a lesson.

1089
01:19:00,914 --> 01:19:02,711
You won't disobey orders in my company.

1090
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:05,388
Sir, I'm sorry,but Private Prewitt's not to blame.

1091
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,465
Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1092
01:19:07,553 --> 01:19:08,907
- Thornhill?- Yes, sir.

1093
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,268
You're in charge of this detail. What about it?

1094
01:19:11,474 --> 01:19:12,873
He's right, Prewitt did nothing.

1095
01:19:12,954 --> 01:19:15,263
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

1096
01:19:15,874 --> 01:19:17,910
That's all. Let's forget it.

1097
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:20,104
Let's get back to our jobs.

1098
01:19:26,514 --> 01:19:29,711
If you guys think this meansI'll step into a ring, you're wrong.

1099
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,428
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1100
01:20:14,074 --> 01:20:15,473
Hey, Friday.

1101
01:20:15,994 --> 01:20:17,473
Why are you called "Friday"?

1102
01:20:17,553 --> 01:20:20,352
I don't know. I was born on a Wednesday.

1103
01:21:27,274 --> 01:21:29,185
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

1104
01:21:29,394 --> 01:21:30,462
Where am I going?

1105
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:33,910
I'm going to Choy's. I'm gonna get me another beer.

1106
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:48,503
Halt!

1107
01:21:50,514 --> 01:21:52,151
Who goes there?

1108
01:21:52,794 --> 01:21:53,782
A friend.

1109
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,224
Advance, friend, and be recognised!

1110
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:07,187
Ten-hut!

1111
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:09,233
About face!

1112
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:10,588
Rear face!

1113
01:22:10,674 --> 01:22:11,788
On your knees!

1114
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:13,591
Scrub the floor!

1115
01:22:14,074 --> 01:22:15,473
At ease.

1116
01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:19,103
Hello, kid.

1117
01:22:19,194 --> 01:22:21,947
What you doing out here all by yourself?

1118
01:22:23,954 --> 01:22:25,672
I'm gonna get a little drink.

1119
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:27,745
Sit down. I got a bottle.

1120
01:22:34,794 --> 01:22:36,193
Thanks, Top.

1121
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:38,713
I got to hand it to you, kid...

1122
01:22:38,794 --> 01:22:41,911
...the way you beat upold Galovitch this afternoon.

1123
01:22:42,034 --> 01:22:44,867
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1124
01:22:52,553 --> 01:22:54,987
Life's crummy, you know it?

1125
01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:58,352
Yes, sir, it's perfectly miserable.

1126
01:23:00,154 --> 01:23:04,591
What do you suppose would happenif a truck came along and ran us over?

1127
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,032
We'd be dead.

1128
01:23:07,554 --> 01:23:08,828
Better not sit here anymore.

1129
01:23:08,914 --> 01:23:12,065
You'd better get upand sit over on the side of the road.

1130
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,951
What do you mean, I better?

1131
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:16,184
You've got more to live for than I do.

1132
01:23:16,273 --> 01:23:18,344
You got your whole companyto take care of.

1133
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:20,868
You move overto the other side of the road.

1134
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,263
I'm old and it don't matter if I die.

1135
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:26,107
You got your whole life ahead of you. Don't argue. Get up.

1136
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:27,468
No, sir, not Prewitt.

1137
01:23:27,554 --> 01:23:30,432
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1138
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,668
Okay, we'll stay together.

1139
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,351
I couldn't have got up anyway.

1140
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:49,351
I got the biggest troublesin the whole world.

1141
01:23:50,594 --> 01:23:52,549
In the whole world, huh?

1142
01:23:52,753 --> 01:23:54,107
Take love.

1143
01:23:54,794 --> 01:23:57,830
Did you personally ever seeany of this love?

1144
01:23:58,474 --> 01:24:00,624
You'll understand what I mean.

1145
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:02,466
This girl...

1146
01:24:03,274 --> 01:24:05,424
...she wants me to become...

1147
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:07,991
- Become what?- An officer.

1148
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:10,629
Can you see me as an officer?

1149
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,267
Yeah, I can see you as an officer.

1150
01:24:14,394 --> 01:24:15,588
You'd be a good officer.

1151
01:24:15,673 --> 01:24:18,472
Well, you both can seemore than I can see.

1152
01:24:18,674 --> 01:24:21,825
I don't wanna be an officer. I'm happy where I am.

1153
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:26,382
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

1154
01:24:26,913 --> 01:24:30,827
You wouldn't want meto be a guy like Holmes, would you?

1155
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:33,306
Well, would you?

1156
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,904
A man should be what he can do.

1157
01:24:47,954 --> 01:24:49,671
How's your girl?

1158
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:52,431
What's her name again?

1159
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:55,464
Lorene.

1160
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:56,748
Oh, yeah.

1161
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:59,352
I remember now.

1162
01:25:00,113 --> 01:25:01,786
A beautiful name.

1163
01:25:02,674 --> 01:25:03,948
Beautiful.

1164
01:25:09,794 --> 01:25:11,749
You two dumb, crazy screwballs.

1165
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:14,109
What are you trying to do,get yourself killed?

1166
01:25:14,194 --> 01:25:15,866
Why are you in the middle of the road?

1167
01:25:15,954 --> 01:25:19,071
My friend Prew and I,we're sitting here discussing the weather.

1168
01:25:19,154 --> 01:25:21,270
- Your friend, huh?- You heard me.

1169
01:25:21,354 --> 01:25:23,709
Don't you knowyou gotta take care of this man?

1170
01:25:23,954 --> 01:25:26,787
Holmes is bound to get himsooner or later.

1171
01:25:27,154 --> 01:25:29,713
And he's the best stinking soldierin the whole Army.

1172
01:25:29,873 --> 01:25:32,183
You both got rocks in your head.

1173
01:25:36,354 --> 01:25:37,866
Angelo.

1174
01:25:41,514 --> 01:25:44,028
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

1175
01:25:46,073 --> 01:25:47,302
I done it, Prew.

1176
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:49,630
I escaped just like I said.

1177
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:51,705
Just like I figured...

1178
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:54,308
...in a back of a truck, under a tarp.

1179
01:25:54,794 --> 01:25:56,352
They rode me right out.

1180
01:25:56,434 --> 01:25:58,152
Just like I figured.

1181
01:25:59,073 --> 01:26:02,111
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,about a mile back...

1182
01:26:02,194 --> 01:26:04,343
...and I fell out in the road.

1183
01:26:05,154 --> 01:26:07,270
You should've seen me bounce.

1184
01:26:07,354 --> 01:26:09,390
I must've broke something.

1185
01:26:15,273 --> 01:26:16,673
Prew, listen.

1186
01:26:17,514 --> 01:26:19,469
Fatso done it, Prew.

1187
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:21,590
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1188
01:26:21,834 --> 01:26:23,870
He asks me if it hurts...

1189
01:26:23,955 --> 01:26:26,184
...and I spit at him like always.

1190
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,671
Only yesterday, it was bad.

1191
01:26:30,073 --> 01:26:31,473
He hit me...

1192
01:26:31,713 --> 01:26:33,112
...he hit me...

1193
01:26:33,194 --> 01:26:34,546
...he hit me.

1194
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:38,746
I had to get out, Prew.

1195
01:26:40,914 --> 01:26:44,065
- They gonna send you to the stockade?- No, they ain't.

1196
01:26:44,154 --> 01:26:45,553
Watch out for Fatso.

1197
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:49,986
He'll try to crack you.

1198
01:26:50,073 --> 01:26:52,224
If they put you in the Hole...

1199
01:26:52,434 --> 01:26:53,866
...don't yell.

1200
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:55,870
Don't make a sound.

1201
01:26:56,434 --> 01:26:59,983
You'll still be yellingwhen they come to take you out.

1202
01:27:00,354 --> 01:27:01,946
Just lay there.

1203
01:27:02,474 --> 01:27:06,547
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

1204
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:21,553
He's dead.

1205
01:27:51,153 --> 01:27:53,110
I'll bet you that's Prew.

1206
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:11,346
Sergeant Judson?

1207
01:30:12,234 --> 01:30:13,632
You want me?

1208
01:30:14,314 --> 01:30:15,712
Yeah, Fatso.

1209
01:30:16,474 --> 01:30:20,433
I don't like that nickname. You want to see me about something?

1210
01:30:21,274 --> 01:30:24,311
Let's step around the cornerwhere we can talk.

1211
01:30:24,914 --> 01:30:26,063
Okay.

1212
01:30:36,713 --> 01:30:38,466
Are you sore about something?

1213
01:30:39,074 --> 01:30:41,827
I don't like the way you play the piano.

1214
01:30:43,634 --> 01:30:44,953
Remember Maggio?

1215
01:30:45,234 --> 01:30:47,668
The wop? Yeah, real tough monkey.

1216
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:49,985
- You killed him. - Did I?

1217
01:30:50,634 --> 01:30:52,272
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

1218
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:56,030
The Army's going to get yousooner or later, Fatso.

1219
01:30:56,274 --> 01:30:59,424
But before they do,I want a piece of you myself.

1220
01:31:00,834 --> 01:31:02,347
I figured that.

1221
01:31:03,114 --> 01:31:04,593
See this knife?

1222
01:31:04,674 --> 01:31:07,108
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

1223
01:32:39,314 --> 01:32:41,544
What's happened?

1224
01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:48,223
It's all right.

1225
01:32:51,073 --> 01:32:52,426
Don't worry.

1226
01:32:52,874 --> 01:32:54,353
I ain't gonna die.

1227
01:33:11,354 --> 01:33:13,151
First Platoon present and accounted for!

1228
01:33:13,234 --> 01:33:14,712
Second Platoon all accounted for!

1229
01:33:14,794 --> 01:33:16,830
Third Platoon all presentand accounted for!

1230
01:33:17,114 --> 01:33:19,229
Fourth Platoon all presentand accounted for!

1231
01:33:19,314 --> 01:33:20,827
Fifth Platoon all accounted for!

1232
01:33:21,314 --> 01:33:22,905
Sixth Platoon all accounted for!

1233
01:33:23,594 --> 01:33:26,028
Company, dismissed!

1234
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:32,551
Prewitt's still absent.

1235
01:33:33,793 --> 01:33:35,431
Makes three days now.

1236
01:33:38,074 --> 01:33:41,066
How long are you gonna carry him present,Top?

1237
01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:42,793
I just mention it.

1238
01:33:42,874 --> 01:33:44,785
Well, don't mention it.

1239
01:33:51,073 --> 01:33:53,906
"Upon observing these incidents,an investigation was made...

1240
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:57,781
"... by the Inspector General's Departmentover a period of several months.

1241
01:33:57,914 --> 01:33:59,665
"It was found that Captain Holmes...

1242
01:33:59,754 --> 01:34:03,462
"... has been guilty of indefensible crueltyto the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1243
01:34:03,553 --> 01:34:07,308
"As mentioned, this included instigationof wholly unauthorised tactics...

1244
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:11,466
"... to force the soldierto join the interregiment boxing team. "

1245
01:34:16,354 --> 01:34:18,151
I'm waiting for your reply.

1246
01:34:18,714 --> 01:34:19,988
I haven't any, sir.

1247
01:34:22,154 --> 01:34:26,306
First thing I learned in the Armywas that an officer takes care of his men.

1248
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,954
It seems to be the first thing you forgot.

1249
01:34:29,114 --> 01:34:30,308
My only regret is...

1250
01:34:30,394 --> 01:34:33,669
...we have to keep you in uniformtill a court-martial is concluded.

1251
01:34:34,394 --> 01:34:37,067
If there were any wayto avoid a court-martial, sir.

1252
01:34:38,274 --> 01:34:41,789
There is one alternative, General,if you are so disposed:

1253
01:34:42,034 --> 01:34:45,947
A resignation for the good of the serviceunder Army regulations.

1254
01:34:47,113 --> 01:34:48,752
Write a letter of resignation.

1255
01:34:48,874 --> 01:34:50,910
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

1256
01:34:51,034 --> 01:34:52,627
As far as I'm concerned...

1257
01:34:52,874 --> 01:34:55,593
...the quicker you're out,the better for everybody...

1258
01:34:55,714 --> 01:34:57,783
...especially the Army.

1259
01:34:59,073 --> 01:35:00,792
That's all, Holmes.

1260
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:10,269
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

1261
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:12,663
I know how far some of youhave been out of line.

1262
01:35:12,994 --> 01:35:15,827
If you want to remain non-coms,you'd better snap into it.

1263
01:35:15,994 --> 01:35:17,188
And another thing:

1264
01:35:17,554 --> 01:35:20,864
From now on,no man will earn his stripes by boxing.

1265
01:35:23,154 --> 01:35:25,224
- Get rid of those. - Yes, sir.

1266
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,187
Dismissed.

1267
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:35,148
- About Sergeant Galovitch. - Yes, sir.

1268
01:35:35,234 --> 01:35:37,953
Bust him. Sergeant Galovitchis now Private Galovitch.

1269
01:35:38,033 --> 01:35:40,422
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1270
01:35:40,594 --> 01:35:41,821
What are you grinning at?

1271
01:35:41,914 --> 01:35:45,428
I think the Company Commandermade a wise decision, sir.

1272
01:35:47,314 --> 01:35:49,269
Company G, Captain Ross.

1273
01:35:50,994 --> 01:35:52,267
Just a minute.

1274
01:35:52,354 --> 01:35:55,187
- It's for you, Sergeant. - Thank you, sir.

1275
01:35:57,594 --> 01:35:58,868
Yes, sir.

1276
01:36:01,794 --> 01:36:04,433
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1277
01:36:05,873 --> 01:36:06,863
What?

1278
01:36:07,034 --> 01:36:09,309
I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.

1279
01:36:12,554 --> 01:36:14,225
Okay, I'll get away somehow.

1280
01:36:14,354 --> 01:36:17,312
Sure, that'd be fine, yeah.

1281
01:36:17,674 --> 01:36:20,347
I'll be there in about an hour. Right.

1282
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:28,072
He's being sent back to the States,sailing next week, and wants me to go.

1283
01:36:28,154 --> 01:36:29,189
What will we do?

1284
01:36:31,234 --> 01:36:34,192
When do you thinkyou'll get your commission?

1285
01:36:36,914 --> 01:36:40,748
I didn't put it in. I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1286
01:36:41,153 --> 01:36:45,067
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,but I couldn't sign it.

1287
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:46,463
Why?

1288
01:36:47,994 --> 01:36:50,427
- But it was the plan- I know.

1289
01:36:50,593 --> 01:36:51,992
It's been weeks.

1290
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:54,268
You can't say you'll do a thingand not do it.

1291
01:36:54,354 --> 01:36:55,582
Karen, listen to me.

1292
01:36:55,673 --> 01:36:58,949
Why didn't you do it?Why didn't you tell me?

1293
01:37:00,034 --> 01:37:01,786
Be back in a minute.

1294
01:37:04,314 --> 01:37:07,067
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

1295
01:37:12,673 --> 01:37:16,269
I thought it was a guy from our company,Prewitt, the kid I told you about.

1296
01:37:16,354 --> 01:37:19,073
He got mixed up with a girlat the New Congress Club.

1297
01:37:19,153 --> 01:37:21,986
He's AWOL, probably in lots of trouble.

1298
01:37:22,314 --> 01:37:25,147
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no-good...

1299
01:37:28,153 --> 01:37:31,226
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1300
01:37:31,633 --> 01:37:32,703
I can't be anything else.

1301
01:37:32,794 --> 01:37:35,183
If I try to be an officer,I'll be putting on an act.

1302
01:37:35,274 --> 01:37:38,744
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

1303
01:37:40,394 --> 01:37:41,747
I know why.

1304
01:37:42,714 --> 01:37:44,863
You don't have to become an officer now...

1305
01:37:44,954 --> 01:37:47,388
...now that Dana's out of the Army.

1306
01:37:47,594 --> 01:37:49,869
You just don't want to marry me.

1307
01:37:49,954 --> 01:37:52,422
You're already married to the Army.

1308
01:37:52,593 --> 01:37:54,266
I love you, Karen.

1309
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:01,106
I know.

1310
01:38:03,754 --> 01:38:05,233
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

1311
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:07,862
I don't want to, either. But I am.

1312
01:38:08,073 --> 01:38:10,383
There's nothing else for me to do.

1313
01:38:10,674 --> 01:38:13,551
It's no good with us, Milt. It could never have been any good.

1314
01:38:13,634 --> 01:38:15,272
Hiding, sneaking.

1315
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:17,392
It had to wear out.

1316
01:38:20,754 --> 01:38:22,472
Good-bye, Sergeant.

1317
01:38:23,194 --> 01:38:25,628
- Thanks. - It ain't good-bye, it's...

1318
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:29,273
We'll see each other again, somewhere.

1319
01:38:30,313 --> 01:38:33,191
Of course we will. Somewhere.

1320
01:38:47,274 --> 01:38:48,423
Here it is.

1321
01:38:48,514 --> 01:38:50,903
Got it on the inside page already.

1322
01:38:51,754 --> 01:38:52,869
"Still no clue...

1323
01:38:53,073 --> 01:38:56,225
"... in the fatal stabbingof Staff Sergeant James R. Judson. "

1324
01:38:57,234 --> 01:38:58,826
Did you hear me?

1325
01:39:01,954 --> 01:39:04,229
Are you trying to set a new world's record?

1326
01:39:06,194 --> 01:39:08,389
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1327
01:39:09,634 --> 01:39:11,943
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt...

1328
01:39:12,394 --> 01:39:15,385
...holder of the new world's record.

1329
01:39:31,516 --> 01:39:33,984
- Everything all right, Top?- Great.

1330
01:39:34,156 --> 01:39:37,546
This is a beautiful meal to put in frontof a guy on a Sunday morning.

1331
01:39:37,636 --> 01:39:39,227
Congratulations.

1332
01:39:52,956 --> 01:39:54,992
They sure look prettyover them mountains.

1333
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:56,395
Don't they, though?

1334
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:07,664
Sounds like they're dynamitingdown at Wheeler Field.

1335
01:40:07,756 --> 01:40:11,544
Mighty ambitious. Sunday morning before 8:00?

1336
01:40:23,396 --> 01:40:26,832
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

1337
01:40:26,915 --> 01:40:29,190
I've seen the red circles on the-

1338
01:40:59,116 --> 01:41:01,186
Get out of here. Hurry up! Go!

1339
01:41:05,236 --> 01:41:07,305
This is a real attack, not a manoeuvre.

1340
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:09,626
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

1341
01:41:09,715 --> 01:41:12,071
Please keep in your homes. Do not go on the streets.

1342
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:13,430
This is a real attack.

1343
01:41:13,515 --> 01:41:16,905
Japanese planes are bombingour Naval and Army installations.

1344
01:41:20,836 --> 01:41:22,189
- Quiet down!- At ease!

1345
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:26,264
Non-coms, get BARs and ammunitionfrom the supply room. Get up on the roof.

1346
01:41:26,356 --> 01:41:27,345
Anderson!

1347
01:41:27,836 --> 01:41:30,554
You're in charge of the loading detail. Get moving.

1348
01:41:31,036 --> 01:41:32,515
Rest of you men, listen to me.

1349
01:41:32,636 --> 01:41:36,105
Every man get his rifle, go to his bunkand stay there. And I mean...

1350
01:41:36,196 --> 01:41:38,026
...stay there!

1351
01:41:38,795 --> 01:41:42,675
Shut up! You'll get your ears shot offif you go outside.

1352
01:41:42,756 --> 01:41:46,510
You'll get plenty of chances to be heroeswith Japs in your lap before night.

1353
01:41:46,676 --> 01:41:49,144
Now get moving, we're wasting time!

1354
01:41:52,956 --> 01:41:56,835
Into the kitchen and make a pot of coffee. Wait a minute, a barrel of coffee!

1355
01:42:16,475 --> 01:42:19,069
I can't issue live ammunitionwithout a signed order.

1356
01:42:19,156 --> 01:42:21,909
- The Captain ain't here, jerk!- Sorry. No order, no ammo.

1357
01:42:21,995 --> 01:42:23,793
- What's the matter?- I got my orders!

1358
01:42:23,876 --> 01:42:26,344
Army regulations state that I can't-

1359
01:42:30,796 --> 01:42:32,274
You blind? Give me the key!

1360
01:42:32,356 --> 01:42:34,870
- I got to obey orders, Top. - I'll see you get a medal!

1361
01:42:34,956 --> 01:42:37,390
- Bust it down, boys!- I warned you!

1362
01:42:59,796 --> 01:43:01,627
Don't go out, Warden, you'll get killed!

1363
01:43:01,716 --> 01:43:04,230
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

1364
01:43:30,076 --> 01:43:31,747
Give them a hand with this ammo!

1365
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:33,149
Put that stuff over there.

1366
01:43:39,075 --> 01:43:41,509
Watch your fire, boys,and lead those planes!

1367
01:44:01,316 --> 01:44:03,705
Friday's gone crazy!He's blowing the Cavalry Charge!

1368
01:44:07,236 --> 01:44:08,430
Here they come, boys!

1369
01:44:39,036 --> 01:44:40,788
I got him, Pete! I got him!

1370
01:44:41,236 --> 01:44:42,828
I got him!

1371
01:44:50,716 --> 01:44:53,105
The danger of an invasioncontinues to exist.

1372
01:44:53,196 --> 01:44:56,268
Infantry from Schofield Barracksmoved out within a few hours...

1373
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:58,153
...and have manned beach positions.

1374
01:44:58,236 --> 01:44:59,669
This is no manoeuvre.

1375
01:44:59,796 --> 01:45:01,706
This is the real McCoy.

1376
01:45:01,996 --> 01:45:03,588
Look out for falling shrapnel.

1377
01:45:03,876 --> 01:45:05,229
Keep under cover.

1378
01:45:05,316 --> 01:45:08,911
Blackout and curfew restrictionswill be rigidly enforced.

1379
01:45:09,116 --> 01:45:11,994
Stay in your homes. Don't use the telephone.

1380
01:45:13,035 --> 01:45:16,585
Rest assured that immediate relayto you of any and all information...

1381
01:45:16,716 --> 01:45:18,706
We've been to Queen's Hospitalgiving blood.

1382
01:45:18,796 --> 01:45:19,830
The town's a madhouse!

1383
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:21,668
A big house was bombed on Kuhio Street.

1384
01:45:21,756 --> 01:45:24,475
The drugstore down on McNullyand King is smashed flat!

1385
01:45:24,675 --> 01:45:26,075
A man and his wife were killed.

1386
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:30,268
Your attention, please. Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

1387
01:45:30,476 --> 01:45:33,433
The danger of an invasioncontinues to exist.

1388
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:37,111
And the planes have been identifiedas Japanese planes.

1389
01:45:38,076 --> 01:45:40,112
Who do they think they're fighting?

1390
01:45:40,276 --> 01:45:43,791
They're picking troublewith the best Army in the world.

1391
01:45:45,196 --> 01:45:46,310
Where you going?

1392
01:45:47,555 --> 01:45:50,149
I gotta get back to the company.

1393
01:45:50,356 --> 01:45:52,869
The company? But why?

1394
01:45:53,356 --> 01:45:54,425
Why?

1395
01:45:54,836 --> 01:45:57,304
But you can't. You're not well yet.

1396
01:45:57,755 --> 01:46:00,190
You're AWOL.They'll throw you in the stockade.

1397
01:46:00,676 --> 01:46:03,907
They'll be throwing them outof the stockade. They need everyone.

1398
01:46:03,995 --> 01:46:05,553
But your side'll open up.

1399
01:46:06,156 --> 01:46:08,510
They'll find out you killed that soldier.

1400
01:46:08,796 --> 01:46:11,754
Once I report in to the company,they'll take care of me.

1401
01:46:11,836 --> 01:46:13,394
I'll be all right once I get back.

1402
01:46:13,475 --> 01:46:16,752
But you'll never make it!There's patrols all over!

1403
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:19,430
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1404
01:46:22,236 --> 01:46:24,067
Prew, stay till morning.

1405
01:46:24,156 --> 01:46:26,750
Maybe if you stay till morningyou'll change your mind.

1406
01:46:34,036 --> 01:46:35,833
Prew, don't go!

1407
01:46:36,316 --> 01:46:37,873
I'll do anything you want.

1408
01:46:38,756 --> 01:46:42,465
We can go back to the States together,we can even get married.

1409
01:46:45,796 --> 01:46:48,708
If you go now,I'll never see you again, I know it.

1410
01:46:49,396 --> 01:46:50,510
I'm sorry.

1411
01:46:55,556 --> 01:46:57,910
What do you want to go backto the Army for?

1412
01:46:57,996 --> 01:47:00,794
What did the Army do for youbesides treat you like dirt...

1413
01:47:00,876 --> 01:47:02,673
...and give you one awful going over?

1414
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:06,749
Get your friend killed!What do you want to go back for?

1415
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:09,344
What do I want to go back for?I'm a soldier.

1416
01:47:09,876 --> 01:47:13,346
A soldier! A regular. From the regular Army!

1417
01:47:13,435 --> 01:47:14,994
A 30-year man!

1418
01:47:16,755 --> 01:47:20,544
I got to turn off the lights,'cause of the blackout outside.

1419
01:47:33,876 --> 01:47:36,469
They say they've seen parachutistsland up in the hills.

1420
01:47:36,556 --> 01:47:37,829
I ain't worried about them.

1421
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:39,746
Saboteurs is what worries me.

1422
01:47:39,836 --> 01:47:42,873
I bet they're operatingall over these islands.

1423
01:48:53,035 --> 01:48:54,025
Halt!

1424
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:57,785
Halt!

1425
01:49:09,316 --> 01:49:10,305
Halt!

1426
01:49:45,435 --> 01:49:47,665
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

1427
01:49:47,836 --> 01:49:49,109
Yes, sir.

1428
01:49:49,555 --> 01:49:51,591
He didn't have any regular identification.

1429
01:49:51,676 --> 01:49:54,030
They found a card on him with his name.

1430
01:49:54,276 --> 01:49:56,107
Seems to be membership of a club:

1431
01:49:56,236 --> 01:49:58,067
The New Congress Club.

1432
01:49:58,435 --> 01:50:01,314
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

1433
01:50:04,316 --> 01:50:05,795
Was this man a friend of yours?

1434
01:50:05,916 --> 01:50:09,829
Yes, sir. He must've been trying to reachour company position up the beach here.

1435
01:50:09,915 --> 01:50:11,554
Then why didn't he halt?

1436
01:50:11,635 --> 01:50:14,673
He was always a hardhead, sir,but he was a good soldier.

1437
01:50:14,795 --> 01:50:17,184
He loved the Armymore than any soldier I ever knew.

1438
01:50:17,955 --> 01:50:20,550
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

1439
01:50:35,756 --> 01:50:38,111
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

1440
01:50:38,915 --> 01:50:42,431
All you had to do was box, but no,not you, you hardhead.

1441
01:50:43,116 --> 01:50:47,428
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna beany boxing championships this year.

1442
01:50:54,076 --> 01:50:56,384
What's the matter?Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

1443
01:50:56,475 --> 01:50:59,513
Let's get this body out of here!We ain't got all night!

1444
01:51:20,516 --> 01:51:22,507
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

1445
01:51:26,915 --> 01:51:30,465
I think it's the most beautiful placeI ever saw in my life.

1446
01:51:31,955 --> 01:51:34,753
I can almost see where I worked from here.

1447
01:51:38,476 --> 01:51:40,114
There's a legend:

1448
01:51:41,316 --> 01:51:44,831
If they float in toward shore,you'll come back some day.

1449
01:51:45,756 --> 01:51:47,314
If they float out to sea, you won't.

1450
01:51:52,955 --> 01:51:54,946
I won't come back.

1451
01:51:56,356 --> 01:51:59,075
My fiancé was killed on December 7.

1452
01:52:00,516 --> 01:52:01,868
I'm sorry.

1453
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,547
He was a bomber pilot.

1454
01:52:04,755 --> 01:52:07,589
He tried to taxi his planeto the edge of the apron.

1455
01:52:07,716 --> 01:52:10,025
The Japs made a direct hit on it.

1456
01:52:10,835 --> 01:52:13,475
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

1457
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:16,066
He was awarded the Silver Star.

1458
01:52:17,116 --> 01:52:19,310
They sent it to his mother.

1459
01:52:19,516 --> 01:52:21,472
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

1460
01:52:22,116 --> 01:52:24,072
That's very fine of her.

1461
01:52:24,915 --> 01:52:27,794
They're very fine people. Southern people.

1462
01:52:28,676 --> 01:52:30,871
He was named after a general.

1463
01:52:31,675 --> 01:52:33,234
Robert E. Lee...

1464
01:52:34,076 --> 01:52:35,065
...Prewitt.

1465
01:52:37,155 --> 01:52:38,144
Who?

1466
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:43,072
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

1467
01:52:45,756 --> 01:52:47,348
Isn't that a silly old name?

1468
01:52:48,305 --> 01:53:48,714
