Two households, both alike in dignity...

...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,574
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

4
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,916
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

...a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,845
...whose misadventured piteous overthrows...

8
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,262
...doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,220
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love...

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,098
...and the continuance
of their parents' rage...

11
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,103
...which, but their children's end,
nought could remove...

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,944

old Capulet, and Montague...

84

...have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

If ever you disturb our streets again...

...your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

87

O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

88
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:56,036
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

89
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,706
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore...

90
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,626
...so early walking did I see your son.

91
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,999
Many a morning
hath he there been seen...

92
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,124
...with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

93
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:11,632
Away from light
steals home my heavy son...

94
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,171
...and private in his chamber
pens himself...

95
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,341
...shuts up his windows...

96
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:22,429
...locks fair daylight out, and
makes himself an artificial night.

97
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,029
Why, then...

98
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:39,367
...O brawling love, O loving hate!

99
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,708
O anything of nothing first create!

100
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,704
Heavy lightness...

101
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:47,873
...serious vanity.

102
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:52,045
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms.

103
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,640
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

104
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,772
...unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

105
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,776
So please you, step aside.

106
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,574
I'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

107
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,368
Come, madam, let's away.

108
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,718
Good morrow, cousin.

109
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,722
Is the day so young?

110
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:23,973
But new struck, coz.

111
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,810
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

112
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:32,736
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

113
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,949
It was.

114
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,780
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

115
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,030
Not having that
which having makes them short.

116
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,405
- In love?
- Out.

117
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,873
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where I am in love.

118
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,085
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view...

119
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:47,498
...should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

120
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,165
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still...

121
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,013
...should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

122
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,090
Where shall we dine?

123
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,132
(TV)... this costly blood.

124
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,511
Never anger made good guard for itself.

125
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,767
The law hath not been dead...

126
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,848
O me! What fray was here?

127
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,348
- Coz, I...
- Yet tell me not, for I've heard it all.

128
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:08,113
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

129
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,522
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

130
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,608
O anything of nothing first create!

131
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,322
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

132
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,117
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

133
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,330
- Feather of lead, br...
- (chuckles)

134
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,703
Dost thou not laugh?

135
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,128
No, coz, I rather weep.

136
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,291
Good heart, at what?

137
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:31,962
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

138
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:36,005
Soft, I will go along. And if you
leave me so, you do me wrong.

139
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,227
But Montague is bound as well as l,
in penalty alike.

140
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:50,939
And 'tis not hard, I think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

141
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:54,532
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

142
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,945
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

143
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,200
But saying o'er what I have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world.

144
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:06,458
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

145
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,423
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

146
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,879
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

147
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,427
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast.

148
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:17,054
At my poor house look to behold this night...

149
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:20,762
...fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

150
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,432
Hear all, all see...

151
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,562
...and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

152
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,231
Come, go with me.

153
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:31,732
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

154
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,984
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

155
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,079
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.

156
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,286
A right good marksman!
And she's fair I love.

157
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:43,543
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

158
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,957
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

159
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:50,542
...nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes...

160
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,128
...nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

161
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,010
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

162
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,806
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

163
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,644
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how I should forget to think.

164
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,687
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

165
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,479
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

166
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,277
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

167
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,701
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

168
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:15,736
Good day, good fellow.

169
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,368
(TV) Now, I'll tell you without asking.

170
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,078
The great rich Capulet
holds an old accustom'd feast.

171
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,256
A fair assembly. Signor Placentio
and his wife and daughters...

172
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:32,051
...the lady widow of Utruvio, mmm,
and her lovely nieces Rosaline...

173
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,056
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline...

174
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,680
...whom thou so loves, with
all the admired beauties of Verona.

175
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:41,850
If you be not of the House of Montague,
come and crush a cup of wine!

176
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,313
Go thither, and with unattainted eye...

177
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,237
...compare her face with some
that I shall show...

178
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,156
...and I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

179
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,814
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown...

180
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,615
...but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

190
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,151

Madam, I am here. What is your will?

196
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,133
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

197
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:58,391
Nurse, come back again!
I have remembered me.

198
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,472
Thou's hear our counsel.

199
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:03,850
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

200
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,232
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

201
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:09,440
By my count, I was your mother
much upon these years.

202
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,694
You are now a maid.

203
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,863
Thus then in brief!

204
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,541
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

205
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:22,078
A man, young lady!

206
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,789
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man of wax!

207
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,421
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

208
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,717
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower...

209
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:31,800
Nurse!

210
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,798
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

211
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:37,391
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there...

212
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,056
...with beauty's pen.

213
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:43,144
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover...

214
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,808
...to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

215
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,655
So shall you share all that he doth possess...

216
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,741
...by having him making yourself no less.

217
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,368
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

218
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:58,121
Oh!

219
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,960
Speak briefly, could you like of Paris's love?

220
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,086
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

221
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,336
But no more deep will I endart mine eye...

222
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,052

to make it fly.

She is the fairies' midwife...

...and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone...

265
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:14,613
...on the forefinger of an alderman...

266
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,324
...drawn with a team of little atomies...

267

...over men's noses as they lie asleep.

268

Her chariot is an empty hazelnut...

night by night through lovers' brains...

who straight dream on fees.

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck...

...and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

276
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:54,401
...and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

277

This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs...

278

and learns them first to bear...

...making them women of good carriage!

280

...which are the children of an idle brain...

287
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:43,214
...begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

288
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:48,340
...which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind...

289
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,346
...who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north...

290

...and, being angered,
puffs away from thence...

Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

I would not for the wealth of all this town...

...the gentle sin is this.

365
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:47,293
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand...

366
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:51,303
...to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

367

Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

368
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,935
...which mannerly devotion shows in this.

369
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:01,235
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

370
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,736
...and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

371
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,823
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

372
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,821
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

373
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:16,161
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

374
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:19,621
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

375
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:23,759
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

376
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,423
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

377
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,174
- Yoo-hoo!
- (elevator pings)

378
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:32,641
Dave!

379
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,844
Oh! Agh!

380
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:38,731
Ugh!

381
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:47,318
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

382
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,449
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

383
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:52,372
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

384
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:54,081
Give me my sin again.

385
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,996
You kiss by the book.

386
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,637

387
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,592
Juliet?

388
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:12,466
Juliet!

389
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:24,566
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

390
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,110
Come, let's away!

391
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,478
Is she a Capulet?

392
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:02,401
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague...

393
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:05,062
...the only son of your great enemy.

394
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,006
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

395
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:31,137
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

396
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:07,965
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

397
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:13,051
(chanting) I am a pretty piece of flesh!

398
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:18,390
I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am!

399
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:29,745
My only love sprung from my only hate!

400
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:33,867
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

401
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:39,036
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy.

402
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:54,136
I will withdraw.

403
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,813
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet...

404
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:00,392
...convert to bitterest gall.

405
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,612
(chanting) A pretty piece of flesh! I am!

406
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:11,158
A pretty piece of...

407
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:12,279
Romeo!

408
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,248
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

409
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,330
Romeo!

410
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,952
Humours! Madman!

411
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:20,918
Passion! Lover!

412
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,384
I will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes...

413
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,554
...by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip...

414
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,852
...by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

415
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:40,109
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

416
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:42,733
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

417
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:43,522
Romeo!

418
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,898
(Mercutio) Good night!

419
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:50,655
I'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

420
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,104
Oh!

421
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:23,937
(clatter)

422
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,610
(dog barks)

423
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:31,240
But soft!

424
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,657
What light through yonder window breaks?

425
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:41,792
It is the east...

426
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,755
...and Juliet is the sun!

427
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:52,509
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

428
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:55,309
...who is already sick and pale with grief...

429
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:59,348
...that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

430
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:02,648
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

431
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,117
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

432
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:12,456
O cast it off!

433
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,125
(elevator)

434
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:24,167
It is my lady, it is my love.

435
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,755
O that she knew she were.

436
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:35,726
Ay me!

437
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,020
She speaks.

438
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:43,189
Speak again, bright angel.

439
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,534
Romeo.

440
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,578
O Romeo!

441
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:51,740
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

442
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,710
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

443
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:03,710
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

444
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:07,423
Shall I hear more...

445
00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:09,508
...or shall I speak at this?

446
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,092
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

447
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:15,398
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

448
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,522
What's Montague?

449
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,483
It is not hand...

450
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,061
...nor foot, nor arm, nor face...

451
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:27,403
...nor any other part belonging to a man.

452
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,072
O be some other name!

453
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,535
What's in a name?

454
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:39,340
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

455
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:42,674
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called...

456
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:47,553
...retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

457
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,641
Romeo, doff thy name;

458
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,263
...and for thy name, which is
no part of thee, take all myself.

459
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:56,432
- I take thee at thy word.
- Agh!

460
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,196
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

461
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,661
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

462
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,205
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

463
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:16,334
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb...

464
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,877
...and the place death,
considering who thou art.

465
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,670
With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls...

466
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,836
...for stony limits cannot hold love out...

467
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,385
...and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

468
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:29,225
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

469
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,751
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

470
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:02,334
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

471
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:04,671
But thou love me...

472
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:06,840
...let them find me here.

473
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,142
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued...

474
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,351
...wanting of thy love.

475
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,308
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

476
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:01,812
...else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek...

477
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:04,576
...for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

478
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:06,736
Fain would I dwell on form...

479
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:08,951
...fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

480
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,530
But... farewell compliment.

481
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:15,328
Dost thou love me?

482
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:19,579
I know thou wilt say "Ay",
and I will take thy word.

483
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:22,213
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

484
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:25,802
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

485
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,381
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

486
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:31,810
...that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

487
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:33,972
O swear not by the moon...

488
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:37,933
...the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb...

489
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,863
...lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

490
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:43,699
(chuckles) What shall I swear by?

491
00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:45,860
Do not swear at all.

492
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,029
Or, if thou wilt...

493
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:52,072
...swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry...

494
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,244
...and I'll believe thee.

495
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,788
If my heart's...

496
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,416
...dear love...

497
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:14,689
Do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy in this contract tonight.

498
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:18,226
It is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning...

499
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,989
...which doth cease to be
ere one can say "It lightens".

500
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,532
Sweet, good night!

501
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:25,321
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath...

502
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:28,162
...may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

503
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:29,326
Good night.

504
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,375
Good night!

505
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:36,835
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

506
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:41,458
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

507
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:47,173
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

508
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,772
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

509
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:05,535
Juliet!

510
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,910
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

511
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:19,090
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage...

512
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:22,093
...send me word tomorrow, by one
that I'll procure to come to thee...

513
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:24,467
...where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite...

514
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:26,513
...and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay...

515
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,842
...and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

516
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:30,098
Julieta!

517
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:32,852
Ay! By and by, I come!

518
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,941
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee...

519
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:38,102
- Juliet!
- By and by, I come!

520
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,982
...to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

521
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:44,283
Tomorrow will I send.

522
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,278
So thrive my soul.

523
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:55,961
A thousand times good night.

524
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:59,214
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

525
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:01,667
Juliet!

526
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:05,298
Julieta!

527
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,394
Good night.

528
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:17,814
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

529
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:21,273
...but love from love...

530
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:24,942
...toward school with heavy looks.

531
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,410
- (window opens)
- Romeo!

532
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,205
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

533
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:33,368
By the hour of nine.

534
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:36,665
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

535
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,923
Good night.

536
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,475
Good night. Good night.

537
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,063
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

538
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,406
...that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

539
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,904

Almighty is the powerful grace

547
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:38,979
...and their true qualities.

548
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,911
For nought so vile
that on the earth doth live...

549
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,664
...but to the earth
some special good doth give.

550
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,708
And nought so good
but strained from that fair use...

551
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,547
...revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

552
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,924
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied...

553
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:04,380
...and vice sometime's by action dignified.

554
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:08,886
Within the infant rind of this... weak flower...

555
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,730
...poison is resident...

556
00:46:11,814 --> 00:46:14,140
...and medicine power.

557
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:18,278
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part.

558
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:19,987
Being tasted...

559
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:24,402
...slays all senses with the heart.

560
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:29,951
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs...

561
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:32,118
...grace and rude will.

562
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:36,672
And where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death...

563
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,666
...eats up that plant.

564
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:40,835
Good morrow, Father!

565
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,837
Benedicite!

566
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:47,135
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

567
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:49,602
(boys) Good morrow, Romeo.

568
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,644
Good morrow.

569
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:54,305
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head...

570
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,022
...so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

571
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:00,739
Or if not so, then here I hit it right...

572
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:04,325
Our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight!

573
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:08,246
The last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

574
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:10,704
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

575
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:12,999
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no!

576
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,578
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

577
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:18,508
That's my good son.
But where then hast thou been?

578
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:22,341
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me...

579
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,054
...that's by me wounded.

580
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,141
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

581
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,765
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.

582
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:32,606
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

583
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:35,645
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set...

584
00:47:35,735 --> 00:47:38,487
...on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

585
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,148
We met, we wooed...

586
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,901
...we made exchange of vow.

587
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:48,239
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray...

588
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,084
...that thou consent to marry us today.

589
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:55,752
Holy Saint Francis!

590
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,916
What a change is here!

591
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:02,303
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

592
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:06,967
Young men's love then lies not truly
in their hearts, but in their eyes.

593
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,974
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

594
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:12,981
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

595
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,980
I pray thee...

596
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:20,531
...chide me not!

597
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:24,566
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

598
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:26,738
The other did not so.

599
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:28,907

600
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,618

623
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:16,318
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

624

Why, that same pale hard-hearted
wench, that Rosaline...

...torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.

00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:28,826
- A challenge, on my life!
- Romeo will answer it?

628
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:31,123
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

629
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:34,627
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares being dared.

630
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:40,136
Well, alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye!

631
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,260
Run through the ear with a love-song!

632
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:45,633
The very pin of his heart cleft
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!

633
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:48,051
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

634
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,514
- Why, what is Tybalt?
- More than Prince of Cats.

635
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:55,691
He is the courageous captain of compliments!

636
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:59,358
He fights as you sing pricksong.

637
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:03,326
Keeps time, distance, and proportion.

638
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,076
He rests his minim rests.

A duellist.

643
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:18,798
A duellist! A gentleman

644
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:20,962
...of the first and second cause.

645
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:23,131
The immortal passado!

646
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:26,760
The punto reverso!

647
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:28,550
The, um... hai!

648
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:31,351
- The what?

649
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,517
Here comes Romeo.

650
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:35,730
Romeo!

651
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:40,774
Ho-ho, taffeta punk!

652
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,943
Signor Romeo, bonjour!

653
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:46,782
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

654
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:49,329
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

655
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:52,335
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?

656
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:54,876
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?

657
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:57,456
Pardon, good Mercutio.
My business was great...

658
00:51:57,551 --> 00:52:00,042
...and in such a case as mine
a man may strain courtesy.

659
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,382
That's as much as to say...

660
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:05,340
...such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams!

661
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:08,768
- Meaning to curtsy?
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

662
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:12,438
- A most courteous exposition.
- Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

663
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:14,648
- Pink for flower?
- Right.

664
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,227
Why, then is my pump well flowered!

665
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,982
O sure wit!

666
00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:22,407
Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo!

667
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:25,945
Now art thou what thou art,
by art as well as by nature!

668
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:29,325
Here's goodly gear!

669
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:33,001
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.

670
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:35,579
I desire some confidence with you.

00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:58,355
Will you come to your father's?

679
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,317
We'll to dinner thither.

680
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,201
I will follow you.

681

If ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise, as they say...

683
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:17,838
...it were a very gross kind
of behaviour, as they say.

684
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,003
For the lady is young...

685
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,880
...and, therefore, if you should
deal double with her...

686
00:53:23,975 --> 00:53:28,518
...truly it were an ill thing,
and very weak dealing.

687
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:32,602
Bid her to come to confession
this afternoon...

688
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:37,651
...and there she shall,
at Friar Laurence's cell, be shrived...

689
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:40,400
...and married.

...to say to me that thou art out of breath?

Is the news good or bad? Answer to that.

707
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:29,538
Well, you have made a simple choice.

00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:32,201
You know not how to choose a man.

709

711

...yet his leg excels all men's...

712

What says he of our marriage?

00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:52,640
What of that?

716

Tell me, what says my love?

Thy love says, like an honest gentleman...

724

and a handsome...

...and, I warrant, a virtuous...

726
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:22,296

- "Where is your mother?"

01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,272
Tybalt...

806
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,826
...the reason that I have to love thee...

807
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:18,363
...doth much excuse...

808
01:01:18,456 --> 01:01:21,540
...the appertaining rage to such a greeting.

809
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,209
Villain am I none.

810
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:32,504
Therefore, farewell.

811
01:01:32,596 --> 01:01:34,553
I see thou knowest me not.

812
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:46,774
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me!

813
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:49,479
Turn and draw!

814
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:51,479
Turn and draw!

815
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,071
Turn and draw.

816
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,825
- Turn and draw!
- I do protest I never injured thee...

817
01:01:59,124 --> 01:02:01,994
...but love thee better than thou canst devise...

818
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,668
...till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

819
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,081
And so, good Capulet...

820
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:11,211
...whose name I tender
as dearly as mine own...

821
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:13,379
(thunder)

822
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:17,515
...be satisfied.

823
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:22,389
Be satisfied.

824
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:27,688
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

825
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:40,324
Thou art my soul's hate!

826
01:02:49,176 --> 01:02:49,876
Tybalt!

827
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:52,339
You rat-catcher!

828
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:53,972
Will you walk?

829
01:02:54,723 --> 01:02:56,597
What wouldst thou have with me?

830
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:59,555
Good King of Cats,
nothing but one of your nine lives!

831
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:00,974
I am for you!

832
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:10,401
(groans)

833
01:03:15,453 --> 01:03:18,657
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

834
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:26,250
(yells)

835
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,789
(slash)

836
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:43,357
(Mercutio chuckles)

837
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:47,190
- Art thou hurt?
- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

838
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:51,780
A scratch!

839
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:53,942
Ay, a scratch...

840
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,406
A scratch! (laughs)

841
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:03,704
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

842
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,587
'Twill serve.

843
01:04:05,673 --> 01:04:09,505
Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man.

844
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:30,062
A plague... o' both your houses!

845
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,409
They have made worms' meat of me.

846
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,413
A plague on both your houses!

847
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,997
(echoing) Your houses! Your houses!

848
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,330
Your houses! Your houses!

849
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,352
No!

850
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,337
(Mercutio)
Why the devil came you between us?

851
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,832
I was hurt under your arm.

852
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,050
I thought all for the best!

853
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:36,428
A plague o' both your houses.

854
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,139
(sobs) No! No!

855
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:47,108
(Abra) Come forth!

856
01:05:49,281 --> 01:05:50,906
Come forth!

857
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:53,067
Mercutio!

858
01:05:56,706 --> 01:06:01,949
♪ Requiem aeternam

859
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:08,420
♪ Requiem aeternam

860
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:22,434
♪ Dona eis

861
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,527
No!

862
01:07:07,613 --> 01:07:09,902
Come, gentle night.

863
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:14,447
Come, loving, black-browed night.
Give me my Romeo.

864
01:07:14,704 --> 01:07:19,449
And when I shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars...

865
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:22,994
...and he will make
the face of heaven so fine...

866
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:26,753
...that all the world
will be in love with night...

867
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,677
...and pay no worship to the garish sun.

868
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:33,922
O! I have bought the mansion of a love...

869
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,305
...but not possessed it;

870
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:39,145
...and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed.

871
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,354
So... tedious is this day...

872
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:47,025
...as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child...

873
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:50,197
...that hath new robes and may not wear them.

874
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:53,569
(yelling)

875
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:41,874
Mercutio's soul is but a little way
above our heads...

876
01:08:41,962 --> 01:08:44,038
...staying for thine to keep him company!

877
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:47,132
Thou wretched boy shalt with him hence!

878
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:50,003
(sobbing) Either thou, or l...

879
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:52,503
...or both, must go with him!

880
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:56,723
Either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

881
01:08:56,811 --> 01:08:58,305
Either thou...

882
01:08:58,396 --> 01:09:02,476
...or l, or both, must go with him!

883
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:09,064
(yells)

884
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,705
(thunder)

885
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:05,540
I am fortune's fool!

886
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:16,091
Romeo!

887
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:20,393
Away, be gone! Stand not amazed!

888
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:28,488
Away!

889
01:10:28,573 --> 01:10:30,650
Romeo!

890
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,410
(sirens)

891
01:10:44,131 --> 01:10:46,208
Tybalt! (sobs)

892
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:54,509
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

893
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:00,564
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

894
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,359
Romeo he cries aloud, "Hold, friends!"

895
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:10,491
Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio.

896
01:11:10,993 --> 01:11:13,069
Tybalt here slain...

897
01:11:13,996 --> 01:11:16,072
...Romeo's hand did slay.

898
01:11:16,165 --> 01:11:16,947
Prince!

899
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,036
As thou art true...

900
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:22,963
...for blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

901
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:25,799
Romeo... spoke him fair...

902
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:28,553
...could not take truce
with the unruly spleen of Tybalt...

903
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:30,012
...deaf to peace.

904
01:11:30,096 --> 01:11:32,718
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false!

905
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:36,851
I beg forjustice,
which thou, Prince, must give!

906
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:39,723
Romeo slew Tybalt.

907
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:41,475
Romeo must not live!

908
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:46,524
Romeo slew him. He slew Mercutio.

909
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:49,484
Who now the price of his dear blood
doth owe?

910
01:11:49,575 --> 01:11:51,651
(wailing)

911
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:56,164
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

912
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:59,415
His fault concludes but what the law
should end-the life of Tybalt.

913
01:11:59,502 --> 01:12:02,040
And for that offence
immediately we do exile him.

914
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,161
Noble Prince...

915
01:12:03,256 --> 01:12:05,498
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses!

916
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:08,379
Nor tears nor prayers
shall purchase out abuses!

917
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,094
Therefore use none!

918
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,685
Let Romeo hence in haste!

919
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:22,891
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last!

920
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:26,152
Romeo is banished!

921
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:29,524
Banishment...

922
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:33,278
Be merciful, say death.

923
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:37,910
For exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death.

924
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:40,873
Do not say banishment.

925
01:12:41,379 --> 01:12:46,754
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts,
and thou art wedded to calamity.

926
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:49,251
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

927
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:52,797
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

928
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,133
There is no world without Verona walls.

929
01:12:55,227 --> 01:12:59,640
Hence banished is banish'd from
the world, and world's exile is death.

930
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:01,475
Then banished is death mistermed.

931
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:04,687
Calling death banished, thou cutt'st
my head off with a golden axe...

932
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,855
...and smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me.

933
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:10,032
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

934
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,988
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.

935
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,110
(knocking)

936
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:16,582
Hence!

937
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:21,043
(knocking)

938
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:22,953
(knocking)

939
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:26,622
- I come from my lady Juliet!
- Welcome, then.

940
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,261
Where is my lady's lord?

941
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:30,421
Romeo, come forth.

942
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,466
- Ah, sir.
- Nurse.

943
01:13:34,059 --> 01:13:35,933
Ah, sir.

944
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,096
Death's the end of all.

945
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:41,349
Speakest thou of Juliet?

946
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,940
Where is she and how doth she?

947
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:47,195
And what says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

948
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,698
O she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

949
01:13:50,785 --> 01:13:54,534
And then on Romeo cries,
and then falls down again.

950
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,832
As if that name, shot from
the deadly level of a gun...

951
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:06,342
...did murder her, as that name's
cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

952
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:09,293
I thought thy disposition better tempered.

953
01:14:09,388 --> 01:14:12,306
Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy.

954
01:14:13,017 --> 01:14:16,018
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt.

955
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:18,179
There art thou happy.

956
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:23,642
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.

957
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:25,776
There art thou happy.

958
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:28,568
A pack of blessings light upon thy back.

959
01:14:28,658 --> 01:14:32,323
Wherefore railest thou on thy birth,
the heaven, and earth...

960
01:14:32,412 --> 01:14:36,576
...since birth, and heaven, and earth,
all three do meet in thee at once?

961
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,659
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

962
01:14:40,796 --> 01:14:43,204
How well my comfort is revived by this.

963
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:44,705
Go.

964
01:14:45,759 --> 01:14:48,167
Get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

965
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:51,465
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.

966
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:54,265
Hie you! Make haste!

967
01:14:55,269 --> 01:14:57,807
But look thou...
stay not till the watch be set...

968
01:14:57,897 --> 01:15:00,104
...for then thou canst not pass to Mantua...

969
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:04,059
...where thou wilt live till we can
find a time to blaze your marriage...

970
01:15:04,154 --> 01:15:07,071
...reconcile your friends,
beg pardon of the Prince...

971
01:15:07,157 --> 01:15:10,941
...and call thee back with
twenty hundred thousand times more joy...

972
01:15:11,036 --> 01:15:13,527
...than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

973
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,955
Quick, hence! Be gone by break of day!

974
01:15:20,421 --> 01:15:22,129
Sojourn in Mantua!

975
01:15:22,548 --> 01:15:24,090
Farewell.

976
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:26,084
(thunder)

977
01:15:31,557 --> 01:15:33,182
O God!

978
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:36,103
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

979
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:40,727
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

980
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:46,613
Was ever book containing
such vile matter so fairly bound?

981
01:15:47,115 --> 01:15:51,113
O that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace!

982
01:15:55,499 --> 01:15:57,705
She'll not come down tonight.

983
01:15:59,545 --> 01:16:02,380
These times of woe afford no time to woo.

984
01:16:02,465 --> 01:16:06,048
Look you, she loved
her kinsman Tybalt dearly.

985
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:08,211
And so did I.

986
01:16:08,304 --> 01:16:09,964
Well...

987
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,175
...we were born to die.

988
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:18,596
I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.

989
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,368
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

990
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:35,072
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue
shall smooth thy name...

991
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,950
...when l, thy three-hours' wife,
have mangled it?

992
01:16:39,045 --> 01:16:42,663
But whyfore, villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

993
01:16:43,925 --> 01:16:44,755
(gasps)

994
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:15,284
♪ I'm kissing you

995
01:17:47,908 --> 01:18:01,457
♪ Co I'm kissing you, o-oh

996
01:18:03,174 --> 01:18:16,604
♪ I'm kissing you

997
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:26,071
I will make a desperate tender
of my child's love.

998
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:29,407
I think she will be ruled in all respects by me.

999
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:33,278
Nay, more! I doubt it not!

1000
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:35,531
But what say you to Thursday?

1001
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:37,701
My lord, I...

1002
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,916
I would that Thursday were tomorrow!

1003
01:18:41,006 --> 01:18:43,757
Thursday let it be, then! Wife!

1004
01:18:43,842 --> 01:18:45,918
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.

1005
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:49,795
Tell her o' Thursday she shall
be married to this noble sir!

1006
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:07,094
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

1007
01:20:08,055 --> 01:20:10,890
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

1008
01:20:11,434 --> 01:20:14,269
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.

1009
01:20:14,353 --> 01:20:19,596
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

1010
01:20:19,692 --> 01:20:23,061
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not be gone.

1011
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:25,522
Well, let me be taken.

1012
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:27,407
Let me be put to death!

1013
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:30,275
I have more care to stay than will to go.

1014
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:33,537
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

1015
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,292
How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.

1016
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:44,838
It is... It is!

1017
01:20:45,469 --> 01:20:47,960
Hie hence, be gone, away!

1018
01:20:48,556 --> 01:20:50,714
O now be gone!
More light and light it grows.

1019
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,677
More light and light...

1020
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,976
...more dark and dark our woes.

1021
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,899
- (door opens)
- Madam!

1022
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,771
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber!

1023
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:07,237
(Gloria) Ho, daughter, are you up?

1024
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:14,743
Then, window...

1025
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,909
...let day in and let life...

1026
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:18,743
...out!

1027
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:20,000
Juliet?

1028
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:23,375
- Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
- I doubt it not.

1029
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:30,968
Trust me, love. All these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses...

1030
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:33,466
...in our times to come.
- Ho, daughter!

1031
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:38,597
Juliet!

1032
01:21:49,703 --> 01:21:51,447
O God!

1033
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:53,827
I have an ill-divining soul!

1034
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:56,407
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low...

1035
01:21:56,502 --> 01:21:58,542
...as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

1036
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:03,121
Adieu!

1037
01:22:03,676 --> 01:22:05,420
O fortune, fortune!

1038
01:22:05,511 --> 01:22:07,385
Be fickle, fortune.

1039
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:11,517
For then I hope thou wilt not
keep him long, but send him back.

1040
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:24,569
Thou hast a careful father, child.

1041
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:27,860
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness...

1042
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:31,155
...hath sorted out a sudden day ofjoy...

1043
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:35,412
...which thou expect'st not,
nor I looked not for.

1044
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,826
Madam, in happy time. What day is that?

1045
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:42,088
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn...

1046
01:22:42,175 --> 01:22:45,342
...the gallant, young,
and noble gentleman, Sir Paris...

1047
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:48,797
...at St Peter's Church,
shall happily make thee there...

1048
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:50,135
...ajoyful bride.

1049
01:22:55,605 --> 01:22:58,606
Now, by St Peter's Church and Peter too...

1050
01:22:58,692 --> 01:23:01,729
...he shall not make me there ajoyful bride!

1051
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:05,277
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.

1052
01:23:05,366 --> 01:23:07,323
How now, wife?

1053
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:09,948
Have you delivered to her our decree?

1054
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:11,413
Ay, sir.

1055
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:13,905
But she will none, she gives you thanks.

1056
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:18,037
I would the fool were married to her grave.

1057
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:22,925
How?

1058
01:23:23,009 --> 01:23:25,085
Will she none?

1059
01:23:25,178 --> 01:23:27,254
Is she not proud?

1060
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:31,090
Doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is...

1061
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:34,553
...that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bride?

1062
01:23:35,063 --> 01:23:38,397
Not proud you have,
but thankful that you have.

1063
01:23:38,484 --> 01:23:41,354
Proud can I never be of what I hate!

1064
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:44,446
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

1065
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:47,948
But fettle your fine joints
'gainst Thursday next!

1066
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:50,075
Hear me with patience but to speak a word!

1067
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:51,111
No!

1068
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:52,237
Fie, fie! Stop it!

1069
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:55,083
Speak not! Reply not! Do not answer me!

1070
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,876
Husband, are you mad?

1071
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:02,714
Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!

1072
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:05,968
God in heaven bless her! You are
to blame, my lord, to rate her so!

1073
01:24:06,054 --> 01:24:08,011
Peace, you mumbling fool!

1074
01:24:08,098 --> 01:24:09,925
I tell thee what.

1075
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:12,306
Get thee to church o' Thursday...

1076
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,802
...or never after look me in the face!

1077
01:24:14,897 --> 01:24:17,684
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.

1078
01:24:17,775 --> 01:24:20,859
An you be not, hang, beg, starve...

1079
01:24:20,945 --> 01:24:22,937
...die in the streets!

1080
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,774
Trust to 't. Bethink you.

1081
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:26,942
I'll not be forsworn!

1082
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:42,966
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!

1083
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:47,173
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

1084
01:24:47,264 --> 01:24:48,889
Or, if you do not...

1085
01:24:48,974 --> 01:24:52,343
...make the bridal bed in that
dim monument where Tybalt lies.

1086
01:24:54,438 --> 01:24:56,265
Talk not to me...

1087
01:24:58,317 --> 01:25:00,393
...for I'll not speak a word.

1088
01:25:01,237 --> 01:25:04,238
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1089
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,120
O God!

1090
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,964
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?

1091
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:26,380
What say'st thou? Hast thou not
a word ofjoy? Some comfort, Nurse!

1092
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:29,340
Faith, here it is.

1093
01:25:30,476 --> 01:25:34,390
I think it best you marry with this Paris.

1094
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:37,891
O he's a lovely gentleman.

1095
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:44,940
I think you are happy in this second match...

1096
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:47,943
...for it excels your first.

1097
01:25:49,037 --> 01:25:51,113
Or, if it did not...

1098
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:53,495
...your first is dead.

1099
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:00,748
Or 'twere as good he were...

1100
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,676
...as living here and you no use to him.

1101
01:26:07,473 --> 01:26:09,679
Speakest thou from thy heart?

1102
01:26:11,018 --> 01:26:14,518
And from my soul too;
else beshrew them both!

1103
01:26:16,566 --> 01:26:18,226
Amen.

1104
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:19,978
What?

1105
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,234
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

1106
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:32,120
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
having displeased my father...

1107
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:36,371
...to Friar Laurence to make
confession and be absolved.

1108
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:45,004
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death.

1109
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:47,883
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous...

1110
01:26:47,974 --> 01:26:50,891
...that she doth give her sorrow
so much sway...

1111
01:26:50,977 --> 01:26:56,351
...and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears.

1112
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:57,816
(door opens)

1113
01:26:59,527 --> 01:27:02,528
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

1114
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,565
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

1115
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:08,446
That "may be" must be, love,
on Thursday next.

1116
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:12,487
- What must be shall be.
- Well, that's a certain text.

1117
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:15,665
Come you to make confession?

1118
01:27:15,753 --> 01:27:20,000
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,
or shall I come to you at evening mass?

1119
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:23,626
My leisure serves thee,
pensive daughter, now.

1120
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:26,720
Good sir, we must entreat the time alone.

1121
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:30,058
God shield I should disturb devotion!

1122
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:38,067
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.

1123
01:27:39,152 --> 01:27:41,192
Till then adieu...

1124
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:43,356
...and keep this holy kiss.

1125
01:27:51,957 --> 01:27:53,997
Tell me not, Father,
that thou hearest of this...

1126
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:57,952
...unless thou tell me how I may prevent it!
- It strains me past the compass of my wits!

1127
01:27:58,047 --> 01:28:00,040
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help...

1128
01:28:00,133 --> 01:28:01,959
...do thou but call my resolution wise.

1129
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:04,803
- And with this, I'll help it presently!
- Hold, daughter!

1130
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:08,221
Be not so long to speak! I long to die!

1131
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:12,062
I do spy a kind of hope...

1132
01:28:12,145 --> 01:28:14,352
...which craves as desperate an execution...

1133
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,728
...as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1134
01:28:16,817 --> 01:28:19,106
lf, rather than to marry with this Paris...

1135
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:21,946
...thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself...

1136
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,863
...then it is likely thou wilt
undertake a thing like death...

1137
01:28:25,951 --> 01:28:28,869
...to chide away this shame.

1138
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:31,781
And, if thou darest...

1139
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,826
...l'll give thee remedy.

1140
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:40,372
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.

1141
01:28:40,466 --> 01:28:43,136
Each part,
deprived of supple government...

1142
01:28:43,219 --> 01:28:46,339
...shall stiff and stark and cold
appear, like death.

1143
01:28:46,723 --> 01:28:51,100
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed...

1144
01:28:51,186 --> 01:28:53,262
...there art thou dead.

1145
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:55,395
Thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault...

1146
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:57,356
...where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

1147
01:28:57,443 --> 01:29:00,147
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1148
01:29:00,237 --> 01:29:02,811
...thou shalt continue
four and twenty hours...

1149
01:29:02,907 --> 01:29:05,528
...and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1150
01:29:05,618 --> 01:29:08,323
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake...

1151
01:29:08,412 --> 01:29:10,950
...shall Romeo by my letters know our drift.

1152
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,035
And hither shall he come that very night
to bear thee both hence to Mantua.

1153
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:19,037
Take thou this vial, being then in bed...

1154
01:29:19,132 --> 01:29:21,753
...and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

1155
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:26,256
I'll send my letters to thy lord
post haste to Mantua.

1156
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:38,688
(knocking)

1157
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:40,153
Hello?

1158
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:05,669
What if this mixture do not work at all?

1159
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:08,884
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?

1160
01:30:11,353 --> 01:30:12,384
(door opens)

1161
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,683
- What, are you busy? Need you my help?
- No, madam.

1162
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:19,274
We have culled such necessaries
as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.

1163
01:30:19,362 --> 01:30:23,146
So please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you.

1164
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:25,447
For I am sure you have your hands full all...

1165
01:30:25,535 --> 01:30:27,243
...in this so sudden business.

1166
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:28,871
Good night.

1167
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:31,031
Get thee to bed and rest...

1168
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:34,283
...for thou hast need.

1169
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:42,170
Farewell.

1170
01:30:45,264 --> 01:30:47,837
God knows when we shall meet again.

1171
01:30:50,477 --> 01:30:51,853
Good night.

1172
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,486
Romeo...

1173
01:31:07,579 --> 01:31:09,737
...I drink to thee.

1174
01:31:27,224 --> 01:31:34,770
♪ Requiem...

1175
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:44,361
As the custom is, in all her best array,
bear her to church.

1176
01:32:11,437 --> 01:32:13,513
(bell tolls)

1177
01:32:41,677 --> 01:32:44,678
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit...

1178
01:32:44,764 --> 01:32:48,596
...lifts me above the ground
with cheerful thoughts.

1179
01:32:48,685 --> 01:32:51,223
I dreamt my lady came
and found me dead...

1180
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:55,262
...and breathed such life with kisses
in my lips that I revived...

1181
01:32:55,358 --> 01:32:57,434
...and was an emperor.

1182
01:32:58,528 --> 01:33:00,604
Ah me!

1183
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:03,271
How sweet is love itself possessed...

1184
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:06,652
...when but love's shadows
are so rich in joy!

1185
01:33:24,389 --> 01:33:26,049
News from Verona!

1186
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:35,894
How now, Balthasar?

1187
01:33:35,984 --> 01:33:38,938
Dost thou not bring me
letters from the priest?

1188
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:41,602
How doth my lady? Is my father well?

1189
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:46,573
How doth my lady Juliet?
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1190
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,161
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

1191
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:02,085
Her body rests in chapel monument...

1192
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:05,428
...and her immortal part
with the angels lives.

1193
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:08,258
I saw her laid low.

1194
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,890
Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

1195
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,979
Is it e'en so?

1196
01:34:43,763 --> 01:34:46,468
Then I defy you, stars!

1197
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,440
Juliet!

1198
01:35:02,908 --> 01:35:05,067
Juliet!

1199
01:35:38,988 --> 01:35:42,523
- I will hence tonight.
- Have patience!

1200
01:35:46,537 --> 01:35:48,080
Leave me!

1201
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:51,082
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

1202
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:53,041
Tush! Thou art deceived!

1203
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:57,207
Hast thou no letters to me from the priest?

1204
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:10,845
No matter.

1205
01:36:14,859 --> 01:36:16,935
Well, Juliet...

1206
01:36:18,404 --> 01:36:20,693
...I will lie with thee tonight.

1207
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:26,987
I will hence tonight.

1208
01:37:05,203 --> 01:37:08,786
(police radio)
Romeo is within Verona walls.

1209
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:19,342
Fear comes upon me!

1210
01:37:19,843 --> 01:37:21,883
O, much I fear...

1211
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:25,554
...some ill, unthrifty thing!

1212
01:37:28,185 --> 01:37:29,929
The letter was of dear import!

1213
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:33,596
I couldn't send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee.

1214
01:37:34,901 --> 01:37:36,858
The neglecting it may do much damage.

1215
01:37:36,945 --> 01:37:39,400
Bring forth these enemies,
Capulet and Montague!

1216
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:51,583
(knocking)

1217
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:54,212
Let me have a dram of poison...

1218
01:37:54,296 --> 01:37:58,626
...such soon-speeding gear as will
disperse itself through all the veins...

1219
01:37:58,717 --> 01:38:00,840
...that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

1220
01:38:00,928 --> 01:38:05,258
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona law
is death to any he that utters them.

1221
01:38:05,349 --> 01:38:08,469
The world is not thy friend,
nor the world's law!

1222
01:38:08,561 --> 01:38:10,601
Then be not poor, but break it...

1223
01:38:10,688 --> 01:38:12,562
...and take this!

1224
01:38:14,275 --> 01:38:16,945
My poverty but not my will consents.

1225
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:20,607
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

1226
01:38:31,877 --> 01:38:34,202
Drink it off...

1227
01:38:34,296 --> 01:38:38,294
...and if you had the strength of 20 men,
it would dispatch you straight.

1228
01:38:38,384 --> 01:38:40,044
There's my gold.

1229
01:38:40,136 --> 01:38:42,010
(helicopter)

1230
01:38:43,222 --> 01:38:45,298
Worse poison to men's souls...

1231
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:49,092
...than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

1232
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,921
Romeo hath no notice of these accidents.

1233
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,714
I will write again to Mantua.

1234
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,892
Within the hour will the fair Juliet wake.

1235
01:39:26,976 --> 01:39:29,053
She stirs. The lady stirs.

1236
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:41,690
- I do beseech you.
- Live and be prosperous.

1237
01:39:42,701 --> 01:39:44,777
And farewell, good fellow.

1238
01:39:45,454 --> 01:39:46,996
Then I will leave thee.

1239
01:39:58,843 --> 01:39:59,922
(sirens)

1240
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:27,495
Tempt not a desperate man!

1241
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:36,292
Hold! Hold!

1242
01:40:37,384 --> 01:40:38,463
(gunshots)

1243
01:40:38,635 --> 01:40:39,666
Hold!

1244
01:40:46,059 --> 01:40:48,432
(Prince) Once more I say to you, hold!

1245
01:40:55,945 --> 01:40:58,021
(panting)

1246
01:43:54,632 --> 01:43:56,708
My love...

1247
01:43:57,802 --> 01:43:59,878
My wife...

1248
01:44:00,513 --> 01:44:03,384
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

1249
01:44:03,474 --> 01:44:06,262
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

1250
01:44:09,063 --> 01:44:11,140
Thou art not conquered.

1251
01:44:15,403 --> 01:44:20,445
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks...

1252
01:44:21,034 --> 01:44:24,403
...and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

1253
01:44:36,842 --> 01:44:41,090
Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

1254
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:47,557
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous...

1255
01:44:47,645 --> 01:44:50,979
...and keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1256
01:45:29,898 --> 01:45:31,309
Here.

1257
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,603
O, here will I set up my everlasting rest...

1258
01:45:36,488 --> 01:45:42,194
...and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

1259
01:45:50,002 --> 01:45:52,079
Eyes, look your last.

1260
01:45:54,883 --> 01:45:57,089
Arms, take your last embrace.

1261
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,720
And lips...

1262
01:46:07,854 --> 01:46:10,061
O you, the doors to breath...

1263
01:46:13,902 --> 01:46:16,228
...seal with a righteous kiss...

1264
01:46:38,386 --> 01:46:40,463
...a dateless bargain...

1265
01:46:41,014 --> 01:46:43,054
...to engrossing death.

1266
01:46:48,105 --> 01:46:49,516
Romeo...

1267
01:46:50,733 --> 01:46:52,606
(gasping)

1268
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,244
What's here?

1269
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:08,114
Poison...

1270
01:47:09,919 --> 01:47:13,335
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after?

1271
01:47:18,345 --> 01:47:20,421
I'll kiss thy lips.

1272
01:47:20,514 --> 01:47:23,219
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them.

1273
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,306
Thy lips are warm.

1274
01:47:46,207 --> 01:47:47,867
Thus...

1275
01:47:49,085 --> 01:47:51,162
...with a kiss...

1276
01:47:55,217 --> 01:47:57,293
...I die.

See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1280
01:52:03,393 --> 01:52:07,059
...that heaven finds means
to kill yourjoys with love!

1281

And l, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.
