1
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:35,990
Two households, both alike in dignity...

2
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,279
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

3
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,574
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

4
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,916
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,873
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:52,084
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

7
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,845
...whose misadventured piteous overthrows...

8
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,262
...doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,220
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love...

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,098
...and the continuance
of their parents' rage...

11
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,103
...which, but their children's end,
nought could remove...

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,944
...is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,343
Two households...

14
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,586
...both alike in dignity...

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,298
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

16
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:44,599
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

17
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,186
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

18
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:56,784
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,995
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers
take their life.

20
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:45,409
A dog of the house of Capulet
moves me!

21
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,579
(rap music on car radio)

22
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:54,044
Pedlar's excrement!

23
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,553
King Urinal! Go rot!

24
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,222
(radio) â™ª The boys! The boys!

25
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:18,281
- The quarrel is between our masters.
- And us their men!

26
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,117
(laughs) Ahh!

27
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,217
(girls giggling)

28
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:46,439
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble!

29
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,653
(both chanting)
And I am a pretty piece of flesh!

30
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,280
I am...

31
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:57,110
...a pretty piece of flesh!

32
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,033
(gasps)

33
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,575
- Here comes of the house of Capulet!
- Quarrel, I will back thee.

34
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,377
Huh?

35
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,845
- Boo!
- (laughing)

36
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,971
(laughing)

37
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:30,102
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

38
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,255
Go forth! I will back thee!

39
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,386
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I... I do bite my thumb, sir.

40
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,630
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

41
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,262
- Is the law of our side if I say ay?
- No!

42
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,555
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but I bite my thumb, sir!

43
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,683
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir? No, sir!

44
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:08,811
But if you do, sir, I am for you.
I serve as good a man as you.

45
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,896
- No better?
- Uh... uh...

46
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:13,111
Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

47
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,026
- Yes, sir, better!
- You lie!

48
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,278
Draw, if you be men!

49
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,327
(women scream)

50
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:22,789
Part, fools! You know not what you do.

51
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,836
Put up your Swords!

52
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:06,168
What, art thou drawn
among these... heartless hinds?

53
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,124
Turn thee, Benvolio...

54
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:14,137
...and look upon thy death.

55
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,257
I do but keep the peace.

56
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,389
Put up thy Sword...

57
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:22,098
...or manage it to part these men with me.

58
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,431
Peace?

59
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,808
Peace?

60
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,977
I hate the word...

61
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,065
...as I hate hell...

62
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,948
...all Montagues...

63
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,034
...and thee.

64
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,581
(boy) Bang bang!

65
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,117
Bang.

66
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,176
(yelling)

67
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:17,533
- Come forth! Come!
- Wait!

68
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,826
Come forth!

69
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:29,880
(gunshots)

70
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,978
Agh!

71
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,617
(car horns)

72
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,893
(helicopter)

73
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,231
(TV) From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

74
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:40,447
Do not proceed!

75
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:49,833
Give me my Longsword, ho!

76
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:52,631
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

77
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,728
(Prince) Rebellious subjects...

78
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:04,606
...enemies to peace!

79
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:06,850
Throw your mistemper'd weapons
to the ground!

80
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,356
On pain of torture...

81
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:15,442
...from those bloody hands throw your
mistemper'd weapons to the ground!

82
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,528
Three civil brawls...

83
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:23,372
...bred of an airy word by thee,
old Capulet, and Montague...

84
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,498
...have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

85
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,049
If ever you disturb our streets again...

86
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:35,296
...your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

87
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,193
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

88
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:56,036
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

89
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,706
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore...

90
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,626
...so early walking did I see your son.

91
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,999
Many a morning
hath he there been seen...

92
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,124
...with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

93
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:11,632
Away from light
steals home my heavy son...

94
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,171
...and private in his chamber
pens himself...

95
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,341
...shuts up his windows...

96
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:22,429
...locks fair daylight out, and
makes himself an artificial night.

97
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,029
Why, then...

98
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:39,367
...O brawling love, O loving hate!

99
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,708
O anything of nothing first create!

100
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,704
Heavy lightness...

101
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:47,873
...serious vanity.

102
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:52,045
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms.

103
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,640
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

104
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,772
...unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

105
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,776
So please you, step aside.

106
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,574
I'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

107
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,368
Come, madam, let's away.

108
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,718
Good morrow, cousin.

109
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,722
Is the day so young?

110
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:23,973
But new struck, coz.

111
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,810
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

112
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:32,736
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

113
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,949
It was.

114
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,780
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

115
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,030
Not having that
which having makes them short.

116
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,405
- In love?
- Out.

117
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,873
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where I am in love.

118
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,085
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view...

119
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:47,498
...should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

120
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,165
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still...

121
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,013
...should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

122
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,090
Where shall we dine?

123
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,132
(TV)... this costly blood.

124
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,511
Never anger made good guard for itself.

125
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,767
The law hath not been dead...

126
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,848
O me! What fray was here?

127
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,348
- Coz, I...
- Yet tell me not, for I've heard it all.

128
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:08,113
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

129
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,522
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

130
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,608
O anything of nothing first create!

131
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,322
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

132
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,117
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

133
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,330
- Feather of lead, br...
- (chuckles)

134
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,703
Dost thou not laugh?

135
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,128
No, coz, I rather weep.

136
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,291
Good heart, at what?

137
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:31,962
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

138
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:36,005
Soft, I will go along. And if you
leave me so, you do me wrong.

139
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,227
But Montague is bound as well as l,
in penalty alike.

140
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:50,939
And 'tis not hard, I think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

141
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:54,532
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

142
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,945
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

143
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,200
But saying o'er what I have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world.

144
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:06,458
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

145
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,423
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

146
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,879
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

147
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,427
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast.

148
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:17,054
At my poor house look to behold this night...

149
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:20,762
...fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

150
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,432
Hear all, all see...

151
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,562
...and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

152
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,231
Come, go with me.

153
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:31,732
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

154
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,984
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

155
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,079
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.

156
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,286
A right good marksman!
And she's fair I love.

157
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:43,543
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

158
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,957
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

159
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:50,542
...nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes...

160
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,128
...nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

161
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,010
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

162
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,806
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

163
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,644
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how I should forget to think.

164
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,687
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

165
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,479
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

166
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,277
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

167
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,701
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

168
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:15,736
Good day, good fellow.

169
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,368
(TV) Now, I'll tell you without asking.

170
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,078
The great rich Capulet
holds an old accustom'd feast.

171
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,256
A fair assembly. Signor Placentio
and his wife and daughters...

172
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:32,051
...the lady widow of Utruvio, mmm,
and her lovely nieces Rosaline...

173
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,056
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline...

174
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,680
...whom thou so loves, with
all the admired beauties of Verona.

175
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:41,850
If you be not of the House of Montague,
come and crush a cup of wine!

176
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,313
Go thither, and with unattainted eye...

177
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,237
...compare her face with some
that I shall show...

178
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,156
...and I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

179
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,814
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown...

180
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,615
...but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

181
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,786
Juliet!

182
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,671
Juliet!

183
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,884
Juliet!

184
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,711
Juliet!

185
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,088
(gasps) Oh!

186
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,018
Ooh!

187
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,928
(elevator pings)

188
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:22,893
Nurse!

189
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,190
Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

190
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,151
I bade her come. God forbid!

191
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,864
Julieta!

192
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,319
Juliet!

193
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:39,290
Juliet!

194
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,996
Juliet!

195
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,248
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

196
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,133
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

197
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:58,391
Nurse, come back again!
I have remembered me.

198
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,472
Thou's hear our counsel.

199
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:03,850
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

200
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,232
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

201
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:09,440
By my count, I was your mother
much upon these years.

202
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,694
You are now a maid.

203
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,863
Thus then in brief!

204
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,541
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

205
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:22,078
A man, young lady!

206
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,789
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man of wax!

207
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,421
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

208
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,717
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower...

209
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:31,800
Nurse!

210
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,798
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

211
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:37,391
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there...

212
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,056
...with beauty's pen.

213
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:43,144
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover...

214
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,808
...to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

215
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,655
So shall you share all that he doth possess...

216
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,741
...by having him making yourself no less.

217
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,368
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

218
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:58,121
Oh!

219
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,960
Speak briefly, could you like of Paris's love?

220
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,086
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

221
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,336
But no more deep will I endart mine eye...

222
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,052
...than your consent gives strength
to make it fly.

223
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:16,722
(door opens)

224
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:18,889
Madam, the guests are come.

225
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,225
Go!

226
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,857
We follow thee.

227
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,230
Juliet! Ugh!

228
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:35,369
Go, girl. Seek happy nights to happy days.

229
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,790
(explosion)

230
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,346
(â™ª "Angel")

231
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,956
You taffeta punk!

232
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,339
- Die a beggar!
- (laughing)

233
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,139
(â™ª "Young Hearts Run Free")

234
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:41,265
(laughing)

235
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,434
(whooping)

236
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,989
â™ª Sharing this one and only life

237
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:54,369
â™ª Ending up just another
lost and lonely wife

238
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:55,783
â™ª You count up the years

239
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:59,823
â™ª And they will be filled with tears

240
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,206
â™ª Young hearts

241
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,540
â™ª Run free

242
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,548
â™ª Never be hung up

243
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:12,922
â™ª Like Rosaline and thee

244
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:16,924
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

245
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,514
Not I. Not l, believe me.

246
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:22,105
You have dancing shoes with
nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.

247
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:23,521
You are a lover.

248
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,315
Borrow Cupid's wings and soar
with them above a common bound.

249
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,694
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

250
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,321
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

251
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,036
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough...

252
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:37,075
...too rude, too boisterous,
and it pricks like thorn.

253
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,373
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.

254
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,414
Prick love for pricking,
and you beat love down.

255
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,873
Every man, betake him to his legs!

256
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,839
Come, we burn daylight, ho! Ho-o!

257
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,210
(all) Ho-o!

258
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:54,390
- But 'tis no wit to go!
- Why, may one ask?

259
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,552
- I dreamt a dream tonight.
- And so did I.

260
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,101
- And what was yours?
- That dreamers often lie.

261
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,763
In bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

262
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,559
O! Then I see
Queen Mab hath been with you.

263
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:08,197
She is the fairies' midwife...

264
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:11,236
...and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone...

265
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:14,613
...on the forefinger of an alderman...

266
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,324
...drawn with a team of little atomies...

267
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,247
...over men's noses as they lie asleep.

268
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,298
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut...

269
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:31,092
...her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat.

270
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:36,721
And in this state she gallops
night by night through lovers' brains...

271
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,888
...and then they dream of...

272
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:40,930
...love;

273
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,310
...o'er lawyers' fingers,
who straight dream on fees.

274
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,977
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck...

275
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,358
...and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

276
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:54,401
...and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

277
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:58,542
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs...

278
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:02,755
...that presses them
and learns them first to bear...

279
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,339
...making them women of good carriage!

280
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,969
This is she!

281
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,264
This is she!

282
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,193
Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

283
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,357
Thou talk'st of nothing.

284
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,903
True.

285
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:37,032
I talk of dreams...

286
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,375
...which are the children of an idle brain...

287
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:43,214
...begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

288
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:48,340
...which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind...

289
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,346
...who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north...

290
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:54,219
...and, being angered,
puffs away from thence...

291
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,062
...turning aside to the dew-dropping south.

292
00:22:57,146 --> 00:23:00,266
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves!

293
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:03,478
Supper is done, and we shall come too late!

294
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:05,812
I fear, too early.

295
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:11,611
For my mind misgives some... consequence,
yet hanging in the stars...

296
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:17,160
...shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels...

297
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,327
...and expire the term...

298
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,369
...of a despised life closed within my breast...

299
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:28,295
...by some vile forfeit of untimely death.

300
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:32,886
But he that hath the steerage of my course...

301
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:36,012
...direct my sail!

302
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,324

318
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,481
I have seen the day that I could tell...

319
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:11,826
...a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please.

â™ª Amore! Amore!

00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:14,987
â™ª Amore...

322
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,741
Whoo!

323
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:05,506
â™ª Pride can stand a thousand trials

324
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:11,508
â™ª The strong will never fall

325
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:18,472
â™ª But watching stars without you

326
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:23,109
â™ª My soul cried

327
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:32,574
â™ª Heaving heart

328
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:40,291
â™ª Is full of pain

329
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:48,174
â™ª Oh, oh

330
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:55,642
â™ª The aching

331
00:26:57,773 --> 00:27:07,774
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you

332
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:12,114
â™ª Oh

333
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:26,334
â™ª I'm kissing you

334
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,504
Madam, your mother calls!

335
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:31,931
â™ª Touch me deep

336
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,226
â™ª Pure and true

337
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:44,859
Will you now deny to dance?

338
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:47,652
A man, young lady. Such a man!

339
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,165
What!

340
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:04,004
Dares that slave come hither
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

341
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:09,170
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin!

342
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:12,642
Why, how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

343
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:15,763
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

344
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:17,931
- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

345
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:21,144
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

346
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:23,691
I would not for the wealth of all this town...

347
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,187
...here in my house do him disparagement.

348
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:28,820
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

349
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,285
Uncle, I'll not endure him.

350
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:33,572
He shall be endured.

351
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,739
Go to!

352
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,159
What, goodman boy? I say he shall!

353
00:28:38,253 --> 00:28:39,451
Go to!

354
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:41,206
Uncle, 'tis a shame.

355
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,207
Make a mutiny among my guests?

356
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:04,189
Did my heart love till now?

357
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,316
Forswear it, sight.

358
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:10,493
For I never saw true beauty till this night.

359
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:21,996
â™ª Where are you now?

360
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:34,177
â™ª Where are you now?

361
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:50,573
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you

362
00:29:51,872 --> 00:30:08,386
â™ª I'm kissing you now

363
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,575
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine...

364
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,744
...the gentle sin is this.

365
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:47,293
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand...

366
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:51,303
...to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

367
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,472
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

368
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,935
...which mannerly devotion shows in this.

369
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:01,235
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

370
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,736
...and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

371
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,823
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

372
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,821
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

373
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:16,161
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

374
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:19,621
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

375
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:23,759
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

376
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,423
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

377
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,174
- Yoo-hoo!
- (elevator pings)

378
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:32,641
Dave!

379
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,844
Oh! Agh!

380
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:38,731
Ugh!

381
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:47,318
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

382
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,449
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

383
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:52,372
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

384
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:54,081
Give me my sin again.

385
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,996
You kiss by the book.

386
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,637
Juliet! Juliet! Oh!

387
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,592
Juliet?

388
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:12,466
Juliet!

389
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:24,566
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

390
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,110
Come, let's away!

391
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,478
Is she a Capulet?

392
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:02,401
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague...

393
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:05,062
...the only son of your great enemy.

394
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,006
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

395
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:31,137
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

396
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:07,965
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

397
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:13,051
(chanting) I am a pretty piece of flesh!

398
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:18,390
I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am!

399
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:29,745
My only love sprung from my only hate!

400
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:33,867
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

401
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:39,036
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy.

402
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:54,136
I will withdraw.

403
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,813
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet...

404
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:00,392
...convert to bitterest gall.

405
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,612
(chanting) A pretty piece of flesh! I am!

406
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:11,158
A pretty piece of...

407
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:12,279
Romeo!

408
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,248
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

409
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,330
Romeo!

410
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,952
Humours! Madman!

411
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:20,918
Passion! Lover!

412
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,384
I will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes...

413
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,554
...by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip...

414
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,852
...by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

415
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:40,109
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

416
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:42,733
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

417
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:43,522
Romeo!

418
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,898
(Mercutio) Good night!

419
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:50,655
I'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

420
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,104
Oh!

421
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:23,937
(clatter)

422
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,610
(dog barks)

423
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:31,240
But soft!

424
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,657
What light through yonder window breaks?

425
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:41,792
It is the east...

426
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,755
...and Juliet is the sun!

427
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:52,509
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

428
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:55,309
...who is already sick and pale with grief...

429
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:59,348
...that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

430
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:02,648
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

431
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,117
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

432
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:12,456
O cast it off!

433
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,125
(elevator)

434
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:24,167
It is my lady, it is my love.

435
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,755
O that she knew she were.

436
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:35,726
Ay me!

437
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,020
She speaks.

438
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:43,189
Speak again, bright angel.

439
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,534
Romeo.

440
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,578
O Romeo!

441
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:51,740
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

442
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,710
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

443
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:03,710
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

444
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:07,423
Shall I hear more...

445
00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:09,508
...or shall I speak at this?

446
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,092
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

447
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:15,398
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

448
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,522
What's Montague?

449
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,483
It is not hand...

450
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,061
...nor foot, nor arm, nor face...

451
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:27,403
...nor any other part belonging to a man.

452
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,072
O be some other name!

453
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,535
What's in a name?

454
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:39,340
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

455
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:42,674
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called...

456
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:47,553
...retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

457
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,641
Romeo, doff thy name;

458
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,263
...and for thy name, which is
no part of thee, take all myself.

459
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:56,432
- I take thee at thy word.
- Agh!

460
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,196
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

461
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,661
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

462
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,205
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

463
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:16,334
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb...

464
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,877
...and the place death,
considering who thou art.

465
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,670
With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls...

466
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,836
...for stony limits cannot hold love out...

467
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,385
...and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

468
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:29,225
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

469
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,751
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

470
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:02,334
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

471
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:04,671
But thou love me...

472
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:06,840
...let them find me here.

473
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,142
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued...

474
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,351
...wanting of thy love.

475
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,308
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

476
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:01,812
...else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek...

477
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:04,576
...for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

478
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:06,736
Fain would I dwell on form...

479
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:08,951
...fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

480
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,530
But... farewell compliment.

481
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:15,328
Dost thou love me?

482
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:19,579
I know thou wilt say "Ay",
and I will take thy word.

483
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:22,213
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

484
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:25,802
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

485
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,381
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

486
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:31,810
...that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

487
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:33,972
O swear not by the moon...

488
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:37,933
...the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb...

489
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,863
...lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

490
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:43,699
(chuckles) What shall I swear by?

491
00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:45,860
Do not swear at all.

492
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,029
Or, if thou wilt...

493
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:52,072
...swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry...

494
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,244
...and I'll believe thee.

495
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,788
If my heart's...

496
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,416
...dear love...

497
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:14,689
Do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy in this contract tonight.

498
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:18,226
It is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning...

499
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,989
...which doth cease to be
ere one can say "It lightens".

500
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,532
Sweet, good night!

501
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:25,321
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath...

502
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:28,162
...may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

503
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:29,326
Good night.

504
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,375
Good night!

505
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:36,835
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

506
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:41,458
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

507
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:47,173
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

508
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,772
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

509
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:05,535
Juliet!

510
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,910
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

511
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:19,090
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage...

512
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:22,093
...send me word tomorrow, by one
that I'll procure to come to thee...

513
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:24,467
...where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite...

514
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:26,513
...and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay...

515
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,842
...and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

516
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:30,098
Julieta!

517
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:32,852
Ay! By and by, I come!

518
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,941
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee...

519
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:38,102
- Juliet!
- By and by, I come!

520
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,982
...to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

521
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:44,283
Tomorrow will I send.

522
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,278
So thrive my soul.

523
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:55,961
A thousand times good night.

524
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:59,214
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

525
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:01,667
Juliet!

526
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:05,298
Julieta!

527
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,394
Good night.

528
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:17,814
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

529
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:21,273
...but love from love...

530
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:24,942
...toward school with heavy looks.

531
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,410
- (window opens)
- Romeo!

532
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,205
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

533
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:33,368
By the hour of nine.

534
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:36,665
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

535
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,923
Good night.

536
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,475
Good night. Good night.

537
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,063
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

538
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,406
...that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

539
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,904
Juliet!

540
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,997
â™ª You and me always

541
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,577
â™ª And for ever

542
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:19,255
â™ª You and me always

543
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:22,260
â™ª And for ever

544
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:27,388
â™ª Ba ba-ba ba-ba

545
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,976
â™ª It was always you and me...

546
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:36,809
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones...

547
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:38,979
...and their true qualities.

548
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,911
For nought so vile
that on the earth doth live...

549
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,664
...but to the earth
some special good doth give.

550
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,708
And nought so good
but strained from that fair use...

551
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,547
...revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

552
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,924
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied...

553
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:04,380
...and vice sometime's by action dignified.

554
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:08,886
Within the infant rind of this... weak flower...

555
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,730
...poison is resident...

556
00:46:11,814 --> 00:46:14,140
...and medicine power.

557
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:18,278
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part.

558
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:19,987
Being tasted...

559
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:24,402
...slays all senses with the heart.

560
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:29,951
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs...

561
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:32,118
...grace and rude will.

562
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:36,672
And where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death...

563
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,666
...eats up that plant.

564
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:40,835
Good morrow, Father!

565
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,837
Benedicite!

566
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:47,135
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

567
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:49,602
(boys) Good morrow, Romeo.

568
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,644
Good morrow.

569
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:54,305
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head...

570
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,022
...so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

571
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:00,739
Or if not so, then here I hit it right...

572
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:04,325
Our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight!

573
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:08,246
The last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

574
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:10,704
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

575
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:12,999
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no!

576
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,578
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

577
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:18,508
That's my good son.
But where then hast thou been?

578
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:22,341
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me...

579
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,054
...that's by me wounded.

580
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,141
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

581
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,765
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.

582
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:32,606
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

583
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:35,645
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set...

584
00:47:35,735 --> 00:47:38,487
...on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

585
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,148
We met, we wooed...

586
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,901
...we made exchange of vow.

587
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:48,239
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray...

588
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,084
...that thou consent to marry us today.

589
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:55,752
Holy Saint Francis!

590
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,916
What a change is here!

591
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:02,303
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

592
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:06,967
Young men's love then lies not truly
in their hearts, but in their eyes.

593
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,974
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

594
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:12,981
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

595
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,980
I pray thee...

596
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:20,531
...chide me not!

597
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:24,566
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

598
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:26,738
The other did not so.

599
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:28,907
Yes, she well knew...

600
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,618
...thy love did read by rote,
that could not spell.

601
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:42,462
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my mother

602
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:47,383
â™ª She's never satisfied

603
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:51,807
For this alliance may so happy prove...

604
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:55,433
...to turn your households'rancour...

605
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:57,354
...to pure love.

606
00:48:57,446 --> 00:49:00,151
â™ª This is what it sounds like

607
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:04,618
â™ª When doves cry

608
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:09,283
Come, young waverer, come, go with me.

609
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:12,294
In one respect I'll thy assistant be.

610
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:16,709
For this alliance may so happy prove...

611
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,670
...to turn your households' rancour
to pure love.

612
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,801
O let us hence! I stand on sudden haste!

613
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,386
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

614
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:32,937
â™ª Maybe I'm just too demanding

615
00:49:33,025 --> 00:49:36,892
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

616
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:40,606
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my mother

617
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,828
â™ª She's never satisfied

618
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:46,870
â™ª Why do we scream at each other?

619
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:02,129
â™ª This is what it sounds like

620
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:06,008
â™ª This is what it sounds like

621
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,469
â™ª This is what it sounds like

622
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:13,228
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home tonight?

623
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:16,318
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

624
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:20,236
Why, that same pale hard-hearted
wench, that Rosaline...

625
00:50:20,324 --> 00:50:22,946
...torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

626
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:25,871
Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.

627
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:28,826
- A challenge, on my life!
- Romeo will answer it?

628
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:31,123
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

629
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:34,627
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares being dared.

630
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:40,136
Well, alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye!

631
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,260
Run through the ear with a love-song!

632
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:45,633
The very pin of his heart cleft
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!

633
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:48,051
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

634
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,514
- Why, what is Tybalt?
- More than Prince of Cats.

635
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:55,691
He is the courageous captain of compliments!

636
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:59,358
He fights as you sing pricksong.

637
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:03,326
Keeps time, distance, and proportion.

638
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,076
He rests his minim rests.

639
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:09,533
One, two, and a third...

640
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:10,622
...in your bosom.

641
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,202
The very butcher of a silk button.

642
00:51:13,672 --> 00:51:15,214
A duellist.

643
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:18,798
A duellist! A gentleman
of the very first house...

644
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:20,962
...of the first and second cause.

645
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:23,131
The immortal passado!

646
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:26,760
The punto reverso!

647
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:28,550
The, um... hai!

648
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:31,351
- The what?
- (laughs)

649
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,517
Here comes Romeo.

650
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:35,730
Romeo!

651
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:40,774
Ho-ho, taffeta punk!

652
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,943
Signor Romeo, bonjour!

653
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:46,782
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

654
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:49,329
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

655
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:52,335
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?

656
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:54,876
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?

657
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:57,456
Pardon, good Mercutio.
My business was great...

658
00:51:57,551 --> 00:52:00,042
...and in such a case as mine
a man may strain courtesy.

659
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,382
That's as much as to say...

660
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:05,340
...such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams!

661
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:08,768
- Meaning to curtsy?
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

662
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:12,438
- A most courteous exposition.
- Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

663
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:14,648
- Pink for flower?
- Right.

664
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,227
Why, then is my pump well flowered!

665
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,982
O sure wit!

666
00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:22,407
Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo!

667
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:25,945
Now art thou what thou art,
by art as well as by nature!

668
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:29,325
Here's goodly gear!

669
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:33,001
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.

670
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:35,579
I desire some confidence with you.

671
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:39,876
Ooh! A bawd!

672
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,718
(Mercutio) A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

673
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:45,132
(all chanting) So ho! So ho!

674
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:46,934
So ho! So ho!

675
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:49,185
Romeo!

676
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:51,146
Romeo!

677
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,312
Romeo!

678
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:58,355
Will you come to your father's?

679
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,317
We'll to dinner thither.

680
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,201
I will follow you.

681
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:08,285
(Mercutio) Farewell, ancient lady! Farewell!

682
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:14,078
If ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise, as they say...

683
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:17,838
...it were a very gross kind
of behaviour, as they say.

684
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,003
For the lady is young...

685
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,880
...and, therefore, if you should
deal double with her...

686
00:53:23,975 --> 00:53:28,518
...truly it were an ill thing,
and very weak dealing.

687
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:32,602
Bid her to come to confession
this afternoon...

688
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:37,651
...and there she shall,
at Friar Laurence's cell, be shrived...

689
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:40,400
...and married.

690
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,285
â™ª Love me, love me

691
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:46,447
â™ª Say that you love me

692
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,866
â™ª Fool me, fool me

693
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,502
â™ª Go on and fool me

694
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:52,579
â™ª Love me, love me

695
00:53:52,672 --> 00:53:54,830
â™ª Pretend that you love me

696
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:57,000
O honey nurse! What news?

697
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,046
- Nurse!
- I am aweary! Give me leave awhile!

698
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:03,507
Fie, how my bones ache!

699
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,176
What ajaunce have I!

700
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:08,803
Would thou hadst my bones
and I thy news.

701
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:10,890
Come, I pray thee, speak!

702
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:14,850
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?

703
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:17,483
Can you not see that I am out of breath?

704
00:54:17,573 --> 00:54:19,980
How art thou out of breath
when thou hast breath...

705
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:22,033
...to say to me that thou art out of breath?

706
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:25,789
Is the news good or bad? Answer to that.

707
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:29,538
Well, you have made a simple choice.

708
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:32,201
You know not how to choose a man.

709
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:35,463
Romeo? No, not he.

710
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,800
Though his face be better than any man's...

711
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:41,460
...yet his leg excels all men's...

712
00:54:41,556 --> 00:54:44,178
...and for a hand and a foot and a body...

713
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:45,596
(giggles)

714
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:51,516
But all this I did know before.
What says he of our marriage?

715
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:52,640
What of that?

716
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:55,938
Lord, how my head aches!
What a head have I!

717
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:59,110
- And my back!
- Ohh...

718
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:01,948
T'other side!

719
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,030
Oh, my back!

720
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:07,123
In faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

721
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,699
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse!

722
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:12,083
Tell me, what says my love?

723
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:14,793
Thy love says, like an honest gentleman...

724
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:17,718
...and a courteous, and a kind,
and a handsome...

725
00:55:17,802 --> 00:55:19,795
...and, I warrant, a virtuous...

726
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:22,296
- Where is your mother?
- "Where is your mother?"

727
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:24,383
How oddly thou repliest!

728
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:27,430
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
"Where is your mother?"

729
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:31,435
God's Lady dear! Are you so hot?
Henceforth, do your messages yourself!

730
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:34,977
O here's such a coil!
Come, what says Romeo?

731
00:55:40,493 --> 00:55:43,364
Have you got leave
to go to confession today?

732
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:46,681
I have.

733
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:51,443
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell.

734
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:55,405
There stays a husband to make you a wife!

735
00:55:55,493 --> 00:55:57,367
Oh!

736
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:06,455
â™ª Everybody's free to feel good

737
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:11,836
â™ª To feel good

738
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:16,254
â™ª Brother and sister

739
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:20,642
â™ª Together we'll make it through

740
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:24,184
â™ª Oh-oh, yeah

741
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:31,738
â™ª Someday a spirit will take you
and guide you there

742
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:37,780
â™ª I know you've been hurting

743
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:43,031
â™ª But I've been waiting to be there for you

744
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:49,755
â™ª And I'll be there just helping you out

745
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:55,180
â™ª Whenever I can

746
00:56:55,264 --> 00:56:57,387
(choir) â™ª Everybody's free

747
00:56:57,474 --> 00:57:00,641
â™ª Everybody's free

748
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:04,144
â™ª Oh, yeah

749
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:07,229
These violent delights...

750
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:09,607
...have violent ends.

751
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:13,195
And in their triumph die
like fire and powder...

752
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:15,952
...which, as they kiss, consume.

753
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:20,614
The sweetest honey is loathsome
in his own deliciousness.

754
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:24,408
Therefore love moderately.

755
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:27,954
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
for us both.

756
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:32,003
â™ª Oh, to feel good

757
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:34,004
(thunder)

758
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,097
(gunshot)

759
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:43,561
(Benvolio) I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire!

760
00:57:43,648 --> 00:57:46,649
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad...

761
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:53,275
...and if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl...

762
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:57,150
...for now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

763
00:57:57,496 --> 00:57:59,868
We're the Caps! (laughs)

764
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:01,617
Wha... Wha... Wha...

765
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:06,005
See? Thou art like one of these fellows...

766
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:09,208
...that, when he enters
the confines of a tavern...

767
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,051
...claps me his Sword upon the table...

768
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:14,378
...and says, "God send me no need of thee".

769
00:58:14,472 --> 00:58:17,556
And, by the operation of the second cup...

770
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:21,556
...draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.

771
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,603
- Yeah!
- (laughter)

772
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:26,059
Am I like such a fellow?

773
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:30,018
Thou art as hot ajack in thy mood
as any in Verona.

774
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,776
By my head, here come the Capulets.

775
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:40,039
By my heel... I care not.

776
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:44,118
Follow me close.

777
00:58:58,393 --> 00:59:01,762
Gentlemen, good day.
A word with one of you?

778
00:59:03,064 --> 00:59:04,891
Ooh!

779
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:07,059
And but one word with one of us?

780
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:09,228
Couple it with something.

781
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,940
Make it a word and a...

782
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:12,897
...a blow!

783
00:59:12,991 --> 00:59:14,071
(laughter)

784
00:59:17,246 --> 00:59:19,369
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir...

785
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:21,579
...and you will give me occasion.

786
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:24,419
Could you not take some occasion
without giving?

787
00:59:24,503 --> 00:59:25,832
(laughter)

788
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:27,167
Mercutio!

789
00:59:27,256 --> 00:59:30,210
Thou, uh... consortest with Romeo?

790
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:34,632
Consort!

791
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,597
What, dost thou make us minstrels?

792
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:41,769
And thou make minstrels of us,
look to hear nothing but discords!

793
00:59:42,147 --> 00:59:43,807
Here's my fiddlestick!

794
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:46,935
Here's that shall make you dance!
Zounds! Consort!

795
00:59:47,027 --> 00:59:50,776
Either withdraw unto some private place,
or reason coldly of your grievances...

796
00:59:50,864 --> 00:59:53,106
...or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us!

797
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,193
Men's eyes were made to look,
and let them gaze.

798
00:59:55,286 --> 00:59:58,037
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

799
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:04,496
Peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

800
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:07,631
Mercutio!

801
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:11,463
Romeo!

802
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:22,596
The love I bear thee can afford
no better term than this.

803
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,184
Thou art a villain!

804
01:00:27,444 --> 01:00:28,939
(snaps fingers)

805
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,272
Tybalt...

806
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,826
...the reason that I have to love thee...

807
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:18,363
...doth much excuse...

808
01:01:18,456 --> 01:01:21,540
...the appertaining rage to such a greeting.

809
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,209
Villain am I none.

810
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:32,504
Therefore, farewell.

811
01:01:32,596 --> 01:01:34,553
I see thou knowest me not.

812
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:46,774
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me!

813
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:49,479
Turn and draw!

814
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:51,479
Turn and draw!

815
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,071
Turn and draw.

816
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,825
- Turn and draw!
- I do protest I never injured thee...

817
01:01:59,124 --> 01:02:01,994
...but love thee better than thou canst devise...

818
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,668
...till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

819
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,081
And so, good Capulet...

820
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:11,211
...whose name I tender
as dearly as mine own...

821
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:13,379
(thunder)

822
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:17,515
...be satisfied.

823
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:22,389
Be satisfied.

824
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:27,688
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

825
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:40,324
Thou art my soul's hate!

826
01:02:49,176 --> 01:02:49,876
Tybalt!

827
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:52,339
You rat-catcher!

828
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:53,972
Will you walk?

829
01:02:54,723 --> 01:02:56,597
What wouldst thou have with me?

830
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:59,555
Good King of Cats,
nothing but one of your nine lives!

831
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:00,974
I am for you!

832
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:10,401
(groans)

833
01:03:15,453 --> 01:03:18,657
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

834
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:26,250
(yells)

835
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,789
(slash)

836
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:43,357
(Mercutio chuckles)

837
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:47,190
- Art thou hurt?
- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

838
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:51,780
A scratch!

839
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:53,942
Ay, a scratch...

840
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,406
A scratch! (laughs)

841
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:03,704
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

842
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,587
'Twill serve.

843
01:04:05,673 --> 01:04:09,505
Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man.

844
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:30,062
A plague... o' both your houses!

845
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,409
They have made worms' meat of me.

846
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,413
A plague on both your houses!

847
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,997
(echoing) Your houses! Your houses!

848
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,330
Your houses! Your houses!

849
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,352
No!

850
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,337
(Mercutio)
Why the devil came you between us?

851
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,832
I was hurt under your arm.

852
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,050
I thought all for the best!

853
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:36,428
A plague o' both your houses.

854
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,139
(sobs) No! No!

855
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:47,108
(Abra) Come forth!

856
01:05:49,281 --> 01:05:50,906
Come forth!

857
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:53,067
Mercutio!

858
01:05:56,706 --> 01:06:01,949
â™ª Requiem aeternam

859
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:08,420
â™ª Requiem aeternam

860
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:22,434
â™ª Dona eis

861
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,527
No!

862
01:07:07,613 --> 01:07:09,902
Come, gentle night.

863
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:14,447
Come, loving, black-browed night.
Give me my Romeo.

864
01:07:14,704 --> 01:07:19,449
And when I shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars...

865
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:22,994
...and he will make
the face of heaven so fine...

866
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:26,753
...that all the world
will be in love with night...

867
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,677
...and pay no worship to the garish sun.

868
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:33,922
O! I have bought the mansion of a love...

869
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,305
...but not possessed it;

870
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:39,145
...and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed.

871
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,354
So... tedious is this day...

872
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:47,025
...as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child...

873
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:50,197
...that hath new robes and may not wear them.

874
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:53,569
(yelling)

875
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:41,874
Mercutio's soul is but a little way
above our heads...

876
01:08:41,962 --> 01:08:44,038
...staying for thine to keep him company!

877
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:47,132
Thou wretched boy shalt with him hence!

878
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:50,003
(sobbing) Either thou, or l...

879
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:52,503
...or both, must go with him!

880
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:56,723
Either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

881
01:08:56,811 --> 01:08:58,305
Either thou...

882
01:08:58,396 --> 01:09:02,476
...or l, or both, must go with him!

883
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:09,064
(yells)

884
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,705
(thunder)

885
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:05,540
I am fortune's fool!

886
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:16,091
Romeo!

887
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:20,393
Away, be gone! Stand not amazed!

888
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:28,488
Away!

889
01:10:28,573 --> 01:10:30,650
Romeo!

890
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,410
(sirens)

891
01:10:44,131 --> 01:10:46,208
Tybalt! (sobs)

892
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:54,509
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

893
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:00,564
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

894
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,359
Romeo he cries aloud, "Hold, friends!"

895
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:10,491
Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio.

896
01:11:10,993 --> 01:11:13,069
Tybalt here slain...

897
01:11:13,996 --> 01:11:16,072
...Romeo's hand did slay.

898
01:11:16,165 --> 01:11:16,947
Prince!

899
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,036
As thou art true...

900
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:22,963
...for blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

901
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:25,799
Romeo... spoke him fair...

902
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:28,553
...could not take truce
with the unruly spleen of Tybalt...

903
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:30,012
...deaf to peace.

904
01:11:30,096 --> 01:11:32,718
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false!

905
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:36,851
I beg forjustice,
which thou, Prince, must give!

906
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:39,723
Romeo slew Tybalt.

907
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:41,475
Romeo must not live!

908
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:46,524
Romeo slew him. He slew Mercutio.

909
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:49,484
Who now the price of his dear blood
doth owe?

910
01:11:49,575 --> 01:11:51,651
(wailing)

911
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:56,164
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

912
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:59,415
His fault concludes but what the law
should end-the life of Tybalt.

913
01:11:59,502 --> 01:12:02,040
And for that offence
immediately we do exile him.

914
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,161
Noble Prince...

915
01:12:03,256 --> 01:12:05,498
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses!

916
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:08,379
Nor tears nor prayers
shall purchase out abuses!

917
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,094
Therefore use none!

918
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,685
Let Romeo hence in haste!

919
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:22,891
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last!

920
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:26,152
Romeo is banished!

921
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:29,524
Banishment...

922
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:33,278
Be merciful, say death.

923
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:37,910
For exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death.

924
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:40,873
Do not say banishment.

925
01:12:41,379 --> 01:12:46,754
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts,
and thou art wedded to calamity.

926
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:49,251
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

927
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:52,797
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

928
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,133
There is no world without Verona walls.

929
01:12:55,227 --> 01:12:59,640
Hence banished is banish'd from
the world, and world's exile is death.

930
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:01,475
Then banished is death mistermed.

931
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:04,687
Calling death banished, thou cutt'st
my head off with a golden axe...

932
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,855
...and smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me.

933
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:10,032
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

934
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,988
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.

935
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,110
(knocking)

936
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:16,582
Hence!

937
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:21,043
(knocking)

938
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:22,953
(knocking)

939
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:26,622
- I come from my lady Juliet!
- Welcome, then.

940
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,261
Where is my lady's lord?

941
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:30,421
Romeo, come forth.

942
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,466
- Ah, sir.
- Nurse.

943
01:13:34,059 --> 01:13:35,933
Ah, sir.

944
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,096
Death's the end of all.

945
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:41,349
Speakest thou of Juliet?

946
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,940
Where is she and how doth she?

947
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:47,195
And what says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

948
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,698
O she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

949
01:13:50,785 --> 01:13:54,534
And then on Romeo cries,
and then falls down again.

950
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,832
As if that name, shot from
the deadly level of a gun...

951
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:06,342
...did murder her, as that name's
cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

952
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:09,293
I thought thy disposition better tempered.

953
01:14:09,388 --> 01:14:12,306
Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy.

954
01:14:13,017 --> 01:14:16,018
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt.

955
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:18,179
There art thou happy.

956
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:23,642
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.

957
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:25,776
There art thou happy.

958
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:28,568
A pack of blessings light upon thy back.

959
01:14:28,658 --> 01:14:32,323
Wherefore railest thou on thy birth,
the heaven, and earth...

960
01:14:32,412 --> 01:14:36,576
...since birth, and heaven, and earth,
all three do meet in thee at once?

961
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,659
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

962
01:14:40,796 --> 01:14:43,204
How well my comfort is revived by this.

963
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:44,705
Go.

964
01:14:45,759 --> 01:14:48,167
Get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

965
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:51,465
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.

966
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:54,265
Hie you! Make haste!

967
01:14:55,269 --> 01:14:57,807
But look thou...
stay not till the watch be set...

968
01:14:57,897 --> 01:15:00,104
...for then thou canst not pass to Mantua...

969
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:04,059
...where thou wilt live till we can
find a time to blaze your marriage...

970
01:15:04,154 --> 01:15:07,071
...reconcile your friends,
beg pardon of the Prince...

971
01:15:07,157 --> 01:15:10,941
...and call thee back with
twenty hundred thousand times more joy...

972
01:15:11,036 --> 01:15:13,527
...than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

973
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,955
Quick, hence! Be gone by break of day!

974
01:15:20,421 --> 01:15:22,129
Sojourn in Mantua!

975
01:15:22,548 --> 01:15:24,090
Farewell.

976
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:26,084
(thunder)

977
01:15:31,557 --> 01:15:33,182
O God!

978
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:36,103
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

979
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:40,727
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

980
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:46,613
Was ever book containing
such vile matter so fairly bound?

981
01:15:47,115 --> 01:15:51,113
O that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace!

982
01:15:55,499 --> 01:15:57,705
She'll not come down tonight.

983
01:15:59,545 --> 01:16:02,380
These times of woe afford no time to woo.

984
01:16:02,465 --> 01:16:06,048
Look you, she loved
her kinsman Tybalt dearly.

985
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:08,211
And so did I.

986
01:16:08,304 --> 01:16:09,964
Well...

987
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,175
...we were born to die.

988
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:18,596
I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.

989
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,368
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

990
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:35,072
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue
shall smooth thy name...

991
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,950
...when l, thy three-hours' wife,
have mangled it?

992
01:16:39,045 --> 01:16:42,663
But whyfore, villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

993
01:16:43,925 --> 01:16:44,755
(gasps)

994
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:15,284
â™ª I'm kissing you

995
01:17:47,908 --> 01:18:01,457
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you, o-oh

996
01:18:03,174 --> 01:18:16,604
â™ª I'm kissing you

997
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:26,071
I will make a desperate tender
of my child's love.

998
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:29,407
I think she will be ruled in all respects by me.

999
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:33,278
Nay, more! I doubt it not!

1000
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:35,531
But what say you to Thursday?

1001
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:37,701
My lord, I...

1002
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,916
I would that Thursday were tomorrow!

1003
01:18:41,006 --> 01:18:43,757
Thursday let it be, then! Wife!

1004
01:18:43,842 --> 01:18:45,918
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.

1005
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:49,795
Tell her o' Thursday she shall
be married to this noble sir!

1006
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:07,094
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

1007
01:20:08,055 --> 01:20:10,890
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

1008
01:20:11,434 --> 01:20:14,269
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.

1009
01:20:14,353 --> 01:20:19,596
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

1010
01:20:19,692 --> 01:20:23,061
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not be gone.

1011
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:25,522
Well, let me be taken.

1012
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:27,407
Let me be put to death!

1013
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:30,275
I have more care to stay than will to go.

1014
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:33,537
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

1015
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,292
How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.

1016
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:44,838
It is... It is!

1017
01:20:45,469 --> 01:20:47,960
Hie hence, be gone, away!

1018
01:20:48,556 --> 01:20:50,714
O now be gone!
More light and light it grows.

1019
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,677
More light and light...

1020
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,976
...more dark and dark our woes.

1021
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,899
- (door opens)
- Madam!

1022
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,771
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber!

1023
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:07,237
(Gloria) Ho, daughter, are you up?

1024
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:14,743
Then, window...

1025
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,909
...let day in and let life...

1026
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:18,743
...out!

1027
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:20,000
Juliet?

1028
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:23,375
- Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
- I doubt it not.

1029
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:30,968
Trust me, love. All these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses...

1030
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:33,466
...in our times to come.
- Ho, daughter!

1031
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:38,597
Juliet!

1032
01:21:49,703 --> 01:21:51,447
O God!

1033
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:53,827
I have an ill-divining soul!

1034
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:56,407
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low...

1035
01:21:56,502 --> 01:21:58,542
...as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

1036
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:03,121
Adieu!

1037
01:22:03,676 --> 01:22:05,420
O fortune, fortune!

1038
01:22:05,511 --> 01:22:07,385
Be fickle, fortune.

1039
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:11,517
For then I hope thou wilt not
keep him long, but send him back.

1040
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:24,569
Thou hast a careful father, child.

1041
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:27,860
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness...

1042
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:31,155
...hath sorted out a sudden day ofjoy...

1043
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:35,412
...which thou expect'st not,
nor I looked not for.

1044
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,826
Madam, in happy time. What day is that?

1045
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:42,088
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn...

1046
01:22:42,175 --> 01:22:45,342
...the gallant, young,
and noble gentleman, Sir Paris...

1047
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:48,797
...at St Peter's Church,
shall happily make thee there...

1048
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:50,135
...ajoyful bride.

1049
01:22:55,605 --> 01:22:58,606
Now, by St Peter's Church and Peter too...

1050
01:22:58,692 --> 01:23:01,729
...he shall not make me there ajoyful bride!

1051
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:05,277
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.

1052
01:23:05,366 --> 01:23:07,323
How now, wife?

1053
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:09,948
Have you delivered to her our decree?

1054
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:11,413
Ay, sir.

1055
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:13,905
But she will none, she gives you thanks.

1056
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:18,037
I would the fool were married to her grave.

1057
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:22,925
How?

1058
01:23:23,009 --> 01:23:25,085
Will she none?

1059
01:23:25,178 --> 01:23:27,254
Is she not proud?

1060
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:31,090
Doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is...

1061
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:34,553
...that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bride?

1062
01:23:35,063 --> 01:23:38,397
Not proud you have,
but thankful that you have.

1063
01:23:38,484 --> 01:23:41,354
Proud can I never be of what I hate!

1064
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:44,446
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

1065
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:47,948
But fettle your fine joints
'gainst Thursday next!

1066
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:50,075
Hear me with patience but to speak a word!

1067
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:51,111
No!

1068
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:52,237
Fie, fie! Stop it!

1069
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:55,083
Speak not! Reply not! Do not answer me!

1070
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,876
Husband, are you mad?

1071
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:02,714
Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!

1072
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:05,968
God in heaven bless her! You are
to blame, my lord, to rate her so!

1073
01:24:06,054 --> 01:24:08,011
Peace, you mumbling fool!

1074
01:24:08,098 --> 01:24:09,925
I tell thee what.

1075
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:12,306
Get thee to church o' Thursday...

1076
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,802
...or never after look me in the face!

1077
01:24:14,897 --> 01:24:17,684
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.

1078
01:24:17,775 --> 01:24:20,859
An you be not, hang, beg, starve...

1079
01:24:20,945 --> 01:24:22,937
...die in the streets!

1080
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,774
Trust to 't. Bethink you.

1081
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:26,942
I'll not be forsworn!

1082
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:42,966
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!

1083
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:47,173
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

1084
01:24:47,264 --> 01:24:48,889
Or, if you do not...

1085
01:24:48,974 --> 01:24:52,343
...make the bridal bed in that
dim monument where Tybalt lies.

1086
01:24:54,438 --> 01:24:56,265
Talk not to me...

1087
01:24:58,317 --> 01:25:00,393
...for I'll not speak a word.

1088
01:25:01,237 --> 01:25:04,238
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1089
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,120
O God!

1090
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,964
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?

1091
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:26,380
What say'st thou? Hast thou not
a word ofjoy? Some comfort, Nurse!

1092
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:29,340
Faith, here it is.

1093
01:25:30,476 --> 01:25:34,390
I think it best you marry with this Paris.

1094
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:37,891
O he's a lovely gentleman.

1095
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:44,940
I think you are happy in this second match...

1096
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:47,943
...for it excels your first.

1097
01:25:49,037 --> 01:25:51,113
Or, if it did not...

1098
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:53,495
...your first is dead.

1099
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:00,748
Or 'twere as good he were...

1100
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,676
...as living here and you no use to him.

1101
01:26:07,473 --> 01:26:09,679
Speakest thou from thy heart?

1102
01:26:11,018 --> 01:26:14,518
And from my soul too;
else beshrew them both!

1103
01:26:16,566 --> 01:26:18,226
Amen.

1104
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:19,978
What?

1105
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,234
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

1106
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:32,120
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
having displeased my father...

1107
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:36,371
...to Friar Laurence to make
confession and be absolved.

1108
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:45,004
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death.

1109
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:47,883
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous...

1110
01:26:47,974 --> 01:26:50,891
...that she doth give her sorrow
so much sway...

1111
01:26:50,977 --> 01:26:56,351
...and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears.

1112
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:57,816
(door opens)

1113
01:26:59,527 --> 01:27:02,528
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

1114
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,565
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

1115
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:08,446
That "may be" must be, love,
on Thursday next.

1116
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:12,487
- What must be shall be.
- Well, that's a certain text.

1117
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:15,665
Come you to make confession?

1118
01:27:15,753 --> 01:27:20,000
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,
or shall I come to you at evening mass?

1119
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:23,626
My leisure serves thee,
pensive daughter, now.

1120
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:26,720
Good sir, we must entreat the time alone.

1121
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:30,058
God shield I should disturb devotion!

1122
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:38,067
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.

1123
01:27:39,152 --> 01:27:41,192
Till then adieu...

1124
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:43,356
...and keep this holy kiss.

1125
01:27:51,957 --> 01:27:53,997
Tell me not, Father,
that thou hearest of this...

1126
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:57,952
...unless thou tell me how I may prevent it!
- It strains me past the compass of my wits!

1127
01:27:58,047 --> 01:28:00,040
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help...

1128
01:28:00,133 --> 01:28:01,959
...do thou but call my resolution wise.

1129
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:04,803
- And with this, I'll help it presently!
- Hold, daughter!

1130
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:08,221
Be not so long to speak! I long to die!

1131
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:12,062
I do spy a kind of hope...

1132
01:28:12,145 --> 01:28:14,352
...which craves as desperate an execution...

1133
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,728
...as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1134
01:28:16,817 --> 01:28:19,106
lf, rather than to marry with this Paris...

1135
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:21,946
...thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself...

1136
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,863
...then it is likely thou wilt
undertake a thing like death...

1137
01:28:25,951 --> 01:28:28,869
...to chide away this shame.

1138
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:31,781
And, if thou darest...

1139
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,826
...l'll give thee remedy.

1140
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:40,372
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.

1141
01:28:40,466 --> 01:28:43,136
Each part,
deprived of supple government...

1142
01:28:43,219 --> 01:28:46,339
...shall stiff and stark and cold
appear, like death.

1143
01:28:46,723 --> 01:28:51,100
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed...

1144
01:28:51,186 --> 01:28:53,262
...there art thou dead.

1145
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:55,395
Thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault...

1146
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:57,356
...where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

1147
01:28:57,443 --> 01:29:00,147
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1148
01:29:00,237 --> 01:29:02,811
...thou shalt continue
four and twenty hours...

1149
01:29:02,907 --> 01:29:05,528
...and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1150
01:29:05,618 --> 01:29:08,323
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake...

1151
01:29:08,412 --> 01:29:10,950
...shall Romeo by my letters know our drift.

1152
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,035
And hither shall he come that very night
to bear thee both hence to Mantua.

1153
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:19,037
Take thou this vial, being then in bed...

1154
01:29:19,132 --> 01:29:21,753
...and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

1155
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:26,256
I'll send my letters to thy lord
post haste to Mantua.

1156
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:38,688
(knocking)

1157
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:40,153
Hello?

1158
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:05,669
What if this mixture do not work at all?

1159
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:08,884
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?

1160
01:30:11,353 --> 01:30:12,384
(door opens)

1161
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,683
- What, are you busy? Need you my help?
- No, madam.

1162
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:19,274
We have culled such necessaries
as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.

1163
01:30:19,362 --> 01:30:23,146
So please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you.

1164
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:25,447
For I am sure you have your hands full all...

1165
01:30:25,535 --> 01:30:27,243
...in this so sudden business.

1166
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:28,871
Good night.

1167
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:31,031
Get thee to bed and rest...

1168
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:34,283
...for thou hast need.

1169
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:42,170
Farewell.

1170
01:30:45,264 --> 01:30:47,837
God knows when we shall meet again.

1171
01:30:50,477 --> 01:30:51,853
Good night.

1172
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,486
Romeo...

1173
01:31:07,579 --> 01:31:09,737
...I drink to thee.

1174
01:31:27,224 --> 01:31:34,770
â™ª Requiem...

1175
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:44,361
As the custom is, in all her best array,
bear her to church.

1176
01:32:11,437 --> 01:32:13,513
(bell tolls)

1177
01:32:41,677 --> 01:32:44,678
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit...

1178
01:32:44,764 --> 01:32:48,596
...lifts me above the ground
with cheerful thoughts.

1179
01:32:48,685 --> 01:32:51,223
I dreamt my lady came
and found me dead...

1180
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:55,262
...and breathed such life with kisses
in my lips that I revived...

1181
01:32:55,358 --> 01:32:57,434
...and was an emperor.

1182
01:32:58,528 --> 01:33:00,604
Ah me!

1183
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:03,271
How sweet is love itself possessed...

1184
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:06,652
...when but love's shadows
are so rich in joy!

1185
01:33:24,389 --> 01:33:26,049
News from Verona!

1186
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:35,894
How now, Balthasar?

1187
01:33:35,984 --> 01:33:38,938
Dost thou not bring me
letters from the priest?

1188
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:41,602
How doth my lady? Is my father well?

1189
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:46,573
How doth my lady Juliet?
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1190
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,161
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

1191
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:02,085
Her body rests in chapel monument...

1192
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:05,428
...and her immortal part
with the angels lives.

1193
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:08,258
I saw her laid low.

1194
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,890
Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

1195
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,979
Is it e'en so?

1196
01:34:43,763 --> 01:34:46,468
Then I defy you, stars!

1197
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,440
Juliet!

1198
01:35:02,908 --> 01:35:05,067
Juliet!

1199
01:35:38,988 --> 01:35:42,523
- I will hence tonight.
- Have patience!

1200
01:35:46,537 --> 01:35:48,080
Leave me!

1201
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:51,082
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

1202
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:53,041
Tush! Thou art deceived!

1203
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:57,207
Hast thou no letters to me from the priest?

1204
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:10,845
No matter.

1205
01:36:14,859 --> 01:36:16,935
Well, Juliet...

1206
01:36:18,404 --> 01:36:20,693
...I will lie with thee tonight.

1207
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:26,987
I will hence tonight.

1208
01:37:05,203 --> 01:37:08,786
(police radio)
Romeo is within Verona walls.

1209
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:19,342
Fear comes upon me!

1210
01:37:19,843 --> 01:37:21,883
O, much I fear...

1211
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:25,554
...some ill, unthrifty thing!

1212
01:37:28,185 --> 01:37:29,929
The letter was of dear import!

1213
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:33,596
I couldn't send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee.

1214
01:37:34,901 --> 01:37:36,858
The neglecting it may do much damage.

1215
01:37:36,945 --> 01:37:39,400
Bring forth these enemies,
Capulet and Montague!

1216
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:51,583
(knocking)

1217
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:54,212
Let me have a dram of poison...

1218
01:37:54,296 --> 01:37:58,626
...such soon-speeding gear as will
disperse itself through all the veins...

1219
01:37:58,717 --> 01:38:00,840
...that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

1220
01:38:00,928 --> 01:38:05,258
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona law
is death to any he that utters them.

1221
01:38:05,349 --> 01:38:08,469
The world is not thy friend,
nor the world's law!

1222
01:38:08,561 --> 01:38:10,601
Then be not poor, but break it...

1223
01:38:10,688 --> 01:38:12,562
...and take this!

1224
01:38:14,275 --> 01:38:16,945
My poverty but not my will consents.

1225
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:20,607
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

1226
01:38:31,877 --> 01:38:34,202
Drink it off...

1227
01:38:34,296 --> 01:38:38,294
...and if you had the strength of 20 men,
it would dispatch you straight.

1228
01:38:38,384 --> 01:38:40,044
There's my gold.

1229
01:38:40,136 --> 01:38:42,010
(helicopter)

1230
01:38:43,222 --> 01:38:45,298
Worse poison to men's souls...

1231
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:49,092
...than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

1232
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,921
Romeo hath no notice of these accidents.

1233
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,714
I will write again to Mantua.

1234
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,892
Within the hour will the fair Juliet wake.

1235
01:39:26,976 --> 01:39:29,053
She stirs. The lady stirs.

1236
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:41,690
- I do beseech you.
- Live and be prosperous.

1237
01:39:42,701 --> 01:39:44,777
And farewell, good fellow.

1238
01:39:45,454 --> 01:39:46,996
Then I will leave thee.

1239
01:39:58,843 --> 01:39:59,922
(sirens)

1240
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:27,495
Tempt not a desperate man!

1241
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:36,292
Hold! Hold!

1242
01:40:37,384 --> 01:40:38,463
(gunshots)

1243
01:40:38,635 --> 01:40:39,666
Hold!

1244
01:40:46,059 --> 01:40:48,432
(Prince) Once more I say to you, hold!

1245
01:40:55,945 --> 01:40:58,021
(panting)

1246
01:43:54,632 --> 01:43:56,708
My love...

1247
01:43:57,802 --> 01:43:59,878
My wife...

1248
01:44:00,513 --> 01:44:03,384
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

1249
01:44:03,474 --> 01:44:06,262
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

1250
01:44:09,063 --> 01:44:11,140
Thou art not conquered.

1251
01:44:15,403 --> 01:44:20,445
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks...

1252
01:44:21,034 --> 01:44:24,403
...and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

1253
01:44:36,842 --> 01:44:41,090
Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

1254
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:47,557
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous...

1255
01:44:47,645 --> 01:44:50,979
...and keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1256
01:45:29,898 --> 01:45:31,309
Here.

1257
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,603
O, here will I set up my everlasting rest...

1258
01:45:36,488 --> 01:45:42,194
...and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

1259
01:45:50,002 --> 01:45:52,079
Eyes, look your last.

1260
01:45:54,883 --> 01:45:57,089
Arms, take your last embrace.

1261
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,720
And lips...

1262
01:46:07,854 --> 01:46:10,061
O you, the doors to breath...

1263
01:46:13,902 --> 01:46:16,228
...seal with a righteous kiss...

1264
01:46:38,386 --> 01:46:40,463
...a dateless bargain...

1265
01:46:41,014 --> 01:46:43,054
...to engrossing death.

1266
01:46:48,105 --> 01:46:49,516
Romeo...

1267
01:46:50,733 --> 01:46:52,606
(gasping)

1268
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,244
What's here?

1269
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:08,114
Poison...

1270
01:47:09,919 --> 01:47:13,335
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after?

1271
01:47:18,345 --> 01:47:20,421
I'll kiss thy lips.

1272
01:47:20,514 --> 01:47:23,219
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them.

1273
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,306
Thy lips are warm.

1274
01:47:46,207 --> 01:47:47,867
Thus...

1275
01:47:49,085 --> 01:47:51,162
...with a kiss...

1276
01:47:55,217 --> 01:47:57,293
...I die.

1277
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:11,395
(gunshot)

1278
01:50:19,117 --> 01:50:22,321
(â™ª "Tristan and Isolde" by Wagner)

1279
01:52:00,015 --> 01:52:03,300
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1280
01:52:03,393 --> 01:52:07,059
...that heaven finds means
to kill yourjoys with love!

1281
01:52:07,898 --> 01:52:12,560
And l, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1282
01:52:16,615 --> 01:52:18,692
All are punished.

1283
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:29,910
All are punished!

1284
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:37,417
(TV) A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1285
01:52:37,512 --> 01:52:40,597
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1286
01:52:40,682 --> 01:52:44,134
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1287
01:52:44,895 --> 01:52:48,229
Some shall be pardoned,
and some punished.

1288
01:52:48,858 --> 01:52:55,821
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
