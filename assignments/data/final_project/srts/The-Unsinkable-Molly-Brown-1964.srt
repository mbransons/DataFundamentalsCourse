I'm gonna somehow
get me to Denver

00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,577
and I'm gonna find me a man
with means enough

00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,370
to put a real roof
over our heads

a roof that don't leak
rain and cold.

I'll miss you, Molly.

I'll miss you too, pa.

240
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,723
It's time I thanked you
for pullin' me out of the flood

241
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,851
and...and raisin' me
like your own.

242
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,024
I guess, I didn't know much
about raising a girl.

243
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,193
Could be I done it wrong.

Nobody could have done better.

I'll send for you, pa.
I promise that.

247
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,827
And you'll have
a room of your own

248
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,954
where you can stay
in bed all day

249
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,705
with a jug
of the best liquor.

I do that now.

Let me give you a word
of advice, Molly girl.

252
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,883
Learn to serve God
and a hot breakfast

253
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,762
and in your search for that roof
that don't leak rain

254
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,598
beware of men that
offer you a roof

255
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,142
and forget
to mention marriage.

256
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,770
Find yourself a good man.

257
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,982
A good Irish Catholic

258
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,275
and settle down.

259
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,949
The man I marry is got to be
more than just Irish Catholic.

260
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,993
What more can a man be?

261
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, if he's gonna
crawl in next to me

262
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,919
he's gonna have to be
the <i>richest</i> Irish Catholic

970
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,407
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I-I-I just can't seem to stop.

971
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,743
Oh, I don't want you
crying over the money.

972
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,287
- Now, shh, shh, shh.
- I ain't.

973
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,916
It's you being
so forgiving that..

974
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,251
[Molly crying]

975
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,714
Now we'll never
get to Denver!

976
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,716
[Molly crying]

977
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,135
[sighs]

978
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,470
Well, if you're gonna keep up

979
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,305
that weeping and wailing

980
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,308
might as well go out right now
and find me another mine.

981
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,187
Johnny? Come back!

982
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,690
Talk to me,
gold and silver!

983
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:30,276
Holler loud, 'cause I got
a gal that burns money up!

984
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,446
Johnny! Johnny!
Come back!

985
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,407
You gonna stop that crying?

986
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,200
Yes! Yes!

987
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,328
Oh, yes, Johnny! Yes!

988
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,956
Say you love me.

989
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,710
I love you, Johnny.

990
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,837
[laughs]
That's better.

991
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,923
[pickaxe clangs]

992
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,684
Oh, Joh.. Joh..

993
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,735
- Oh-oh!
- Yee-haw!

994
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,195
[screaming]

995
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,613
Ladies and gentlemen

996
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:19,284
we are now entering
Pennsylvania Avenue.

997
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,703
Up and down
this beautiful avenue

998
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,372
are the homes
of the Sacred Thirty-Six.

999
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,125
The Creme de laCreme
of Denver.

1000
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,961
The house on your left..

1001
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,380
...is the home of Mrs. McGraw

1002
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,259
the acknowledged leader
of Denver Society.

1003
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,805
And this is the new showplace
of Pennsylvania Avenue.

1004
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:45,226
'It has just been remodeled
by Mr. and Mrs. J.J. Brown'

1005
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,437
owner of the little Johnny Mine

1006
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,940
the richest gold strike
in the history of Colorado.

1007
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,694
This mine has already
produced $10 million.

1008
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,238
(male #3)
'Fourteen million,
and plenty more'

1009
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,823
'where that come from.'

1010
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,533
Good-bye, folks!

1011
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,702
Have yourself a nice ride.

1012
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,995
And don't believe everything

1013
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,497
that fellow tells you.

1014
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,040
- Pa!
- Goodbye! Goodbye.

1015
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,334
I told you you mustn't do that
every day, now, pa.

1016
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:12,420
- It ain't elegant.
- I got nothing else to do.

1017
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,713
- Funny.
- Leave it lay.

1018
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,507
How many times
do I gotta tell you

1019
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,635
I like a lived-in feeling
in one room of this fancy house.

1020
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,677
Alright, pa.

1021
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,096
And tell Hotchkiss to fetch me

1022
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,388
a fresh jug.

1023
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,307
Ooh. Sure, pa.

1024
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,433
Thank you, darling.

1025
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,729
Hotchkiss!

1026
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,733
- Yes, madam?
- Get my pa another jug.

1027
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,401
Yes, madam.

1028

[whistling]

1029
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,575
What's that?

1030
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,285
Present.

1031
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,371
Ooh! What is it?

1032
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,956
It's a new wedding ring.

1033
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,749
What's wrong with this one?

1034
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,209
That ain't the one
you was married with.

1035
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,129
[Molly chuckles]
I got you another, more fitting.

1036
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:00,093
Now, don't you never,
ever take it off

1037
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,012
unless I tell you to,
Chick-a-Pen.

1038
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,598
Promise me.

1039
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,350
I promise.

1040
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:12,188
Oh! A-A cigar band!

And-and rubies
and sapphires and diamonds!

The-the-the man said there ain't

1044
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:22,282
another like it
in the whole world.

1045
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,577
Oh, it's real
beautiful, Johnny.

1046
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,329
Thank you.

1047
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,582
I'm glad you like it.

1048
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,044
What do you wanna do today?

1049
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,088
I don't know.

1050
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,631
Wanna go out and buy something?

1051
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,551
- We done that yesterday.
- Mm.

1052
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,303
Wanna go for a walk?

1053
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,680
Mm-hmm.

1054
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,391
Yeah. Let's play another game
of blackjack.

1055
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,559
[knock on door]

1056
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,311
- Yeah?
- Excuse me, madam.

1057
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,938
Mr. Cartwright from the bank is
downstairs.

1058
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,648
Well, you tell him
we'll be right there.

1059
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,860
Thank you, madam.

1060
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,153
Johnny, you go down
and talk to him.

1061
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,697
I gotta find my shoes. Oh!

1062
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,824
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

1063

Uh! I'll be right down!

[panting]

1067
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,595
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright!
Nice to see you.

1068
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,388
Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown.

1069
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,515
How's things at the bank,
Mr. Cartwright?

1070
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,643
- Fine.
- Have a seat, Mr. Cartwright.

1071
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,144
Thank you. Nice weather
we've been having.

1072
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,520
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, sit here.

1073
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,688
This one's a good chair.

1074
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,357
Cost a pot of money.

1075
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,609
- Thank you.
- Oh, my.

1076
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,778
Oh, it's a, it's a pleasure
to be seeing

1077
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,530
one of Denver's
Sacred Thirty-Six in our home.

1078
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,740
- Yeah.
- Sit-sit-sit down.

1079
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,158
Oh, uh, it gets kinda

1080
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,785
lonesome around here.

1081
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,620
That's why we thought
it'd be a fine idea for you

1082
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,956
to come here this time, instead
of us running to the bank.

1083
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:55,124
Yes, I understand.
I have the money right here.

1084
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,417
Oh, that's fine.

1085
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,544
Now-now, you just sit a while.

1086
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,588
Oh, no, I must get back
to the bank.

1087
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,507
(Tobin)
'Hotchkiss!'

1088
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,467
Hotchkiss, where's me jug?

1089
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,553
Pa! Say hello to Mr. Cartwright!

1090
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,681
Mr. Cartwright,
say hello to my pa.

1091
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,350
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright.
Nice to see a new face.

1092
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,478
It gets pretty lonesome
around here. Hotchkiss!

1093
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,146
You think with the place
crawling with flunkies

1094
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,274
a thirsty man could
get a jug now and then.

1095
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,318
Well, don't you
want to count it?

1096
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,445
- Oh, guess you've done that.
- Yeah.

1097
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,573
Here.

1098
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,867
Oh, how about some fudge?

1099
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,244
Not right now, thank you.

1100
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,122
Well...oh, you keep that.

1101
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,623
- Yeah.
- Thank you, no.

1102
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,709
I-I-I must get back to the bank.

1103
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,210
- Oh.
- Oh.

1104
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,795
Well, uh, drop in and see us

1105
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,255
again sometime, Mr. Cartwright.

1106
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,424
- Uh, yeah. Bring your friends.
- Yeah.

1107
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,675
Oh, bring Mrs. Cartwright.

1108
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,678
- We're always here.
- Yes.

1109
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,471
Good heavens!

1110
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,141
I've never seen anything
like that before.

1111
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,684
(Mr. Cartwright)
'Eh, it's solid gold!'

1112
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,353
Eh, yeah, that's what it is.

1113
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,898
Uh, I presume
the ''B'' stands for Brown?

1114
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,151
Well, it don't stand
for backhouse.

1115
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,194
[both laughs]

1116
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,865
Oh, uh, Mr. Cartwright,
you come back real soon.

1117
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,451
Well, ha-ha thanks again,
Mr. Cartwright.

1118
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,493
You come see us real soon.

1119
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:13,536
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1120
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,579
Oh, uh

1121
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,748
'what's going on over there?'

1122
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,499
Oh, it must be the caterer
delivering things

1123
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,084
for Mrs. McGraw's party.

1124
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,419
Party? What party?

1125
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:22,754
Mrs. McGraw gives a party
every year

1126
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,130
when her roses bloom. Goodbye.

1127
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,174
- Uh, bye.
- Bye.

1128
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:29,218
Oh, ain't that wonderful?

1129
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,137
What?

1130
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,515
She gives a party
when her roses bloom.

1131
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,976
Oh, my.

1132
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,937
[instrumental music]

1133
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,827
Oh, good evening, father!

1134
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,662
I believe you all know
<i>Monsignor</i> Ryan.

1135
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,415
You've been fortunate
in the weather, Mrs. McGraw.

1136
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,877
- The garden is most attractive.
- Oh, thank you.

1137
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,754
I, uh, I haven't been here

1138
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,756
since the house next
door was remodeled.

1139
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,425
Oh, yes. Dreadful, isn't it?

1140
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,718
But at least the noise

1141
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,345
of the remodeling is over.

1142
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,555
I've seen Mrs. Brown
on the Avenue.

1143
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,724
She's a little...strange.

1144
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,102
- Oh!
- They overpay their servants.

1145
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,104
The entire economy
of Pennsylvania Avenue

1146
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,355
has been affected.

1147
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,065
I'm told they drive up and down

1148
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,025
the avenue while she shouts

1149
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,485
greetings to passers-by.

1150
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:30,822
- Oh, dear.
- Well, perhaps they're lonely.

1151
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:34,283
Have you called on them
to welcome them, Mrs. McGraw?

1152
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,410
Mrs. Fitzgerald?

1153
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,036
Uh, <i>monsignor,</i> have you

1154
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,663
seen the roses?

1155
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,417
Thank you, Jeeves.

1156
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,134
Oh, my!

1157
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:53,010
Ooh! Evening, folks!

1158
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,595
Uh, Molly Brown's the name.

1159
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,222
Uh, this here's Johnny Brown

1160
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,723
owner of the Little Johnny.

1161
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,392
'And richest man
in the United States.'

1162
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,437
- 'Molly.'
- Oh, there you be, neighbor!

1163
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:03,813
(Molly)
'Howdy!'

1164
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,566
Uh, Brown's the name.

1165
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:10,319
Uh, we, we're the ones from
that little shack next door.

1166
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,155
How do you do, Mrs. Brown?

1167
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:13,239
Great!

1168
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,824
Uh, to tell you the truth

1169
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,076
the Denver water is a little
hard on the kidneys.

1170
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,870
But we love it here.

1171
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,330
Oh, uh, Mr. Brown!

1172
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,458
- Hmm?
- 'Say hello to Mrs. McGraw.'

1173
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,876
Sure. Howdy.

1174
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,587
Uh, oh, we-we was out
for a walk and, and saw

1175
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:31,174
your lights was on,
so we just thought we'd drop in.

1176
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,885
Uh, may I present
<i>monsignor</i> Ryan?

1177
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,095
Well, hello there, <i>monsignor.</i>

1178
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,638
Glad to make your acquaintance.

1179
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,056
- Yeah. Mr. Brown.
- Howdy.

1180
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,892
Oh, uh, I read
about your school fund

1181
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,268
in the paper, father.

1182
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,854
Here's $5,000, and good luck.

1183
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,356
[indistinct chattering]

1184
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:51,569
Well, I hardly know what to say.

1185
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,572
- God bless you, Mrs. Brown.
- Oh.

1186
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,616
Well, what you standing
there for, Mr. Brown?

1187
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,451
Match my 5,000.

1188
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,369
Or be high-class and double it.

1189
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,247
(Johnny)
'Why, sure. Glad to.
Here, father.'

1190
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,833
One, two, three..

1191
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,044
Already took a few million
out of God's good earth.

1192
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:10,046
Guess he deserves
a little kickback.

1193
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,632
That should see them
into heaven.

1194
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,133
Well, maybe it'll grease
the gates a little.

1195
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,178
...nine, ten. Ten thousand.

1196
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,680
I'm sorry it's all in ones.

1197
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:23,184
God bless you both.

1198
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:26,270
- Fifteen thousand dollars.
- Uh, think nothing of it.

1199
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,107
Once took 20 times that
just to warm J.J.'s backside.

1200
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,613
Besides, this here's
our home now

1201
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:38,241
and-and-and we want to belong.

1202
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,451
Got to keep up with Mrs. McGraw.

1203
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:41,911
How much did you kick..

1204
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,123
Uh...how much did you
kick in, Gladys?

1205
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,920
Oh, well, as a matter
of fact, I..

1206
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:54,382
...I haven't made
my contribution yet.

1207
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,008
- You haven't?
- No.

1208
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,635
What's the matter
with you, Gladys?

1209
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,012
You got plenty, I hear!

1210
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:04,183
- Now, Roberts!
- Dinner is served, madam.

1211
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,936
Thank you. Well, shall we?

Oh. Hi.

Well..

[sighs]

1218
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,870
Uh, Mrs. McGraw regrets
that there isn't room

1219
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,581
at the table for two more.

(Roberts)
'Uh, she hopes
you will excuse her.'

1221
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,627
Oh, well, we just popped in.

1222
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,005
Uh, tell her
it was great meeting her

1223
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:36,924
and-and not to give
the Browns a second thought.

1224
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,968
Yes, madam.

1225
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,513
I'm sorry you aren't staying
but I assume

1226
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,307
you had other plans.

1227
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,226
Oh, yes. We're pretty busy.

1228
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,563
You-you go on inside
before your supper gets cold.

1229
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,190
Goodnight.
May God go with you.

1230
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,485
- Goodnight.
- See you in church.

1231
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,155
Yes.

1232
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:04,327
- Come on.
- Oh, wait. Oh, wait.

1233
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:06,996
Oh, I just gotta see
how they do.

1234
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:08,331
Uh, come on.

Ain't that pretty?

1238
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,679
Well, uh, there's, there's
plenty of room at that table.

1239
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,810
[chuckles]
It sure smells good, Gladys.

All them beautiful people.

as trimmed, too.

Oh, the good lord outdid itself
on Pennsylvania Avenue

when we're right smack
in the middle of it.

01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,561
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you have a good time?

1252
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,314
Mm. We had more fun back
in Leadville by accident

1253
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,607
than they're having
there on purpose.

They're a bunch of cold fish.

Oh, no, that's dignity,

And we're gonna get us some.

1258

They could have made room
for us.

of room at that table.

a dreary party, wasn't it?

- Was you there?
- No, but I was watching.

How come you ain't
at the party, Buttercup?

Ain't never invited
to Gladys' parties.

of Denver Society, you know.

Well, now, that ain't a nice way

to get up the nerve to come.

What are you going
to do about it?

1294

About what?

1295
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,368
About Gladys and the way

1296
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,954

the brush-off tonight.

what gave you the axe.

or Paris.

1350

in its second generation.

You're unschooled,
and you're full

01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,744
of unharnessed enthusiasm
and Denver isn't

sophisticated enough
to appreciate that.

1359

Ah, we should have stayed
in the hills where we belong.

'A nice long tour of Europe.'

Like what?

1368
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:03,227
Learn something
about art and music.

1369
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:06,063
Learn manners.
Get a smatterin' of languages.

1370

All that just to show
Mrs. McGraw?

1371
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,193
Go ahead, father.

1372
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,028
I'm learnin' already.

1373

I've said enough.
I think you understand.

Thanks for the advice, father.

You're right.
We sure are ignorant.

1377
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,711
But we're gonna get schooled and
harnessed

1378

and, and-and be second
