1
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:14,700
Mr Bond. Mr Bond, I'm so glad
I caught you. Your office called.

2
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,370
They're sending a helicopter
to pick you up. Some sort of emergency.

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,664
It usually is. Thank you.

4
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,500
Good afternoon, Mr Bond.

5
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,505
Don't concern yourself with the pilot.
One of my less useful people.

6
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,681
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.

7
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,088
Think twice, 007. It's a long way down.

8
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,669
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr Bond.

9
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,215
I intend to enjoy it to the full.

10
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,214
Really, have you no respect for the dead?

11
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,176
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

12
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,388
I trust you had a pleasant... fright?

13
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:29,663
You're fading from my picture, Mr Bond,
but the end cannot be far away.

14
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,200
Mr Bond! Mr Bond!

15
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,164
We can do a deal.

16
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:16,793
I'll buy you a delicatessen.
In stainless steel.

17
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,423
- Please!
- All right. Keep your hair on.

18
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,635
Put me down. Put me down!

19
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,137
Oh, you want to get off?

20
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,808
Mr Bond!

23
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:11,181
"For your eyes only I never need to hide"

24
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:19,523
"You can see so much in me,
so much in me that's new"

25

26
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,036

00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,789

"For your eyes only,
the nights are never cold"

36

"You really know me,
that's all I need to know"

37
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:33,514
"Maybe I'm an open book
because I know you're mine"

38
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:42,523

to read between the lines"

39

"For your eyes only"

48
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,252
- Afternoon. How's it looking topside?
- Beautiful day. Just bringing the nets in.

49
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,630
Fish for supper again.

50
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,894
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.

51
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:47,064
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,443
- Afternoon, sir.
- Hello, Mac.

53
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,030
My watch.

54
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,785
Where the hell did that come from?

55
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,209
- What's going on?
- Unidentified object closing fast.

56
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,142
Secure Operations Room!

57
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,104
Destruct ATAC system.

58
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,897
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral.

59
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,399
Send them in.

60
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:03,700
Shocking news. We've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St Georges.

61
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,954
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday.

62
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,541
Then nothing. We sighted
floating debris this morning.

63
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,668
My God, Jack.

64
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:17,256
- How deep is the water there?
- Not deep enough, I'm afraid.

65
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,011
Yes, Comrade Secretary, off Albania.

66
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,766
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.

67
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,647
It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining the ATAC transmitter.

68
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,652
Of course, Comrade.
There will be no direct involvement.

69
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:46,577
But if it comes on the market we should
not lose such a remarkable opportunity.

70
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,916
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece. Da.

71
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,843
- Down you go. Go on.
- Down you go.

72
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:57,105
- Give us a kiss. Give us a kiss.
- I'll give you a nut. Here you are.

73
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,112
Come on.

74
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,241
- Your packages, seĂ±orita.
- Oh, thank you.

75
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,580
Melina!

76
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,518
- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.

77
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,979
Welcome home, Melina.
You look beautiful.

78
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,774
- Thank you.
- Your call from Athens was a surprise.

79
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:44,361
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.

80
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:49,199
Yes. I wanted to come back here and start
work on the temple. You between jobs?

81
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,578
Only for a few days.
I'll lend a hand, if you want.

82
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,664
Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.

83
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,667
That's for you. And pistachios for Max.

84
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,126
- James.
- Moneypenny, a feast for my eyes.

85
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,798
- What about the rest of you?
- Well, I was going to get around to that.

86
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,384
Well, you'd better go in. M's on leave.

87
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,763
The minister's here with the chief of staff
and wants to see you immediately.

88
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,100
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.

89
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,979
Haven't you forgotten something?

90
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,147
As M's away.

91
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,239
- Ah, there you are, 007.
- Hm.

92
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,241
Minister. Chief of Staff.

93
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,035
Are you aware of our ATAC system, 007?

94
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,747
ATAC, sir. Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.

95
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,128
Uses an ultra-low frequency transmitter to
order our submarines to launch missiles.

96
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:11,133
Five days ago, our spy ship St Georges
was sunk in the lonian Sea.

97
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:15,721
She was equipped with ATAC. If that
transmitter fell into the wrong hands,

98
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,683
it would render
our entire Polaris fleet useless.

99
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,644
- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.

100
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:27,774
Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.

101
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,402
Have we begun a salvage operation?

102
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,863
An official operation was impossible.

103
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,657
The St Georges
was off the Albanian coast.

104
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:39,703
We asked Sir Timothy Havelock,
the archaeologist, to locate the wreck.

105
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:45,626
Before he could report, he and his wife
were killed by a hit man, Hector Gonzales.

106
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,379
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales from a description

107
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,383
given to them by Melina,
Sir Havelock's daughter.

108
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,553
Operation Undertow -
the information's all here.

109
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,389
Now, Gonzales is at a villa near Madrid.

110
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:04,561
Isolate him and apply the necessary
pressure to find out who hired him.

111
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,256
A Walther PPK.

112
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,509
Standard issue, British Secret Service.

113
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,178
Licensed to kill...

114
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,557
or be killed.

115
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,851
Take him away.

116
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,006
Excuse me.

117
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,527
Vamos, rápido,
que no se puede escapar. Corred.

118
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,748
Lo tenemos ahora, cógelo.

119
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,717
...por aquí.

120
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,178
You've outstayed your welcome.
Come on.

121
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,939
Ése no se puede escapar.

122
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,526
No importa. Sigue, sigue, sigue.

123
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,985
Que se nos escapa.

124
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:40,212
- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.

125
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,024
Hurry.

126
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,664
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.

127
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,250
The Havelocks?

128
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,878
I'm sorry.

129
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,636
- How did you know where Gonzales was?
- Through a detective agency.

130
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,723
What were you doing there?

131
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,267
I'm afraid we're being out-horsepowered.

132
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,201
Excuse me.

133
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,715
Take the low road.

134
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,094
Not that low.

135
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,402
You don't mind if I drive, do you?

136
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,586
Por favor, empujen.

137
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:46,815
- Go backwards forwards quickly.
- Hm?

138
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,588
Love a drive in the country, don't you?

139
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,888
Hold tight.

140
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,375
We haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.

141
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,795
My name is Bond... James Bond.

142
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,717
Muchas gracias.

143
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,221
Olympic has a flight at 11.

144
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,561
It should be safe to go to the airport now.

145
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,110
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

146
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,154
Really.

147
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:01,408
- Going back to your father's ship?
- Yes, I'm continuing his work.

148
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,661
- But this business is unfinished.
- What business?

149
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,915
The man who paid Gonzales.

150
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,584
The Chinese have a saying.

151
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:15,547
"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves."

152
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:22,179
I don't expect you to understand.
You're English, but I'm half-Greek.

153
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:28,602
And Greek women, like Elektra,
always avenge their loved ones.

154
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,021
I must go.

155
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,657
You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.

156
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,200
I quite agree.

157
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:47,454
We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead.

158
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,249
She'll have our guts for garters.

159
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:54,294
If you care to look again
at page 2 paragraph 4 of my report, sir,

160
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,589
you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.

161
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:02,344
Assuming that that was for Havelock's
murder, there is still a glimmer of hope.

162
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,515
- I don't follow.
- If we could identify that someone...

163
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,560
- Why don't you try the Identigraph?
- Hm.

164
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,272
- Yes, sir.
- Well, get cracking, 007.

165
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,023
Hm.

166
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,608
Minister.

167
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,364
Hello, Q.

168
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:27,202
- Smithers, how's the arm?
- Coming along very nicely, thank you, sir.

169
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,289
That'll come in handy.

170
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,375
- What are you doing here, 007?
- Identigraph, Q.

171
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,544
This way.

172
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:50,350
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.

173
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,145
I see you got the Lotus
back together again.

174
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,274
I disregard these gibes
about our equipment, 007.

175
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:02,070
- I bet you don't find it funny in the field.
- Indeed, I don't.

176
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:12,039
This 3-D visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.

177
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,917
Now, once we get
a composite of the man,

178
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,796
we can find a match by patching into the
photographic files of the Sűreté, Interpol,

179
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,341
CIA, the Mossad...

180
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:28,180
And the West German Police. Yes,
you've told me so already, Q, five times.

181
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,349
Thank you, 007.

182
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,894
Right.

183
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:38,148
Describe the person you wish to identify
and I'll program the information.

184
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:42,194
Male Caucasian. Late 30s.

185
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,990
Hair - fine, light brown.

186
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,703
That's it. Parted in the middle.

187
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,956
Wait a minute.

188
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,082
Right.

189
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,752
- Eyes - a little smaller.
- Uh-huh.

190
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:02,631
Blue. A little greyer.

191
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,676
That's it, you have it. Now, nose.

192
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,265
- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- Sorry.

193
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,852
Stop. Lips fuller.

194
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,396
Uh-huh. Whoops.

195
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,108
- No, no, no. Mouth wider.
- Uh-huh.

196
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,277
Good.

197
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,657
Thank you.

198
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,827
Thank you, Sharon.
You can go. I'll lock up.

199
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,996
OK.

200
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,792
I reckon we're almost there, Q.
Apart from glasses.

201
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,587
- Steel-rimmed.
- Yeah.

202
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,298
- Octagonal.
- Octagonal.

203
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,678
That's him. That's our man.

204
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,056
Right. I'll try and get a match.

205
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,239
Yes?

206
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,159
Ah, sir, the man we want
is Emile Leopold Locque.

207
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,745
An enforcer in the Brussels underworld.

208
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:18,499
He's been convicted
of several particularly brutal murders.

209
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:23,045
He escaped from Namur prison
by strangling his psychiatrist.

210
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:26,715
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.

211
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,259
Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.

212
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:33,680
The Italian Secret Service think
that he is at this moment in Cortina.

213
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:38,018
I'll instruct Ferrara, our man in
Northern Italy, to contact you there.

214
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,355
And, 007, try not to muck it up again.

215
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,107
I'll do my best, sir.

216
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,777
I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?

217
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,906
- Grazie.
- Prego, signore.

218
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,920
The snow this year is better at Innsbruck.

219
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,589
But not at St Moritz.

220
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:34,593
- Ferrara.
- Bond, James.

221
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,136
Luigi.

222
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,139
I presume London's briefed you?

223
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:42,643
If Locque's in Cortina, we'll find him.

224
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:46,563
I have a reliable Greek contact here.
An Anglophile.

225
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,525
He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.

226
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:53,153
- Then what's he doing in Cortina?
- He...

227
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:00,619
...spends a few months a year
here at his chalet.

228
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:04,623
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.

229
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:08,669
Knows everything going on. Very reliable.

230
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,548
The British gave him a medal
for resistance fighting during the war.

231
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:15,884
- Yes, but can I meet him?
- I've set it up.

232
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:18,720
He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.

233
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,186
Good! Extend your arms.

234
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,407
- Signor Kristatos?
- Ah.

235
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,078
- Kristatos. Aris Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.

236
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:48,542
- Would you join me in some gluhwein?
- That's a very good idea. Thank you.

237
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:52,421
Well, gentlemen, how can I help you?

238
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,090
We'd like some information.

239
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:06,059
My protégée.
A sure winner in the next Olympics.

240
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:10,898
She's completely absorbed in her skating,
but innocent in the ways of the world.

241
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:16,320
The day she wins the gold medal
will be the greatest in my life.

242
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,287
Bibi!

243
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:30,125
Here are some new admirers for you.
Mr Bond, Mr Ferrara - Bibi Dahl.

244
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:34,296
And her coach, Jacoba Brink.
Once a world-class skater herself.

245
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:39,134
I've seen Miss Brink skate. The world will
soon see much of your skating, Miss Dahl.

246
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,095
Only if she works harder - much harder.

247
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:47,601
- Uncle Ari, can't I stop now? I'm pooped.
- That's for Miss Brink to decide.

248
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,604
Come, Bibi. Another half-hour of practice.

249
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:55,984
- Will you take me to the biathlon?
- You know I have to work this afternoon.

250
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,324
Bibi wants to know if you
would escort her, Mr Bond.

251
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,911
- I don't think...
- I would feel better if you were with her.

252
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:11,708
Well, I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonte.

253
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,460
Great!

254
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,548
Now, how can I help you?

255
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:22,094
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque. Columbo's right hand.

256
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:27,349
Milos Columbo. His name came up
in connection with a smuggling operation.

257
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:32,479
That's the least of his offences.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.

258
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:37,818
In the Greek underworld, he is
known as "The Dove". A very sick joke.

259
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,904
- Where is this "Dove"?
- In Greece, I would guess.

260
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,991
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.

261
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:49,121
We fought together in the Greek
Resistance and against the Communists.

262
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:52,791
After that, he took a different path.

263
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,671
Well, thank you
for your time, Mr Kristatos.

264
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:04,011
My pleasure. I leave for Corfu soon. If I get
any more information, I will call Ferrara.

265
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:19,109
What do you think? Does this "Dove",
have the resources to mount a salvage?

266
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:23,989
Definitely. He runs a fleet
of intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.

267
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:27,242
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.

268
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:41,215
- Luigi, I'll see you later.
- OK.

269
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,066
- Is this the one you mean, signora?
- I'll take it.

270
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:02,110
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristallo, please.

271
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,580
Oh! Beg your pardon.

272
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,167
Buongiorno. May I help you?

273
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,753
Yes. Give me a dozen lilies, will you?

274
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,179
I'll pick them up later.

275
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,105
Come on, quickly.

276
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,499
Send them to the funeral, will you?

277
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:05,257
Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what you're doing in Cortina?

278
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,719
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?

279
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:12,097
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.

280
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,726
I didn't send a telegram. Now, get in.

281
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,646
The station, please.

282
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,358
- Are we leaving?
- Not "we", you. And now.

283
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,861
You don't tell me what to do.

284
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,697
- La stazione, per favore.
- Si, signore.

285
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,923
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?

286
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,966
I'm working on it.

287
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,471
He's here, isn't he?
That's why you're here.

288
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,724
- Driver, stop. Go back.
- Vai avanti.

289
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,852
- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?

290
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,980
You do that and we'll never find out
who is behind this.

291
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:05,859
It was my parents they killed, not yours.
Let me out. Driver, stop.

292
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,736
Vai avanti.

293
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,780
Presto.

294
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:14,159
Melina, look at me. You were lucky once
but they are on to you now.

295
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,412
The telegram,
the motorcycles, they prove it.

296
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:21,333
- Please, let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?

297
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,504
All I can say is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.

298
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,507
More important than my parents?

299
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:35,305
Your father was part of it. He thought it
important enough to risk his life.

300
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:39,226
Now, Melina, please trust me.
Go back to the Triana and wait.

301
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,980
Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.

302
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:47,985
OK. I'll go back and wait. But not for long.

303
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,654
It won't be, I swear.

304
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:56,243
Amore, amore.

305
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,955
Don't they have showers at the ice rink?

306
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:43,999
How did you get in here?

307
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:47,961
One of the porters is a fan.
He'll do anything for me.

308
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:51,215
And I'll do anything for you.

309
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,136
I'm exceedingly flattered, Bibi,
but you're in training.

310
00:43:56,261 --> 00:44:00,098
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.

311
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:05,270
You can start building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes.

312
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:10,901
Don't you like me?

313
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:17,032
Why, I think you're wonderful, Bibi, but I
don't think your Uncle Ari would approve.

314
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:20,244
Him? He thinks I'm still a virgin.

315
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:27,334
Yes, well, you get your clothes on
and I'll buy you an ice cream.

316
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,719
Ah. Shall we?

317
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,352
Don't you ever come up for air?

318
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,897
That's why I'll get the gold medal.
Breath control.

319
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:52,067
Yes, well, you can't lose.

320
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,160
The leading skiers are now at
the firing range: Wolf Ghul from Austria,

321
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:05,914
Kerel Behrta from Switzerland,
Wolfgang Blatt from Holland...

322
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:25,434
And now Eric Kriegler,
last year's East European champion.

323
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:30,856
He's passing people and coming up on
the West German champion, Hans Wolf.

324
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:37,529
- There's Eric Kriegler.
- The East German champion?

325
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,951
- Isn't he beautiful?
- You know something, Bibi? You're fickle.

326
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:46,288
Hey, Eric!

327
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,126
Come on, let's go watch him shoot.

328
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:18,570
Eric!

329
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:22,533
Eric, we'll have a drink at the finish.

330
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,122
- Well, Bibi, I'm afraid I have to leave you.
- No, James, stay with me.

331
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:31,625
I have an appointment.

332
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,045
Will you come and say goodbye
at the practice rink later?

333
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,631
Please, we're going back to Greece soon.

334
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,969
All right, but if I can't make it,
all I can say is don't grow up any more.

335
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:46,431
- Huh?
- The opposite sex would never survive it.

336
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,758
Libero.

337
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,972
Libero.

338
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,704
Libero.

339
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:32,676
- Ehi tu, dov'č il casco?
- Guarda.

340
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,934
Guardia, c'č un pazzo qua.

341
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:56,398
It won't take long.
Don't play with the switches.

342
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,358
Right.

343
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:12,956
James!

344
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,336
- James, what took you so long?
- Well, I took the scenic route.

345
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:21,632
Tell me more about
your boyfriend, Eric Kriegler.

346
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:27,137
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.

347
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,641
- James, you're jealous.
- Of course.

348
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:34,686
What else can you tell me about
my rival for your affections?

349
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,564
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.

350
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:40,901
Bibi! It is time for your rubdown.

351
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,913
I could eat you up alive.

352
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:59,336
Farewell, Mr Bond, but not goodbye.

353
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:45,442
I'll be finished around six, Mikes.
Meet me here.

354
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:48,612
James, how did you know I was here?

355
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:51,990
I radiotelephoned the Triana.
They said you were coming ashore.

356
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:56,286
I have to go shopping for the crew. Why
don't you come with me and we can talk?

357
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,048
Yassou.

358
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,729
Parakalo.

359
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,154
I think you may need that.

360
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,599
My father loved the view from here.

361
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:02,811
- I can see why.
- We came here often.

362
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,980
- Is Corfu your home?
- No.

363
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,524
My real home's always been the Triana.

364
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:12,863
The Greek islands, Turkey, North Africa,
wherever my father's work took us.

365
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:17,951
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.

366
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:20,954
No, I don't think so.

367
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:24,541
To tell the truth,

368
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:29,004
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since...

369
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,173
Try not to think about it now.

370
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:35,761
I'm meeting a man tonight at the casino
who may give us a lead.

371
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,977
Cinq cent mille banque, monsieur.
Qui fait banco?

372
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:49,191
Banco. Carte, s'il vous plaît.

373
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,536
- Huit.
- Huit.

374
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:04,915
Et neuf la banque.

375
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,002
You're perspiring, Bunky.

376
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,340
Good evening, Contessa.

377
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:17,636
Un million banque, monsieur.
Qui fait banco?

378
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,515
Your Lordship?

379
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,227
Five hundred thousand.

380
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,605
Only half? Where's your courage, Bunky?

381
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:33,610
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.

382
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:37,072
- Un million.
- Bravo, Bunky.

383
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:43,453
Banco suivi.
Carte, s'il vous plaît.

384
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,415
A lucky night.

385
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,462
Carte.

386
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,143
The odds favour standing pat.

387
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,312
If you play the odds.

388
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:13,317
Neuf la banque.

389
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,652
- La main passe.
- La main passe.

390
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:18,989
Would you cash
these in for me, please?

391
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:23,118
Thank you. Excuse me.

392
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,640
- Aperitif, please?
- Ouzo for me, please.

393
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,309
Ouzo.

394
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,937
And a whiskey.

395
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,397
And to eat?

396
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:57,444
I'll have the Préveza prawns,
Savara salad, and bourdetto.

397
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:59,571
Excellent choice. I'll have the same.

398
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:03,450
May I suggest a white Robola wine
from Cephalonia, my home place?

399
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:07,371
If you'll forgive me, I find that
a little too scented for my palate.

400
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,624
- I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.
- Theotaki.

401
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:14,753
After our last meeting,

402
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:19,883
I am asking myself why you want
to know about Locque, Columbo's man.

403
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:24,972
Now, I know Columbo runs heroin to be
refined here before it is sent to England.

404
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:30,936
So I think I see the answer.
You are from the British Narcotics Board.

405
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,982
- Am I right?
- Go on.

406
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:37,067
Hm.

407
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:39,820
I wish you luck, my friend.

408
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:43,031
But I must warn you.
Stopping Columbo will be difficult.

409
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:46,618
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

410
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,121
You must find a different way.

411
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:55,377
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

412
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:01,884
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there, with the woman in blue.

413
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:08,891
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.

414
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:13,103
He is a secret partner in the casino here,
but we are perfectly safe.

415
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,190
He will do nothing in his own place.

416
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:18,567
And the Countess?

417
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:23,197
Lisl? An Austrian. Expensive mistress.

418
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,993
She sometimes shills for the house.
If she bets, it's with other people's money.

419
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:52,976
But I must warn you.
Stopping Columbo will be difficult.

420
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,563
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

421
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,316
You must find a different way.

422
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:05,531
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

423
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:09,952
Just tell me where he is.

424
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:26,468
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?

425
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:29,221
I will speak to you any way I please.

426
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:33,350
Sit down. You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

427
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,728
Get out!

428
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:39,982
Nothing would please me more.

429
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,450
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.

430
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:54,746
- If you play the odds.
- As you wish. Take my car.

431
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:59,626
I'll play a little chemmy.
Ask the chauffeur to come back for me.

432
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:10,929
Allow me.

433
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:13,056
May I drive you home?

434
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,809
No, thank you. I'll take a taxi.

435
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:20,898
No courage? Seriously, you may
have a job finding one this time of night.

436
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:24,943
Well, you look like a gentleman.

437
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:27,112
Why not?

438
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,414
I'm the Countess Lisl von Schlaf.

439
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:39,374
My name is Bond.

440
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,837
I'm a writer. I'm preparing a novel about
Greek smugglers. Do you know any?

441
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:47,257
Smugglers?
How would I know any smugglers?

442
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:53,680
I would have thought that a lady in your
position would get to know many things.

443
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:57,059
- I'd really be most grateful.
- How grateful?

444
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:58,435
Very.

445
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:02,439
I adore grateful men.

446
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:34,638
May I call you tomorrow, Countess?

447
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:38,183
I'm a night person.
I've champagne and oysters in the fridge.

448
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,519
Why not come in for a bite?

449
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:46,984
I won't need you any more tonight.

450
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:16,346
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

451
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,228
Whoops!

452
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:26,148
Me nightie's slipping.

453
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:28,692
So's your accent, Countess.

454
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,571
- Manchester?
- Close.

455
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:35,115
Liverpool.

456
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,329
It was a very amusing performance
between you and the owner of this.

457
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,040
What exactly did
Columbo whisper to you?

458
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,752
That you were a spy.
To find out more about you.

459
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:50,839
And have you?

460
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:53,634
Have I ever.

461
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:22,663
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.

462
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:28,210
Well, that sounds like a dismissal.
I was rather looking forward to breakfast.

463
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,270
Oh, James!

464
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:10,794
Lisl! Lisl, come back!

465
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:45,329
Get in. Ugh!

466
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:00,135
Goodbye, Countess.

467
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:07,142
What...

468
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:52,938
- Now, what should I do with you?
- You can't just arrest him.

469
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:55,232
You must find a different way.

470
01:11:55,315 --> 01:12:00,112
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

471
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,990
Just tell me where he is.

472
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:07,744
I am here, Mr Bond
of the British Secret Service.

473
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:12,499
But I'll tell you,
it is Kristatos you want, not me.

474
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:19,006
He told you about himself. He's the one
with the powerful connections.

475
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,550
Locque works for him, not for me.

476
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:27,598
I smuggle, yes. I smuggle gold,
diamonds, cigarettes, pistachio nuts.

477
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,975
But no heroin.

478
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,060
Sit down.

479
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:36,690
That I leave to him, when he is
not too busy working for Russia.

480
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:40,903
- Against my country and yours.
- My country awarded him a King's Medal.

481
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:44,573
Yes, I know, but other people died for it.

482
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:49,119
All through the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.

483
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:53,165
King's Medal!

484
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:58,545
I would laugh if my heart
was not so heavy about my poor Lisl.

485
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:04,301
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?

486
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:09,515
I know too much about him.
He wants me out of the way.

487
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:15,437
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him,

488
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,607
your government might
give him another medal.

489
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:22,653
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.

490
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:27,533
We'll go together
to his warehouse in Albania.

491
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:29,618
OK?

492
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:33,455
If I don't report in by tomorrow morning,
not only will my people

493
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:37,626
but the entire Greek police
be down on you like a load of bricks.

494
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:43,131
Don't worry.
By tomorrow we'll be good friends.

495
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:47,469
Let us drink to that.

496
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,930
I'll wait till tomorrow.

497
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,902
You may need this.

498
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,156
I am a good judge of men.

499
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:12,286
Mr Bond, you have
what the Greeks call thrassos.

500
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,912
Guts.

501
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,667
So have you, Mr Columbo.

502
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,010
Cheers.

503
01:14:28,093 --> 01:14:30,053
Yassou.

504
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,885
Locque!

505
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,457
Phew!

506
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,782
Santos, sproxto.

507
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:19,913
Argh!

508
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:30,048
Watch it.

509
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:38,682
Santos. Nikos.

510
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:51,278
JIM diving equipment, for salvage work
at depths of more than 300 feet.

511
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,336
Raw opium.

512
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:10,380
An old smugglers' trick.
Kristatos knows them all.

513
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:55,968
Get your men out of here. Now!

514
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:03,267
Argh!

515
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:34,399
Argh!

516
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:03,554
You left this with Ferrara, I believe.

517
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:24,074
He had no head for heights.

518
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:58,085
- Where did the St Georges sink?
- We can't be sure for certain.

519
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:03,131
We know it was in this vicinity. Your father
was using the temple as a front.

520
01:22:03,257 --> 01:22:08,679
Kristatos killed your father because
he didn't want him to find the St Georges.

521
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:11,223
Kristatos!

522
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:13,392
How can I help?

523
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:16,603
Where did your father
keep his records, his daily log?

524
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:18,730
Daily log. Daily log.

525
01:22:18,856 --> 01:22:23,652
Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.

526
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,657
Give us a kiss.

527
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,784
- What's his name?
- Max.

528
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:34,037
- Max.
- Thank you.

529
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,583
Hello.

530
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:44,131
- It's all shorthand.
- He used a special kind.

531
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,593
I was the only one who could decipher it.

532
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,557
He made several surveys in Neptune.

533
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,686
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.

534
01:22:57,769 --> 01:23:01,356
According to this,
he saw a diving bell here.

535
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,609
Diving bell?

536
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:06,904
Oil exploration, Kristatos.

537
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:13,785
Three days later, he sighted
a wreck in the same area.

538
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:15,662
And?

539
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:18,957
That was his last entry.
The day he was killed.

540
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:23,045
Ah. Well, air would be
useless at this depth.

541
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:26,215
We'd need a special mixture
of oxygen and helium.

542
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:29,718
I have all the necessary
equipment aboard.

543
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:32,638
The less people that know
about this, the better.

544
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:36,433
I'll give the crew shore leave,
apart from the mate and two others.

545
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:37,559
Let's go.

546
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:10,569
584 feet. An oxygen-helium mix at
that depth will gives us eight minutes.

547
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,821
We're going to have to work fast.

548
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:16,283
Wouldn't the St Georges crew
have destroyed the transmitter?

549
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:20,037
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.

550
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,363
We have a visitor below.

551
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:06,291
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.

552
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:59,595
I hope he was dining alone.

553
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:26,955
- You'd better go back to the sub.
- No, no. I'm staying.

554
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:41,512
That should be
the command cabin.

555
01:28:02,574 --> 01:28:04,618
Eureka.

556
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:17,172
"Main destruct timer under lever
right of ATAC housing

557
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:22,970
dualled by ring-mained circuit
through antihandling charger."

558
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:28,350
The destruct timer's set at one minute.
For some reason, the lever wasn't pulled.

559
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:38,026
The transmitter with a Thermite charge.

560
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:57,004
Hold these.

561
01:28:57,087 --> 01:29:02,551
"To bypass trembler switch,
cut wires in following procedure."

562
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:05,471
Cutters.

563
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,825
Screwdriver.

564
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:46,345
That's it. Let's get out of here.

565
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,264
James!

566
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:53,662
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.

567
01:30:58,709 --> 01:31:02,212
Get back to the sub fast. I'll stall him.

568
01:33:43,832 --> 01:33:45,375
James!

569
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:26,250
- Try and close the CO2.
- I'm trying.

570
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:59,343
Careful, James. It's 5000 years old.

571
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:42,136
Thank you, Mr Bond. You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.

572
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:44,680
Apostis, take that.

573
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:52,396
- Where are the men I left on board?
- You will soon be joining them.

574
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,567
Let the girl go. And I guarantee
we'll double whatever you're getting.

575
01:36:56,692 --> 01:37:02,865
Oh, I never go back on a deal.
It would be bad for my reputation.

576
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:22,718
I will deliver it
and return with the money.

577
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:28,348
The voice of the KGB. Our agreement was
to meet in a place designated by me.

578
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:32,686
After they pay,
I will turn the transmitter over to them.

579
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:37,774
- It must not go out of your sight, Apostis.
- Or mine, Kristatos. Where are we going?

580
01:37:37,858 --> 01:37:42,154
- We will take the ATAC to St Cyrils.
- St Cyrils?

581
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:45,199
I'll arrange the pick-up.

582
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:55,417
Ah, bind that wound.
We don't want any blood in the water.

583
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,878
- Not yet.
- Murderer.

584
01:37:58,545 --> 01:38:02,966
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.

585
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:09,807
Leave the legs free.
They'll make appetising bait.

586
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:23,695
- I didn't think it would end like this.
- We're not dead yet.

587
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:51,849
Hold tight.

588
01:39:17,124 --> 01:39:19,793
Turn around. We go again.

589
01:39:24,882 --> 01:39:27,426
Take a deep breath.

590
01:40:22,481 --> 01:40:25,734
Once again. Hurry.

591
01:41:03,397 --> 01:41:04,606
Argh!

592
01:41:17,161 --> 01:41:18,579
Leave him.

593
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:24,084
Turn. Run them down.

594
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:43,854
Follow me.

595
01:42:26,271 --> 01:42:28,232
Ah.

596
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:32,194
The sharks have them. Make port.

597
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:56,385
- Thank you.
- Hello.

598
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:03,433
- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.

599
01:43:03,517 --> 01:43:06,270
Kristatos is still alive.

600
01:43:06,353 --> 01:43:10,107
He's probably on his way
to Moscow or Havana by now.

601
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:13,819
- We'll never get him.
- Or the ATAC.

602
01:43:13,902 --> 01:43:16,989
ATAC to St Cyrils. ATAC to St Cyrils.

603
01:43:22,077 --> 01:43:24,496
ATAC to St Cyrils.

604
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:33,607
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

605
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:37,110
That's putting it mildly, 007.

606
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:40,531
Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.

607
01:44:40,614 --> 01:44:47,704
Do you know, so far we've managed
to locate 439 St Cyrils in Greece?

608
01:44:47,788 --> 01:44:52,084
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.

609
01:44:52,209 --> 01:44:55,504
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.

610
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:13,480
St Cyrils,
where we used to hide from the Germans.

611
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:19,027
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.

612
01:45:19,111 --> 01:45:24,783
My friend, I've been studying this place
for years for just such an occasion.

613
01:45:24,867 --> 01:45:30,622
We'll split here. The best approach will be
on the right face, away from the building.

614
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:33,083
Then make towards the shed on the left,

615
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:36,628
which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.

616
01:45:36,712 --> 01:45:39,548
It can be operated only from the shed.

617
01:45:40,299 --> 01:45:42,342
Good luck.

618
01:45:51,059 --> 01:45:54,605
- We need more people.
- James is counting on surprise.

619
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:58,567
- But we are only five men.
- And one woman.

620
01:46:50,202 --> 01:46:54,623
18, 19, 20...

621
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:57,543
- 50 more.
- That's the pits!

622
01:46:57,626 --> 01:47:01,046
I'm supposed to be skating
in Oslo and Innsbruck.

623
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,965
Why are we in this creepy place?

624
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:07,469
Our plans are changed. We are going
to live in Cuba for a few months.

625
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:08,846
Cuba?!

626
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:12,224
You can skate privately.
I will be your audience.

627
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:16,770
What a drag that'll be.
I wanna win the gold medal.

628
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:18,564
We all want that.

629
01:47:18,647 --> 01:47:23,485
I know what you want.
But you're too old for me. I'm splitting.

630
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:27,823
You have done this,
poisoned her against me!

631
01:47:27,948 --> 01:47:30,409
Don't blow your top, Ari. Leave her alone.

632
01:47:30,492 --> 01:47:36,123
I will deal with you, Jacoba Brink,
as I deal with everyone who betrays me.

633
01:47:45,215 --> 01:47:49,428
Bibi, you're so young.

634
01:47:50,846 --> 01:47:55,058
- You must have a sponsor.
- I'll find another one.

635
01:47:55,142 --> 01:48:00,105
Go outside and check the guards. Let me
know as soon as the helicopter arrives.

636
01:53:07,955 --> 01:53:10,040
James!

637
01:53:13,585 --> 01:53:16,505
Apostis. One of Kristatos' killers.

638
01:55:59,585 --> 01:56:02,713
Shut him up!

639
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,094
Get the door.

640
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:21,648
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.

641
01:56:21,732 --> 01:56:25,277
You know I will never leave you.

642
01:56:27,946 --> 01:56:30,324
Your general is late.

643
01:56:30,407 --> 01:56:32,993
Only bad weather would delay him.

644
01:56:47,174 --> 01:56:51,386
Cover the windows. Let's go.

645
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:54,181
He's all right, leave him.

646
01:57:01,396 --> 01:57:03,023
He's all right.

647
01:57:03,106 --> 01:57:04,942
Back.

648
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:10,072
Sh!

649
01:57:13,367 --> 01:57:15,828
OK. Let's go.

650
01:57:15,953 --> 01:57:18,747
I'll be with you.

651
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:19,748
Sorry.

652
01:57:31,969 --> 01:57:34,680
Cover the door!

653
01:57:34,763 --> 01:57:37,474
Where's Kristatos? Keep your voice down.

654
01:57:37,558 --> 01:57:41,186
We are leaving him.
He must not know until we are gone.

655
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:45,399
- We'll help you if you help us.
- Ja, mein Herr Bond. Ja.

656
01:57:45,482 --> 01:57:47,359
Come.

657
01:57:57,828 --> 01:58:01,623
- Where are the guards?
- That way.

658
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:38,619
Hey.

659
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:54,676
Move.

660
01:58:58,222 --> 01:59:01,767
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.

661
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:04,603
You'd better stay here.

662
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:15,364
Where's Brink?
What have you done to her?

663
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:18,951
- Go back to your room.
- You can go to hell!

664
01:59:51,108 --> 01:59:53,443
Drop it.

665
02:01:15,567 --> 02:01:18,654
- Where's Kristatos?
- He left with the ATAC.

666
02:01:29,623 --> 02:01:33,127
You're going to pay for it.

667
02:01:47,182 --> 02:01:52,062
No, Melina. That's not the answer.
We'll turn him over to the Greek police.

668
02:01:52,146 --> 02:01:54,189
Out of my way, James.

669
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:59,736
All right. But be prepared
to dig those two graves.

670
02:02:17,296 --> 02:02:19,339
Nyet!

671
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:42,237
That's dĂ©tente, comrade.
You don't have it, I don't have it.

672
02:03:14,394 --> 02:03:18,315
Well, seems as though
Bibi has a new sponsor.

673
02:03:28,534 --> 02:03:32,746
- Well, how's it going?
- I patched through a line to the satellite.

674
02:03:32,830 --> 02:03:35,499
- We can try Bond now.
- Good.

675
02:03:35,582 --> 02:03:38,961
- Are you through to Number 10?
- Standing by, sir.

676
02:03:42,923 --> 02:03:46,218
You know what I'd like?

677
02:03:46,301 --> 02:03:48,470
I can't imagine.

678
02:03:48,595 --> 02:03:50,806
A moonlight swim.

679
02:03:54,977 --> 02:03:57,938
007, are you there?

680
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:03,527
Bond?

681
02:04:04,153 --> 02:04:06,029
Bond?

682
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:11,118
Bond, are you there? Bond!

683
02:04:11,201 --> 02:04:13,412
For your eyes only, darling.

684
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:18,000
Bond? Bond?

685
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:19,293
Bond, Bond.

686
02:04:19,376 --> 02:04:21,920
- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.

687
02:04:25,841 --> 02:04:28,552
I'll get it, Denis.

688
02:04:30,929 --> 02:04:34,183
- Hello?
- Mr Bond on the line, Prime Minister.

689
02:04:34,266 --> 02:04:36,435
Ah, Mr Bond.

690
02:04:37,269 --> 02:04:41,190
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased we all are

691
02:04:41,273 --> 02:04:44,401
that your mission was a success.
Thank you.

692
02:04:44,485 --> 02:04:47,696
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't thank me, Mr Bond.

693
02:04:47,779 --> 02:04:52,910
Your courage and resourcefulness
are a credit to the nation.

694
02:04:52,993 --> 02:04:55,162
Denis and I look forward to meeting you.

695
02:04:55,245 --> 02:04:58,040
Meanwhile, if there
is anything I can do for you...

696
02:04:58,165 --> 02:05:03,462
- Give us a kiss. Give us a kiss.
- Well, really, Mr Bond.

697
02:05:03,545 --> 02:05:07,549
- I think we're having trouble with the line.
- Give us a kiss.

698
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:11,595
- You idiot. Get on to him.
- 007.

699
02:05:11,678 --> 02:05:14,264
007!

700
02:05:14,348 --> 02:05:16,892
Bond, have you gone mad?
What's going on?

701
02:05:16,975 --> 02:05:19,561
Bond? Bond! Bond!

702
02:05:20,521 --> 02:05:27,069
"For your eyes only
can see me through the night"

703
02:05:28,987 --> 02:05:35,244
"For your eyes only I never need to hide"

704
02:05:37,704 --> 02:05:43,544
"You can see so much in me,
so much in me that's new"

705
02:05:46,046 --> 02:05:53,095
"I never felt until I looked at you"

706
02:05:53,178 --> 02:05:57,516
"For your eyes only"

707
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:00,144
"Only for you"

708
02:06:00,269 --> 02:06:05,149
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

709
02:06:05,232 --> 02:06:08,861
"For your eyes only"

710
02:06:08,944 --> 02:06:11,697
"Only for you"

711
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:14,575
"The love I know you need in me"

712
02:06:14,658 --> 02:06:17,619
"The fantasy you've freed in me"

713
02:06:17,703 --> 02:06:21,665
"Only for you"

714
02:06:21,874 --> 02:06:25,752
"Only for you"

715
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:40,684
"For your eyes only,
the nights are never cold"

716
02:06:42,978 --> 02:06:49,193
"You really know me,
that's all I need to know"

717
02:06:51,653 --> 02:06:57,951
"Maybe I'm an open book
because I know you're mine"

718
02:06:59,995 --> 02:07:07,002
"But you don't need
to read between the lines"

719
02:07:07,127 --> 02:07:11,507
"For your eyes only"

720
02:07:11,632 --> 02:07:14,134
"Only for you"

721
02:07:14,259 --> 02:07:19,139
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

722
02:07:19,223 --> 02:07:22,851
"For your eyes only"

723
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:25,646
"Only for you"

724
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:28,649
"The passions that collide in me"

725
02:07:28,732 --> 02:07:31,568
"The wild abandoned side of me"

726
02:07:31,652 --> 02:07:35,322
"Only for you"

727
02:07:35,405 --> 02:07:40,869
"For your eyes only"

728
02:07:40,953 --> 02:07:44,039
