1
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>This is Providence...</i>

2
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,021
<i>Providence, Rhode Island,</i>
<i>where we lived in the year 1921.</i>

3
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:48,089
<i>I was 16 then</i>
<i>and a sophomore in high school.</i>

4
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,102
<i>But enough about me,</i>
<i>for this is not my story...</i>

5
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,662
<i>but the story of our family</i>
<i>and, first and foremost...</i>

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,335
<i>the story of my father</i>
<i>and my mother.</i>

7
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,006
<i>Dad... Frank Bunker Gilbreth...</i>
<i>was an industrial engineer...</i>

8
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,811
<i>- and a leader in the field</i>
<i>of scientific management.</i>

9
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:08,513
<i>If that sounds complicated,</i>
<i>just say that he was an efficiency expert...</i>

10
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,784
<i>a man who'd shown industry</i>
<i>how to save time.</i>

11
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:14,018
<i>He was a man</i>
<i>of definite character...</i>

12
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:18,860
<i>and once his course was set,</i>
<i>nothing could swerve him.</i>

13
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,525
Road hog!

14
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,437
<i>Whenever he came home from a business trip...</i>

15
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,239
<i>- even if he'd been away only for a day,</i>

16
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:36,076
<i>He brought with him an element</i>
<i>of surprise and suspense.</i>

17
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,606
<i>For there's no doubt about it.</i>
<i>Dad was a rugged individualist...</i>

18
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:43,416
<i>Brilliant but... well, let's face it...</i>
<i>a trifle eccentric,</i>

19
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,980
<i>Living by a code</i>
<i>ofhis own design.</i>

20
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,283
<i>It's Daddy! It's Daddy!</i>

21
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:24,887
Hello, live bait.

22
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,455
- Hello, Dad. Glad you're home.
- Glad to be home, Anne.

23
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,502
- Hi, Dad. I was over on the lot.
- Hmm. So I see.

24
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,665
Eighteen seconds. Not bad, not bad.
But I still say we should make it in less.

25
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,674
<i>- We gotta keep trying.</i>
- Hello, Frank.

26
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,676
- Hello, dear.
- How was your trip?

27
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,678
- Couldn't have been better.
- I'm glad, dear.

28
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:43,715
Hi, there, funny face.
Have any trouble with the offspring this time?

29
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,774
- No more than usual.
- How about this one?

30
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,342
- Oh, she's been good as gold.
<i>- Hey, Dad...</i>

31
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,787
what did you bring us?

32
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,915
Quiet, quiet.
You'll find out later.

33
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:57,361
Fall in. Fall in.
Come on, there, small fry.

34
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,726
Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:13,109
Good boy, Jackie.

36
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,841
Dan.

37
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,849
You, there.
What's your name... Sitting Bull?

38
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:21,478
Aw, you haven't forgotten me, Daddy.
I'm Fred.

39
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,818
- Fred? Fred what?
- Fred Sittin Bull.

40
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,823
- How!
- How!

41
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:30,590
All right, let's see your nails.

42
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:35,157
Hmm, you could stand a little soap
and water on those hands, young man.

43
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:39,364
Aw, heck, Dad. What's the good of always
washing 'em? They only get dirty again.

44
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:42,271
That's a risk
we have to take.

45
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,300
- Lillian, I thought I told you
not to bite your nails.
- I didn't bite 'em, Daddy.

46
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:51,213
- They broke off on the piano.
- Then maybe you'd better
go back to the violin.

47
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:54,844
- Oh-oh. How many home runs today?
- Two.

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,185
Slipping, huh?

49
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,191
All right, Martha.
Still dieting?

50
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,386
Kinda.

51
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:06,625
Very nice, Mary. Ernestine.

52
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,294
Mm-hmm.

53
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,303
What's that
on your face? Paint?

54
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,137
No, it isn't. And besides, Dad,
they don't call it paint anymore. It's makeup.

55
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,609
I don't care what they call it.
And don't think you can fool me, either.

56
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,805
I know paint when I see it.

57
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,578
Here. Spit on this.

58
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:33,354
Hm. Well, I see it isn't paint,
and I apologize.

59
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:37,953
But it might have been. As I've told you,
I won't have any painted women in this house.

60
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,591
- If you start any of that nonsense,
you'll find yourself...
- In a convent.

61
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,261
Yes, Daddy, I know...
the one with the 12-foot wall, near Albany.

62
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,270
Don't be impertinent.

63
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:54,272
Now, you'll find the chocolate bars
there in my briefcase. Fall out. Fall out.

64
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,712
- Well, Lillie, it's all settled.
- Is it, dear?

65
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,615
- Yes, ma'am... signed, sealed
and ready for delivery.
- Good.

66
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,882
- What is? What is?
- What's ready for delivery, Dad?

67
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,219
- Shall I?
- They'll have to know sooner or later.

68
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,318
All right. Hey, small fry, how would you kids
like to live in Montclair, New Jersey?

69
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:12,364
- Montclair?
- You mean leave Providence?

70
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:15,400
- I don't know how else you'd do it.
- Oh, but why? Why?

71
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,992
- Well, because it'd be nearer my work.
- But, gee, Dad.

72
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,402
- I'm shortstop on our team.
- And I'm pitcher.

73
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:24,203
There's plenty of time before school starts.
You can form a new team in Montclair.

74
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:27,712
But we don't wanna form a new team.
We wanna be on the one we're on.

75
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,547
- Who wants to live in Montclair?
- You promised when we moved here
we could stay.

76
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:35,587
- Just when we were makir friends too.
- It's all right now, lady.

77
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:39,420
I got them marbles and the comb out,
and I think most of the bird's nest.

78
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:42,517
- Anyway, it works just as good as ever.
- I'll send you a check.

79
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:44,961
- That's all right. Will you just sign here?
- Aw, Dad, please...

80
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,626
Be quiet, all of you!

81
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,694
- Stop this infernal howling.
- But, Dad...

82
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:56,969
- Stop it!
- All these kids yours, mister?
Or is this a picnic?

83
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,603
They're all mine, and believe me,
it's no picnic.

84
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,670
- Aw, look...
- Silence!

85
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,243
<i>After a few days of organized confusion...</i>

86
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,310
<i>we were packed</i>
<i>and ready to depart.</i>

87
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:13,017
<i>And I might add that</i>
<i>Ringling Brothers'Circus had nothing on us.</i>

88
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,583
- Hurry up there, Frank.
- Get off my feet!

89
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:19,097
Be sure everything's out of the house
before you leave, Jim.

90
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:21,724
Don't you worry, Mrs. Gilbreth.
We'll take care of everything.

91
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,030
Have a nice trip.
We'll see you Friday morning.

92
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:27,595
Yes, we'll meet the train.

93
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,607
Hey, Bill. Come on, there.
Hurry up.

94
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,667
- Come on. Foolish Carriage is getting restless.
- I'm comir, Dad.

95
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,713
Come on, Bill.
Make it snappy.

96
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:38,977
- Mercy Maud!
- Scared you, didn't I, son?

97
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,509
- Mercy Maud!
- I'll bet you jumped six and 9/10ths inches.

98
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,522
- Gee, Dad.
- It's all right, dear.

99
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,855
Teach you to keep your eyes open
crossing streets, young man.

100
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,861
Well, is everybody in?
Anne, Ernestine, Martha, Mary, Frank...

101
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,954
- All present and accounted for, Dad.
- Okay.

102
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:55,193
If you're all reasonably sanitary,
let's go.

103
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,202
Bye, Jim! Bye, Mrs. Monahan!

104
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,003
- Good-bye! Good-bye!
- Good-bye, Rhode Island.
New Jersey, here we come.

105
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,344
Hey, Noah, what are you doir
with that ark?

106
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,854
Collecting animals
like the good lord told me, brother.

107
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,152
All I need now
is a jackass. Hop in!

108
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,359
- We turn to the left here, don't we, dear?
- I'm going to turn.

109
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:29,401
It's okay, Dad. I think you can make it.

110
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:33,268
I know I can make it. Hold out your hand.

111
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,273
<i>- Hi, brother.</i>
- Hi, brother.

112
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:39,300
Hi!

113
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,620
Eh, that fan belt again.
You have to get out, Bill.

114
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,684
- Excuse me, Lillie.
- It's not going to blow up, is it?

115
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,253
Of course not.
Wort take a minute to fix it.

116
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:03,825
Incidentally, now's a good time,
while we're stopped, if any of you
want to go see Mrs. Murphy.

117
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:05,836
- Well, how about it?
- Not me, Dad.

118
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:10,034
All right. But remember, all of you,
this is your last chance.

119
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:13,840
Can't understand why a good car
like this should keep acting up.

120
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,905
If it's not one thing, it's another.
Last week it was the carburetor.

121
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:35,659
- Who did that?
- Uh, that was a good joke on you, Dad.

122
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,870
Listen, young man...

123
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:42,896
there's a time and a place for jokes,
and a time and a place for spankings.

124
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:45,603
And the sooner you learn... Get out. Get out.

125
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:51,081
Mercy Maud, Frank. I'll bet you jumped
six and 9/10ths inches that time.

126
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,354
Ha, you're right, son.

127
00:09:56,422 --> 00:10:01,553
That <i>was</i> a good joke on me. By jingo,
I'll bet I did jump six and 9/10ths inches.

128
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,894
Oh, these kids. These kids.

129
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,227
Oh, excuse me, dear. I did that.
It was accidental.

130
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:22,813
#You made life cheery
when you called me dearie #

131
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,840
# 'Twas down where
the bluegrass grows #

132
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,513
#Your lips were sweeter
than julep #

133
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,749
#When you wore a tulip #

134
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:36,022
- #And I wore a big, red rose #
- # Bom, bom ##

135
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,224
- Ah, Lillie, what do you suppose
piddling little families...

136
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,666
- with only five or six children
do with themselves?
- I can't imagine.

137
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:48,434
But I do know one thing.
We'll look back on moments like these
as the happiest in our lives.

138
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,441
- You children hear that?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,443
All right.
Don't forget it.

140
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,947
- # Memories, memories #
- # Memories #

141
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,642
Dad. Hey, Dad.

142
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,708
- Yes, son?
- I gotta go see Mrs. Murphy.

143
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,222
- I asked you not 15 minutes ago,
and you said that you...
- Yes, I know...

144
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,223
but, gee, I can't
help it, Dad.

145
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,225
- Me too, Dad.
- I do too, Dad.

146
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,160
By jingo, I gave you your last chance.
I'm not stopping again.

147
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,221
- But, Dad...
- Nothing doing. You had every opportunity.

148
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,858
Frank, I think
you'd better stop.

149
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,203
All right. Out you go.

150
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,639
And hurry up.
We haven't got all day!

151
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,201
Make it snappy.

152
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,531
All right. You can open your eyes now.

153
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:48,828
Well, what do you think of it?

154
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,835
- Oh, Frank, it's beautiful.
- It's wonderful, Dad.

155
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:54,862
I'm glad you like it. Wait till you see the inside.
Come on. Let's get out.

156
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,704
Come on there, Frank. Help your mother.
That's a good fella.

157
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,802
- You must admit it's a mighty fine
piece of property.
- It's lovely.

158
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,814
I knew it was the right place
the minute I laid eyes on it.

159
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:07,841
I didn't say much or try to describe it.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

160
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,548
- Oh, no, Daddy. We love it.
- Howdy. You folks moving in here?

161
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:13,284
- That's right. Gilbreth's the name.
- You certainly got a nice place.

162
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,656
- I'll say that for you.
- Thank you. We think so.

163
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,957
- All those kids yours?
- Oh, these aren't so many.

164
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,624
You ought to see the ones
we left behind.

165
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,157
- How you ever feed 'em?
- Ah, they come cheaper by the dozen,
you know.

166
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:27,228
Come on, kids.

167
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:36,338
<i> It</i> was <i>a wonderful house,</i>
<i>and we loved living in it...</i>

168
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:40,317
<i>but we soon found out that,</i>
<i>while it was often too small for 12 children...</i>

169
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,411
<i>it was more often too large</i>
<i>for two servants.</i>

170
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:49,085
<i>As usual, Mother and Dad met their problem</i>
<i>in the typical Gilbreth manner... head on!</i>

171
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,593
The family council
will please come to order.

172
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,262
Now, obviously, this house is too big
for Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken...

173
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:01,568
to take care of without help.

174
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,473
Therefore, your mother and I have
called this meeting to discuss...

175
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:08,274
you children taking over part of the work
in the house and in the yard.

176
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:12,943
Assignments will be made on the basis
of personal choice and aptitude.

177
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:17,148
Now, does the chair hear
any suggestions?

178
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:21,022
Come, come, members of the council, this is
a democracy. Everybody has an equal voice.

179
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,084
How do you want
to divide the work?

180
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:29,456
In a democracy, everybody speaks.
So, by jingo, start speaking.

181
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:32,594
Bill, I recognize you.
What do you think?

182
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:36,903
I think Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken
ought to do the work. They get paid for it.

183
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:39,637
- Sit down. You're no longer recognized.
- But in a democracy...

184
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,147
Hush, Bill.
It's almost impossible to get good servants...

185
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,512
these days with so many
children in the family.

186
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,442
- Mr. Chairman?
<i>- Yes, son?</i>

187
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:51,450
I think you're right. Jim and Mrs. Monahan
do have too much to do.

188
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:54,976
- I move we hire more people to work for us.
- Second the motion!

189
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:58,923
- Me too.
- Out of order.
Sit down and be quiet, all of you.

190
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:02,018
I, uh... Uh,

191
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,997
The chair recognizes
the assistant chairman.

192
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:10,127
Well, of course, we could hire additional help,
and that might be the answer.

193
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:14,902
- But that would mean cutting the budget
somewhere else.

194
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,909
Perhaps if we cut out
all desserts...

195
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:20,003
<i>and allowances,</i>
<i>we might be able to afford a maid.</i>

196
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,346
<i>And then if we cut out movies,</i>
<i>ice cream sodas and new clothes for a year...</i>

197
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:27,079
we might even be able to afford
a helper forJim too.

198
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:30,520
Uh-huh. Do I hear a motion
to that effect?

199
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,957
How about it, Bill?
You want to stop allowances? Frank? Anne?

200
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,997
Oh, well.
I move we allot the work.

201
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:41,522
- Splendid, splendid. Do I hear a second?
- Second the motion.

202
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:44,502
- All those in favor signify.
- Aye.

203
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,438
Motion carried.
Now, is there any further business?

204
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,498
I move we adjourn.

205
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:53,637
Not so fast, young lady. There's still
that little matter of specific assignments.

206
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:57,171
For instance, the back fence,
which is badly in need of whitewashing.

207
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,184
Do I hear any bids?

208
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:03,484
Huh? Speak up. If you want to earn a little
extra spending money, here's your chance.

209
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:06,116
- Yes, Bill?
- I'll bid $10.

210
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:10,561
You must think this is a government project.
Do I hear any reasonable bids?

211
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,224
L... I bid 47 cents.

212
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,065
- Forty-seven cents?
- Please, Daddy. Let me do it.

213
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:21,574
- Tell me, how do you happen
to hit on 47 cents?
- I've been saving to buy...

214
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:24,610
a pair of roller skates,
and that's how much more I need.

215
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:27,373
- But you're gonna get skates for your birthday.
- Frank.

216
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:31,315
Oh, I'm sorry, Lillie.
I wasrt supposed to let that out of the bag.

217
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:34,876
- Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.
Thank you, thank you.

218
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:37,923
Besides, that's too big a job
for a little girl like you.

219
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,821
Frank, here's your chance.
What do you bid... within reason?

220
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,161
Oh, well. 2.50, I guess.

221
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:50,430
Good. You got yourself a contract.
Now, is there any more new business?

222
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,830
I think this family
ought to buy a dog.

223
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:57,399
Out of order. Meeting adjourned.

224
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,384
Well, here we are.
I know you're all eager to get started...

225
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:11,549
on a new school year, so out you go.

226
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:14,115
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- But, Dad, not all of us?

227
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,061
Certainly all of you.
You want us to make an impression, don't you?

228
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,064
But this isn't our school...
Ernestine's and mine.

229
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,498
- We're gonna go to high school.
- We'll take care of that later.

230
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:25,800
- I wanna show these people first
what a real family looks like.
- But it's so embarrassing.

231
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,602
A person with inner dignity
is never embarrassed.

232
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:31,303
Besides, visits like this get results.
Teachers lap it up.

233
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:35,108
I only wish I had time to send home
for your mother and the babies.

234
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:38,878
- And I will, too,
unless you two get a move-on. Come on.
- Honestly, Dad.

235
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:43,082
- You have more gall...
- Somebody in this family
has to show a little spunk.

236
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,181
- Come on, son.
- It's so silly.

237
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:53,757
Ern! Ern! There he is.

238
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,366
He's the one I told you about... the captain
of the swimming team. His name is Tom Black.

239
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:06,810
- Oh, he's adorable.
- I'll say.

240
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:14,149
What are you two hanging back there for?
Come along!

241
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,246
Shh! Daddy, please.
Why...

242
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:19,791
- Why, somebody might hear you.
- Suppose they do?

243
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,054
They're gonna hear from me
soon enough anyhow.

244
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:26,497
No dying-cow looks, now.
Hold your heads up and look alive. Let's go.

245
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,500
Take your hats off.

246
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:34,096
Gangway.

247
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:42,570
Refer these to Miss Jensen.
Give these to Miss Sweeney.

248
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,583
Come in.

249
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:49,020
Good morning, madam.
Just a Gilbreth invasion,
or perhaps I should say a partial invasion...

250
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,818
since I left most of them
at home with their mother.

251
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:55,850
- I hope we're not intruding.
- Oh, not at all.
I'm delighted to see you, Mr. Gilbreth.

252
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,523
We've heard so much about you.
I understand you have...

253
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:01,294
Eleven children, ma'am,
but unfortunately...

254
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,268
only five will be under
your excellent supervision:

255
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:07,238
Mary, Martha, Lillian,
Bill and FrankJr.

256
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:10,504
- How do you do, sir?
- I just brought my two older girls,
Anne and Ernestine...

257
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:13,842
along so you could get a better
idea of the crop we're raising.

258
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,040
Well, I'm so glad
you dropped in, Mr. Gilbreth.

259
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:19,642
I'm sure we're all going to get along
beautifully together. It's such a pleasure...

260
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,449
Uh, just a minute.
I'm not just dropping in.

261
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,990
I want to meet their teachers
and see what grades they're going into.

262
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:28,221
Oh, well, I'm afraid all our teachers are busy
at the moment. You see, it's opening day...

263
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,285
Oh, that's all right.
I'm in no hurry.

264
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,696
In fact, I've arranged my schedule
so as to give you my entire morning.

265
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,257
- You have?
- Meanwhile, as to their grades...

266
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:40,136
I see no reason why children who are
well-developed mentally should be held back...

267
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:44,233
by a school system geared to those
of simply normal intelligence.

268
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,076
No. Of course not. But so much depends
on their ages. Now, if you'll just...

269
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:51,480
You mean mental ages,
of course.

270
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:54,679
- Bill, how old are you, son?
- Eight.

271
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,745
What grade does an eight-year-old
usually belong in?

272
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,621
- The third.
- Then I think he'd better go in the fifth.

273
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:04,254
Oh-ho, but that's impossible, Mr. Gilbreth.
Perhaps later on, if he takes tests...

274
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,733
By all means. I hope they'll all take
a lot of tests. It's good for them.

275
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:12,293
Meanwhile to, uh,
to illustrate my point... Frank...

276
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:16,035
what's 46 times 83?

277
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,600
Three thousand,
eight hundred and eighteen.

278
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:22,079
Lillian, 19 times 91.

279
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,981
<i> One thousand,</i>
<i>seven hundred and twenty-nine.</i>

280
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:29,681
Bill, 52 times 52.

281
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:31,986
Two thousand,
seven hundred and four.

282
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:35,425
Now, would you care to suggest
a few large numbers?

283
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:39,989
Well, I... think I'll take your
word for it, Mr. Gilbreth...

284
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,000
and I'll see what I can do.

285
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,002
It would really
expedite matters...

286
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,402
if you'd have the teacher of the fifth grade
step in here for a moment.

287
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,406
Also, while we're about it...

288
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:52,467
the teachers of the third,
fourth, sixth and seventh.

289
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:55,241
Ask Miss Billsop, Miss Jensen,
Miss Moore, Mrs. Hallbright...

290
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:57,249
and Miss Sweeney
to step in here for a moment.

291
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:00,218
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- Thank you, madam.</i>
<i>And now, while we're waiting...</i>

292
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:03,278
perhaps it might interest you to hear
something of the home training program...

293
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,586
their mother and I have
worked out for the children:

294
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,491
Spelling games, geography quizzes,
language study...

295
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:11,325
We're learning French and German
from a Victrola.

296
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:15,697
Dad's even taught us how to take a whole bath
in the time it takes to play just one record.

297
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:18,999
- Really?
A simple matter of coordination, madam.

298
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,438
Like any other physical effort,
scientific bathing is...

299
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:26,206
- Yes, but how do you do it?
- Well, this seems hardly the time and place.

300
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,476
I doubt if you'd be interested.

301
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:32,643
Oh, but I am.
It sounds perfectly fascinating.

302
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,244
- Yeah. Go on. Show her, Dad.
- Yeah. Show her.

303
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:39,451
- Here.
- Well, if you insist, son.
This is really very simple.

304
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,892
First, you take the soap in your right hand,
apply it to the left shoulder...

305
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:48,025
run it down the top of the left arm,
up the inside of the left arm to the armpit...

306
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:52,333
<i>then the ears... both of them, of course...</i>
<i>not forgetting the back of the neck...</i>

307
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:56,364
then down the outside of the left leg,
back up the inside of the left leg...

308
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:58,910
then down the right leg,
and up.

309
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,037
Then at the hip,
change the soap to the left hand...

310
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:04,572
<i>and do the same thing</i>
<i>on the right arm and shoulder.</i>

311
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,915
<i>After a couple of circular motions</i>
<i>on the midsection and back...</i>

312
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:11,081
and some special attention
to the feet...

313
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:15,059
slide under for a rinse,
and you rise bathed.

314
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:19,087
Oh, come in, ladies. Mr. Gilbreth
is just showing me how to take a bath.

315
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:22,225
- A what?
- Good morning, ladies.

316
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,292
Good morning.

317
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:28,201
<i>In our family, sickness was taboo.</i>

318
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:31,971
<i>Dr. Burtors car in front of our house</i>
<i>could mean only one thing.</i>

319
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,978
<i>- Dad!</i>
- Yes?

320
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:38,483
- Where's the baby? Where is it?
- In her room taking her nap, of course. Why?

321
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:41,748
- We mean the latest model.
- Is it a boy or a girl?

322
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,755
Is what a boy or a girl?

323
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:47,315
Aw, come on, Daddy. You can't fool us.
What are we gonna name this one?

324
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,953
Lillie, what's got into these children?
What are they talking about?

325
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,465
- I can't imagine, dear.
- We wanna see the new baby.

326
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,024
Whatever gave you the idea
there was a new baby?

327
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:59,469
- That's Dr. Burtors
automobile outside, isn't it?
- Yes.

328
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,906
- And you were sick last night, werert ya?
- I had a slight headache.

329
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,773
And every time you're sick
there's always a baby, isn't there?

330
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:10,748
Oh, my goodness. Babies don't come just
because you're sick. I thought you knew that.

331
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:13,047
They've always come before
when you were sick.

332
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,088
Oh, dear.

333
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,749
It's up to you, Lillie. You're the psychologist.

334
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:22,386
I have some very important work to do.
I'll be in my study.

335
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,487
You understand, don't you?

336
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:27,692
Yes, I certainly do.

337
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,792
Well, first, about Dr. Burton.

338
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,963
He's here because he's afraid Jack has
a whooping cough, which means you children...

339
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,371
will have to stay
away from him.

340
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:40,208
As to babies, well,
I think it's about time we had a little talk.

341
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,742
Oh, no, Bill.
Don't tell me you're getting it too?

342
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,825
- Who's that coughing?
<i>- Me, Dad.</i>

343
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:57,659
Well, stop it.
I'm not gonna have an epidemic in this house.

344
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,925
We haven't time
for any such nonsense.

345
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,992
You children have been given good health,
and by jingo, it's your job to keep it.

346
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,197
- I don't want any excuses. You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

347
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:08,365
- All right.
- I think I better get him up to the doctor.

348
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,375
Yes, Lillie.

349
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:15,238
Where did that whatever-it-is come from?

350
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:17,509
- He's a beaut, isn't he, Dad?
- A beaut?

351
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,484
Look here, you mangy mongrel...

352
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:23,181
Go on. Get out.
Don't argue. Out! Out!

353
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:30,595
Martha, keep
that cover on.

354
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,858
Remember what the doctor said.

355
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:35,457
- He wants you to keep warm.
- Yes, Mother.

356
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:38,504
Here, darling.
Put this jacket around your shoulders.

357
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:40,505
Oh, thank you, Mother.

358
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,201
<i> I'm going down to the kitchen</i>
<i>now to get your dessert...</i>

359
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:45,335
and I'll read to you,
if you like.

360
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,345
- Oh, hello, Dad.
- May I come in?

361
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:50,405
<i>- Of course, dear.</i>
- I won't disturb anything.

362
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,542
It's all right.
The children have missed you.

363
00:23:55,688 --> 00:24:00,591
- Oh, Frank. Not you too?
- Yes, yes. Looks like I belong up here too, Lillie.

364
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,992
Oh, dear.

365
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,087
Daddy's got the whooping cough.

366
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:09,692
- Daddy's got the whooping cough.
- You children get back in bed. Go on.

367
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,828
- Dr. Burton...
<i>- Yes?</i>

368
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:14,771
- Will you come in here a minute, please?
<i>- Right away.</i>

369
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,976
Frank, sit down, dear.

370
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:22,014
- Do you ache anywhere?
- I'll be all right, Lillie.

371
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,242
- In heavers name, what's the trouble now?
- It's Mr. Gilbreth.

372
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:26,251
He's coughing too.

373
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,413
Oh, me. How did I ever get mixed up
with this family anyhow?

374
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:31,683
Let me hear you cough.

375
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:34,123
There's nothir the matter with me.

376
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:36,753
- I was only joking.
- You were what?

377
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:39,730
Well, it just wasrt any fun
downstairs by myself, Lillie.

378
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,168
- I wanted to be up here
with the rest of the family.
- Very funny. Very funny.

379
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:47,637
Frank Gilbreth, I give up. Sometimes I think
you're more trouble than the children.

380
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:50,938
I'm sorry, Lillie. But all that quiet
down there makes me nervous.

381
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,944
Oh, really.

382
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:57,182
Tell me, Doc, how are
my Mongolians coming along?

383
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:00,614
- They'll live.
- In spite of you, you old veterinarian.

384
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:04,451
Well, I'll say one thing for you, Gilbreth.
Your children don't get sick very often...

385
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:06,456
but when they do,
they certainly mess up...

386
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:08,856
the public health statistics
of the state of New Jersey.

387
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:12,727
- How's that, Mr. Bones?
- Ordinarily, I only have a couple of cases
of whooping cough...

388
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:17,257
or measles a week, but when I have to report
11 cases in a single day, they're liable...

389
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:20,793
to quarantine the whole town of Montclair
and close every school in Essex county.

390
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,806
Well, at least these
are only light cases.

391
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:25,240
Pioneer stock, you know.

392
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,245
As far as New Jersey's concerned,
whooping cough's whooping cough.

393
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:31,043
By the way, these kids have got tonsils...
really ugly ones.

394
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:35,075
- As soon as they're over this,
they ought to come out.
- I've never had mine out.

395
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:38,611
- Maybe you should. Let's look.
- No, you don't.
There's nothing the matter with them.

396
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,217
- Oh, stop wasting my time and sit down.
- What's the point of all this?

397
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:44,955
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

398
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,397
- Say "ah."
- Ah-h-h-h.

399
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,196
Just as I thought.
Yours should have been out years ago.

400
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:56,639
- You're crazy.
I've never been sick a day in my life.
- Let them stay in if you want to.

401
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,642
You're not hurting
anyone but yourself.

402
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,942
But these children's tonsils
have got to come out, all but one... Martha's.

403
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:05,608
<i>- Hers are as sound as a dollar.</i>
- Hooray for me.

404
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:09,780
- Well, good night, girls. I'll see you tomorrow.
<i>- Good night, Doctor.</i>

405
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:13,620
Say, Doc, I was just thinking.

406
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:16,991
If we have to have their tonsils out,
could we do it here in the house?

407
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:20,031
- Why here?
What's the matter with a hospital?
- Well, it struck me...

408
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:23,727
if we could rig up
an operating room downstairs,
I could photograph the operations...

409
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:25,929
and study what you doctors
are doing wrong.

410
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:29,701
Then I'd be able
to show how you could eliminate
a lot of waste motions and speed things up.

411
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:32,971
Now, wait a minute. That system of yours
may be all right in factories...

412
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:37,174
And in medicine too.
Ho-ho, I've been looking for a chance like this.

413
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:40,183
- Now, not so fast. Nobody's going to...
- Oh, you're leaving, Doctor?

414
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:44,585
- Lillie, we're gonna have
the children's tonsils out.
- Oh, Frank, do we have to?

415
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:48,092
That's what this fella here says.
But it's all right. I'm gonna take movies.

416
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,684
- Of the operations?
- Certainly, of the operations.

417
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:54,027
Why, there's no telling how many lives
this sort of study will help save.

418
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,262
But doesn't it seem rather heartless,
using the children as guinea pigs?

419
00:26:57,335 --> 00:27:00,031
Not at all. They'll be asleep
and won't know what's going on.

420
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:05,133
Besides, if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll let this old butcher here yank mine out too.

421
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,078
Yours? Well, why didn't you say so?
Now we're getting somewhere.

422
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:12,310
- Oh, Frank...
- No, don't stop him.
Let him go ahead and cut his own throat.

423
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:15,841
That's one part of the festivities
I might even enjoy.

424
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,787
Will you stop drooling?

425
00:27:18,857 --> 00:27:22,850
By jingo, this may make you famous,
you ol' quack.

426
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,129
All right, May,
you can ease up a little now.

427
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:44,079
- All right. Start...
Start cranking.

428
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:47,118
Can you see it all?
Is the clock in?

429
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:49,119
<i> Yeah, it's in.</i>

430
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:51,451
<i>Everything's in.</i>

431
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:55,653
Mr. Gilbreth,
my stomach's beginning to...

432
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm not interested in your internal organs.
Just keep cranking.

433
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,298
<i>Dad had said, "Think of all the fun we'll have...</i>

434
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:07,429
<i>looking at the movies</i>
<i>and seeing ourselves asleep. "</i>

435
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:11,669
<i>But I'm afraid, to those waiting,</i>
<i>it was not a very consoling thought.</i>

436
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:15,372
<i>As much as they loved movies,</i>
<i>I have a feeling that that's one epic...</i>

437
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:17,937
<i>they'd have been</i>
<i>delighted to pass up.</i>

438
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:27,087
I hear you poor kids couldn't
have any breakfast this morning.

439
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:30,491
Aw, everybody knows you can't eat
before you get operated on.

440
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:34,430
I had doughnuts for breakfast with sugar...
mmm, delicious...

441
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:37,195
<i>and a big piece of apple pie</i>
<i>that was left over from last night.</i>

442
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:39,202
You beast.
You get out of here.

443
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,068
Mrs. Monahan was just as sweet
as she could be.

444
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,074
"Why don't you have
another one, Martha?"

445
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,542
"Thanks, Mrs. Monahan,
I believe I will."

446
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:49,205
"Why don't you take two to three, dear?
They're so tasty."

447
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,714
<i>"I really shouldn't,</i>
<i>Mrs. Monahan.</i>

448
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:54,650
<i>"But maybe while those poor kids</i>
<i>are waiting tonight...</i>

449
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:57,517
I'll dedicate one
to each of them."

450
00:28:57,589 --> 00:28:59,921
<i>Mother, will you make Martha stop talking...</i>

451
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:01,925
<i>about what a delicious</i>
<i>breakfast she had?</i>

452
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,291
<i>All she's done</i>
<i>since she's been in here is gloat.</i>

453
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:08,196
- Not another word about food, Martha.
Do you understand?
- I'm sorry, Mother.

454
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:11,235
I won't even mention doughnuts
and apple pie again.

455
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:15,432
<i>- Martha!</i>
- Nothing to it.
Anne slept through it just like a baby.

456
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:19,442
And I know we got some great movies.
Come on, Ernestine, girl. You're next.

457
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,709
- Don't be afraid, dear.
It'll be over in a few minutes.
- I'm not afraid, Mother, much.

458
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:28,513
A Gilbreth, afraid? Don't be ridiculous.
After all, she's her father's daughter.

459
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:31,555
What in the world is there to be afraid of?
Never heard such nonsense.

460
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:35,115
- This'll all be over in a jiffy. Go on, dear.
- Go ahead, dear.

461
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:38,060
- That's a good girl.
- I'll go up with Anne.

462
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,154
Everything's under control.

463
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,726
Let's take off the robe
and hop right up here on the table.

464
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:47,498
- Is it going to hurt?
- At your age, you won't even feel it.

465
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:49,904
That's what
I told her, Doctor.

466
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:51,908
All right, May.

467
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:57,070
Just relax, dear. I'll be
right here with you.

468
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,786
How about changing the lens
for this one?

469
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:05,015
I want to see exactly how his caddy
hands him those knives.

470
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:08,252
But ain't it kinda hot in here?
Couldn't we open a widow or somethir?

471
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,726
- Do you want this child to get pneumonia?
- But this ether...

472
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:14,788
- Never mind the ether.
Just take care of that camera.
<i>- Ready, Doctor.</i>

473
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,197
Good heavens, man, I told you
I didn't want Martha.

474
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:23,900
- You haven't got Martha. That's Ernestine.
- You sure?

475
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:26,341
- Of course I'm sure, you jackass.
- You must be mistaken.

476
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,606
Here. Look carefully.
There now. Isn't that Martha?

477
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,547
Don't you suppose I know my own children?
I tell you, that's Ernestine.

478
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:35,211
- Well, if this isn't Martha,
we've made a horrible mistake.
- We? What do you mean, we?

479
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:39,586
- What kind of a mistake?
- I know them by their tonsils.
I thought these were Martha's.

480
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,716
They're the only ones
that didn't have to come out.

481
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:46,560
- You mean you knocked my little girl
unconscious for no reason?
- I'm sorry, but that's about it.

482
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:49,498
I'll admit it was careless,
but you do have an uncommon lot of them...

483
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,559
- and they all look alike to me.
- But what do we do now?

484
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:54,969
Take them out anyhow.
They may have to come out eventually.

485
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,805
The worst part of an operation
is dreading it beforehand.

486
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:01,436
- Go get Martha ready.
- But she's been eating all morning.

487
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:06,745
Never mind. Go get her.
I'm not going through another day like this.

488
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:11,312
- Start grinding.
At least we'll salvage something.

489
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:16,159
<i> Poor Martha.</i>

490
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:21,324
<i>It was a blow, but in she went</i>
<i>full of pie, doughnuts and indignation.</i>

491
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,031
Frank.

492
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:30,131
- What is all this about Martha?
- This fool, Burton...
he got her mixed up with Ernestine.

493
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,371
- It's all his fault.
- I don't care whose fault it is.
I think it's a shame...

494
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:36,436
after letting that poor child
eat all those doughnuts for breakfast...

495
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:38,448
only to be snatched up
and brought in to be butchered.

496
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:41,815
Now, there's nothing to worry about, Lillie.
It's no worse than a mosquito bite.

497
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:45,879
Besides, it's almost over. You better wait
in the other room. Go on, dear.

498
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:47,891
There we are.

499
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,893
Keep grinding.

500
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:52,361
Frank, I think this whole thing...

501
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,796
But you're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

502
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:58,063
All it takes is the tiniest little cut
at the back of the throat.

503
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:00,366
Just to show you it's nothing,
I'll go next.

504
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:03,032
- I thought you wanted to watch your pictures.
- Oh, I'll watch, all right.

505
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:06,406
I'm only gonna take a local anesthetic.
Ho-ho, I won't miss a thing.

506
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:10,243
- But does Dr. Burton think
a local anesthetic is wise?
- That's just a lot of nonsense...

507
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:12,248
about my physical condition.

508
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:14,682
These doctors don't know
what they're talking about half the time.

509
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:18,119
I'll be in the amen corner
when they're laying him away.

510
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:21,158
Besides, I wanna get this over with
before lunch. I'm starved.

511
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:24,558
Gee, Dad, you act like
you're lookir forward to it.

512
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,588
Why, sure, son. There's nothing to it.
Huh! Just like rollir off a log.

513
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,396
All right, who's next?

514
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:34,870
<i>- I am.</i>
- Okay, make it snappy.
A man can stand just so much.

515
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:38,204
Frank, I hope you're not making a mistake.
After all, at your age...

516
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:40,335
Age has nothing
to do with it, Lillie.

517
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:42,879
It's simply a matter
of resolution.

518
00:32:42,947 --> 00:32:44,881
Let's go.

519
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,521
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

520
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:54,991
<i>To Dad, a tonsil operation was nothing,</i>
<i>just like... how did he put it?</i>

521
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:58,051
<i>"Just like rolling off a log."</i>

522
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,434
<i>- Frank!</i>
- Oh, Lillie.

523
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:08,029
- My throat. This is awful.
- Yes. I know, dear.

524
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:11,166
- I... I can't talk.
- Nurse, I'll take him.

525
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,176
You're all right, old pioneer.

526
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,838
- You just had to have it
the hard way, that's all.
- Lillie, I...

527
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,881
- I'm dying.
- Now, come on, old-timer.

528
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:19,883
I'll give you something
to make you sleep.

529
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,919
How am I gonna sleep
with my throat cut?

530
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:25,649
- You'll be all right in a couple of weeks.
- Mr. Gilbreth! Mr. Gilbreth!

531
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:28,214
Go away. Go away. Can't you see I'm dying?

532
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:33,787
I hate to tell you this, but it looks like
none of them motion pictures'll be any good.

533
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:38,234
- No good?
- Uh, I forgot to put any film in the camera.

534
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:42,238
- You what?
<i>- Please. Oh, now, please, please</i>
<i>don't get excited.</i>

535
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,400
<i>- Anyhow, it's too much for me. I quit!</i>
- Let me at him.

536
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:47,467
- Frank!
- Let me at him!

537
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,817
- Children, children.
Now, we are not doing our best.

538
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,724
Suppose we start over, and this time,
let's be sure everybody's in the same key.

539
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:38,796
Oh, it's no use,
Miss Ethel.

540
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,057
We might as well face it.
We just haven't any musical talent.

541
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:44,259
We mustrt let our father
hear us say that.

542
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:49,034
- Why? Doesrt he know yet?
- He takes it for granted
that all of his children are gifted.

543
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:51,597
Well, far be it for me to disillusion him.

544
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:54,974
- Let's go.
- All right, children? Ready?

545
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,878
One, two, three...

546
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:36,246
Softly, now. Softly as a little brook
tinkling through a still forest.

547
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:51,362
Excuse me, but do you by any chance
hear a little brook...

548
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,369
tinkling through a still forest?

549
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,769
Poor Miss Ethel. What fortitude.

550
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,773
You're home early, dear.

551
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:00,173
Yes, I know.
Well, I had a letter today...

552
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,405
from Dr. Bleneim
of Czechoslovakia.

553
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,970
- Thought you might like to see it.
- Oh, do they want you to come?

554
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:08,212
Well, there's nothing really definite yet,
but Bleneim thinks there's a good chance...

555
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:11,220
they'll ask me to speak at the International
Management Conference in Prague.

556
00:36:11,288 --> 00:36:13,279
Oh, Frank, I knew they would.
May I see it?

557
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:15,291
Let's not count our chickens
too soon.

558
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,293
This is gonna be
a pretty high-powered meeting.

559
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,693
It'll attract
the best scientific minds in the world.

560
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,493
That's why it's such a wonderful opportunity
to show other countries...

561
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:26,093
what motion study really is
and have your methods accepted universally.

562
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,161
I admit it's what
I've always hoped for.

563
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:30,604
It might mean a great deal
financially too, Lillie.

564
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:35,543
But the important thing is that it will
establish you as a leader in the whole field.

565
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:40,675
- I'm so happy, Frank.
- I knew you'd be pleased. And why not?

566
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,311
After all, if it hadn't been
for you and your help...

567
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,753
- Will you tell the children tonight?
- You can tell them if you want...

568
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:47,757
but warn them...
not a word about it yet.

569
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:51,693
- But I won't be here tonight.
- You won't be here? Where are you going?

570
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:55,391
- Have you forgotten?
I have a date at the hospital.
- So soon?

571
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,400
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

572
00:36:57,468 --> 00:37:00,096
But I thought you were only joking
about going to the hospital.

573
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,333
After all, you never went to one before
just to have a baby.

574
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:05,534
Maybe I never thought
about it before.

575
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:09,739
Going to be awfully lonely around here
without you, Lillie.

576
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,804
<i>I'll hurry back</i>
<i>as quickly as I can.</i>

577
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,817
By the way,
do you mind what it is?

578
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:20,585
Why, I thought we'd already agreed
it would be a boy. After all, we have six girls.

579
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,421
But of course, anything you decide
will be all right with me.

580
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:26,088
Thank you, dear.
Have you thought of a name?

581
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:29,132
- Why, no, I haven't.
- What do you think of Robert?

582
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,531
Robert? Why Robert?
Who's named Robert?

583
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:34,230
Oh, no one in particular.
It's just a nice name, that's all.

584
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,932
I always knew you had a strange collection
of beaus during your college years...

585
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,941
but, uh, which one was Robert?

586
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,911
The one with the long hair and the violin,
or the one that lisped... like "thith"?

587
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,448
When you're quite through,
we'll decide on a name.

588
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,950
In the meantime, if you want
to go into the subject of old flames...

589
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,486
remember... two can play
at that game.

590
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:54,320
- I seem to recall a certain lady poetess...
- Never mind. Never mind.

591
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:58,725
I wouldn't think of blighting
an old schoolgirl romance.

592
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,788
Male or female,
Robert it is.

593
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,861
<i> For the 12th time,</i>
<i>Dad's verdict was exactly the same.</i>

594
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:12,431
Well, I'll say this for him.
He's every inch a Gilbreth.

595
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:17,469
- I'm glad you approve.
- Yes. I expect we'd better keep <i>him</i> too.

596
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:20,984
Well, Lillie, it's over. Twelve of'em.

597
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,212
And hardly an idiot
in the bunch.

598
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:26,017
And you were afraid you'd be
the last of the Gilbreths.

599
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:28,080
I admit, you had me worried
there for a while.

600
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:31,127
Four girls in a row.
That can be pretty nerve-racking.

601
00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,595
Of course, you know
I did it deliberately.

602
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,133
Come here, young fella.

603
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:39,192
Let's you and me
get acquainted.

604
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:42,670
Be careful with him, Frank.
I don't think hospitals approve of fathers.

605
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,071
Hospitals. Heh.

606
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:49,772
Young man, did I ever tell you about the night
your mother and I were married...

607
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:53,374
and we decided to have
an even dozen like you, hmm?

608
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,217
You set the actual target, dear...
six boys and six girls.

609
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,654
I believe you even made
a memorandum of it.

610
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:04,820
That's right, son.
Sounds kind of silly now, doesn't it?

611
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:07,295
Not half as silly
as it sounded then.

612
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:13,835
Honestly, dear, did you really think
we'd be able to go through with it?

613
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:15,838
Why, certainly.

614
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:19,740
I always knew that anything you and I
teamed up on, Lillie, would be a success.

615
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,179
It'll seem kind of funny, won't it?
For the first time in 17 years...

616
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:29,379
we'll be able to go to bed
without setting the alarm for a 2:00 feeding.

617
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,444
It's certainly gonna be a luxury,
isn't it?

618
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:35,322
A wonderful luxury...
and I'll hate it.

619
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:40,694
- Well, Bob, you better get back
to your mother.

620
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:44,495
Looking after her is gonna be
one of your jobs from now on.

621
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:49,801
And incidentally, young man,
she's a pretty wonderful woman.

622
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:53,866
Anyway, that's one mars opinion.

623
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,382
<i>That's good. Smile, now.</i>

624
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,975
<i>Smile so I can see</i>
<i>the whites of your teeth.</i>

625
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:07,319
<i>And stop fidgeting. How can I focus this thing</i>
<i>if you keep on fidgeting?</i>

626
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,655
Children, please be quiet.
This won't last much longer.

627
00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:12,092
Anne, you're the oldest.
Help your mother keep them quiet.

628
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:14,426
I'm afraid that would require
an act of God.

629
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,899
Now, stop moving for all our sakes
and smile.

630
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:21,165
That's right. Now, listen to your sister.
Come on, now. Let's have a great big smile.

631
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,172
Come on. Smile for Daddy.

632
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,834
That's better.
Are we all ready?

633
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:28,571
Jane, take your hands down from your ears.
That's a good girl.

634
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:31,205
Now, then, here we go.
Hold it. Hold it.

635
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:34,148
Ho-o-old it!

636
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:38,210
I think that was a good one, Lillie.
Ha-ha, this new flash certainly works fine.

637
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:40,552
Yes, it certainly does.

638
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:43,821
- Now that we're all together, whadaya say?
- Yeah, it's a swell time.

639
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:46,226
You get the chair and the gavel,
and I'll get the table.

640
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:48,230
- Okay.
<i>- Thank you, dear.</i>

641
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:51,734
- Come, children. It's past your bedtime.
<i>- Before you go upstairs, Lillie...</i>

642
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:54,236
don't you think we ought to take one more,
just to be on the safe side?

643
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:56,238
- I think not, dear.
- Why, after all, we should.

644
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:59,275
- It's the first time we've had all 12 together.
- No, Frank.

645
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:03,837
- Seven explosions
are quite enough in one night.
- Okay, Lillie. You're the boss.

646
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:07,213
- Well, what's that for?
- Dad, we've been talkir something over...

647
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:10,185
and we wondered, as long as we're all here,
if we couldn't have a family council.

648
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,187
Well, that's possible.
What's on your mind, son?

649
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:15,554
- We want to do it legally, Dad,
in regular meeting.
- Very good.

650
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,560
All right, everybody.
Come on. Let's take seats.

651
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:19,892
- No, Frank. I have to get the babies to bed.
- This won't take long.

652
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:21,931
- After all, if the children are interested...
- I'll take them up, Mother.

653
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:24,263
I, uh... I think they want you
down here.

654
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:29,101
- All right, dear. But what's all mystery about?
- You'll find out. Come, Jane.

655
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:33,006
All right, kids, take your places.
I'll be at your service in a moment.

656
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,170
Hurry up, there. Make it snappy.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

657
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,909
Now, then,
are we all settled?

658
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:43,646
Now, the, uh... the family council
will please come to order.

659
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,654
Now, then,
what's the problem?

660
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,656
- Mr. Chairman?
- Yes?

661
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:50,887
It's been brought to our attention
that the assistant chairman... Mother...

662
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:53,020
intends to buy a new rug
for the dining room.

663
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:56,998
And since the entire membership will be
required to look upon and sit in chairs...

664
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:01,663
resting on said rug, we move that the council
be consulted before any rug is purchased.

665
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:03,729
- Second the motion.
- Me too!

666
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:06,605
That's a point well taken.
Any discussion?

667
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:09,908
We'd like to ask the assistant chairman
how much it's going to cost.

668
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,849
- $100.
- Mr. Chairman, I move
that not more than $95 be spent.

669
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:16,852
- Second the motion.
- Me too.

670
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,186
Well, this idea of saving five dollars
is a very laudable one. Let me commend you.

671
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:25,319
Now, all those in favor of spending
only $95 for a rug signify by saying "aye."

672
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:28,796
- Aye!
- Carried. Now, is there any further business?

673
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:33,165
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. I move we spend
the five dollars we've just saved to buy a dog.

674
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:36,501
<i>- Second the motion.</i>
- Out of order. Out of order.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

675
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:39,804
You children know very well how I feel
about having animals around here.

676
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:42,037
- But, Mr. Chairman, a dog would be a pet.
- William...

677
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:45,104
Everyone in the family could pat
him and I would be his master.

678
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:48,640
A dog would be a friend, Mr. Chairman.
He could eat scraps of food, and...

679
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,653
- Save motions.
- What was that?

680
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,746
And that would save motions
for the garbage man.

681
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,724
A dog would keep burglars away.
He would sleep on the foot of my bed...

682
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,783
and I would wash him
whenever he was dirty.

683
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:00,227
A dog would be an accursed nuisance,
that's what he'd be.

684
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:02,959
He'd be our master.
He'd eat us out of house and home.

685
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,365
He'd spread fleas
from the garret to the basement.

686
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:09,394
And he'd attach himself to me.
Ho, they always do. And I won't have it.

687
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,407
- But, Mr. Chairman, I promise...
- No.

688
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:13,602
No filthy, flea-bitten creature's
gonna share my bed and board.

689
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:15,611
- This whole idea is ridiculous.
- But, Mr. Chairman, I...

690
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,704
Lillie, don't you see
where this is leading us?

691
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:20,409
If we start throwing our money away like this,
the next thing they'll want is...

692
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:22,645
ponies, roadsters, trips to Hawaii.

693
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:24,687
You tell 'em
it's out of the question.

694
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:27,223
I think, dear, we can rely
on the good sense of the children.

695
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,555
- After all, a five-dollar dog
is not a trip to Hawaii.
- But, Lillie...

696
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:32,595
- Question.
- Vote! Vote! Vote!

697
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:36,223
No, no! This whole thing's out of order.
If I'd known what you were up to, I'd...

698
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,961
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
- All those in favor...

699
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,333
- Aye!
- Ayes have it!

700
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:44,532
No. No. I still say no. No!

701
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:46,542
- The ayes have it, dear.
- But, Lillie...

702
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,875
The meeting's adjourned.

703
00:43:50,947 --> 00:43:52,938
A dog.

704
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:04,492
Mmm.

705
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:06,529
<i>Dad was right.</i>

706
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:09,463
<i>There were 14 Gilbreths</i>
<i>in the house, but Mr. Chairman...</i>

707
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:14,732
<i>for thus was he christened... soon dispelled all</i>
<i>doubt as to which Gilbreth was his favorite.</i>

708
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:23,072
<i>In no time at all,</i>
<i>they were bosom companions.</i>

709
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:31,749
<i>- There was no end</i>
<i>to Dad's determination to save time.</i>
- Ready? Go.

710
00:44:31,822 --> 00:44:36,816
<i>And in these experiments, large or small,</i>
<i>Mother was always at his side...</i>

711
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:39,088
<i>a partner in every enterprise.</i>

712
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:41,494
- Stop. How long was that?
- Seven seconds.

713
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:44,227
Good. Now we'll do it
the other way.

714
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:46,235
- Ready?
- Go.

715
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:56,769
That was better... only five and a half seconds.

716
00:44:56,847 --> 00:45:00,613
- By jingo, I knew it.
Bottom to top, that's the answer.

717
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:04,017
<i> Along with Dad's,</i>
<i>Mother's fame as a psychologist...</i>

718
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:07,420
<i>and industrial consultant had grown also...</i>

719
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:12,951
<i>To such an extent that people came</i>
<i>from far and wide to solicit her help.</i>

720
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:19,168
- Mrs. Gilbreth?
- Yes?

721
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:22,933
I'm Amelia Mebane.
I wonder if I could talk with you for a moment.

722
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:24,997
I'm very busy. If...
If you could tell me...

723
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:29,273
- Well, I'll only take a moment of your time.
- Well, won't you come in?

724
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:31,337
Thank you.

725
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:37,814
- In here, please.
- I understand you're very civic-minded,
Mrs. Gilbreth.

726
00:45:37,888 --> 00:45:40,152
I believe in being
a good citizen, yes.

727
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,157
- Wort you sit down?
- Thank you.

728
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:45,558
- You lecture too, I hear.
- Occasionally.

729
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:47,859
- Now, just what is it you wanted to...
- Well, it's...

730
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:49,865
It's about birth control.

731
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,128
Birth control?

732
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:54,796
Yes. The National League
of Planned Parenthood...

733
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:57,431
is organizing a local chapter
in Montclair.

734
00:45:57,507 --> 00:46:01,238
- I was told that you'd be interested.
- I?

735
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:05,179
I met a friend of yours on the train last night...
a next-door neighbor, I believe.

736
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:08,115
She felt that you were just the person
we're looking for.

737
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:11,051
She was sure you'd be willing
to cooperate.

738
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,386
Well, just how would you want me
to cooperate?

739
00:46:14,457 --> 00:46:17,915
Why, by being the moving spirit
behind our Montclair chapter.

740
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:19,985
That's a pretty big job,
isn't it?

741
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:22,463
Oh, yes.
Yes, there's work to be done.

742
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:26,491
That's why I'm appealing to you...
a civic-minded career woman with a...

743
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:30,974
and this is most important... with a large house
where one can hold meetings.

744
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:35,370
Well, of course,
I'll have to consult my husband.

745
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:39,006
Oh, is he interested
in good works too?

746
00:46:39,082 --> 00:46:42,882
Oh, yes. I think he'll be
very interested in this.

747
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:45,944
- Excuse me. I'll call him.
- Certainly.

748
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:55,331
- Can you come into the living room
a moment, dear?
- I'm awfully busy, Lillie.

749
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:58,458
But we have a guest, dear.
A lady from New York...

750
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:00,730
who wants me to be the head
of the local birth control organization.

751
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:03,136
Of the what?

752
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:06,539
Shh.
It's a pretty big job, dear.

753
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:08,975
Oh, indeed.

754
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:14,881
Well, in that case, Lillie,
let's go.

755
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:22,251
Mrs. Mebane,
this is my husband, Mr. Gilbreth.

756
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:24,919
- How do you do, Mr. Gilbreth?
- A pleasure, madam.

757
00:47:24,994 --> 00:47:28,828
It's a great pleasure to meet
a woman engaged in such a noble cause.

758
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:32,334
Thank you. And it's a pleasure
to find a man who thinks it <i>is</i> noble.

759
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:36,930
Usually we find the husbands so much less
sympathetic with our aims than the wives.

760
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:39,998
You'd be surprised at some
of the horrible things men have said to me.

761
00:47:40,076 --> 00:47:43,307
- Yes, I can imagine.
- And yet, if you could see, as I have...

762
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:46,644
relatively young women
growing old before their times.

763
00:47:46,716 --> 00:47:49,082
Ah, a pity.
A great pity.

764
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:52,644
- Excuse me, Mrs. Mebane, just a moment.
- Why, of course.

765
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:01,858
- Why, how odd.
What's he doing, Mrs. Gilbreth?

766
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:03,865
- Whistling.
- Oh, yes, I know.

767
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,834
- But why?
- Oh, he frequently whistles.

768
00:48:06,903 --> 00:48:08,837
- Uh...
<i>- Gangway!</i>

769
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:13,603
- Come on, Jackie.
- Hurry up, there. Pick up your feet.

770
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:17,373
Make it snappy. Where's Frank?
He's always late. Come here, Frank.

771
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:19,506
- Now, then. Are we all assembled?
- Yeah.

772
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:23,814
Fourteen seconds. By jingo, I knew
you could do it. It's a new world's record.

773
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:26,378
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- Yeah, what'd you call us for?</i>

774
00:48:26,456 --> 00:48:28,856
I want you to meet
a very important lady.

775
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,416
Now, come with me, children.
Watch your manners.

776
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,429
Children,
this is Mrs. Mebane.

777
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,227
How do you do? How do you do? Hello. Hello.

778
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,863
- I... don't quite understand. Is this a school?
- No, it isn't a school.

779
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:47,535
Then it's... No. Oh, no.
Yes, they <i>are.</i>

780
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,976
- They are what, madam?
- They're yours. Don't try to deny it.

781
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:54,710
I shouldn't think of denying it, madam.
Let me introduce the family, at least most of it.

782
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:57,480
- Seems to me there should be
some more of them around here.
- Heaven help us.

783
00:48:57,554 --> 00:49:00,079
Lillie, how many head of children
have we now, would you say offhand?

784
00:49:00,156 --> 00:49:02,920
Well, the last time I counted them, dear,
there seemed to be an even dozen.

785
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:05,517
- A dozen?
- I may have missed one or two, but not many.

786
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:07,620
I'd say twelve
was a pretty fair guess.

787
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:12,031
- Disgusting. And within 18 miles
of national headquarters too.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

788
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:14,592
- Shall we have some tea?
- Certainly not. Good day.

789
00:49:14,671 --> 00:49:16,605
- Good day, madam.
- Good day.

790
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:19,506
It looks to me as though
somebody's been pulling my leg!

791
00:49:19,576 --> 00:49:24,275
- How revolting.
- And within 18 miles
of national headquarters too.

792
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:32,048
<i>Our summers, we spent at Nantucket...</i>

793
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:34,988
<i>in a cottage</i>
<i>and two abandoned lighthouses.</i>

794
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,686
<i>Dad had named it "The Shoe"</i>
<i>in honor of Mother...</i>

795
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,527
<i>who, he said, reminded him</i>
<i>of the old woman who lived in one.</i>

796
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,727
Come on, slowpokes.
Last one in is Kaiser Bill.

797
00:49:46,803 --> 00:49:49,067
There you go, young lady.

798
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:52,039
You boys look out after her.

799
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:54,599
Come along, Anne, Ernestine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

800
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:57,510
You know how your father feels
about the primitive life.

801
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,514
- Now, be good, children.
- We will.

802
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:01,516
You'd think Dad
invented this ocean.

803
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:04,712
Andy.

804
00:50:04,787 --> 00:50:07,221
Look. Is that Tom Black?

805
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:15,789
It certainly looks like him.

806
00:50:15,865 --> 00:50:18,800
It is.
He's the lifeguard.

807
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,335
Oh, I can't imagine
what he's doing <i>here.</i>

808
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:33,075
Well, he has to keep in condition
for swimming somewhere, doesn't he?

809
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:36,778
Oh, yes. But here...
in Nantucket.

810
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:40,186
Leave your towels here, children.

811
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:42,190
Air.

812
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:45,887
- Wonderful air. Ho-ho.
- Oh, now, Frank, please don't overdo it.

813
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:48,931
- You know what Dr. Burton said.
- That quack? He can't scare me.

814
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:50,966
My heart's as good
as his any day. Better.

815
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:53,059
But this water's always cold.
It's a shock.

816
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,798
A good dip in the ocean never hurt anybody.
Hurry up. Get your robe off.

817
00:50:55,872 --> 00:50:59,399
- Let's go, kids.
- Come on, girls.

818
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:02,103
- The sooner we get this over with, the better.
- You go on ahead, Mother.

819
00:51:02,178 --> 00:51:04,476
- We'll be in in just a few minutes.
- All right. But don't be long.

820
00:51:04,547 --> 00:51:06,538
We won't.

821
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:22,957
- Why don't we stroll by and speak to him?
- Why should we?

822
00:51:23,032 --> 00:51:25,330
Well, after all, we see him
at school, don't we?

823
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:30,896
Yes. We see him,
but he doesn't even know I... we exist.

824
00:51:48,491 --> 00:51:53,019
Flaming youth. Heh. Look at them!

825
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:01,597
Fine spectacle:

826
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:04,162
Bobbed hair, rolled stockings,
painted knees.

827
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,765
I don't know what's
coming over girls today.

828
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:10,904
Don't they know what's going to happen
to them if they go around looking likeJezebels?

829
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,178
- Frank, that word's "Eskimo."
- "Jezebels" I said, and "Jezebels" I mean.

830
00:52:15,251 --> 00:52:17,515
But that's the way
everybody dresses today.

831
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:21,785
Everybody but Ernestine and me.
Why, we're... we're freaks.

832
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:24,759
Freaks or not,
you're not going around with bare knees...

833
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:27,318
for all the boys to ogle...
not while I'm alive.

834
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:31,992
- Boys don't ogle
when everybody dresses that way.
- Don't tell me what boys ogle.

835
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:35,265
I was young once myself. And I'd hate to tell
you what would have happened in my day...

836
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:37,602
if girls had dressed like
some of these girls do today.

837
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:40,369
- What?
- Never you mind what.

838
00:52:40,443 --> 00:52:44,539
But, Mother, what's wrong
with the way girls dress today?

839
00:52:44,614 --> 00:52:49,313
- Is it a crime to try to look
as attractive as you can?
- That isn't the point, dear.

840
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:53,685
Men... that is, nice men... don't want to marry
girls who make themselves cheap.

841
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:56,054
They may run around with them
before they're married...

842
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,889
but when they settle down,
they want someone they can respect.

843
00:52:58,961 --> 00:53:01,486
Well, they certainly respect me.

844
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:04,158
I'm the most
respected girl I know.

845
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,600
- Why, they respect me so much,
they won't even look at me.
- Me either.

846
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,970
- That's too bad.
- Honestly, Dad, how do you expect us
to ever be popular?

847
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:13,975
Popular! Popular!

848
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:16,841
That's all I hear.
That's the magic word, isn't it?

849
00:53:16,913 --> 00:53:18,972
That's what's the matter
with this generation.

850
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:20,982
Nobody thinks about
being smart or clever.

851
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,416
Huh. No, sir.
They just want to be pop-ular!

852
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:26,284
- Huh.
- But, Dad, if you'd only be reasonable.

853
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:30,587
For the last time, no.
I'll not have any fancy women in my family.

854
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,594
If other people want to go to the devil,
that's their business.

855
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:34,653
But you're not going with them.
Is that clear?

856
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,664
It oughta be.
We've heard it often enough.

857
00:53:36,732 --> 00:53:41,692
Otherwise you'll find yourself right in that
convent... the one with the 12-foot wall.

858
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,103
Mother, what are we gonna do?

859
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,505
Go back and have your swim, dear.
I'll talk to your father.

860
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:49,306
- Oh, but, Mother, you...
- I know, dear. I understand.

861
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:52,142
- Now, you girls run along.
- I don't feel like going in, Mother.

862
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:55,309
- I'll help you with the table.
- All right, dear.

863
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:57,375
<i>I want it back. You said I could have it.</i>

864
00:53:57,453 --> 00:54:01,389
<i>- Give it to me!</i>
<i>- No, you don't.</i>
<i>Come on and catch me, if you want it.</i>

865
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:03,925
- But it's my turn to play with that ball.
- If you want it, get it.

866
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:07,724
- Andy, button me, will you, please?
- "Button me."

867
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:10,357
That's all I hear
from morning till night.

868
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:13,231
It's, "Andy, button me up,"
or "Andy, unbutton me."

869
00:54:13,302 --> 00:54:16,965
- Aw, you're not mad.
- No, but I'm fed up.

870
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:19,337
Honestly, won't you ever learn
to button yourself?

871
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:21,672
You're pretty
when you're mad.

872
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,645
Oh, you little dickens. Go on. Get outta here.

873
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:14,729
Look out, convent. Here I come.
And I mean the one with the 12-foot wall.

874
00:55:14,797 --> 00:55:17,664
- What have you done now?
- Nothing. It's what I'm about to do.

875
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:20,702
And I want you to know
I'm not doing this just for myself.

876
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:23,705
I'm doing it for you and Martha and Mary
and Lillian and Jane...

877
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:27,436
'cause I know you'll never be emancipated
until I pave the way.

878
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,774
What are you talking about?
Oh, Anne, you're not.

879
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:32,746
I've got to, otherwise
we'll all go to our graves old maids...

880
00:55:32,815 --> 00:55:35,750
still wearing cootie garages over our ears
and long drawers.

881
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:38,286
- Oh, but Dad'll murder you.
- You'll back me up, won't you?

882
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:41,152
Of course I will.
But who's gonna back Dad up?

883
00:55:41,223 --> 00:55:43,418
Someone's got to
take a stand somewhere...

884
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:45,619
and I've made up my mind...
I'm going to.

885
00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:47,663
- Oh, but, Anne...
- There!

886
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,995
Oh, no.

887
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:53,001
- What is it, Dad?
- Whatcha got?

888
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,004
Now, hold your horses. Keep your shirts on.
You remember I promised you children...

889
00:55:56,072 --> 00:56:00,509
there'd be no formal studying this summer...
no language lessons or schoolbooks.

890
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:03,238
But I've discovered a way to teach you
the Morse code without studying.

891
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:05,872
- Oh, Dad, do we have to?
- Not if you don't want to.

892
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:09,213
But those who don't are gonna be sorry.
Yes, indeedy.

893
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:12,152
I've painted the code on the bathroom wall...
the one that faces you.

894
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:14,655
Now, you don't have to make a project
of studying it, but, uh...

895
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:17,659
you'll be surprised how much
you'll absorb each day when...

896
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:20,127
- Who's that?
- It's a telegram. I'll get it.

897
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:22,994
It's all right, Frank. It's probably for me.
I'll go. Hold that.

898
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:25,158
- Let me see it.
- I will. Just a minute.

899
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:27,259
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

900
00:56:27,336 --> 00:56:30,066
- Martha, will you call
Anne and Ernestine, please?
- Yes'm.

901
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:36,310
There we are. Thank you, Jed.

902
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:38,870
- 'Twas no bother. How's the family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

903
00:56:38,948 --> 00:56:40,939
Good. Glad to see you
back, Mr. Gilbreth.

904
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:42,951
- Thank you very much.
- Be seeing you.

905
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:46,216
Right.

906
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,587
<i>Don't poke it so hard.</i>

907
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:51,752
<i>Get down, Fred.</i>
<i>You want to break it?</i>

908
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:56,060
- What is it, dear?
- A cable from Bleneim in Prague.

909
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:59,659
It seems the management conference program
is filled without me.

910
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:03,172
- Oh, Frank, really?
- Bleneim says he's still working...

911
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,639
but for me
not to count on it.

912
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:09,667
He's trying to let me down easy,
but I gather there's a general lack of interest.

913
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:13,739
I'm sorry, dear. But don't be too disappointed.
There'll be other conferences.

914
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:17,513
I suppose I was counting on it
too much, Lillie, but...

915
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:20,750
Well, no use crying
over spilt milk.

916
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:24,816
- You go ahead with dinner. I'll be right in.
- All right, dear.

917
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:28,888
<i>Hey, see what you've done?</i>

918
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,490
<i>It's just a screw. Here, I'll fix it.</i>

919
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:33,501
<i>You better</i>
<i>before Daddy sees it.</i>

920
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:35,503
<i>There.</i>
<i>Now it's all right.</i>

921
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:37,505
<i>- Let me work it.</i>
<i>- Wait a minute!</i>

922
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:40,337
Leave that alone, now,
children. Sit down.

923
00:57:40,409 --> 00:57:42,400
Come along.

924
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:46,471
I'll take those,
Mrs. Monahan.

925
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:54,555
- Where's Anne?
- She's coming up, Mother.

926
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:56,990
Come along, dear.
We're rea...

927
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:58,993
Anne,
what have you done?

928
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,552
- Look at yourself.
- Oh, I have looked at myself, Mother.

929
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:05,089
Please don't ask me to look again.
I don't want to spoil my appetite.

930
00:58:05,168 --> 00:58:08,865
- But your hair. Your beautiful hair.
- What's the matter with her hair?

931
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:10,872
Take that ridiculous wig off.

932
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,704
- It's not a wig. I've cut my hair.
- You've what?

933
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:16,210
You can kill me if you want to,
but I've done it.

934
00:58:16,279 --> 00:58:18,839
I think it looks snaky.
Besides, it's more efficient.

935
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:22,373
- I'll bet she can fix her hair now in 15 seconds.
- Fix what hair?

936
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:26,217
- She hasn't any hair left to fix.
- Anne, how could you do this to yourself?

937
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,553
Herself? How could she do it
to an Airedale?

938
00:58:28,624 --> 00:58:31,388
Well, I won't have it.
I want it grown back fast.

939
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,157
I'm not gonna grow it back. I don't care
what you say. I'm sick of being a freak!

940
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:39,634
- Anne, come back here. Anne?
- Let her go, dear.
After all, it isn't such a tragedy.

941
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:43,331
- All the girls her age
are bobbing their hair now.
- But I distinctly told her...

942
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:46,068
But you forget. She's growing up.
She's no longer a child.

943
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,076
She has to make some
decisions for herself.

944
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:51,204
- Nevertheless, I'm not gonna have her
defying me...
- Please, come and have dinner.

945
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,249
I'll talk to her
after we've had time to think this over.

946
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:59,345
- But, Lillie, if we start letting
the children do as they please...
- Please, dear, for my sake.

947
00:58:59,422 --> 00:59:02,914
Well, all right, Lillie, but...

948
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:11,266
<i>By the time vacation was over...</i>

949
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:13,393
<i>and we were on our way</i>
<i>back to Montclair...</i>

950
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:15,403
<i>Dad was reconciled.</i>

951
00:59:15,471 --> 00:59:18,440
<i>My bobbed hair had been a bitter pill</i>
<i>for him to swallow...</i>

952
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:21,340
<i>but like all fathers</i>
<i>from the beginning of time...</i>

953
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,470
<i>he gulped and swallowed it.</i>

954
00:59:37,293 --> 00:59:41,059
<i>- What's that?</i>
- Oh. Hello, Daddy. Come on in.

955
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:43,121
You might as well know
the worst. I...

956
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:45,827
I bought these with my own money
and I'm going to wear them.

957
00:59:45,902 --> 00:59:48,803
Oh, no, you're not. You're gonna
take them back where you got them.

958
00:59:48,871 --> 00:59:51,999
- They embarrass me even to look at them.
- Oh, but, Dad...

959
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:55,373
Do you mean to tell me this is all
the underwear women put on nowadays?

960
00:59:55,444 --> 00:59:58,777
But they don't show.
Besides, Dad, everybody wears them now.

961
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:01,146
If you don't believe me,
you can come and see for yourself.

962
01:00:01,217 --> 01:00:03,151
That won't be necessary.

963
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:06,052
Oh, Daddy, please
be sensible. You...

964
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:10,616
You don't really mean I have to
take them back? Not really, do you, Dad?

965
01:00:10,693 --> 01:00:14,356
- Do you?
- Well, all right.

966
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,694
But no silk stockings and high-heeled shoes.

967
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:19,462
I'm not gonna have a lot of doctor bills
because of foot trouble.

968
01:00:19,535 --> 01:00:21,765
Thank you, Dad.
And while we're both in the mood...

969
01:00:21,837 --> 01:00:24,237
you might as well know
it's a little late for that now.

970
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:27,174
I've been wearing them
ever since we came home from Nantucket.

971
01:00:27,243 --> 01:00:29,575
- Now, Anne...
<i>- Andy! Andy, telephone!</i>

972
01:00:29,645 --> 01:00:33,877
<i>- It's a boy calling!</i>
- A boy? Excuse me, Dad!

973
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,113
Come back here.
I'm not saying you can wear those things.

974
01:00:37,186 --> 01:00:40,417
- Better hurry up before he gets away.
- Who do you suppose it is?

975
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:43,981
- Yeah, who could be calling <i>you?</i>
- Shut up.

976
01:00:45,528 --> 01:00:48,190
Hello.
Oh, hello, Joe.

977
01:00:48,264 --> 01:00:50,459
Fine, thank you.

978
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:55,266
What? Oh, I'd love to.
You will?

979
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:58,102
8:00? Oh, that would be
simply wonderful.

980
01:00:58,174 --> 01:01:00,472
Thank you for calling.
Good-bye.

981
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,774
You see, Dad? I told you
if I started dressing like the other girls...

982
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:06,314
- everything would be all right.
- Who was it, dear?

983
01:01:06,382 --> 01:01:09,840
Joe Scales. He's asked me
to the senior prom Friday night.

984
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:13,616
- It's <i>the</i> dance of the year.
- Why, how lovely, dear. I'm so glad.

985
01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:15,623
Who's Joe Scales?
Is he nice?

986
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:19,183
Well, he comes from an awfully nice family,
and he's a cheerleader.

987
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:23,721
- He's got his own car too.
- Two fine recommendations.
What about a raccoon coat?

988
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:27,462
- Oh, he'll probably get that next year
when he goes to college.
- Gee!

989
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:30,562
Come on. I've got to decide
what I'm gonna wear. It's formal.

990
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,336
- Just a minute. Friday night, you say?
- Yes.

991
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:37,743
Let me see.
Um, yes. That's all right. I can make it.

992
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:40,077
- You can make what?
- The dance, of course.

993
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:42,982
You didn't think I was gonna let you go out
by yourself with a cheerleader, did you?

994
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:46,488
Daddy, you wouldn't spoil everything
by doing a thing like that, would you?

995
01:01:46,555 --> 01:01:48,785
- What'll he think of me?
- That you're a sensible...

996
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:50,792
well brought-up child
with sensible parents.

997
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,590
Honestly, Dad, don't you trust
your own flesh and blood?

998
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:56,324
Of course I trust you.
I trust all my daughters.

999
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:59,459
- It's that cheerleader I don't trust.
- Oh, no.

1000
01:01:59,535 --> 01:02:03,494
- Now, make up your mind to it.
Either I go, or you don't.

1001
01:02:03,572 --> 01:02:07,030
- Well, shall I tell him we'll go
in his car or ours?
<i>- His</i> car?

1002
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:11,170
Ho-ho, I should say not. I haven't seen it,
but I can imagine what it's like.

1003
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:13,374
We'll go in Foolish Carriage.

1004
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:15,679
Come on, Lillie.

1005
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:17,981
Oh, when you and the others
start going out...

1006
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:22,047
I just hope you appreciate
what I've had to suffer for you.

1007
01:02:44,246 --> 01:02:46,544
- Come on, Joe.
- Okay, baby.

1008
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:50,985
Is your pop ready?

1009
01:02:51,053 --> 01:02:53,783
- Great Caesar's ghost, Lillie,
it's Joe College in the flesh.

1010
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:57,314
- And if he "pops" me once more,
I'll pop him right back.
- Shh, dear.

1011
01:02:57,393 --> 01:03:01,591
- I think he's kind of cute, in a vest pocket way.
- Cute? Heh.

1012
01:03:01,664 --> 01:03:05,191
He looks like what might happen
if a pygmy married a bob-tailed penguin.

1013
01:03:05,267 --> 01:03:07,462
And look at that car.

1014
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:10,630
Well, don't worry.
You'll be riding in yours, not that contraption.

1015
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:14,437
Thank heavens for small favors.
I'd better bring Foolish Carriage around.

1016
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,946
Come on, children.
Come on.

1017
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:21,608
Boy, oh, boy.
You look good enough to eat.

1018
01:03:21,684 --> 01:03:23,948
And I'll bet you do. Get it?

1019
01:03:24,019 --> 01:03:26,419
"I'll bet you do... eat"?

1020
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:29,754
Wort you come in, Joe?
I'd like you to meet my family.

1021
01:03:29,825 --> 01:03:34,023
Sure, baby.
It'll be a pleasure.

1022
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:37,429
Now, you children behave yourselves.

1023
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,765
- Mother, this is Mr. Scales.
- Good evening, Mr. Scales.

1024
01:03:40,836 --> 01:03:43,270
- Hiya, Mrs. Gilbreth.
- I'm fine, thank you.

1025
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:46,240
- And these are Anne's brothers and sisters.
- Hiya, gang.

1026
01:03:46,308 --> 01:03:48,299
- Hi.
- This is quite a family.

1027
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:51,107
Yes. Will you excuse me, please,
while I get my wrap?

1028
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,842
Why, sure, baby. On the double quick, huh?

1029
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:57,875
- Wort you sit down, Mr. Scales?
- No, thanks. I'd rather stand.
We'll only be a minute.

1030
01:03:57,953 --> 01:04:01,514
- Well, just make yourself at home.
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

1031
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,558
- What's new, kids?
- Nothir.

1032
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:06,356
- Um, did you ever see a William Tell tie?
- Uh-uh.

1033
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:11,092
You didn't, huh? Well, you pull the bow,
and it hits the apple, get it?

1034
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:14,432
It hits the apple... the Adam's apple, see?

1035
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:16,994
Gee, you're the first cheerleader
we ever saw up close.

1036
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:19,563
- Yeah?
- How about showing us how you do a yell?

1037
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:23,373
- Andy and Ern taught most of'em to us.
- I don't mind if I do.

1038
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:26,414
- Do you know the old Montclair High rah?
- We know that one.

1039
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,973
Let's hit it.
Let me get rid of my hat.

1040
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:31,315
- I wanna hear you holler, get me?
- Yeah.

1041
01:04:31,387 --> 01:04:36,086
- Ready?
- Rah! Rah! Rah, rah, rah!

1042
01:04:36,158 --> 01:04:40,959
Rah, rah, Montclair! Rah, rah, Montclair!
Hoo-rah! Hoo-rah!

1043
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,726
<i>Oh, you Montclair!</i>

1044
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:47,257
- Psst. Psst.
<i>- Gee, I wish</i>
<i>I could be a cheerleader.</i>

1045
01:04:47,336 --> 01:04:51,136
<i>- You gotta get elected.</i>
<i>- But don't you have to practice?</i>

1046
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:54,176
<i>- I don't know. It just comes natural.</i>
- The car won't start.

1047
01:04:54,243 --> 01:04:56,177
- What'll I do?
- Go in his car.

1048
01:04:56,245 --> 01:04:59,214
Do I look like a chicken
waiting for a place to roost?

1049
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:02,307
He isn't very big.
I don't think anything will happen to Anne.

1050
01:05:02,384 --> 01:05:04,614
Maybe if you warn her
to come home early.

1051
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:08,589
I said I was going and I am,
even if it has to be in that insane calliope.

1052
01:05:08,657 --> 01:05:12,525
- Daddy, have you metJoe?
- Uh, not yet, I haven't.

1053
01:05:12,595 --> 01:05:16,258
All set, huh?
Mighty fancy, I'll say.

1054
01:05:16,332 --> 01:05:20,132
- This is my father, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gilbreth.

1055
01:05:20,202 --> 01:05:23,933
- Good evening, young man.
- I hear you kind of go in
for this time-saving racket.

1056
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:25,940
I manage to make
a fair living.

1057
01:05:26,008 --> 01:05:30,707
- I got a few ideas
I'd like to talk to you about sometime.
- That would be a great pleasure.

1058
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:34,146
- We're late. Don't you think we ought to go?
- Let's shake that thing.

1059
01:05:34,216 --> 01:05:36,446
- Good night, gang. Good night, Mrs. Gilbreth.
<i>- Good night!</i>

1060
01:05:36,518 --> 01:05:40,784
- Good night, Mr. Scales.
Have a good time, dear.
- We will, Mother.

1061
01:05:40,856 --> 01:05:42,790
I know it's not
your fault, Lillie...

1062
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:44,849
but things would have been
a whole lot easier...

1063
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:47,054
if you'd taken my advice
and had all boys.

1064
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:50,587
I'm sorry, dear.
I'll try to be more careful with the next dozen.

1065
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:55,069
Boy, is that a car!
I bet you he can do 50 in it.

1066
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:57,401
What's so wonderful about that?
Fifty's not so fast.

1067
01:05:57,473 --> 01:06:00,909
- Yeah? Well, I'd like to see you do it, fatty.
- You shut up.

1068
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:02,910
Shh!

1069
01:06:02,978 --> 01:06:05,469
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, dear.

1070
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:07,481
How's about the little old
rumble seat, pops?

1071
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:09,642
You know the old saying, "Two's company."

1072
01:06:09,718 --> 01:06:13,916
I'm well acquainted
with that expression, young man.

1073
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:16,082
- You all right, Dad?
- Dandy.

1074
01:06:16,158 --> 01:06:18,991
And now, if you'll be good enough
to keep it down to a dull roar, let's go.

1075
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:21,393
Right!

1076
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:36,367
- Special delivery for Mr. Frank Gilbreth.
- I'll sign for it.

1077
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,514
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1078
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:42,573
Good night.

1079
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:47,688
- Who's it from?
- It's postmarked "Prague."

1080
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:50,156
- Mother, it's the invitation.
- Oh, I hope so.

1081
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:53,956
- Go on, Mother. Open it.
You know Dad would want you to.
- Yes, go on.

1082
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:57,260
- But I hate to open anyone else's mail.
- Oh, but this is different.

1083
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:00,825
- Yes, I suppose he wouldn't really mind.
- Of course he wouldn't.

1084
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,370
Listen.
"Dear Gilbreth...

1085
01:07:07,443 --> 01:07:10,037
"the board of directors
of the International Management Conference...

1086
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:12,945
"have voted unanimously
to extend to you an invitation...

1087
01:07:13,015 --> 01:07:14,949
to speak at their forthcoming meeting
in Prague."

1088
01:07:15,017 --> 01:07:18,612
- Oh, Mother.
- "At the same time, I am reliably informed...

1089
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,678
"a similar invitation
will be extended to you...

1090
01:07:20,756 --> 01:07:24,522
to address the World Power Conference
in London. Bleneim."

1091
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:27,960
- Gee, and Dad just missed it.
- I wish I could get this to him somehow.

1092
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,760
- Couldn't we telephone him?
- There's no telephone in the gym.

1093
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:35,031
- You hop on your bicycle
and run down there and give it to him.
- Okay, Mother. Sure.

1094
01:07:35,104 --> 01:07:37,538
That's a good boy.

1095
01:07:37,606 --> 01:07:40,666
Wouldn't you give anything
to see Daddy's face when he reads it?

1096
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:42,768
Yes, dear, anything.

1097
01:07:42,845 --> 01:07:46,303
Well, unfortunately, I can't ride a bicycle.

1098
01:07:55,724 --> 01:07:59,421
- Hiya, Joe. Hi, Anne.
- Hiya, fellas. Here you are, sonny boy.

1099
01:07:59,495 --> 01:08:02,464
What held you two up?
Kinda early to start neckir, ain't it?

1100
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:05,523
- Shh. Lxnay. Lxnay.
- Oh, excuse me, sir.

1101
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:07,626
<i>Hello, Anne. Hi, Anne.</i>

1102
01:08:10,038 --> 01:08:11,972
Gee, it's her father.

1103
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,498
- What's he doing here?
- Chaperoning Anne. Isn't it a scream?

1104
01:08:15,577 --> 01:08:19,980
The way that cookie's looking tonight,
she <i>needs</i> chaperoning.

1105
01:08:26,422 --> 01:08:28,356
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, pal.

1106
01:08:28,424 --> 01:08:31,257
- Where'd you get the hand-me-downs?
- Easy. Don't bruise the material.

1107
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:33,385
Hey, Joe, who's
the third wheel?

1108
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:35,664
Yeah, you said it.
Third wheel is right.

1109
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:39,756
You see, Dad? Everybody's talking.
I don't know why boys even bother with me.

1110
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:43,066
Well, I know, if you don't,
and that's exactly why I'm here.

1111
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:46,869
- Don't you sort of feel like...
like what they said... a third wheel?
- Yes.

1112
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:49,342
That's what I'm gonna
keep on being.

1113
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:51,402
I might not be able
to whip some of these fullbacks...

1114
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,471
but if I see any of them
start taking liberties...

1115
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:56,176
at least I'll be able
to run for help.

1116
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:58,981
All set, baby? Come on.
Let's give it the old hips.

1117
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:02,046
So long, pop.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1118
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,616
"Pop."

1119
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,330
- Lipstick, honey?
- No, thanks.

1120
01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:17,633
Do me a favor, will you, sugar?
Look in my bag and hand me my perfume.

1121
01:09:17,706 --> 01:09:21,335
Sure, Debby.
Oh, what a darling bottle.

1122
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:25,140
- Well, go ahead. Help yourself.
- Oh, I don't think I should. I never use perfume.

1123
01:09:25,213 --> 01:09:29,809
You don't? Why, I'd simply die
before I'd go out without my perfume on.

1124
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:33,946
Why, I'd feel positively naked.
Go on. Put a little behind your ear.

1125
01:09:34,022 --> 01:09:38,584
Well, maybe just a dab won't matter.
Oh, it's wonderful, Debby.

1126
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,390
A little old boy I met
in New Haven sent it to me.

1127
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:45,695
You know something? I just got to meet
your daddy. I think he's so cute.

1128
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:48,736
All the girls at school do.
I could just eat him up.

1129
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:51,363
That's nice, but he's kind
of old-fashioned, you know.

1130
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,034
Then I'll just adore him,
'cause I'm awfully old-fashioned myself too.

1131
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,271
Maybe it's 'cause
I was born in Mississippi.

1132
01:09:57,345 --> 01:09:59,438
You got to be old-fashioned
to be born in Mississippi.

1133
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:03,245
But you will be careful, won't you, Debby...
about the perfume and lipstick and everything?

1134
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:08,221
Now, don't you worry, honey. My daddy's
the same way... always carryir on about me.

1135
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:12,124
But I notice he doesn't carry on
when it's someone else's daughter.

1136
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:24,463
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Oh, Anne.

1137
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:27,997
Dad, I'd like you to meet one of my
very dearest friends, Deborah Lancaster.

1138
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:30,010
- She's from Mississippi.
- How do you do?

1139
01:10:30,078 --> 01:10:33,275
I've just been dying to get somebody
to introduce me, Mr. Gilbreth.

1140
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:36,875
Why, I've been hoping to meet you
ever since you started visiting our school.

1141
01:10:36,952 --> 01:10:40,547
Is that so? Well, well.
I'm delighted. Delighted.

1142
01:10:40,622 --> 01:10:42,556
So, you're from
Mississippi, are you?

1143
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:45,491
Yes, sir. I'm just a little old fugitive
from a plantation.

1144
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,494
Pardon me.

1145
01:10:47,562 --> 01:10:49,496
- Hello, Debby.
- Hello, honey.

1146
01:10:49,564 --> 01:10:52,089
- Dad, this is Tom Black.
- How do you do?

1147
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,568
- How are you, Mr. Gilbreth?
- I'm very well, thank you, young man.

1148
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:58,367
- At least I was.
- I'm sorry. How about a dance?

1149
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,374
- You mind, Dad?
- Not at all.

1150
01:11:00,442 --> 01:11:05,209
- I'm sure this young lady and I
will have a very pleasant time.
- We won't be long.

1151
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,249
- Hey, what have you done to yourself?
- Nothing. What do you mean?

1152
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:10,807
You didn't look like this
in Nantucket last summer, baby.

1153
01:11:10,885 --> 01:11:15,083
- How would you know what I looked like?
You never even noticed.
- Well, I'm noticing you now...

1154
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:17,147
and I <i>mean.</i>

1155
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:22,730
If you'd rather be out there dancing,
don't let me detain you.

1156
01:11:22,797 --> 01:11:26,324
Oh, no, Mr. Gilbreth.
I'd much rather sit this one out with you.

1157
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:29,598
Anne tells me you've just been
revolutionizing industry...

1158
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,970
just saving millions of dollars
in time and things.

1159
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:35,407
- By jingo, that smells good.
- Do you like it?

1160
01:11:35,477 --> 01:11:39,208
A little old boy from New Haven
sent it to me. But I mean,

1161
01:11:39,281 --> 01:11:42,409
What does anybody want
to save all that time for, Mr. Gilbreth?

1162
01:11:42,484 --> 01:11:45,385
So as to be able to sit here and talk...

1163
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:47,944
to a...
Pretty little lady like you.

1164
01:11:48,023 --> 01:11:52,460
Why, I declare. Anne didn't tell me
she had such a gallant daddy...

1165
01:11:52,527 --> 01:11:54,461
and so good-looking too.

1166
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:57,794
- I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
- You'd be surprised...

1167
01:11:57,866 --> 01:12:00,096
at the things other girls
are saying about you.

1168
01:12:00,168 --> 01:12:03,399
Why, they're only hopir you'll come
to all our dances from now on.

1169
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:05,405
Is that so?
Well, if I'd known that...

1170
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:07,737
I'd have started comir sooner.

1171
01:12:07,809 --> 01:12:11,643
There just gonna hate me
if they don't get to meet you too. You mind?

1172
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:15,171
Oh, no. No. Of course not.
Bring 'em over. As many as you like.

1173
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,651
Oh, thank you, sugar... I mean...
Excuse me, Mr. Gilbreth.

1174
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,713
Now, don't you go away, you hear me?
I'll be right back.

1175
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:41,572
- How about some punch?
- Oh, I'd love some.

1176
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:44,441
- Say, your old man sure is swell.
- Dad's really sweet, but...

1177
01:12:44,512 --> 01:12:48,972
Believe me, you've got to hand it to him,
coming here like this just to look after you.

1178
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:52,042
- I tried to get him not to, but...
- I'll get it.

1179
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,611
- Excuse me, Mike.
- Sure, Tom.

1180
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:57,157
Hope you like pineapple.

1181
01:12:57,225 --> 01:13:01,389
- I do.
- I mean, where are you gonna
find fathers like yours today?

1182
01:13:01,463 --> 01:13:03,693
- Sure bet you're proud of him.
- Proud of him?

1183
01:13:03,765 --> 01:13:06,757
If I ever have a daughter,
I'm sure gonna watch after her.

1184
01:13:06,835 --> 01:13:09,065
You aren't gonna catch me
letting her run around...

1185
01:13:09,137 --> 01:13:11,628
by herself with guys,
you know, trying to act funny.

1186
01:13:11,706 --> 01:13:13,970
- You aren't?
- You wouldn't catch me marrying anybody...

1187
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:16,033
whose folks let her
act like that either.

1188
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:19,171
- You wouldn't?
- Oh, a fella likes
to run around with 'em, maybe...

1189
01:13:19,247 --> 01:13:21,738
just for a good time
before he gets married, but...

1190
01:13:21,816 --> 01:13:24,842
when it comes to settling down,
none of these flappers for me.

1191
01:13:24,919 --> 01:13:29,720
- I want a girl I can respect.
- Why, that's funny.
That's what my mother says.

1192
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,692
Believe me, baby, she's right.
I've been around, and I know.

1193
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:36,162
Well, of course it does make a girl
feel awfully good...

1194
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:38,699
to know that her parents
care what she does.

1195
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,758
Sure makes you stop
and think, all right...

1196
01:13:40,835 --> 01:13:43,895
an important man like Mr. Gilbreth
sitting in there all by himself...

1197
01:13:43,972 --> 01:13:46,167
not even dancing,
just watching.

1198
01:13:46,241 --> 01:13:51,144
- I... I was just about to ask him to dance
when you came over.
- Yeah? Well, come on.

1199
01:13:51,212 --> 01:13:55,308
I guess I can spare one dance. But just one,
you understand. The rest are mine.

1200
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:57,317
- What aboutJoe Scales?
- That wet smack?

1201
01:13:57,385 --> 01:14:01,583
- After all, he is my date.
What am I gonna do with him?
- Throw him back, baby.

1202
01:14:01,656 --> 01:14:03,886
He's too small to keep anyhow.

1203
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:10,230
Look!

1204
01:14:24,212 --> 01:14:29,115
- I can't believe it.
- Well, what do you know? Say, not bad, either.

1205
01:14:29,184 --> 01:14:31,175
- Come on. Let's dance.
- No, wait a minute.

1206
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:34,380
- I have an idea something
tremendous has happened.
- Yeah? What?

1207
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:38,688
- Oh, you wouldn't understand,
only I guess it's my salvation.
- I don't get it.

1208
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,491
- It's too deep for me.
- I'll tell you someday. Excuse me.

1209
01:14:44,165 --> 01:14:46,429
Excuse me.

1210
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:49,265
- Excuse me, Dot. May I cut in, please?
- Oh, certainly, Anne.

1211
01:14:49,337 --> 01:14:52,500
- I just love dancing with you, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Thank you, young lady.

1212
01:14:52,574 --> 01:14:57,307
- Well, I hope you haven't been too lonely, Dad.
- Oh, no. I've managed.

1213
01:14:57,378 --> 01:14:59,642
Funny. I didn't know you could dance.

1214
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:01,944
There's lots of things
you don't know, young lady.

1215
01:15:02,016 --> 01:15:04,348
- Maybe you ought to congratulate me.
- What for?

1216
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:06,649
After all, it isn't every girl
in Montclair High...

1217
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:08,951
whose father can be
the belle of the ball.

1218
01:15:09,023 --> 01:15:12,754
I wanted to show friends of yours
they're not the only ones who can dance.

1219
01:15:12,827 --> 01:15:14,818
- Your mother and I...
- Okay, Dad. I understand.

1220
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:17,797
Now, let's be honest.
They're not really bad kids, are they?

1221
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:19,857
I suppose they're all right,
after their fashion.

1222
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:23,893
And you're not really gonna tag along with me
every time I go out, are you?

1223
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:25,906
We'll decide that
when I get back.

1224
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:28,306
I won't be able to tag along
while I'm in Europe.

1225
01:15:28,376 --> 01:15:30,640
In Europe?
But I thought you werert going to Europe.

1226
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:32,839
Oh, yes.
I'm gonna speak in London as well as Prague.

1227
01:15:32,914 --> 01:15:35,041
- When did you find out?
- The invitation just came.

1228
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:37,846
- Your mother sent it over by Frank.
- Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.

1229
01:15:37,919 --> 01:15:40,149
Now, Anne, dear...
Anne, don't get emotional.

1230
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:43,156
If you're gonna toddle with me,
by jingo, let's toddle.

1231
01:15:43,224 --> 01:15:46,716
Okay, Dad. Let's go.

1232
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:03,199
Thank you.

1233
01:16:21,195 --> 01:16:23,686
- Are you sure you have everything, dear?
- I think so.

1234
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:26,700
- Both your speeches?
- Right here in my briefcase.

1235
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:29,760
- How about your pills?
- Enough to last a lifetime.

1236
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:33,568
- You'd better hurry then.
You haven't much time.
- Be right with you.

1237
01:16:35,577 --> 01:16:38,068
Anne? Ernestine?
Come along, girls.

1238
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:40,637
- Your father's ready to leave.
<i>- We're coming.</i>

1239
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:43,047
- Frank, you'd better take his suitcases.
- Yes, ma'am.

1240
01:16:43,117 --> 01:16:47,076
- Mother, why can't we go
to the station with Daddy?
- Yeah, I wanna see the train.

1241
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:49,646
When I get back,
I'll show you lots of trains.

1242
01:16:49,724 --> 01:16:52,955
But I don't intend to start off to Europe
wringing wet with tears.

1243
01:16:53,027 --> 01:16:55,018
- You know how I feel about good-byes.
- Dad?

1244
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:57,030
- Yes?
- Here's something for you...

1245
01:16:57,098 --> 01:17:00,090
- but don't open it till you get on the boat.
- More socks?

1246
01:17:00,168 --> 01:17:03,626
Whose idea was it
for me to learn to knit in the first place?

1247
01:17:03,705 --> 01:17:06,902
Okay, I plead guilty.
Thank you, dear.

1248
01:17:06,975 --> 01:17:12,379
Well, I better get started. Trains don't wait,
you know. Come on, kids. Let's go.

1249
01:17:12,447 --> 01:17:16,110
- Come along, children.
- Don't forget to send postcards
from England and Czechoslovakia.

1250
01:17:16,184 --> 01:17:19,210
It won't hurt you kids
to write me now and then either.

1251
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:21,983
I don't see why we never get to go
on a boat to Europe.

1252
01:17:22,056 --> 01:17:24,456
After all, Dad, they come
cheaper by the dozen.

1253
01:17:24,525 --> 01:17:27,289
Ah, not for Eskimos.

1254
01:17:27,362 --> 01:17:29,626
I'll leave the car
at the garage downtown, Lillie.

1255
01:17:29,697 --> 01:17:31,961
This darn carburetor's
acting funny again.

1256
01:17:32,033 --> 01:17:33,967
- They'll send it back.
- Yes, dear.

1257
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:37,527
Well, good-bye, dear.

1258
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,674
Good-bye, Frank.
Take good care of yourself.

1259
01:17:40,742 --> 01:17:44,678
Don't worry about me. And if anything
comes up and you need me, cable me.

1260
01:17:44,746 --> 01:17:48,307
I'll take care of the work here.
You just forget it and enjoy yourself.

1261
01:17:48,383 --> 01:17:50,317
I will.

1262
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,921
Come here, young lady.

1263
01:17:54,989 --> 01:17:57,856
You gonna be a good little girl and eat
your spinach for Daddy while I'm gone?

1264
01:17:57,925 --> 01:17:59,859
Make you big and strong.

1265
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:01,861
And that goes
for you too.

1266
01:18:01,929 --> 01:18:03,863
- Good-bye, Lillie.
- Good-bye.

1267
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:05,865
- Good-bye, girls.
- Good-bye, Daddy.

1268
01:18:05,933 --> 01:18:07,924
- Ernestine.
- Good-bye, Dad.

1269
01:18:08,002 --> 01:18:11,028
Anne.
Never mind about you three.

1270
01:18:11,105 --> 01:18:13,596
You children behave yourselves.
Do what your mother tells you.

1271
01:18:13,675 --> 01:18:16,439
I'll be back in a couple of months.
Good-bye, Mr. Chairman.

1272
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:20,971
I guess I can count on you to keep
the bed warm while I'm gone. Ha, ha, ha.

1273
01:18:21,049 --> 01:18:22,983
Mighty fine dog.

1274
01:18:23,051 --> 01:18:24,985
Good-bye. I'm gonna
miss you so much.

1275
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:28,284
A little more attention to books
and a little less to that swimming champion...

1276
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:30,586
and you'll stand a better chance
of getting into college.

1277
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:33,456
- I'll work on it, Dad.
- That's my girl. Lillie?

1278
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:35,462
- Good-bye, dearest.
- Good-bye, dear.

1279
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,464
- Have a good time.
- I'll try.

1280
01:18:37,532 --> 01:18:39,966
Bring us some souvenirs, Dad.

1281
01:18:42,036 --> 01:18:45,267
- Take good care of your mother
and don't forget to write.
- We will.

1282
01:18:45,339 --> 01:18:47,933
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye! Good-bye!

1283
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:50,000
Good-bye!

1284
01:19:02,757 --> 01:19:07,285
Hello? Oh, hello, Dad.
Hey, where are you?

1285
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:09,352
Yes, sir. She's upstairs.

1286
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,059
- Oh. Okay, I'll call her. Hey, Mother!
<i>- Yes?</i>

1287
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:16,365
Dad's on the phone. He forgot somethir.
He wants to talk to ya.

1288
01:19:16,437 --> 01:19:19,736
<i>- I'll be right down.</i>
- Okay. She's comir, Dad.

1289
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:24,141
Have a good time, now.
Yes, sir. I will. Good-bye.

1290
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:27,670
- He's at the Montclair station.
- Thank you, dear.

1291
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:29,979
- Don't be late for lunch.
- I won't.

1292
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:33,486
Hello, Frank.

1293
01:19:33,554 --> 01:19:37,115
Hello? Hello?

1294
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:40,490
<i>Hello,</i> Frank.

1295
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:43,928
Operator.

1296
01:19:43,998 --> 01:19:47,263
Operator,
are we still connected?

1297
01:19:47,335 --> 01:19:50,862
Well, that's funny.
No one answers.

1298
01:19:50,938 --> 01:19:54,897
Hello? Hello?

1299
01:19:54,976 --> 01:19:57,342
Frank?

1300
01:19:58,412 --> 01:20:00,403
Frank!

1301
01:20:08,723 --> 01:20:11,283
- Anne.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Benson.

1302
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,090
- Your mother wants you
to come home, dears, right away.
- What is it? What's happened?

1303
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:18,690
Your father was taken ill at the station.
I'm afraid it's his heart.

1304
01:20:18,766 --> 01:20:21,530
- Is it... Is it bad?
- I don't know how bad, dear.

1305
01:20:21,602 --> 01:20:24,571
Mrs. Monahan said you were shopping
and asked me to find you.

1306
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,665
- Frank's playing ball. Do you know where?
- The school grounds, I guess.

1307
01:20:27,742 --> 01:20:30,734
I said I'd pick him up too.
Come on. Let's get in.

1308
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:48,051
You children better go on in.
I'll park in my driveway.

1309
01:20:59,908 --> 01:21:02,502
How... How is he,
Mrs. Monahan?

1310
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:06,570
Oh, Andy.
Our daddy's dead.

1311
01:21:31,139 --> 01:21:33,130
Sit down, children.

1312
01:21:44,085 --> 01:21:48,215
I've called you older children together because
I think you ought to know the situation.

1313
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:50,780
There isn't going to be
a great deal of money.

1314
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:53,884
Most of it's had to go back
into your father's business.

1315
01:21:53,962 --> 01:21:56,760
I talked by telephone
to your grandmother in California...

1316
01:21:56,831 --> 01:22:00,562
and naturally she wants all of us
to move out there and live with her.

1317
01:22:00,635 --> 01:22:05,163
If it's a matter of money,
I plan not to go to college anyway. I'll get a job.

1318
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,505
- I don't want to go to college either, Mother.
- Wait until I've finished.

1319
01:22:08,576 --> 01:22:13,513
There's an alternative, but it hinges
on your being able to take care of yourselves...

1320
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:16,311
and it will involve sacrifices
from all of us.

1321
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:21,720
I want you to make the decision. I can go on
with your father's work, keep the office open...

1322
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:24,280
and that will mean
that we can keep the house.

1323
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:27,658
We'll have to let Mrs. Monahan go,
and live very simply.

1324
01:22:27,729 --> 01:22:31,859
- We couldn't letJim Bracken go, could we?
- Oh, he wouldn't go anyway.

1325
01:22:31,933 --> 01:22:35,369
No, I think we can manage
with Jim.

1326
01:22:35,436 --> 01:22:40,430
And if things work out the way I think they
will, Anne, you can go to college later on too.

1327
01:22:40,508 --> 01:22:44,740
- You know your father wanted
all of you to go to college.
- Don't worry about that, Mother.

1328
01:22:44,812 --> 01:22:49,511
Do you want to try it? Can you run the house
and look after things until I get back?

1329
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:52,348
- Get back from where, Mother?
- I'm going to Europe.

1330
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:56,481
I'm going to give those speeches
for your father in London and Prague.

1331
01:22:56,557 --> 01:23:02,120
We all know how much they meant to him,
and I'm sure that's the way he would want it.

1332
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:06,064
But as I say, the final decision
is up to you.

1333
01:23:06,134 --> 01:23:08,898
Oh, Mother, you don't have to ask us.
Why, you know...

1334
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,461
we'll do anything
as long as we can stay together.

1335
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:16,135
Thank you, dear.
I knew that's the way you'd feel about it.

1336
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:19,179
Well, since I'm gonna be
planning the meals from now on, I...

1337
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:21,181
I guess I better get started.

1338
01:23:21,249 --> 01:23:23,513
- I'll go over everything with Mrs. Monahan.
- Yes, dear.

1339
01:23:23,584 --> 01:23:27,315
And I'll see the house is kept nicely, Mother.
Just the way you like it.

1340
01:23:27,388 --> 01:23:29,379
- And I'll help her, Mother.
- We all will.

1341
01:23:29,457 --> 01:23:32,949
- Thank you, girls.
- Me too, Mother.

1342
01:23:35,229 --> 01:23:38,460
Maybe Bill and I better go down and see
some used car dealers...

1343
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:40,467
about sellir
the automobile, Mother.

1344
01:23:40,535 --> 01:23:44,062
You'd better tell them
to bring a tow car.

1345
01:23:44,138 --> 01:23:47,130
You know Foolish Carriage
never starts for anyone but Daddy.

1346
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:50,541
- Yeah, and sometimes
it wouldn't even start for him.

1347
01:23:50,611 --> 01:23:54,638
I'll do all the errands, Mother, and helpJim.
He's getting pretty old.

1348
01:23:54,716 --> 01:23:56,707
That's right.

1349
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:04,156
- Well, son?
- Yes, Mother.

1350
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:08,495
From now on, you'll have to be
the man of the family.

1351
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:10,656
Sure, Mother.
We'll handle things.

1352
01:24:10,732 --> 01:24:14,168
And we'll do a good job too.
You wait and see.

1353
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:17,170
Yes, son.

1354
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:19,172
I know you will.

1355
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,732
Anyhow, that's one mars opinion.

1356
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:15,726
<i>Yes, Dad, Gilbreth and Company will go on.</i>

1357
01:25:15,797 --> 01:25:18,664
<i>Mother and your even dozen</i>
<i>will see to that.</i>

1358
01:25:18,733 --> 01:25:20,963
<i>Mother will go to Europe,</i>
<i>and you'll be proud...</i>

1359
01:25:21,035 --> 01:25:24,698
<i>of the way she delivers</i>
<i>those speeches for you.</i>

1360
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:30,010
<i>And she'll go right on,</i>
<i>following in your footsteps...</i>

1361
01:25:30,077 --> 01:25:35,105
<i>to become the foremost woman industrial</i>
<i>engineer in the world and, by 1948...</i>

1362
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:38,516
<i>America's Woman of the Year.</i>

1363
01:25:38,586 --> 01:25:43,819
<i>But wherever you are,</i>
<i>Dad, somehow I'm sure you know that...</i>

1364
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:46,883
<i>and never doubted it</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>
