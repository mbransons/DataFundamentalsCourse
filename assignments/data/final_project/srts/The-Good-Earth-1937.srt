1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:39,871
This is the day!

3
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,483
Yes, yes, Loo! I'm up!

4
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:53,260
Quiet! Quiet! You'll wake father!

5
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,918
Here friend!

6
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:08,290
And eat a little bit more for once!

7
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:42,842
Morning medley!

8
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,719
Morning! Morning!

9
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,414
So today's the day!

10
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,063
The day! Hay hay!

11
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:54,465
Tomorrow's another world's waters

12
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,366
Another!

13
00:04:56,377 --> 00:05:02,565
I know! I know!
Who does it!

14
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:23,252
Shou Zheng! Where's my hot water?

15
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:27,398
My lungs are cold!

16
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,673
It's ready father.

17
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,526
I'm too old
to wait for my food like this.

18
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,359
Tomorrow a woman
will bring food to us both.

19
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,866
Yeah, she'll eat food too
and there's

20
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,268
little enough for any of us
until the harvest,

21
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:48,068
and if the rains don't come
there won't be a harvest!

22
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,788
Tea? Have you lost your mind?

23
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,756
Tea is like eating silver!

24
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:57,129
But this is the day father,

25
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,169
if the woman brings us luck,

26
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,002
we may never go hungry again.

27
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:04,115
Tea! Waste!

28
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,188
You think she'll be an ugly woman?

29
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,985
Hum! If things go on like this,

30
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,354
someday the bridegroom
would want to see

31
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:14,346
the bride before they marry them!

32
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,643
Well then
I won't have a pock mark woman!

33
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:18,982
Or the one with split lip!

34
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,891
Now then are you a farmer's son or not?

35
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,365
Your woman must work as your mother did.

36
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,301
And bear children like she did,

37
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:28,999
6 sons like mine!

38
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,645
Your tea will be cold.

39
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,512
True! True!

40
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,661
5 sons dided
in the years of flood and famine.

41
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:42,109
Your mother worked on
with me until she died.

42
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:45,116
Now I know that she was the one,

43
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,059
the best a man could have.

44
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,927
But I'll tell you one thing,

45
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,539
your woman is not deformed.

46
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:59,697
Thank you father!

47
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,584
Now there it is!
Water enough to bring a crop to fruit.

48
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,488
Must you waste it?

49
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,531
I haven't wash my body
all at once since the new year!

50
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,036
That won't do
starting a new woman like this!

51
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,610
Tea in the morning
water in all this wasting!

52
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:45,580
- Father?
- Well, what is it?

53
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,276
I'll be grateful to you if you...

54
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,765
would please you to ask my
friends for a feast tonight?

55
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,202
- No!
- A very small feast?

56
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,603
- It's only this one?
- No no no no no!

57
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:59,454
Spend for a feast, make way for a famine.

58
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,926
Good morning father Wong!

59
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:01,925
It's going to rain!

60
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,565
It is unlucky to mention it!

61
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,202
I haven't said it would rain!

62
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,838
I haven't said it!

63
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,037
Here's some very bad wine
for the bridegroom.

64
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,789
This gift is much too good for my son.

65
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,494
Oh is miserable wine!

66
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,073
Where's the bridegroom?

67
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:24,878
He's washing his whole body!

68
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,183
Is that my friend Wong Loong?

69
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:30,125
Shing! That's my son!

70
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:33,098
Wasting good water
before the rains come!

71
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,137
Uh but the rains will come!

72
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:38,052
And what's on
the top of the water to you,

73
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,561
a man who lives to see his grandson.

74
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:43,998
Young men and fools are alike,

75
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,868
until the gods teach them wisdom.

76
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:51,141
And asking your
few friends for a feast tonight.

77
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,821
A very small feast,

78
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:57,656
if you'll come my son will be honoured.

79
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:01,908
You were boys together. Shing!

80
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:08,429
This is the day!

81
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,831
Chickens! Good buy! Eat!

82
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,767
Good your blood and pure your liver!

83
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:51,917
Peaches, 6 for 2 coppers!

84
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,991
Now then what?

85
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,464
I'm Wong Loong, the farmer.

86
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,439
Well, and Wong Loong the farmer what?

87
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,443
I'm coming... I'm coming...

88
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:34,144
Are you seeing that?
I see you a fool!

89
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:39,208
There's a woman to be...

90
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,041
Ha ha ha! So you're he!

91
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:45,882
You're the bridegroom!
I thought you're the peddler!

92
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,559
Why do you bring a basket?

93
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,882
Are you gonna carry
that the whole day?

94
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,656
The bridegroom! He comes!

95
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:09,091
The bridegroom! He comes!

96
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:16,105
The bridegroom!

97
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:22,553
He's here! The bridegroom!

98
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:28,686
He's here! The bridegroom!

99
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:38,394
You fool, get up!

100
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:47,180
Your farmer's come,
he smells like a stable!

101
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,438
Nobody giggles!

102
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,940
Is all wreck crack yours?

103
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,172
Open it! Open it!

104
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,375
To see what's in it.

105
00:11:56,587 --> 00:12:02,554
There's a thief in every kitchen.

106
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,575
When did you steal these?

107
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:13,789
My mother gave'em to me.

108
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,833
Save it for your own brats!

109
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:21,002
Pick up your eggs! Hurry!

110
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:30,073
This dress, the kitchen slave.

111
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:41,448
This woman came into my house
when she was a child.

112
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:44,751
Her parents were farmers
but during the famine

113
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:48,025
they sold her to me for food.

114
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,774
She has a strong body,
and will work well

115
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:55,815
for you in your house
and your fields.

116
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,922
Take her and use her well!

117
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:05,712
Ou Lang! Over him!
And bring him many sons.

118
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:10,921
Bring the first son for me to see.

119
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:15,088
Well? Go go go go!

120
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,271
Take the box!

121
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:29,469
Peaches! Fresh peaches!
Good peaches are the friend!

122
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,805
Good your blood and pure your liver!

123
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,004
Peaches! Fresh peaches! Thank you!

124
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:38,132
Peaches! Fresh peaches!
They're yours!

125
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,296
Eat for yourself.

126
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,150
A tree will grow from the seeds.

127
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:03,849
Hey, hey! Let him be!

128
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,032
For very silent says she's a good cook!

129
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,531
An excellent cook!

130
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:14,090
I am an old man and I have never
tasted such food before!

131
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:15,955
Oh no it's very poor food!

132
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:21,663
Very badly prepared,
the woman can't cook at all!

133
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,608
My friends,

134
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,609
my poor farm barely
produces enough

135
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,753
to keep my family alive.

136
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:35,229
But tonight,
I rejoyce that my brother's son

137
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,781
has been favoured by him.

138
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:43,359
Are you, you, how beautiful it is,

139
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:47,593
and how pretty, nephew?

140
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:56,387
Forgive me!

141
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:03,643
Poor Zon! He faked and shaved

142
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,683
and hope we will all go home!

143
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,480
No no no no!

144
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,956
Your presence delights him!

145
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:17,129
Then we'll all stay till cockcrow!

146
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:25,735
May you have many grandsons!

147
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,236
And she might beg for the first one!

148
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:32,459
You want my old bones!

149
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:40,383
Brother, your joy is mine!

150
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:44,789
Nephew! Now that
the woman will work in the house,

151
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:49,438
you might help
your old uncle in the fields?

152
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,249
Alas I...

153
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,860
Good night!
Good night!

154
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,693
Good night!
Good night!

155
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:03,309
Good night!
Night! Night!

156
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:48,602
It will grow!

157
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:51,142
This is good land!

158
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:55,960
An old one,
my ancestors came here long ago!

159
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,852
And they sleep in it!

160
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,757
My father ploughed it,

161
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:04,934
and it's mine!

162
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:08,505
The best the man can have!

163
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:12,831
Now it belongs to us both!

164
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:21,354
It's raining!

165
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,551
Why did you put up your hand?

166
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:37,721
Were you afraid?

167
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,609
Afraid of me?

168
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:50,926
Were they cruel to you
in the Great House?

169
00:19:55,647 --> 00:20:01,614
No one will be cruel to you here!

170
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:41,440
I am with child.

171
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:55,268
Enough for the day,

172
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:01,759
We'll tell old father.

173
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,884
Why have you left the field?

174
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:27,498
She is with child already!

175
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,472
Hey hey! She want me to be a grandfather.

176
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:34,578
I shall prepare food now.

177
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:38,745
Yes! Food! Food! Food!

178
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,599
I know nothing of these things,

179
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:03,181
when the child is born you need a woman.

180
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,946
Perhaps there's a woman
in the Great House.

181
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,453
Someone you knew in the kitchen!

182
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:10,354
Not in that house!

183
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:15,403
Well...

184
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,638
we're only two men here!

185
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:20,179
There must be someone
in the Great House...

186
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:23,287
I'll never go back, in that house

187
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,655
It will be with my son in the house

188
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:28,765
I'll have a red coat on it,

189
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,199
and a red flower trousers,

190
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:35,791
and a hat with a buddha and tiger,

191
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:39,727
and I'll go into a kitchen where
I spend my days as a slave,

192
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:41,392
and into the great hall

193
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,576
where all the mistress
sits with their pipe

194
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:50,243
and I'll show myself
and my son to all of them.

195
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,344
Well!

196
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,857
You know, I...

197
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,260
I haven't heard you speak
so many words...

198
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:13,433
since you came into this house!

199
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:07,995
Now then, why are you
not in the fields today?

200
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,024
The wheat must be cut!

201
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:16,181
Today I shall not go into the fields.

202
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:50,528
Look! Dark clouds!

203
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:02,507
Rain? We'll loose the harvest!

204
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:05,236
We'll starve this winter!

205
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:09,444
Bring the others!

206
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:57,618
Hey hurry with the wheat!

207
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:20,341
There's hail in that storm! Let's go!

208
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:29,594
Help me load the cart!

209
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:22,922
What is it? Is it the child?

210
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,213
I get a woman.

211
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,385
No! Go back to the wheat!

212
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,257
I play my king correctly!

213
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,830
No you didn't!

214
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,834
You lost every game correctly!

215
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,981
Of course! How did I know what he had?

216
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:07,743
You might have looked over his shoulders.

217
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:09,965
But I didn't!

218
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:16,136
You gave me the wrong sign!

219
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:21,581
Hey! What did I tell you?

220
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,352
And you made me play another game

221
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:26,285
while this was happenning!

222
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,986
Is it a man? Is it a man?

223
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:56,285
A man! A man-child has been born!

224
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:59,536
Behold we have a son!

225
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,276
A man-child! A man-child!

226
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:06,459
I'm a father!

227
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,756
And you're a grandfather!

228
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,998
I never could get my wife to
work the way that woman did,

229
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,715
with a child about to be born.

230
00:33:18,884 --> 00:33:20,784
If it weren't indignified,

231
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,868
I'd tell her that she's a good wife!

232
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:26,874
Nephew! I rejoyce with you!

233
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,344
It's nothing that I lost my own wheat

234
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:35,517
helping with the child, nothing!

235
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:43,399
Hear him! Huh huh!

236
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:41,529
I'll get eggs, and dye them red

237
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,966
for the whole village.

238
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:47,611
Everyone must know I have a son!

239
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:51,775
Ha ha ha ha ha!

240
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,675
Oh my son is very pleased!

241
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,514
Oh it was a dismal noise!

242
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:20,687
No no! Very good noise!

243
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,510
Now then!

244
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:52,025
Those cakes are not to be eaten!

245
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,719
Well!

246
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:07,380
And I am poor
but at least I can be honest!

247
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,664
My dear nephew, please add this fowl

248
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,961
to the little coloured eggs

249
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:25,116
which you hadn't offered me!

250
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:28,366
But they are gift for the Great House!

251
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,856
Very bad for the stomach,

252
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:34,262
only fit for rich people,

253
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:36,438
if they are not too rich to accept them

254
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:40,078
Those people
are not as rich as you think!

255
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,080
They are feeling pinch this year.

256
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:46,464
I've heard that they are selling land.

257
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:48,868
Land? Selling land?

258
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:51,569
I heard it yesterday from their agent,

259
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:54,810
At the gambling, at the tea house.

260
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,514
Well, am I asked to fill my cup

261
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,391
in this house of properity?

262
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,505
Huh... please please!

263
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:14,091
Ha ha ha ha ha!

264
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:21,373
What have I not thought of...

265
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:28,861
A good new year, a triumphant new year!

266
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:33,514
Good night!
Good bye!

267
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:43,099
We could buy land, from the Great House!

268
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:46,245
Rice land!

269
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:49,918
Now then, if we lost our wheat

270
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,489
we'll have no money.

271
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:54,024
But we haven't!

272
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,788
But how close it was!

273
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:58,003
Between this money and nothing

274
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,911
Not even food!

275
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,685
When a man has 2 fields, or 3 fields

276
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:09,755
he can loose his wheat
and still have food.

277
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:13,330
That rice land is sure!

278
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:18,201
Had to be sure again I'd even
go to the Great House and buy it!

279
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,227
Do you think They'd kill me?

280
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,769
Well, well! I'm not afraid!

281
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,000
I go to the Great House to say,

282
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:32,444
to tell'em I have important business.

283
00:39:32,649 --> 00:39:34,516
Money is concerned.

284
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,187
What is a fair price,
I have it in my hand!

285
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:49,015
Well it was a good thought

286
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,596
But what use is a good thought then?

287
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:56,764
If no one agrees with it?

288
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,680
And the child! A beautiful child!

289
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:18,987
A beautiful boy! Boo boo boo boo!

290
00:41:19,196 --> 00:41:23,137
Ha ha ha ha ha!

291
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,363
Here's the son of Wong Loong!

292
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:38,535
Here's the son of Wong Loong the farmer!

293
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,242
He's a man-child!

294
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:43,353
He's a man-child!

295
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:07,142
Miss Oh Lang,
Wife Wong the farmer and her son

296
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:11,825
you will announce them to ancient one.

297
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,666
And you say her child would be a female.

298
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:16,969
Ha ha ha ha! A female!

299
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:23,147
Quiet! I'll cut off your own hands!

300
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:27,859
Um! He has a sickly look.

301
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:30,560
Very pale and green.

302
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,651
Let's hope he won't die before Spring!

303
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,813
Ha ha ha ha ha!

304
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:37,349
Stop that cackles!

305
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:43,520
Hurry woman! Must I waste the whole day?

306
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:52,041
Hey hey hey!

307
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:56,340
He's a beautiful child!

308
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:59,303
He's a beautiful child!

309
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:02,480
Hey hey hey!

310
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,180
You won't believe she laughed!

311
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:06,685
And say he's a beautiful child!

312
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:10,090
She said those words
"a beautiful child"!

313
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:14,601
Well she said no more than the truths!

314
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:17,276
And I saw not
one slave in all that house

315
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:19,909
with a new coat like mine!

316
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,091
And why should you go about

317
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,096
like a wife of a common fellow?

318
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:29,268
I can afford a piece of cloth I think!

319
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:41,868
Now I have 2 fields!

320
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:44,993
I bought it today from the Great House!

321
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:48,993
- The land?
- They said it was less than an inch.

322
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:52,101
And took all that silver
as if it were nothing!

323
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,967
And the foolish clerks
who don't own a foot land

324
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:57,078
laughed the goose clack at me

325
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,375
'cause I couldn't write my name!

326
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:01,451
But I'll buy again and again!

327
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:03,682
Until my land is more than an inch!

328
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:09,203
Even in a house of a prince!

329
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:14,540
Look here farmer!
Someday all this will belong to you!

330
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:16,444
And you'll be a prince too!

331
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:21,286
And I'll buy more land
and more land and...

332
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:24,364
What a pity! We're so poor!

333
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,835
We have nothing!
And the child is nothing!

334
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:31,012
Yes yes! Is less than nothing!

335
00:44:31,214 --> 00:44:33,189
And it's only a female,

336
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:35,730
and it's covered with small pox as well!

337
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:40,569
Yes yes! Only a female,
and covered with small pox,

338
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:43,749
as well!

339
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:59,185
You mighty gods! You wise gods!

340
00:44:59,393 --> 00:45:02,229
You've been good to me, for many years

341
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:04,800
you've been good to this humble person;

342
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:08,944
I had only 1 field, now I have 5!

343
00:45:09,146 --> 00:45:13,484
I had only 1 child, now I have 3!

344
00:45:13,688 --> 00:45:17,321
My eldest son
planted his first rice today!

345
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:22,506
My youngest son
is big enough to lead the ox!

346
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:26,885
My third child is only a female,

347
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:33,094
but I won't reproach you for that!

348
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,780
Excuse me!

349
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,767
Now we haven't forgotten you!

350
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:47,273
We brought you
fine new rogues of red paper

351
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:49,886
so you won't forget me!

352
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:53,687
You send me rich harvest this year also

353
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:57,997
and you persuade my uncle,
to work a little now and then.

354
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,004
And not ask for money so often

355
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:03,340
And if he does,
please allow my husband to refuse him!

356
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:05,815
I'll do that anyway!

357
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:07,844
Very gracefully!

358
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:09,766
Wong Loong! Come up!

359
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:11,306
Wong Loong come up here!

360
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:14,481
Wong Loong!

361
00:46:15,117 --> 00:46:17,451
Wong Loong will know,
he'll know what it is!

362
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:20,183
Wong Loong! How would he know?

363
00:46:20,394 --> 00:46:23,127
He is as slow witted as my woman!

364
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:27,137
Hey hey! Well! And what now?

365
00:46:27,341 --> 00:46:30,313
Look! Look!

366
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,672
An army!

367
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,747
No! Virgins perhaps?
So many?

368
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:45,615
People from the North! But why?

369
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:48,055
There must be famine in the North!

370
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:50,356
They're going south where there's food!

371
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:51,898
Famine!? Ha ha ha!

372
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:53,604
What ideas you have!

373
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,066
The woman is right!

374
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,953
I have seen it before!

375
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:00,061
That's what happens
when a man has only 1 field!

376
00:47:00,263 --> 00:47:01,892
But I have 5!

377
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,799
We must thank the gods
for giving me so much foresight!

378
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:06,304
What talk is this!?

379
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:09,276
Forgive him!
My son he's young and stupid

380
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:11,075
and talks too much!

381
00:47:11,135 --> 00:47:17,102
It was famine that made me a slave!

382
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:28,911
It dries even if we carry it!

383
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:33,659
Well if the vines starve,
we'll all starve!

384
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:39,909
The wheats' gone! And the rice!

385
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:43,586
The more my fields
I have only this handful of beans!

386
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:47,751
Mother! Mother!

387
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:00,193
You know we're not thieves!

388
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:01,662
But the ox is mine!

389
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,202
We're hungry! Our children are hungry!

390
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:05,567
You should help us!

391
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,848
If I have money I would help you!

392
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:14,014
My nephew! You can sell your land!

393
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:19,305
Sell my land?
Yes!

394
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:28,277
But then the money is gone,
and the land!

395
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:31,722
At least we could
live well through the famine!

396
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,296
What good is this land now?

397
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:38,462
You're young,
you don't know what a famine is like!

398
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,906
My father knew years of famine,
but he kept the land.

399
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,395
I must keep it for my sons!

400
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,931
The earth is good,
if we work it would feed us.

401
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,238
But how am I to live?

402
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:51,411
How am I to live?

403
00:49:51,612 --> 00:49:53,907
Work! As I do!

404
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,344
I'll not rob my sons to feed you!

405
00:49:56,754 --> 00:49:59,099
You, you!

406
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,150
Must we go hungry
while you have land?

407
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:05,468
This land that you won't sell!

408
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:07,858
I'm not selling my land.

409
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:10,823
It's my life, it's mine!

410
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:13,967
I'll never sell it,
I'll dig up the earth

411
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:16,263
first and feed it to my children!

412
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:22,440
Yes! And you'll bury them in it!

413
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:32,637
He's my friend.

414
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:42,538
My friend!

415
00:51:43,357 --> 00:51:47,311
We're not hungry!

416
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,951
Mercy on me you powerful ones!

417
00:53:37,454 --> 00:53:40,791
I starve and my woman starve,

418
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:45,584
and there's no one
to give me a handful of rice!

419
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:50,885
There's one who has plenty,
but he's a rich man!

420
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:55,193
And rich's hardened the heart,
soften his heart

421
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:58,863
o powerful ones,
that he may give me a little

422
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:01,809
out of his abundance!

423
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:04,076
Would not a man sell his lands

424
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:07,315
unless he has foods
to give his children?

425
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:10,432
He has food! And I starve!

426
00:54:10,634 --> 00:54:16,598
He has food! And these good men starve!

427
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,930
Well, what?

428
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,913
You have food! We're starving!

429
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:34,440
You have food! Food!

430
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,708
I have nothing!

431
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:41,109
I dig for roots, for my children.

432
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:44,761
You have food hidden!
Food and silver!

433
00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:47,934
Food? Find it!

434
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:52,535
He's got it he's got it!

435
00:54:52,578 --> 00:54:54,107
Wong Loong has food!

436
00:54:54,213 --> 00:54:59,256
I told you, he has food!

437
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:25,621
But... it's earth!

438
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,967
It takes hunger, and it's warm.

439
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:50,244
Ching!

440
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:54,395
Hunger makes man mad!

441
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:08,904
Come come! You're little man now!

442
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:13,561
You won't cry!
Look! Your sister doesn't cry!

443
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:31,207
Little one she never cries now

444
00:56:31,408 --> 00:56:35,349
What is it? Why?

445
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,904
If you could have a little food

446
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:19,613
you'd have the strength
to bring the child

447
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:21,589
I'll find it.

448
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:22,816
Tomorrow I...

449
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:27,973
When have you had food?

450
00:57:30,524 --> 00:57:34,280
There's a thing in me that hurts,

451
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:37,398
and not hunger,

452
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:42,599
that a man has no words.

453
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:46,663
No words, but I know!

454
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:55,628
Oh Lang, the earth has forgotten us!

455
00:57:57,878 --> 00:58:03,845
The earth... I hate it! I'll sell it!

456
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:11,584
No! For a constant length! No!

457
00:58:11,794 --> 00:58:17,750
No not the land! Not the land!

458
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,933
We're ready nephew.

459
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,545
Are you safe?

460
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:33,046
Yes...

461
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,647
safe.

462
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:39,640
Huh! Another mouth to feed.

463
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:44,316
My poor man!
For the sake of your children,

464
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:47,130
we'll give you
a better price for your land

465
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:51,603
than you can get
anywhere else in these times.

466
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:57,543
We'll give you 12 pieces of silver.

467
00:58:57,753 --> 00:59:01,603
What? 12 pieces?

468
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:05,746
For all my land?

469
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:11,273
Huh! I...

470
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:13,974
I paid a 100 times that much!

471
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:18,688
But who was starving then?

472
00:59:18,895 --> 00:59:22,852
Please! Please!

473
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:40,816
And well you know I must sell.

474
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:46,977
No! Not the land!

475
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:52,317
We'll not sell the land.

476
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:57,655
We'll keep it, we'll go south.

477
00:59:57,962 --> 01:00:00,900
And when we return
we'll still have the land.

478
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:02,571
But I've arranged it!

479
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:05,539
I brought these men here,
you must sell!

480
01:00:05,745 --> 01:00:11,203
Is it your land?
Did you buy it bit by bit?

481
01:00:14,106 --> 01:00:19,573
The land is our life
and it's better to go south,

482
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:27,565
or die walking, than to give it to you,

483
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:30,739
for nothing!

484
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:44,210
What a pity! What a pity!

485
01:00:57,226 --> 01:01:03,079
How can you walk anywhere?
With the child?

486
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:08,248
The child is dead! Dead?

487
01:01:10,564 --> 01:01:13,000
But I heard it cry?

488
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:17,165
The child is dead!

489
01:02:23,715 --> 01:02:27,148
What do you say father, shall
we ride in this fire wagon?

490
01:02:27,353 --> 01:02:29,829
It ain't safe for your old back.

491
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,643
He said it crawls on these iron poles!

492
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:35,363
Grandpa says it's a god of fire!

493
01:02:35,572 --> 01:02:37,562
These wagons chained together.

494
01:02:37,773 --> 01:02:39,766
Do it again find a thing?

495
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:45,945
We sit in it while it walks off!

496
01:04:06,585 --> 01:04:08,282
With these mats we can build a home.

497
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:12,358
Well then get to work!
Get to work all of you!

498
01:04:14,034 --> 01:04:17,228
You'll look at me and listen!

499
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,965
Take the bowel in your right hand so

500
01:04:19,177 --> 01:04:23,242
and hold it out to everybody that passes

501
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:26,322
and cry out to them:

502
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:29,725
!A heart good sir!
A heart good lady!

503
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:33,024
A good deed and you shall prosper!

504
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:37,122
The small cash, a coin you throw away!

505
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:40,387
Feed us starving child!"

506
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:45,266
Have a kind heart!
A good deed that bring you fortune!

507
01:04:45,474 --> 01:04:48,310
The small cash the coin you throw away

508
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,574
give for the child died!

509
01:04:50,784 --> 01:04:53,551
Have a kind heard!
A good deed to bring you fortune!

510
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:55,750
The small cash feed the starving child!

511
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:58,318
Feed the good fortune!
Bring you a good heart!

512
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,074
Small cash for starving!
Poor little child!

513
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:03,516
Feed the good fortune!
Bring you a good heart!

514
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:08,686
Small cash for starving!

515
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,001
Hey hey! Have a kind heart good sir!

516
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:30,186
A good...

517
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:53,095
Well?

518
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:56,901
- And today?
- Nothing!

519
01:05:56,906 --> 01:06:00,201
No work of any kind!

520
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:02,679
For things a beast should do,

521
01:06:02,884 --> 01:06:07,349
there were a 100 men, fighting!

522
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,148
It would have been better to starve,

523
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:13,282
in our own land,
than to come to this great city,

524
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,578
where there's no work for a man's hands!

525
01:06:15,788 --> 01:06:16,778
It will come!

526
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:20,293
Now then must I wait
for my meat any longer?

527
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:23,465
Meat? Hey hey hey!

528
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,275
It's the first we've had
since we killed the ox!

529
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,042
You must have begged
from a prince today!

530
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:33,216
It's mine!

531
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:34,502
Where did you get meat?

532
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,938
I took it from an old woman!

533
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:43,109
You stole it? You thief!

534
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:47,527
Thief! Thief!

535
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:01,166
Meat is meat.

536
01:07:01,168 --> 01:07:05,074
Do we have to steal
or beg for it to live?

537
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:08,476
A man can't stand it here!

538
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:13,751
Our land is all in the north!

539
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:19,427
In times like this,
my parents found a way to go back;

540
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:25,450
they sold me to the old
mistress in the big house.

541
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:34,899
You could sell little one?

542
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:40,511
I would sell her, to take
you back to the land.

543
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,446
If it wasn't for me,

544
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,508
you would die before you'll sell her!

545
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:53,282
We won't sell her,

546
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:58,083
not if I spend my life
in this wilderness.

547
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:30,390
What is it? What happened?

548
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:40,065
He was pulling timber, he fell and died!

549
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:51,344
Where did he work? Where did he work?

550
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:56,484
At the great market!

551
01:09:19,742 --> 01:09:21,923
Where are these soldiers going?

552
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:24,841
They say there's a revolution coming!

553
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:29,396
Revolution? What is a revolution?

554
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:34,069
I don't know,
but it has something to do with food!

555
01:09:54,466 --> 01:09:57,907
Things are growing again.

556
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,374
You were a farmer?

557
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,245
I own land in the north!

558
01:10:03,452 --> 01:10:06,823
So did I! 10 years ago!

559
01:10:07,026 --> 01:10:08,689
Why don't you go back?

560
01:10:08,896 --> 01:10:12,111
You gotta have an ox!
You gotta buy seeds!

561
01:10:12,316 --> 01:10:15,082
You gotta live, till you make the crop.

562
01:10:15,287 --> 01:10:17,554
I tried saving up for 10 years,

563
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,823
I'll never get back,
and neither will you!

564
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:23,128
I'll get back!

565
01:10:23,338 --> 01:10:26,310
If I can pull that thing
I can pull a plough;

566
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,272
ox or no ox!

567
01:10:28,283 --> 01:10:31,811
Listen my brothers!
Before the peasants close my mouth!

568
01:10:32,022 --> 01:10:35,841
In a few days
China will be a free country;

569
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:38,980
the day of tyranny is over!

570
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:40,982
The revolutionary army is on its way;

571
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:43,281
they've been marching 30 miles a day!

572
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,517
Fighting in the rain in the north

573
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:47,027
Hey!

574
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:49,127
You hear him?
Yes!

575
01:10:49,336 --> 01:10:51,578
But what does it all mean?

576
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,824
It's raining in the north!

577
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:58,054
Everyday in the south
as come to revolution!

578
01:10:58,264 --> 01:11:01,591
All of China will soon be free!

579
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:03,822
Don't let them drag you from your homes;

580
01:11:04,032 --> 01:11:06,332
that famine has driven you off course!

581
01:11:06,538 --> 01:11:10,478
Soldiers! Soldiers!

582
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:26,042
Run! Soldiers!

583
01:12:30,858 --> 01:12:32,312
What is it? What is it?
Why you shouting?

584
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:35,568
It's free! The revolution's here!

585
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,037
China's a republic!

586
01:12:37,277 --> 01:12:43,187
Republic? What is a "republic"?

587
01:13:02,172 --> 01:13:03,231
Hey what do they want?

588
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:05,767
- Where are they going?
- Into the great house of Lang!

589
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:10,314
It's all over the city,
a man can do what he like!

590
01:17:46,396 --> 01:17:49,360
Aim! Fire!

591
01:18:34,284 --> 01:18:40,187
No! No! I was hungry! Mercy!

592
01:18:42,091 --> 01:18:48,059
No! I was hungry! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

593
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,637
Aim! Fire!

594
01:19:15,493 --> 01:19:18,898
Captain! Prepare to march!

595
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,061
Follow in!

596
01:19:24,622 --> 01:19:26,183
Let them be a warning to you!

597
01:19:26,723 --> 01:19:28,715
Free publicans are not bandits!

598
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,058
Order must be maintained
throughout the city!

599
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:35,835
You may go, but remember
anyone caught looting will be shot!

600
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:08,044
What haven't I seen?
What have I not seen!

601
01:20:08,252 --> 01:20:10,608
I could never tell you!

602
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:15,905
Such things! Crowds! Oh I got through!

603
01:20:16,114 --> 01:20:18,642
The city is mad!
They're robbing the rich!

604
01:20:18,852 --> 01:20:20,685
Killing'em and burning'em!

605
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,454
The soldiers have
come down from the north!

606
01:20:23,663 --> 01:20:27,634
Huh! It's well you were here,

607
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:30,735
it's well you were here!

608
01:20:37,773 --> 01:20:39,673
Look!

609
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:56,075
We can go back,

610
01:20:57,076 --> 01:21:00,576
we can go back to the land!

611
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,140
Home!

612
01:21:25,841 --> 01:21:27,641
We are home!

613
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:30,342
- Home!
- Home!

614
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:33,643
Come!

615
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:37,771
Hey! Down with you!

616
01:21:39,573 --> 01:21:42,807
Run to uncles home,
tell'em Wong is home!

617
01:21:43,013 --> 01:21:46,566
Tell all our friends,
tell'em I have great hungs!

618
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:52,732
Away with you! Ha ha ha ha!

619
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:03,692
This is yours! Thank you!
Take what you need!

620
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:09,701
Please! Take it all! The sack! All!
Thank you!

621
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:12,662
All! There's food for all
until the harvest!

622
01:22:12,863 --> 01:22:14,025
We'll have more crops!

623
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:17,297
Thank you! Bye!

624
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:22,176
If you need more, come back!
We have plenty!

625
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:26,849
- Ching!
- Wong Loong!

626
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:33,075
I see no face
in the city like yours, my friend!

627
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:37,337
These belong to you;
I kept'em in our house.

628
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:42,287
Kept them? But it was starving!

629
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,222
Why don't you sell them?

630
01:22:44,428 --> 01:22:45,862
I have no ploughs to...

631
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:49,036
But keep it!

632
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:52,068
Tomorrow I'll bring my ox and'em,

633
01:22:52,278 --> 01:22:54,373
to help plough your field!

634
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:59,235
I have no field, I had to sell it!

635
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:03,901
Sell them?
Well you can come and work for me!

636
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:11,892
I've had luck in itself,
I have the mind to buy more land!

637
01:23:12,096 --> 01:23:14,328
Will you come?

638
01:23:14,534 --> 01:23:18,497
I'll come gladly.

639
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:28,130
Nephew! Brother! My loved ones!

640
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,568
I predicted it! I predicted it!

641
01:23:30,778 --> 01:23:33,546
I always said
if those southeners had anything,

642
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:36,622
my nephew would bring it home with him

643
01:23:36,825 --> 01:23:39,021
But it's too late to help me,

644
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:41,557
I've had to sell my daughters

645
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:45,429
Well uncle,
anything you want and I have...

646
01:23:45,433 --> 01:23:47,623
Nothing, nothing.

647
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:51,224
Still, if you could let me
have a few pieces of silver,

648
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:54,629
2 or 3, say 4?

649
01:23:54,637 --> 01:23:57,174
4? Why? Take 10!

650
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:01,552
15! 20!
Why not?

651
01:24:01,754 --> 01:24:04,988
I have this and more! I have jewels!

652
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:07,488
Jewels!
A handful! All colours!

653
01:24:07,499 --> 01:24:11,351
Red ones white ones, come!

654
01:24:11,555 --> 01:24:13,510
I want to feel my toes
in the earth again!

655
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:16,748
- But there's something...
- Well?

656
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,688
Are you going to sell the jewels?

657
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,052
To buy the land?

658
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:25,725
Sell them? Why of course!

659
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:30,310
And what else would I do with them?

660
01:24:30,512 --> 01:24:35,130
If I could have 2, only 2 small ones,

661
01:24:35,337 --> 01:24:36,666
2 white ones...

662
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:39,333
The pearls? You?

663
01:24:39,343 --> 01:24:43,913
I wouldn't wear them,
I'm much too plain-looking.

664
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:47,558
Oh I've never noticed it.

665
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:53,227
But I could hold them
in my hands, sometimes.

666
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:20,589
Thank you!
It's nothing! Nothing!

667
01:25:20,799 --> 01:25:24,188
After all you, helped to find them.

668
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,460
And you must wear them, yes,

669
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:28,497
and you must dress in a way
becoming to them,

670
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:30,260
not as a poor farmer's wife!

671
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,903
We'll see to that!

672
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:33,369
We'll look after you!

673
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:35,705
We'll come and live with you!

674
01:25:35,914 --> 01:25:37,405
We'll rebuild the house!

675
01:25:37,617 --> 01:25:39,383
No this house is enough!

676
01:25:39,588 --> 01:25:41,022
But no we must make it bigger!

677
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:43,058
We must have rooms for a household!

678
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,952
No no we were happy here!

679
01:25:45,158 --> 01:25:46,179
We'll be happier!

680
01:25:46,389 --> 01:25:49,409
We'll have men in the fields,
slave in the house.

681
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,997
No slaves! Nothing!

682
01:25:52,205 --> 01:25:54,776
But you must have a slave
until you're well again.

683
01:25:54,986 --> 01:25:58,926
I'm well now, see!

684
01:26:02,768 --> 01:26:05,797
It's cured me; coming home.

685
01:26:06,008 --> 01:26:08,599
But you shall rest and have everything!

686
01:26:08,807 --> 01:26:10,928
We'll live well and in comfort,

687
01:26:11,136 --> 01:26:13,031
We'll be safe from hunger
as long as we live

688
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,102
Longer! Longer!

689
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:17,332
My nephew you're rich!

690
01:26:17,543 --> 01:26:19,673
You can live like a great lord!

691
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:25,848
Why you can even pick a second wife!

692
01:26:29,033 --> 01:26:32,265
Listen to him! Listen to him!

693
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:36,017
But why not? You have 2 oxens?

694
01:26:36,227 --> 01:26:39,927
No! No but come along!

695
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:22,310
<i>It is further agreed
that the above named seller,</i>

696
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:25,415
Wong Lung, shall deliver
to the respected merchant,

697
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:30,032
Liu Fong Kee, the set wheat
as and when same harvested

698
01:27:30,772 --> 01:27:34,949
Cost of transportation
to be born by the seller.

699
01:27:35,158 --> 01:27:37,686
It is agreed between
the above mentioned parties,

700
01:27:37,897 --> 01:27:41,098
that the price
of this wheat is to be as follows:

701
01:27:41,338 --> 01:27:44,565
"For each bushel of wheat,
4 pieces of silver

702
01:27:44,769 --> 01:27:46,595
In the event of damage to the crop,

703
01:27:46,799 --> 01:27:49,095
from storm, pest or other cause,

704
01:27:49,299 --> 01:27:51,632
the worthy purchaser, Liu Fong Kee,

705
01:27:51,836 --> 01:27:55,469
shall be held free
of any liabilities to accept this wheat"

706
01:27:55,677 --> 01:27:57,204
Read that last paragraph.

707
01:27:57,415 --> 01:28:00,250
Mr Wong, I'm delighted to pay you

708
01:28:00,454 --> 01:28:02,220
such a high price for your wheat,

709
01:28:02,425 --> 01:28:05,260
even though my profit might be slight.

710
01:28:05,465 --> 01:28:10,121
Very kind of you to buy my rigid grain.

711
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:13,485
The contract's ready father.

712
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:15,992
Well it is time.

713
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:17,667
But this contract is wrong!

714
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:19,201
This is the radical for wood,

715
01:28:19,405 --> 01:28:20,895
it should be the radical for water.

716
01:28:21,108 --> 01:28:22,338
Change it then.

717
01:28:22,545 --> 01:28:25,142
We'll not put our names
to anything wrongly written!

718
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:28,481
Mr Wong, 2 clever sons like these,

719
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:30,626
are the better half of your wealth!

720
01:28:30,827 --> 01:28:32,812
They're stupid worthless preachers,

721
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,349
If anything was driven
to their big bright skulls

722
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:37,041
it was by beating them!

723
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:39,817
I told that teacher to beat them!

724
01:28:39,826 --> 01:28:43,621
He beat them so well,
that this one's going to the university.

725
01:28:43,632 --> 01:28:46,192
- Indeed!
- If I'm not too unworthy.

726
01:28:46,203 --> 01:28:48,131
I hope to win a degree in agriculture!

727
01:28:48,342 --> 01:28:50,244
A degree!? Agriculture!?

728
01:28:50,277 --> 01:28:51,369
That's somekind of paper

729
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:53,411
that will make it rain just enough.

730
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:55,777
But not too much!

731
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:58,378
And you? You going too?

732
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:00,875
No sir! I'll stay on my father's land,

733
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:02,172
when my brother returns

734
01:29:02,415 --> 01:29:03,782
he'll show me
what more can be done with it

735
01:29:03,986 --> 01:29:05,011
than we have done!

736
01:29:05,188 --> 01:29:06,884
Now then that's talk enough,

737
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:11,084
take the money home.

738
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:30,437
My ignorant daughter!

739
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:31,699
A beautiful girl!

740
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,844
Oh she has a wretched appearance!

741
01:29:33,847 --> 01:29:37,247
Now you two might mix
your blood in one bowl!

742
01:29:37,453 --> 01:29:40,517
Oh but your daughter
is much too good for my son.

743
01:29:40,525 --> 01:29:44,658
Oh no! But you would never
come decend to such a marriage!

744
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:47,375
Oh but I couldn't presume
to look so high!

745
01:29:47,386 --> 01:29:50,557
It's impossible! Quite impossible!

746
01:29:50,758 --> 01:29:53,127
But, it might done.

747
01:29:53,297 --> 01:29:56,361
Yes indeed,
if you'll be good enough to consider it

748
01:29:56,571 --> 01:29:58,437
in due time.

749
01:29:58,441 --> 01:30:02,638
I should think of it
night and day, good bye!

750
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:04,444
It would be modest of me to say

751
01:30:04,454 --> 01:30:08,915
that this idea was mine.
Good bye!

752
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,636
Ah! What a beautiful day!

753
01:30:11,746 --> 01:30:14,843
That music! It seems to draw me

754
01:30:15,053 --> 01:30:19,016
inspite of myself!

755
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:20,345
- I'm not used to these places.
- Eh?

756
01:31:20,556 --> 01:31:23,040
I have no clothes!

757
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:24,716
I'm only a farmer!

758
01:31:24,918 --> 01:31:26,478
I have work to do...

759
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,660
Work? Work!

760
01:31:30,764 --> 01:31:33,702
You must learn to enjoy yourself!

761
01:31:33,904 --> 01:31:37,570
There's more in the world
than earth and crops,

762
01:31:37,778 --> 01:31:40,341
there're songs and dancing!

763
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:45,310
And girls who do these things elegantly!

764
01:31:45,515 --> 01:31:48,478
Watch!

765
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:21,387
That must be the stairway!

766
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:22,854
Yes.

767
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:26,355
- Shall we see what it feels like?
- No no no!

768
01:32:26,356 --> 01:32:27,956
No, I...

769
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:33,246
I've never been off
the ground all my life!

770
01:34:04,699 --> 01:34:10,656
She's like a dream person!

771
01:34:21,567 --> 01:34:25,769
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

772
01:34:25,975 --> 01:34:28,948
Quiet!

773
01:34:32,951 --> 01:34:35,707
I told the thing
not to wake me till this time.

774
01:34:35,911 --> 01:34:37,068
Another feast?

775
01:34:37,277 --> 01:34:40,443
The dragon feast, woman!

776
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,315
It's my duty to observe the old customs

777
01:34:43,523 --> 01:34:45,322
My nephew insisted on it.

778
01:34:45,327 --> 01:34:46,893
Old customs indeed!

779
01:34:46,897 --> 01:34:48,794
There's more than that with your nephew!

780
01:34:48,801 --> 01:34:50,867
When the farmer buys silk, robes

781
01:34:51,072 --> 01:34:52,905
and washes his whole body everyday,

782
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,237
there's a woman that should work!

783
01:34:54,246 --> 01:34:56,379
But the rich man may have 2 wives!

784
01:34:56,579 --> 01:34:58,903
But the wife must cling to her husband,

785
01:34:59,007 --> 01:35:00,626
that is as it should be

786
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:03,205
That's right!
A woman of love and one is mistake!

787
01:35:03,209 --> 01:35:06,074
Of course! Now then, it is said

788
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:08,343
you may see a tea pot with 4 tea cups,

789
01:35:08,553 --> 01:35:10,886
but did you ever
see a tea cup with 4 tea pots!?

790
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:12,890
It is also said,
do you ever see 2 spoons

791
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:18,562
in the same bowl
that do not nod against each other!?

792
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:26,429
Well What is it? What is it?

793
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:32,203
Excuse me father, but you look like
the lord of the Great House.

794
01:35:32,412 --> 01:35:37,720
Well! And that is not
as strange as you think!

795
01:35:37,924 --> 01:35:42,491
I just... tell your mother
I wish to see her.

796
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:46,152
Yes father. Can you spare me a moment?

797
01:35:46,363 --> 01:35:48,686
I must know what seed
to prepare for the Summer planting.

798
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:52,715
Why trouble me about it?
Prepare the seed my son gives you!

799
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:02,573
These flowers are dead, Little One!

800
01:36:02,644 --> 01:36:05,776
Your sister knows only happiness.

801
01:36:05,986 --> 01:36:10,437
Mother!
Is it a letter from your brother?

802
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,540
No mother! Father wishes to see you.

803
01:36:17,787 --> 01:36:20,252
Forgot how chilly it was!

804
01:36:22,563 --> 01:36:28,530
Are you well? Your pain, is it bad?

805
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:32,966
No it's nothing!

806
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:47,616
You sent for me?

807
01:36:48,194 --> 01:36:51,429
Well, there's a thing I've done,

808
01:36:51,634 --> 01:36:53,660
I bought the Great House!

809
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:55,840
The house of Loo!

810
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,522
Courts and land!

811
01:36:58,734 --> 01:37:02,689
I'm the new lord there.

812
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:07,976
Well? Have you no thanks?

813
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:10,978
I thought it would please you
to be mistress in that house,

814
01:37:10,986 --> 01:37:16,825
where you lived as a slave.

815
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:19,466
Our sons were born here...

816
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,289
They must have wives!

817
01:37:21,498 --> 01:37:23,517
We'll have grandchildren,

818
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:25,886
there's room in that house to all!

819
01:37:26,094 --> 01:37:30,808
You'll have a high place
with money to spend for slaves.

820
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:32,513
You must make yourself becoming to it!

821
01:37:32,717 --> 01:37:36,100
Look at your hair! Your clothes!

822
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:37,633
You disgrace me!

823
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:40,964
One would think you're still the
wife of a common labourer!

824
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:46,035
Wear the pearl you have.

825
01:37:46,244 --> 01:37:51,200
The pearls? I have them!

826
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:53,485
You would never wear them.

827
01:37:53,486 --> 01:37:55,386
Why...

828
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:59,827
I look at them sometimes.

829
01:37:59,829 --> 01:38:05,797
I need them, give them to me.

830
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:35,416
I know that I'm ugly,
and not to be loved.

831
01:38:40,535 --> 01:38:43,030
All that we have now came from you.

832
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:46,942
That is the truth and I say it.

833
01:38:47,149 --> 01:38:49,120
But, but now...

834
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:52,053
But now?

835
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:57,783
There's a woman, not such a one as you;

836
01:38:57,992 --> 01:39:02,652
not as good as you,
it's like a sickness!

837
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:07,301
When I'm with her, it's not enough!

838
01:39:07,502 --> 01:39:10,612
When I'm not with her, there's nothing!

839
01:39:10,826 --> 01:39:14,133
Even the land is nothing!

840
01:39:14,338 --> 01:39:19,801
Then it will be better
when she's in your house.

841
01:39:20,378 --> 01:39:22,237
You'll say that?

842
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:26,396
Is it your wish?

843
01:39:26,942 --> 01:39:29,412
Yes.

844
01:39:29,613 --> 01:39:33,348
Let it be then!

845
01:39:33,555 --> 01:39:39,523
Ou lang, what is there more to say?

846
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:45,668
Nothing.

847
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,650
Who is it?

848
01:40:36,385 --> 01:40:40,448
Who is that man going out the gate?

849
01:40:40,461 --> 01:40:46,571
He look something like my son, Lung!

850
01:41:20,101 --> 01:41:21,564
Now then what?

851
01:41:21,565 --> 01:41:23,318
I'm Ching the farmer.

852
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,324
Well, Ching the farmer what?

853
01:41:25,529 --> 01:41:27,864
I have business with Wong the farmer.

854
01:41:28,068 --> 01:41:29,628
Wong the farmer?

855
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:31,535
This is the great house of Wong!

856
01:41:31,743 --> 01:41:35,706
He's the lord here!

857
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:11,343
There's a bad woman in the house!

858
01:42:11,549 --> 01:42:14,383
There's a bad woman in the house!

859
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:17,558
Bad woman!

860
01:42:17,759 --> 01:42:19,894
Father, hush!

861
01:42:19,898 --> 01:42:22,165
It's his second wife.

862
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:24,602
I say it's a bad woman!

863
01:42:24,808 --> 01:42:29,010
I had but one woman...
and my father had but one woman,

864
01:42:29,066 --> 01:42:30,413
and we farm the land!

865
01:42:30,419 --> 01:42:36,603
Come father,
it's he and his second wife!

866
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:45,498
I'm tired, I want my tea.

867
01:42:50,925 --> 01:42:53,225
The old man is childish,

868
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:55,457
nobody listens to him,

869
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:59,092
but he shall be kept away!

870
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:01,622
I'm hated in this house,

871
01:43:01,826 --> 01:43:04,027
how can I be happy here?

872
01:43:04,032 --> 01:43:07,132
But... what can I do?

873
01:43:07,302 --> 01:43:09,774
I have to sit here, shut in all day,

874
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:11,307
if I stood out there they whisper

875
01:43:11,546 --> 01:43:14,210
and look at me hatefully!

876
01:43:14,418 --> 01:43:19,290
Where can I walk in the evening?

877
01:43:19,494 --> 01:43:24,440
If I had the garden,
if I had the garden all mine;

878
01:43:24,452 --> 01:43:27,787
with singing birds in the pavillion,

879
01:43:28,388 --> 01:43:31,788
the fountain too, with fish.

880
01:43:31,798 --> 01:43:35,100
But the money...

881
01:43:35,305 --> 01:43:39,498
- Then it's money that you love.
- No no! Little Flower!

882
01:43:39,514 --> 01:43:43,846
But it will not be
easy until the harvest.

883
01:43:43,853 --> 01:43:46,815
I must see, I must see,

884
01:43:47,014 --> 01:43:49,779
my younger son keeps the accounts.

885
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:53,585
But these're few little things.

886
01:43:53,788 --> 01:43:59,755
If you love me, if I please you.

887
01:44:01,571 --> 01:44:07,536
It shall be done! Anything! Anything!

888
01:44:08,113 --> 01:44:12,088
Be careful! My pearls!

889
01:44:50,782 --> 01:44:53,754
I may come in?

890
01:45:02,619 --> 01:45:04,486
Does my music disturb you?

891
01:45:04,723 --> 01:45:07,250
Oh no! No I like it!

892
01:45:07,462 --> 01:45:09,432
I listen sometimes.

893
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:11,728
I play it because I'm lonely.

894
01:45:11,737 --> 01:45:14,431
I have so much to talk and laugh,

895
01:45:14,643 --> 01:45:16,840
but there's no one.

896
01:45:17,047 --> 01:45:19,710
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry!

897
01:45:19,917 --> 01:45:21,510
You must excuse me, I...

898
01:45:21,511 --> 01:45:24,599
I have some business with
the grain merchants.

899
01:45:24,608 --> 01:45:28,934
- If you'll please I must go!
- Then you'll pass by the shops?

900
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:32,055
Yes?

901
01:45:33,058 --> 01:45:36,053
Would you mind
giving him these for a bottle?

902
01:45:36,264 --> 01:45:37,995
With silver?

903
01:45:38,201 --> 01:45:41,105
Why... Yes! Yes!

904
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:42,777
But you won't misunderstand.

905
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:44,771
Why should I?

906
01:45:44,775 --> 01:45:48,799
When a woman gives her slipper to a man?

907
01:45:49,002 --> 01:45:50,670
But I shouldn't tell you.

908
01:45:50,882 --> 01:45:53,184
Oh no please!

909
01:45:53,393 --> 01:45:59,367
Well then... it means
he's taking her fancy.

910
01:46:01,016 --> 01:46:05,013
But you ask me to have it guilded?

911
01:46:05,224 --> 01:46:08,248
But the bottle doesn't need guilding,

912
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:12,406
it's pure silver!

913
01:46:38,147 --> 01:46:39,776
Here's a letter from your brother,

914
01:46:39,984 --> 01:46:42,012
will you read it to me?

915
01:46:42,022 --> 01:46:46,185
Of course mother!

916
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:52,765
Now then, we'll hear
what our scholar has to say

917
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:57,631
"First, I am ashamed of my ignorance.

918
01:46:57,842 --> 01:47:02,206
But I am not ashamed
to inquire of my teachers.

919
01:47:02,409 --> 01:47:05,677
Each day I learn
new ways of bring about nature's

920
01:47:05,882 --> 01:47:10,347
facts in case
nature herself should fail us".

921
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:13,422
What does he say?

922
01:47:13,631 --> 01:47:17,092
He says
he's learning many things to help us.

923
01:47:17,306 --> 01:47:18,967
But is he happy there?

924
01:47:19,173 --> 01:47:20,864
Does he say he need anything?

925
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:22,762
No mother.

926
01:47:22,968 --> 01:47:25,957
"I miss my beloved
father and mother deeply.

927
01:47:26,168 --> 01:47:31,657
And I'm eager to share
the happiness of our new home".

928
01:47:33,466 --> 01:47:36,740
Mother, I want to go away too!

929
01:47:36,815 --> 01:47:37,612
Go away?

930
01:47:37,817 --> 01:47:40,014
To the wars! I'll be a soldier!

931
01:47:40,222 --> 01:47:43,192
Now then what madness is this?

932
01:47:43,393 --> 01:47:47,318
Well I've heard stories
of war and plunder and battle,

933
01:47:47,519 --> 01:47:49,006
and I hate this house!

934
01:47:49,218 --> 01:47:50,778
And I'll go!

935
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:56,956
I wish she'll stop that music!

936
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:21,690
Now this house is full of silences.

937
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:25,166
I was reading mother
a letter from the older brother.

938
01:48:25,469 --> 01:48:29,663
- Would you like to hear it?
- If he's well it can wait!

939
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:33,169
But there's more
in your face than the letter!

940
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:35,528
He'll be a soldier.

941
01:48:35,737 --> 01:48:39,571
A soldier! Now then,

942
01:48:39,775 --> 01:48:42,575
men don't take good iron to make an ail,

943
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,251
nor a good man to make a soldier.

944
01:48:45,453 --> 01:48:48,289
It would be a disgrace
to me a man of serving land

945
01:48:48,493 --> 01:48:50,689
to have a son who's a soldier!

946
01:48:50,896 --> 01:48:52,696
But I'm nothing in this house!

947
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:53,698
If you're lost in this house

948
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:55,494
go back to the land!

949
01:48:55,702 --> 01:48:57,598
Help Ching until the harvest.

950
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,660
Put an alert on yourself!

951
01:48:59,863 --> 01:49:01,489
That's good for any man!

952
01:49:01,697 --> 01:49:03,588
Well if the land
isn't fit for you anymore

953
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:05,363
it isn't fit for me!

954
01:49:12,252 --> 01:49:16,038
Now all these stuffes I don't know.

955
01:49:16,047 --> 01:49:20,580
He's come to the age of tempers
and weeping.

956
01:49:20,784 --> 01:49:23,404
When I was a lad I had no such tempers!

957
01:49:23,612 --> 01:49:25,579
You worked on the land;

958
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,749
but he's like a young lord!

959
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:29,682
And he's been alone here.

960
01:49:29,888 --> 01:49:32,050
And you worry his age to have a bride

961
01:49:32,258 --> 01:49:35,721
But I was given a sla...

962
01:49:35,934 --> 01:49:39,874
My marriage cost my father nothing!

963
01:49:40,075 --> 01:49:43,636
The boy's our son!

964
01:49:43,844 --> 01:49:49,500
He would be better dead
than here with this woman!

965
01:49:49,707 --> 01:49:53,670
What? You're dreaming!

966
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:11,095
Even she hears it who has nothing else;

967
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:15,228
it feels all this house,
that woman cause

968
01:50:15,236 --> 01:50:19,140
and she's bored
and your son is young...

969
01:50:19,144 --> 01:50:20,738
Enough!

970
01:50:21,148 --> 01:50:23,715
Gossip! Kitchen gossip!

971
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:25,413
That's where you came from!

972
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:28,289
Where you wished to live,
live there then!

973
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:31,923
Eat 'n sleep we will,
but between you and me

974
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:35,481
there's nothing! Nothing!

975
01:50:48,315 --> 01:50:52,286
The man is loon here.

976
01:50:55,549 --> 01:50:57,942
What are you doing in the house?

977
01:50:58,144 --> 01:51:01,802
There's work to be done in the fields.

978
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:05,973
But, what is it?

979
01:51:08,056 --> 01:51:10,027
You're weeping,

980
01:51:10,928 --> 01:51:15,428
and you must do it
and man can be sorry,

981
01:51:16,707 --> 01:51:18,608
But why do you weep?

982
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:21,465
There's food for everyday.

983
01:51:21,672 --> 01:51:24,634
And fire!

984
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:43,568
Sometimes a man gets
a longing for his fields.

985
01:51:43,769 --> 01:51:46,458
Well, if it pleases you to come up again

986
01:51:46,664 --> 01:51:49,595
and working them, they're yours!

987
01:51:49,797 --> 01:51:52,063
No it's better for my son to come;

988
01:51:52,269 --> 01:51:55,104
in the house he pulls against the yolk.

989
01:51:55,307 --> 01:51:58,975
He has all the freedom here he wants!

990
01:51:59,183 --> 01:52:00,447
Where is he today?

991
01:52:00,653 --> 01:52:01,985
He comes and goes!

992
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:07,060
Sometimes one day, sometimes two.

993
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:09,193
I thought you knew.

994
01:52:09,394 --> 01:52:10,686
I knew nothing!

995
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:12,788
I spend my time in town!

996
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:15,756
Why don't you tell me
you slow witted ox!

997
01:52:15,961 --> 01:52:18,525
Why should I tell you
what everyone's been saying?

998
01:52:18,735 --> 01:52:21,571
For weeks!

999
01:52:21,774 --> 01:52:22,799
What?

1000
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:24,171
Well...

1001
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:25,973
Well speak!

1002
01:52:25,983 --> 01:52:28,114
If you have eyes and ears you'll know.

1003
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:30,425
Know? Know what?

1004
01:52:30,631 --> 01:52:32,012
That the second wife and your son is...

1005
01:52:32,218 --> 01:52:35,205
Liar!

1006
01:52:47,725 --> 01:52:50,588
Get off my land.

1007
01:52:50,589 --> 01:52:52,089
Well...

1008
01:52:52,135 --> 01:52:54,902
it's been a long time with us.

1009
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:59,260
Take what belongs to you and go.

1010
01:52:59,466 --> 01:53:01,522
I came to you with nothing,

1011
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:05,695
I'll go with nothing.

1012
01:53:44,225 --> 01:53:50,176
Good day master! Good day!

1013
01:54:51,057 --> 01:54:54,030
- Ah!
- Father!

1014
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:36,995
Get out! Out of my sight!

1015
01:56:25,385 --> 01:56:28,048
Good bye mother.

1016
01:56:32,086 --> 01:56:34,086
Mother!

1017
01:56:34,187 --> 01:56:35,675
Mother, you're ill,

1018
01:56:35,687 --> 01:56:40,849
you should have a doctor.

1019
01:56:42,029 --> 01:56:45,202
It's nothing.

1020
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:55,007
Where you go you ought to tell me.

1021
01:56:57,082 --> 01:57:01,342
They say there's a war in the north.

1022
01:57:01,548 --> 01:57:06,581
Sometimes in wars
there are those who die.

1023
01:57:06,792 --> 01:57:12,759
Well if that's best, let it be!

1024
01:57:14,474 --> 01:57:16,877
When I'm gone,
you must see to the harvest

1025
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,673
we almost did it already,

1026
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:20,672
the clerk will tell you how much.

1027
01:57:20,878 --> 01:57:24,829
I will see to it.

1028
01:57:26,544 --> 01:57:32,037
If you must go,
there's a thing to be done.

1029
01:57:32,388 --> 01:57:33,669
Speak to your father.

1030
01:57:33,878 --> 01:57:37,311
- No, no, I can't!
- You're his youngest son.

1031
01:57:51,126 --> 01:57:53,098
Father.

1032
01:57:54,299 --> 01:57:55,999
Father? I...

1033
01:57:56,103 --> 01:57:58,074
I am going away.

1034
01:57:58,075 --> 01:58:01,716
I... I only want to tell you that I...

1035
01:58:01,717 --> 01:58:05,520
how I... if you could forgive me...

1036
01:58:06,257 --> 01:58:08,418
But go!

1037
01:58:09,685 --> 01:58:13,411
Nephew! We're ruined! Everything's gone!

1038
01:58:13,618 --> 01:58:16,954
And I predicted it! I predicted it!

1039
01:58:17,157 --> 01:58:18,126
What's happened?

1040
01:58:18,327 --> 01:58:21,025
I knew it, I ran miles to tell you.

1041
01:58:21,132 --> 01:58:24,162
- What is it?
- I forgive everybody.

1042
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:27,974
- What is it?
- This!

1043
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:31,306
- Locusts!
- The flying plague!

1044
01:58:35,393 --> 01:58:37,859
Well! Let them come!

1045
01:58:37,863 --> 01:58:38,888
But the lion, the harvest!

1046
01:58:39,097 --> 01:58:40,794
What can we do against the gods?

1047
01:58:41,001 --> 01:58:41,970
It's not the gods!

1048
01:58:42,171 --> 01:58:43,902
It's a thing of nature! We can fight it!

1049
01:58:44,108 --> 01:58:46,873
- Have you ever seen a plague
of locusts? - No but...

1050
01:58:46,881 --> 01:58:49,743
I have! They come in millions.

1051
01:58:49,953 --> 01:58:52,652
The air is black with them and stinky.

1052
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:55,484
And where they come down
there's nothing left!

1053
01:58:55,691 --> 01:58:58,881
Not a green of wheat!
Not a blade of grass!

1054
01:58:59,088 --> 01:59:01,350
Not a leave nor flower! Nothing!

1055
01:59:01,355 --> 01:59:03,822
And can you fight that with your book?

1056
01:59:03,927 --> 01:59:06,019
Forgive me!
I mean no disrespect for my elders,

1057
01:59:06,232 --> 01:59:07,894
but I speak for what I heard at school!

1058
01:59:08,102 --> 01:59:09,092
And I heard this:

1059
01:59:09,305 --> 01:59:10,809
"That a man is a slave to the earth,

1060
01:59:11,024 --> 01:59:13,252
or its master
and when it turns against him,

1061
01:59:13,463 --> 01:59:14,732
he must fight it!"

1062
01:59:14,937 --> 01:59:16,372
We can fight these creeping things!

1063
01:59:16,574 --> 01:59:17,836
If we save but one field,

1064
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:19,903
it would a new thing in all this land,

1065
01:59:20,105 --> 01:59:22,296
and the best in a thousand years!

1066
01:59:22,502 --> 01:59:24,400
This thing can be done?

1067
01:59:24,603 --> 01:59:25,535
Show us how to do it!

1068
01:59:25,737 --> 01:59:31,204
If it'd please you,
come on to the fields!

1069
01:59:32,217 --> 01:59:34,688
Now look!
The locusts will come down here,

1070
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:36,284
the wind blows between these hills.

1071
01:59:36,293 --> 01:59:39,664
There! Like a whirlpool,
if it blows the locusts

1072
01:59:39,867 --> 01:59:41,767
they'll come down there
and no other place!

1073
01:59:41,968 --> 01:59:44,693
I saw it! As a boy!
They came down there!

1074
01:59:44,899 --> 01:59:47,123
And they were gone,
with a change of wind

1075
01:59:47,330 --> 01:59:49,889
But the crops, were gone with them!

1076
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:51,088
But that's the thing!

1077
01:59:51,302 --> 01:59:52,793
We can hold them off
till the wind changes!

1078
01:59:53,005 --> 01:59:55,307
We must take a fire break
along these hill tops.

1079
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:56,739
Make a wall of fire!

1080
01:59:56,946 --> 01:59:58,506
But my wheat
lights on fire in a fire wall!

1081
01:59:58,716 --> 02:00:00,350
And mine! And mine! And mine!

1082
02:00:00,355 --> 02:00:02,747
I'll pay for what is eaten
and what is burnt!

1083
02:00:02,958 --> 02:00:04,656
We'll get kerosene,
bring it in carts!

1084
02:00:04,863 --> 02:00:07,020
The fire stuff,
it makes a quick, high flame.

1085
02:00:07,228 --> 02:00:09,419
We can fight everything
behind this wall!

1086
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:10,453
If they break through,

1087
02:00:10,658 --> 02:00:12,384
we'll wind the ditch behind the fire;

1088
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:13,615
a wall of water!

1089
02:00:13,825 --> 02:00:15,351
It will fail!

1090
02:00:15,562 --> 02:00:17,691
If it fails,
we'll fight them with torches!

1091
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,631
With noise! With our hands!

1092
02:00:19,837 --> 02:00:22,163
If we can hold them off until
the wind picks them up again,

1093
02:00:22,175 --> 02:00:23,474
we can save at least those fields!

1094
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:26,447
- It can't be done!
- It must be done!

1095
02:00:26,651 --> 02:00:29,054
All you have
and all I have depends on it!

1096
02:00:29,258 --> 02:00:30,280
You think I'm rich?

1097
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,111
But if I lose
this harvest there's nothing!

1098
02:00:32,287 --> 02:00:33,717
If I save anything I'll share it!

1099
02:00:33,918 --> 02:00:35,213
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1100
02:00:35,417 --> 02:00:36,849
Let the men dig and women,

1101
02:00:37,051 --> 02:00:38,987
let the old men and boys make torches,

1102
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:40,590
gather all things that'll make a noise!

1103
02:00:40,793 --> 02:00:41,851
Bring the fire stuff!

1104
02:00:42,061 --> 02:00:44,362
Get the oxens and ploughs,
sickels, spades!

1105
02:00:44,567 --> 02:00:48,632
- Everyone! Hurry! Hurry!
- Useless! Useless!

1106
02:00:48,842 --> 02:00:51,859
I'll stay where it's safe!

1107
02:01:04,307 --> 02:01:09,275
Faster! Faster!
Make that thing wider!

1108
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:23,047
Up here! Hurry! Hurry!
Bring the fire stuff!

1109
02:01:23,991 --> 02:01:28,154
Come on men, hurry!

1110
02:01:32,342 --> 02:01:35,314
Torches.

1111
02:02:25,808 --> 02:02:29,737
Millions! Millions!

1112
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:32,953
My god!

1113
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:45,304
See! They land in one place!

1114
02:02:45,514 --> 02:02:49,478
Yes, they fall!

1115
02:03:34,471 --> 02:03:40,438
Hey! Hurry with the fire stuff!

1116
02:04:04,676 --> 02:04:07,871
Load the fire stuff from here!
Get them!

1117
02:04:09,772 --> 02:04:12,187
Get the torches!

1118
02:04:23,047 --> 02:04:27,011
Get the torches!

1119
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:31,845
Light the fires!

1120
02:05:22,607 --> 02:05:27,068
All fire stop!
They are smothering the plains!

1121
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:58,402
It's breaking through,
just as I predicted it!

1122
02:05:58,610 --> 02:06:03,017
Just as I predicted it!

1123
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:07,171
- Bring the water! Fill the ditches!
- Fill the ditches!

1124
02:06:16,492 --> 02:06:19,521
They'll be eaten,
there's no doubt about it now!

1125
02:06:19,730 --> 02:06:25,198
No doubt about it!
That ditch will never hold them!

1126
02:06:58,987 --> 02:07:00,419
We must fight them with our hands!

1127
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:06,588
Ourselves! Anything! Move!

1128
02:07:41,899 --> 02:07:47,828
Chen! Keep fighting! Don't give up!

1129
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:55,133
We must keep fighting!

1130
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:03,918
Everyone! We can!

1131
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:11,689
There's the wheat! Save it!

1132
02:08:18,235 --> 02:08:24,203
The wind! The wind! The wind! The wind!

1133
02:09:05,822 --> 02:09:10,302
We beat them!
We beat them! We beat them!

1134
02:09:12,344 --> 02:09:17,661
Yeah! We beat them!

1135
02:09:17,864 --> 02:09:23,314
The farm! Victory!
Victory! We've done it!

1136
02:09:39,959 --> 02:09:42,718
The young master,
it's wonderful! He did it!

1137
02:09:42,924 --> 02:09:45,352
The son and his father,
the son to be proud of!

1138
02:09:45,354 --> 02:09:46,382
The father to be proud of!

1139
02:09:46,386 --> 02:09:47,847
The wise man in 3 generations!

1140
02:09:47,854 --> 02:09:51,618
But it's nothing!
Just a matter of oil and fire,

1141
02:09:51,827 --> 02:09:54,391
something we learn from books!

1142
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:57,437
But I'm worn out! Worn out!

1143
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,200
But we saved the crops!

1144
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:00,741
The harvest is saved!

1145
02:10:00,946 --> 02:10:04,283
The gods are good!

1146
02:10:04,486 --> 02:10:07,642
What's the matter?

1147
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:09,770
I'll call your husband.

1148
02:10:09,781 --> 02:10:13,642
No, no! Say nothing.

1149
02:10:13,852 --> 02:10:16,253
He's on the land again,

1150
02:10:16,456 --> 02:10:22,333
with his sons, and this day's his,

1151
02:10:22,536 --> 02:10:26,271
and it must be!

1152
02:10:26,477 --> 02:10:30,931
You shall bring in the harvest,
and lead the workers!

1153
02:10:34,707 --> 02:10:37,676
Both of you!

1154
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:48,430
And Ching is my steward!

1155
02:10:48,633 --> 02:10:50,647
Well! There's work to be done!

1156
02:10:50,861 --> 02:10:56,346
Yeah yeah yeah!
The harvest! Food! Food again!

1157
02:10:58,822 --> 02:11:02,157
And another thing must be done,
and you must do it,

1158
02:11:02,361 --> 02:11:03,489
quickly!

1159
02:11:03,697 --> 02:11:05,690
I? Work?

1160
02:11:05,702 --> 02:11:09,102
Go to the banker,
as a commisioner to be had,

1161
02:11:09,309 --> 02:11:10,870
and if you rob me a little,

1162
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:14,779
it will be yours! For old time's sake!

1163
02:11:14,988 --> 02:11:18,044
I will sell the Great House!

1164
02:11:18,253 --> 02:11:20,808
Sell? But why?

1165
02:11:21,019 --> 02:11:23,574
The harvest is saved, you'll have money!

1166
02:11:23,783 --> 02:11:25,252
You can live like a lord!

1167
02:11:25,287 --> 02:11:28,492
All that is finished!

1168
02:11:29,094 --> 02:11:35,039
I will sell the Great House!

1169
02:11:50,178 --> 02:11:52,580
It's a wedding again!

1170
02:11:52,934 --> 02:11:53,994
But who?

1171
02:11:54,204 --> 02:11:55,934
It's your grandson's wedding!

1172
02:11:56,140 --> 02:12:01,082
And soon there'll be great grandsons!

1173
02:12:01,317 --> 02:12:03,254
Many of them! Many of them!

1174
02:12:03,455 --> 02:12:05,321
Please! Please!

1175
02:12:05,325 --> 02:12:07,855
Let him be! Let him be!

1176
02:12:08,059 --> 02:12:10,754
His cheek is as red
as this excellent wine!

1177
02:12:10,755 --> 02:12:12,052
Excellent indeed!

1178
02:12:12,054 --> 02:12:13,680
My stomach is very pleased!

1179
02:12:13,988 --> 02:12:15,422
Perhaps it's the lost of memory,

1180
02:12:15,624 --> 02:12:17,184
but I've never eaten such rice!

1181
02:12:17,395 --> 02:12:21,233
It's very bad rice.
The worst I've ever bought!

1182
02:12:21,436 --> 02:12:27,404
Grandchildren! Great grandchildren!

1183
02:12:41,611 --> 02:12:43,608
Have all the guests had rice?

1184
02:12:43,816 --> 02:12:45,750
Yes, yes!

1185
02:12:45,953 --> 02:12:49,586
Is the sweet rice is hot,
with lard and sugar?

1186
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:50,853
And the 8 fruits?

1187
02:12:51,064 --> 02:12:52,657
It's just as you wished.

1188
02:12:52,868 --> 02:12:58,820
Mistrss! Your son's bride!

1189
02:13:04,503 --> 02:13:10,238
Well, and she's beautiful!

1190
02:13:10,448 --> 02:13:12,619
My daughter,

1191
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:16,720
look to your husband,

1192
02:13:16,921 --> 02:13:19,521
and your husband's father,

1193
02:13:19,896 --> 02:13:24,946
and his granfather,
and you'll have no duty...

1194
02:13:24,947 --> 02:13:27,247
to any of them.

1195
02:13:33,741 --> 02:13:36,712
You must rest!

1196
02:13:43,155 --> 02:13:48,549
Everyone be here
not smiling because of me.

1197
02:14:20,046 --> 02:14:23,348
Let them be, for the bride!

1198
02:14:23,519 --> 02:14:26,789
In good time! In good time!

1199
02:14:26,994 --> 02:14:29,529
For you'll be well again.

1200
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:32,530
Well...

1201
02:14:35,193 --> 02:14:38,319
This thing is waiting.

1202
02:14:38,328 --> 02:14:40,761
You can't speak of that,

1203
02:14:40,767 --> 02:14:43,939
and please me.

1204
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:47,248
I'm content,

1205
02:14:48,049 --> 02:14:53,349
and what must
be done, you've done!

1206
02:15:02,257 --> 02:15:04,154
Bridegroom hasn't heard a word!

1207
02:15:04,259 --> 02:15:05,692
He's wishing we go home!

1208
02:15:05,696 --> 02:15:09,268
No! No indeed, I should be honoured
if you stay the whole evening!

1209
02:15:14,145 --> 02:15:16,673
Do you remember?

1210
02:15:16,885 --> 02:15:19,850
Yes!

1211
02:15:21,649 --> 02:15:26,445
If a man could speak, there're things...

1212
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:30,589
Some are forgotten.

1213
02:15:31,026 --> 02:15:33,496
But now I know that you're the one,

1214
02:15:33,698 --> 02:15:39,665
that the best a man can have.

1215
02:15:49,108 --> 02:15:53,778
Ou Lang! Ou Lang!

1216
02:15:54,772 --> 02:15:57,275
This I cannot bear!

1217
02:15:57,479 --> 02:16:02,650
I'd sell all my land
if I could heal you!

1218
02:16:02,857 --> 02:16:07,816
No! I would not let you!

1219
02:16:09,159 --> 02:16:13,282
For I must die, sometime.

1220
02:16:13,490 --> 02:16:19,435
But the land will be there, after me.

1221
02:16:20,905 --> 02:16:26,872
I beg you! Stay here with me!

1222
02:16:31,387 --> 02:16:34,351
I can not!

1223
02:16:37,785 --> 02:16:40,757
Forgive me!

1224
02:17:38,654 --> 02:17:40,654
Ou Lang...

1225
02:17:41,855 --> 02:17:44,887
you are the earth!

1226
02:17:45,305 --> 02:18:45,474
