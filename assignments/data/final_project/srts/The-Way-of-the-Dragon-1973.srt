1
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,941
Attention please,
TWA flight 820 from Hong Kong

2
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,278
has arrived 30 minutes early.

3
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,656
Passengers will exit from Gate 3.

4
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,207
Mam.

5
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,184
May I help you?

6
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:26,616
Eggs.

7
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,622
Tang Lung?

8
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,123
Miss Chen Ching Hua?

9
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,625
Yes.

10
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,086
You weren't waiting at the gate.

11
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,838
The plane arrived early.

12
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,716
I was hungry, so I went and grabbed a bite.

13
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,469
How is my uncle in Hong Kong?

14
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,847
He's a bit unwell, so I came instead.

15
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,768
He wrote me about you but didn't go into details.

16
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,145
How can you help me?

17
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:47,859
Please don't stand on ceremony
I'll personally help you.

18
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,986
Personally help me?

19
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,656
Do you understand my problem?

20
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,574
That you must tell me later.

21
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,411
But first, can you tell me where the toilet is?

22
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,494
Precious horse (BMW)?

23
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,214
Wild horse (Mustang)?

24
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,096
A flying horse?

25
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,571
Dad died recently,
and left me this restaurant.

26
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,991
Uncle Wang and the others
have helped out a lot.

27
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,410
Business wasn't bad
in the beginning.

28
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,371
Then a huge syndicate stepped in.

29
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,999
They're interested in our land

30
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,209
and wanted me to sell the restaurant.

31
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,754
There's no sale
without mutual agreement.

32
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,548
If you refuse, what can they do?

33
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,301
In theory, you're right

34
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,596
but they won't listen to reason.

35
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,933
They'll do anything for my land.

36
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,312
They hired some young thugs

37
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,148
to watch the place day and night.

38
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,233
If a customer comes in

39
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,945
they simply drive him away.

40
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,447
What am I to do?

41
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,990
Why not report it to the police?

42
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,370
They disappear when the police come.

43
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,998
We can't ask
for round-the-clock protection.

44
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,462
Business has gone down badly

45
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,424
and I still have to pay my workers.

46
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,178
How can I go on meeting the expenses?

47
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,353
The thugs have become worse lately

48
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,230
demanding an immediate answer.

49
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,691
So I wrote to my uncle for help.

50
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,069
I thought he'd send a lawyer, but...

51
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,698
I told you not to worry.
I am here to help.

52
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,449
Don't worry, Miss Chen.

53
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,828
It's nothing. I can take care of them.

54
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,167
Look up there!
That's their headquarters.

55
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,872
Make yourself at home.

56
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,528
I rent this place.

57
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,282
It's more convenient.
All the men live at the restaurant.

58
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,953
There's always a spare room
for my sick workers.

59
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,875
You can stay there for the time being.

60
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,505
You're my uncle's friend,
so please feel at home.

61
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,341
Let me know if you need anything.

62
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,594
May I use your toilet?

63
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,471
It's over there.

64
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,354
Chinese New Year is coming up,

65
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,314
do they celebrate it in Rome?

66
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,452
I haven't been back to HK in 12 years,

67
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,496
it certainly will take some
getting used to.

68
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,877
How's the restaurant business?

69
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,379
I live on a farm in the New Territories.

70
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,760
I practise martial arts every day.

71
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,685
Restaurants haven't changed much.

72
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,606
Take a seat.

73
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,112
Here's the key.

74
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,200
Our telephone numbers are on it.

75
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,129
The restaurant is nearby.

76
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,507
If you lose your way, show that card

77
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,092
and any taxi driver will bring you back.

78
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,596
Taxi? It's too expensive here.

79
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,139
Do they have public light buses?

80
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,641
Do you need some money?

81
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,268
No, I brought some with me.

82
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,647
Better put it in a bank,

83
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,440
it's safer that way.

84
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,403
No, it's safer and easier to carry it.

85
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,907
I won't argue. How much did you bring?

86
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,867
Not much.

87
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,120
Really, not much.

88
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,791
Still, I say it's safer in the bank.

89
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,376
Come!

90
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,844
Miss Chen! How are you? How are you?

91
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,178
This is Mr. Tang

92
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,139
He wants to deposit some money.

93
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,725
My friend.

94
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,020
How much money do you have, let's see it!

95
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,564
This way.

96
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,448
How much you want to change
into our currency?

97
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,868
How much local money will you change?

98
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,665
20 will do.
Lately the exchange rate has been bad.

99
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,193
That was the bank manager,
not a pickpocket.

100
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,071
You must be more polite.

101
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:57,158
Not everyone you meet is a villain.

102
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,202
Besides, I know that bank manager.

103
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,374
Foreigners are warm and polite.

104
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,545
When people smile, smile back,
that's politeness.

105
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,344
When someone puts an arm on your shoulder,
it's a sign of friendship

106
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,514
You should react the same way.

107
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,979
Remember that well!

108
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,343
Have a seat please!

109
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,810
Make yourself at home!

110
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:23,930
Ah Lung, you must be Ah Lung!
Welcome to Rome.

111
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:29,268
I'm Quen, from Miss Chen's restaurant.

112
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,519
Quen!

113
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,190
Miss Chen has returned to the restaurant.

114
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,691
She asked me to take you there.

115
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,779
By the way, where were you just now?

116
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,117
Let's go!

117
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,352
Ah Lung is back.

118
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,522
Ah Lung, this is Uncle Wang.

119
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,982
Uncle Wang.

120
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:21,821
Have a seat!

121
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,448
Quen, prepare some tea.

122
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,158
Ok...

123
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,541
It must have been
a long and tedious flight.

124
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:42,300
How do you like it here so far?

125
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,722
I'm certainly not used to things yet.

126
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,558
Doesn't matter, you will,
as time goes on.

127
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:58,399
It's been a long time since I was back home.

128
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,237
How are things in HK?

129
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,366
HK? I seldom went to town

130
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,453
when I was in the New Territories.

131
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,168
Have some tea.

132
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,755
Come, have some tea.

133
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,965
Thank you!

134
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,933
Why are there no customers?

135
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,229
With those thugs around,

136
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,483
who'd dare come here?

137
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,238
Ah Lung,
there are more workers training out back.

138
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,448
Let's go meet them.

139
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,825
Ok...

140
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,377
There's no business

141
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,338
so they spend their time exercising.

142
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,591
Come on!

143
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,430
Before Mr. Chen passed away,

144
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,393
they learned karate
to handle the villains.

145
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,685
Why didn't you take it up?

146
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,688
I'm not interested
in foreign martial arts.

147
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:25,820
It doesn't matter what style
if you can use your body well

148
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,824
even in the midst of violent movement,

149
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,743
to honestly express oneself.

150
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,456
I prefer Chinese boxing.

151
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,500
Do you know Chinese boxing?

152
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,751
Yes!

153
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,002
Really?

154
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,258
Let's take a breather.

155
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,638
Come here.

156
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,314
This is Tang Lung.
Introduce yourselves.

157
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,066
My name is Tony!

158
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,444
Jimmy!

159
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,778
Thomas!

160
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,196
Robert!

161
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,656
I've no English name.
Call me Ah Chuan.

162
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,283
Ah Chuan.

163
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,628
He looks like a typical Chinese boxer.

164
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,339
Have you learned any boxing?

165
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,801
Ah Lung came from HK to help us.

166
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,180
He's an expert Chinese boxer.

167
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,141
I'm just a novice.

168
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,812
Chinese boxing?
I understand it's like dancing.

169
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,856
But it sadly lacks power?

170
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,817
You lack power when you haven't
mastered the fundamentals

171
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,236
Right.

172
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,494
How then do you develop power?

173
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,998
By putting the hip into it.

174
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,416
Right.

175
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,838
Will you demonstrate
how to put the hip into it?

176
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,468
I'm afraid I'll hurt someone.

177
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,803
What are you afraid of?

178
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:19,642
They're wearing protective padding.

179
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:24,063
They won't get hurt.

180
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,175
We've guests coming.
Change and get to work.

181
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,094
Hurry!

182
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,471
Come on, let's go.

183
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,852
Change and get cracking!

184
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,565
Quen, where's the toilet?

185
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:12,403
Over there.
It's labelled in English.

186
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,654
Thank you!

187
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,446
Out, get the hell out of here, now!

188
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,239
Come on!

189
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,632
Get out!

190
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,091
Why?

191
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,302
That's why!

192
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,389
What's your decision?

193
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,641
Uncle Wang.

194
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,059
Yes.

195
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,646
Come quick, they're here again!

196
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,773
Stop it!

197
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,358
All right!

198
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,195
If you don't answer by tonight,

199
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,989
don't blame us for getting rough.

200
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,580
Please help us out,

201
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,874
put in a good word for us.

202
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,169
Give us a few more days to think it over.

203
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:59,510
You've been delaying a long time.

204
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,638
Are you or are you not selling?

205
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,765
Hey, don't you hit anyone.

206
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,229
Don't fight please!
We'll only wreck our own things.

207
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,941
Remember, by tonight you'd better
have an answer for us

208
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,567
Let's go!

209
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,491
Sorry!

210
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,749
Watch where you're going next time.

211
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,088
You don't even know a word of English.

212
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,006
Why did my Uncle send you here?

213
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,143
They're young and headstrong,

214
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,312
Don't blame them,
everything will be all right.

215
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,038
Lucky they weren't armed today.

216
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,291
In broad daylight?

217
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,753
They wouldn't dare use a gun in public.

218
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,713
If Uncle Wang hadn't stopped them...

219
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,967
I'd have used karate on them!

220
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,762
You can talk!

221
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,681
What good is your karate?

222
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,103
It's still better than Chinese boxing

223
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,356
People shove you out of the way

224
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,526
and you even apologised!

225
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,916
Sit down, sit down, please!

226
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,678
May I help you?

227
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,972
Can you help me?

228
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,391
Sure!

229
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,562
I'd like some Chinese spareribs.

230
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,773
Chinese spareribs?

231
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,109
Do you need me to tell you

232
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,489
what Chinese spareribs are?

233
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,910
Well let me show you!

234
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,506
What are you doing?

235
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,301
You know what we are doing,
don't they, fellas?

236
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,430
You all should have left
this restaurant!

237
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,184
Get Uncle Wang out here to help.

238
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:03,861
Stay calm. Don't wreck our place.

239
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,445
It's no use.

240
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,951
Do you want to step outside!

241
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,286
Sure!

242
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,453
Good!

243
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,082
Go...

244
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,923
Ah Lung, you...?

245
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,924
Let's go!

246
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:04,212
Jimmy... Jimmy...

247
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,881
Chinese boxing?

248
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:13,263
Damn!
They think this is Chinese boxing

249
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,223
If I knew Chinese boxing

250
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,935
I'd give them a good taste of it!

251
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,227
I'll go!

252
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,158
Tell him this is Chinese boxing

253
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,455
Hey! Chinese boxer!

254
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,567
The Dragon Set Movement No. Four
"Little Dragon Seeking Its Path"

255
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,947
"Big Dragon whipping its tail"

256
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,747
Ah Lung, bravo!

257
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:07,586
Magnificent!

258
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,671
Excellent!

259
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,590
Don't be overjoyed.

260
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:16,386
There'll be more trouble after this.

261
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,848
With Ah Lung's skill

262
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,393
those men will think twice now.

263
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:28,065
You don't understand.

264
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:33,820
It's hard to beat local hoodlums.

265
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:38,909
This is their territory.

266
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,831
We must be careful.

267
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,376
Let's be more patient.

268
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,171
More patience! Man, our Dragon is here!

269
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,966
You'd be wise to heed my advice.

270
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,927
Is that so?

271
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,846
Calm down, everyone.

272
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,600
Ah Lung, it's late, you must be tired.

273
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,976
Let's turn in.

274
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,994
Want some supper?

275
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,915
No, I must get up early for training.

276
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,045
I hear it's easy to buy a gun here?

277
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,465
Yes, any local citizen can get a licence.

278
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,153
What are you doing?

279
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,279
Making darts.

280
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,363
Darts?

281
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,170
What's the matter? Want to eat?

282
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,007
You can if you're as good as Ah Lung.

283
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,219
Better go practise your karate!

284
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,640
Is it for brother Lung?
Why didn't you say so?

285
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:32,063
Brother Lung!

286
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:43,783
Good morning, Brother Lung!

287
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:50,373
I made this especially for you.

288
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,500
Eat it while it's hot.

289
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,757
You're terrific.

290
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,092
Who was your teacher in HK?

291
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:09,184
Look at this!
Little Dragon seeking its path

292
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,686
"Big Dragon whipping its tail"

293
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,272
With that, all the enemies are down!

294
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,819
You said Chinese boxing lacks power.

295
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,240
I was only kidding.

296
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,992
Ah Lung, you were too fast yesterday.

297
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,702
We couldn't see clearly

298
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,372
Will you show us again?

299
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:39,798
Please show us.

300
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,510
Go on then!

301
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,364
Everyone says you're fast and powerful.

302
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,574
I didn't see it last night.

303
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:11,871
You said one must use the hip.

304
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,874
How about a demonstration?

305
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,670
Be quiet and let's watch, okay?

306
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,046
So shut up!

307
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,631
Step back!

308
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,467
Are you all right?

309
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,636
Everything all right?

310
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,518
Fantastic!

311
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,856
Ah Lung, will you be my teacher?

312
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,776
You said physical training is useless.

313
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,320
So why are you doing it now?

314
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,114
I never liked karate.

315
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,202
That's Chinese boxing, you dig?

316
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,496
We'll give up karate.

317
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,665
Let's learn from Ah Lung.

318
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,293
Right!

319
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,962
Customers! Come quick!

320
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,475
Change, on the double!

321
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,562
Ah Lung, no, Master, Master
I have to go take care the customer.

322
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,816
We'll talk later.

323
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,948
Is there anything for me to do?

324
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,992
Watch out for those villains.

325
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,934
My boss wants to see you!

326
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,853
What was that?

327
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,354
He wants us to see his boss.

328
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,649
Shut up! Now move!

329
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,761
See you tomorrow.

330
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,440
All of you are good for nothing!

331
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,866
You! Didn't you have a gun?

332
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,453
What I like, I get

333
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,330
and I want the restaurant.

334
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,373
Yes boss! Yes boss!

335
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,545
Yes boss! Yes boss!
You've wasted enough time!

336
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,467
But, I... I always do my best.

337
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,929
Then why did you fail?

338
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:03,186
They're getting help
from a man called Tang Lung.

339
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,897
A man? Only one man?

340
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,944
But this man knows Chinese kung fu.

341
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,238
Kung fu?

342
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:13,548
Good morning. Sit down. Eat.

343
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,722
You won't often find this in Rome,
how does it taste?

344
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,560
It's not as good as in HK.

345
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,565
I cooked it, it's all right.

346
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,164
And you?

347
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,458
Want some more?

348
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,800
I'll take you around Rome later.

349
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,066
Wait!

350
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,117
Go on!

351
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,757
Move, move, come on!

352
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,970
Where's the man from HK?

353
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,472
Tell him to come out.

354
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,907
Where is he? Talk!

355
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,784
I don't know.

356
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,627
You'd better talk!

357
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,465
All right. He'll be back soon.

358
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,719
Where is he now?

359
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,857
These are famous relics of the past.

360
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,823
Over there... what is it?

361
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,452
Our slum is full of these wrecks.

362
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,540
Please.

363
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,779
A king built these gardens for his queen.

364
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,907
It took a lot of time and money.

365
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,618
They must have been really in love.

366
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,664
Are you married?

367
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,927
How do you like the palace?

368
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,224
Such a big place is a waste.

369
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:57,438
In HK I would build a skyscraper
and collect rent.

370
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,151
I'd better return to the restaurant.

371
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,872
Close the door.

372
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,009
You better cool it, baby.

373
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,553
Bring him down!

374
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,114
Chinese kung fu?

375
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,042
The boss means well.

376
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,128
He appreciates talent

377
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,465
and he knows you're strong.
Oh, what rippling muscle!

378
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,509
We don't want to harm you.

379
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,432
Here's a ticket back to HK.

380
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,851
Better to stay out of trouble.

381
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,813
All right! Take him away

382
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,773
but be careful with the gun in public.

383
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,776
Yes boss! Come on, let's go!

384
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,963
Go to see if anybody around?

385
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:57,767
Put your hands down! Put your hands down!

386
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,727
Listen, listen!
Boss, that bastard got away!

387
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,021
Go! Get him, but no gun!

388
00:49:54,074 --> 00:50:08,754
Get him!

389
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,393
Let's get him!

390
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:43,015
Get him!

391
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:33,667
Miss Chen, quit while you're ahead.

392
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,503
You'd better say yes.

393
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:44,053
We're offering you a good deal.

394
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,554
Hello!

395
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,463
Tell him.

396
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:30,724
We don't want any more trouble,
or else I will retaliate.

397
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,689
He told us not to come
and cause any more trouble.

398
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,785
Move them out.

399
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,622
Hurry up and pick up everybody.

400
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,566
Hold it, that's a customer.

401
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:31,243
Welcome!

402
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,044
Serve our guest properly.

403
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,846
See? I told you to be patient.

404
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,100
You should bear the responsibility for this.

405
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,353
What should we do now?

406
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,938
We'll fight to the end.

407
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:04,193
This is no joke.

408
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,737
I know, but...

409
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,157
I know how you feel

410
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,913
but we must think of Tang Lung.

411
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,166
They'll do what they say.

412
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,542
You mean...

413
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,378
Keep him under cover for awhile.

414
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,883
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's
If there's trouble...

415
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,301
I don't know if he'll agree?

416
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,303
I know he's stubborn

417
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:35,140
You must persuade him.

418
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,685
Without him,
we'll be forced to sell the restaurant.

419
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,607
We'll have to see.

420
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,362
We may have to cooperate.

421
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:53,033
But we mustn't sell the place.

422
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,954
Let me decide.

423
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,455
All right.

424
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,875
Better go and talk to Lung.

425
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,102
Is your restaurant open tomorrow?

426
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,275
Good, we'll go to the countryside and practise.

427
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,046
Remind Quen to bring
the protective padding.

428
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,805
Firecrackers?

429
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:04,396
It's banned in HK.
There must be Chinese living nearby.

430
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,868
You must leave Rome for awhile.

431
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,536
Leave Rome?

432
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,498
We don't want you to go,

433
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,959
especially me, but you must.

434
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,045
Do you understand me?

435
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,047
I don't understand.

436
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,596
Ah Lung, why won't you...

437
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,058
Are you afraid of fire crackers?

438
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,935
I'll take you to the airport.

439
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,311
Why?

440
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,646
Those men want you...

441
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,237
My duty is to help you.

442
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,822
I know, but you must leave

443
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,337
They intend to kill you

444
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,381
Kill me? Who?

445
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,560
Time's up. Let's go!

446
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,605
It's too noisy. I'll close the window.

447
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,574
Stay here, don't move about.

448
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:35,065
Miss Chen!

449
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:49,162
Hello! May I help you?

450
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:57,003
Three... five...

451
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:01,550
Hello, what was that Sir,
can you please repeat that?

452
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:06,138
Hello... hello... hello...

453
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,026
Don't waste time.

454
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,071
Here's the agreement of sale.

455
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,698
Sign it!

456
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,199
No!

457
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,577
Why be so stubborn?

458
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,455
The boss has been nice to you.

459
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:39,838
If this knife crosses your face,

460
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,008
you'll look ugly.

461
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,641
So don't make our boss mad.

462
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,019
I won't sign!

463
01:02:56,522 --> 01:03:00,692
It's for your own good.

464
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:05,155
We'll get the restaurant
sooner or later anyway.

465
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:09,367
Tang Lung will soon be here.

466
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,454
Tang Lung? You think he will come?

467
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:20,712
He's reporting to our Lord in Heaven!

468
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,855
Be careful.

469
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,805
The mastermind is over there.

470
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,588
You're crazy!

471
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:09,798
Let me tell you.

472
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,384
He doesn't understand Chinese.

473
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,364
Let's go.

474
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:10,442
I've thought of a great way
to handle that Tang Lung.

475
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:17,157
Do unto other's as you
would have them do unto you!

476
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,707
Well, among my friends

477
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,084
there is one Japanese martial artist

478
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,170
and one European martial artist

479
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,755
They are both strong

480
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,717
but the problem is they are from
different schools.

481
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,512
I'm afraid they might not
cooperate with each other.

482
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,598
Money will buy cooperation.

483
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,892
If money is not a problem.

484
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,854
Then I suggest we call America for Colt.

485
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,522
Is this Colt good?

486
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:56,571
Is Colt good? He is America's best!

487
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,824
You better pray
that you don't fail this time!

488
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,327
He will beat Tang Lung.

489
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,038
I'll bet my life on it.

490
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,002
Operator!

491
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,379
I'd like to call America.

492
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,509
Yes, A-me-ri-ca!

493
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:32,023
Happy New Year!

494
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,863
Thank you, Uncle Wang...

495
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,666
I didn't expect
traditional lucky money abroad.

496
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,878
Uncle Wang gives us lucky money yearly.

497
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,383
This is my best New Year ever.

498
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,594
First, we successfully defended
our restaurant,

499
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,266
and second, we have Ah Lung with us,

500
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,185
who's also our teacher.

501
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,776
Third, we finally beat the hoodlums.

502
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:24,367
Let's enjoy the new year
and skip the violence.

503
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,203
Here comes Ching Hua.

504
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:34,335
Happy New Year!

505
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,129
Come, this is for you.

506
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,797
Thank you, Uncle Wang

507
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,594
Ah Lung, a cable for you.

508
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,159
It's from my Uncle.

509
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,120
He wants you to go
somewhere to help someone.

510
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:28,139
Don't be like that. I'll be back.

511
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:33,436
I won't leave
until the whole thing is settled.

512
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:42,195
Happy New Year!
Beautiful decorations indeed.

513
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,205
What a warm gathering.

514
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,998
What do you want?

515
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:01,589
I came to bring greetings.

516
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,095
It was our fault. I must apologize.

517
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,224
We must all be friends.

518
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,979
Our boss would like to see Mr. Tang.

519
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,023
Would he do us the honor?

520
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,944
Wonderful.

521
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,697
Business will be good this year.

522
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,992
Tell your boss we'll be there.

523
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:35,248
Fine. Empress Restaurant
tomorrow morning, bye.

524
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:13,828
Just a minute please! Please, please!

525
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,957
We are friends.

526
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,001
Tang Lung is our enemy.

527
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:23,588
Please wait for our boss
to come back to decide.

528
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:28,092
Which one of you will take care
of that Chinaman?

529
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,022
Stop!

530
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,237
Sensei!

531
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,822
Bob's my student.

532
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:09,509
He will personally take care of Tang Lung.

533
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,302
Yes, boss!

534
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:16,307
Who can do karate better than the Japanese?

535
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,350
Wait! Now that we have decided.

536
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:00,935
Is everything arranged?

537
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,353
Yes, boss!

538
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:07,692
I'll meet them at the restaurant
early tomorrow morning.

539
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,155
You're here. Sit down.

540
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:18,369
Sorry our boss couldn't make it.

541
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,621
Why isn't he here?

542
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:26,085
Something urgent came up.

543
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:29,422
I'll have my car drive you over.

544
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,591
What? We're to go to him?

545
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:35,386
Never mind. Take us there!

546
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:40,099
Right! I like straight-talkers.

547
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,350
Let's go!

548
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,451
Where is he?

549
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,961
He's gone.

550
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,631
Forget it. He won't get away.

551
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,554
It's a trick. Be careful everyone!

552
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,919
Leave it to me, Teacher!

553
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,088
The three of us can handle him.

554
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,464
I'll go first.

555
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,885
You? Tang Lung?

556
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,722
Tang Lung.

557
01:16:51,648 --> 01:18:05,388
Are you Tang Lung?

558
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:57,523
Leave it, he's already surrendered.

559
01:18:57,774 --> 01:18:59,817
Ah Lung, we're lucky this time

560
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,153
not to have fallen into their trap.

561
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:07,199
Tang Lung, come if you dare!

562
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:11,954
Ah Lung, don't let him get away.

563
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:14,832
Tony and Jimmy can take the Japanese.

564
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,479
Tony, are you all right?

565
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,441
I'm hurting all over.

566
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:06,592
Uncle Wang, why...

567
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:11,263
Don't blame me, if you must,
blame it on Ah Lung

568
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:17,812
Yes, Ah Lung got you into this mess

569
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:21,315
He should not have get in my way.

570
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:27,988
You... what do you mean?

571
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,573
What do I mean?

572
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,452
Working men have no future.

573
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:39,333
I have worked hard for half my life
but own nothing.

574
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:46,298
My wife and children are waiting in HK

575
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,300
If the restaurant cooperates,

576
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:51,053
they'll pay me a big reward.

577
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:55,933
Then I can return to HK,
and enjoy luxury.

578
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:02,898
I've slogged away overseas
I'd like to enjoy an easy life.

579
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:42,646
Tang Lung, you've got guts.

580
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:45,668
The man you just saw will kill you.

581
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:14,863
Lung, you're at the end of your road.

582
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:56,905
You're at Death's door.

583
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,617
Ho!

584
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:41,966
Wang, we've failed.

585
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,227
Hold it!

586
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:57,482
We've been tricked

587
01:34:57,733 --> 01:35:01,903
Tony and Jimmy... look!

588
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:17,460
Don't get emotional, please!

589
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,214
Listen to me, Mr. Tang.

590
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:29,741
Now that it's over. I must go.

591
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:32,994
I'll see you off.

592
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:37,248
No, Chuan has a car waiting.

593
01:36:53,098 --> 01:36:54,432
Take good care.

594
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:19,290
In this world of guns and knives,

595
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:25,213
he's gonna need luck wherever he goes!
