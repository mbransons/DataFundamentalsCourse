1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,767
Good morning, Mr. Kirby.

3
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,210
Good morning.

4
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,231
- Good morning, A.P.
- Good morning.

5
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,004
Good morning.

6
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,407
- No pictures.
- New York Times, Mr. Kirby.

7
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,034
We'd like a statement
on the business outlook.

8
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,912
The newspapers should know that
Mr. Kirby never issues any statements.

9
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,014
Come on, come on. Let's go up.

10
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,752
I got your telegram, Mr. Kirby.
They're all waiting in your office.

11
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,944
Good.

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,547
- Hello, A.P. You're looking well.
- What can I say?

13
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,673
- How was the trip?
- Good morning.

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,925
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad to get home. Hello, Tony.

15
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:48,967
- How are you?
- Good.

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,052
- How's your mother?
- She's fine.

17
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,138
That's good, I nearly sent for you.
I thought you might like the White House.

18
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,223
I'm sorry you didn't.

19
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,724
How do you like being a vice president?

20
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,292
Painless so far.

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,270
He still talks
as if he were having a tooth yanked.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,356
- What happened in Washington?
- Yes, what did you find out?

23
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,732
A.P., how do we stand?

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,192
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,027
How do we stand, A.P.?

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,780
Well, gentlemen, there'll be no interference
from the powers that be.

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,323
- There won't? That's marvelous.
- Are you sure?

28
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,950
What about the senator
with the anti-trust complex?

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,621
I said there'd be no interference.
We're going ahead exactly as we planned.

30
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,625
It'll be the largest individual monopoly
in the world, gentlemen, if we're smart.

31
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,627
Particularly now that Ramsey
is lined up.

32
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,128
- Ramsey, too?
- That's impossible.

33
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,463
No, the administration
would never stand for that.

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,257
Why, we'd control every type
of war material.

35
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,800
That's exactly it, gentlemen.

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,053
With the world going crazy,
the next big move is munitions.

37
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,846
And Kirby and Company
are going to cash in on it.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,014
It's unbelievable.

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,308
Why, a war wouldn't be possible anywhere
without us.

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,520
A.P., if I know Ramsey, he'll never
let himself be absorbed by anybody.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,813
- He won't?
- No.

42
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,649
Well, we'll see if he will
when I hand him a little surprise.

43
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,319
I own every inch of the 12 blocks that
completely surround the Ramsey factories.

44
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,654
- No!
- News to us!

45
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,406
Well, we certainly didn't
know anything about that.

46
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,867
So, how is he going to fulfill
his contracts without us?

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,952
Now, you'd better get busy.

48
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,996
Complete all your negotiations
with the others.

49
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,247
I'll handle Ramsey myself.

50
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,249
- We'll hop right to it.
- Right on.

51
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,418
I have a meeting with my nitrate group
this afternoon.

52
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,565
Good.

53
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:11,154
Ten thousand a year for doctors
and I'm still taking this stuff.

54
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,513
- Well, son, what do you think about it?
- Don't ask me.

55
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,890
You know my cockeyed sense of values.

56
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,603
Get me that sour-faced real estate agent
on the phone. What's his name?

57
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,206
- Blakely.
- Yeah, yeah. Private line.

58
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,066
Dad, how do you feel?

59
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,776
Rotten. It's my stomach.

60
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,194
Yeah, I thought so.

61
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,196
These trips to Washington
are getting me jittery.

62
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,241
But it's the last one.
From now on, they come to me.

63
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,243
Say, Tony, do you realize

64
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,689
there won't be a bullet, gun or cannon
made in this country without us?

65
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,647
Dad, now don't tell me
you've forgotten the slingshot market.

66
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,115
Mr. Blakely on the phone.

67
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,155
Hello, Blakely.
This is A.P. How's it going?

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,681
You what? What trouble?

69
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,225
Now, wait a minute.
Don't bite my head off.

70
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,895
I've got all 12 blocks, everything,

71
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,357
with the exception of one little lot
I can't get the man to sell.

72
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,108
Those 12 blocks
are absolutely useless to me,

73
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,360
unless I get every inch of them.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,862
But I'm up against some kind
of an old crank.

75
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,989
His house isn't worth over $25,000.

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,950
I've already offered him $50,000,
but he's standing pat.

77
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,077
If you can't get it with money

78
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,370
there's certainly other ways
of getting it.

79
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,455
Now, that's up to you.
Now, remember this, Blakely,

80
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,855
unless you buy up the whole 12 blocks,
you won't get a penny commission.

81
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,255
That man has got ice water in his veins.

82
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,591
Well, the description fits only one man.

83
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,843
I've simply got to get a hold
of that property, Bill.

84
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,262
You can't force a man
to sell his home, John.

85
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,514
I've got to.

86
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,433
I'll make him sell if I have
to drive him out with stink bombs.

87
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,437
Listen, a fortune has been invested
in those 12 blocks.

88
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,107
And behind it is one of the most
powerful men in the country,

89
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,483
and a silly old man,

90
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,153
with that silly little house
is holding up the whole business.

91
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,032
- Now, how do you like that?
- Excuse me, John, but I think it's great.

92
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,785
What did he say when you offered him
$50,000 for his place?

93
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,955
Well, I'm not sure,
but I think someone began singing.

94
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,331
Someone else danced

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,750
and Grandpa Vanderhof
sat down and played a mouth organ.

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,627
Played a mouth organ?

97
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,921
- What are they, a bunch of nuts?
- Fascinating ones.

98
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,591
- It's the old army game.
- I doubt it. He's not interested in money.

99
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,034
Mr. Vanderhof is here.

100
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,012
Have him come in right away.

101
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,264
How did you get him to come here?

102
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,558
Not interested in money?

103
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,227
Miss Jones, just a minute.
Don't send him in yet.

104
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,271
Have him wait a while.
Let him cool his heels.

105
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,372
Yes, sir.

106
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,860
- He'll just be a minute, Mr. Vanderhof.
- Thank you.

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,715
You imagine that guy wanting me
to split commission three ways.

108
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,487
- What are you doing?
- What?

109
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,285
My goodness. I made a mistake.

110
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,641
First time in 20 years.

111
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,291
That calls for the building to collapse,
I suppose?

112
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,874
- Have some.
- No, thank you. It'll spoil my appetite.

113
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,401
What are you doing that for?

114
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,904
I have to add up these figures
to see if they're right.

115
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,051
Why?

116
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,309
Why? Because they have to check
against these figures.

117
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,455
- Do you like this?
- Like it?

118
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,480
- This work you're doing.
- No, my goodness, no.

119
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,670
Land's sakes, what am I saying?

120
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,839
Well, why do you do it?

121
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,801
Look, they're very strict
in this office and I...

122
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,429
Tell me, isn't there something else
you'd rather be doing than this?

123
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,555
No.

124
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,600
Go along with you.
I don't believe a word you're saying.

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,295
Go on, tell me,
what would you rather be doing than this?

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,067
I make up things.

127
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,445
- Poetry?
- No. Just things.

128
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,718
Go on. Let me see some of them.

129
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,629
Say, that's kind of cute.

130
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,382
It is, isn't it? I made it up myself.

131
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,424
Yes.

132
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,636
I have a lot of other ideas
just like it.

133
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:29,766
Well, what do you mean
fooling around with those dull figures?

134
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,960
It seems to me, Mr....

135
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,938
"Poppins." Yes.

136
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,815
It seems to me, Mr. Poppins,

137
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,776
that is the kind of work
you ought to be doing.

138
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:44,097
Someday I'm going to do nothing else.
Someday, when my ship comes in.

139
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:49,953
How'd you like to come over to our house
and work on your gadgets?

140
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,621
Over to your house?

141
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,123
Well, I don't know. Thank you, but...

142
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,292
Go along. You'd love it.

143
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,545
Everybody over at our place
does just what he wants to do.

144
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,897
Really?

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
That must be wonderful.

146
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,343
But how would I live?

147
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,178
The same way we do.

148
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,930
The same way.

149
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,891
Well, who takes care of you?

150
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,246
The same one that takes care
of the lilies of the field, Mr. Poppins.

151
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:20,376
Except that we toy a little,
spin a little, have a barrel of fun.

152
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,195
If you want to,
come on over and become a lily, too.

153
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,424
A lily? Me? A lily of the field?

154
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,784
What's that?

155
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,163
Just a little something
Mr. Poppins whipped up.

156
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,248
Why, Mr. Poppins.

157
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,168
Hey, Ethel, come here. Take a look at this.
Alice, George, John.

158
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,503
- Isn't that the cutest thing.
- Did you do that? How in the world?

159
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,571
- Isn't that clever?
- Aren't you clever?

160
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,650
Where is he, Miss Jones?

161
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,994
What's going on here?

162
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,395
Well, well, welcome, welcome,
Mr. Vanderhof. Come right into my office.

163
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,815
- No, thanks, Mr. Blakely. I was just going.
- Going?

164
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,109
- Hello, Mr. Hughes.
- How do you do?

165
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,446
What's happened?
You were all right last time I saw you.

166
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,471
One of my granddaughters dared me
to slide down the banister.

167
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,203
Too bad, is it serious?

168
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,206
No, just a sprain or something.

169
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,750
The thing I like most about it
is the crutches.

170
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,004
I've been wanting to walk on them
ever since I was a kid, haven't you?

171
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,507
Yes. Yes, yes, must be a lot of fun.

172
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,385
Well, Mr. Vanderhof,
I believe we understand each other.

173
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,220
Now, I'm ready to do business.

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,039
Say, that's a bad twitch in your eye.

175
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,394
You've been working too hard.
You ought to take a vacation.

176
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,396
Well, if it's all the same to you,
Mr. Vanderhof,

177
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,939
let's quit playing games.

178
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,024
I'm a very busy man. Come...

179
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,970
A couple of weeks fishing
will fix up that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

180
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,116
Well, I've got to go to the graduation
exercises over at the university.

181
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,786
Look, I have a check here for $100,000.
Now, if you're interested...

182
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,788
- Have you been to one lately?
- No.

183
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,982
They're a truckload of fun.

184
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,086
You ought to hear the speeches.

185
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,860
Well, I'd better be going. I'll be late.

186
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,702
Look out for that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

187
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,685
Coming, Poppins?

188
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,105
I'd like to, but I don't think...
I'd better not.

189
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,880
- Yes, sir.
- This is all your fault. You and your toys.

190
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,216
You...

191
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,176
Wait a minute, please.

192
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,559
If you leave, Poppins,
you needn't come back.

193
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,362
Wait. Wait, wait.

194
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,361
The die is cast.

195
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,409
I'm a lily.

196
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,490
Have some popcorn.

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,482
Did your grandpa go
to the graduation exercises, Miss Essie?

198
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,834
Guess so.

199
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,112
I wonder how many folks Grandpa's gonna
bring home for dinner tonight.

200
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,616
I don't know. It all depends on
whether he goes walking in a park.

201
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,720
Well, let him bring 'em.
I'll be ready for them.

202
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,504
Mother, will you taste
a Love Dream for me?

203
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,606
Not now. I'm busy.

204
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,929
Do you have to make candy today, Essie?
It's so hot.

205
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,015
Well, Ed went out
and got a bunch of new orders.

206
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,183
How does it taste to you?

207
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,143
If this keeps up,
you'll be opening a store.

208
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,668
That's what Ed was saying last night,
but I said no.

209
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,258
No. I want to be a dancer.

210
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,366
Finish your second act yet,
Mrs. Sycamore?

211
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,035
No, I've got Cynthia
just entering the monastery.

212
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,411
I'll be right down, Mr. DePinna.

213
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,414
I just want to show my wife
these new firecrackers we made.

214
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,668
Look, Penny, we can make up a lot of these
before the Fourth of July

215
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,692
and sell them for 10 cents
a string. Watch.

216
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,149
Watch, Penny.

217
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,851
Nice?

218
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,977
Yes, Paul, dear.

219
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,895
I tell you, the kids will go
for those like hotcakes.

220
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:31,343
Mr. Sycamore, I'm afraid we've got
the powder chamber too near the balloon.

221
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,403
Let's go down to the cellar and try it.

222
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,131
Where's Grandpa? Let's ask Grandpa.

223
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,889
I ain't done nothing,
but I'm sure tired.

224
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,579
Yeah, you always tired. From what?
You was born tired.

225
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,039
Here, take this, you're just
in time enough to set the table.

226
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,018
I don't see why I got to do your work
just because we're engaged.

227
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,423
Donald, were you ever in a monastery?

228
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,448
No, I don't go no place much.
I'm on relief.

229
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,166
Hello, Momma.

230
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,498
What do you say, Donald boy?

231
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,791
Well, I delivered all the candy.
Where's my beautiful wife?

232
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,612
Lordy.

233
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,056
Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.

234
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,951
- I'm calling it Love Dreams.
- Boy, you're a whiz.

235
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,454
Wait 'til you listen to this tune.
It's been ringing in my ears all day.

236
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,955
- Come on back a minute, Essie.
- What tune is it?

237
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,833
This is sure a beauty.
I think you gonna like this hymn.

238
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,732
Let me turn
the little do-jigger on here.

239
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,793
I like that, Ed. Yours?

240
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,646
No, Chopin.

241
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,589
Got a lot of you in it.

242
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,049
What do you say there, Donald?

243
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:10,392
Well, you should have been there.
Everybody should have been there.

244
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,169
Hello, Grandpa. How's your foot?

245
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,897
How's my foot? Is that all I get?

246
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,344
Big class this year, Grandpa?

247
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,679
How many were there?

248
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,931
There must have been two acres.

249
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,749
Everybody graduated.

250
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,812
The speeches were a lot funnier
this year, too.

251
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,606
If you want to hear a good speech,
you ought to hear Father Divine.

252
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,380
Don't you worry.
They'll have him there yet.

253
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,850
See if this sounds any better to you,
Mr. DePinna.

254
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,315
Mr. Poppins, excuse me.

255
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:04,178
This is my granddaughter, Essie,
and this is her husband, Mr. Carmichael.

256
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,404
Hello.

257
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,056
What do you say, Mr. Poppins?

258
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,641
How do you do?

259
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,496
Help yourself to a Love Dream, Mr. Poppins.
They're over there on the table.

260
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,302
And this is my daughter, Mrs. Sycamore.

261
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,076
- This is Mr. Poppins, dear.
- How do you do?

262
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,726
Have a chair, Mr. Poppins.
Were you ever in a monastery?

263
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,416
In a monastery? Well, I...

264
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,168
What's the matter, Penny? Stuck?

265
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,192
Yes, I sort of got myself in a monastery
and I can't get out.

266
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,238
It'll come to you.
Remember how you got out of that jail?

267
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,453
That's fine, Ed.

268
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,972
Is Alice coming home to dinner?

269
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,265
She didn't say.

270
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,434
I think she ought to stop working
in that millinery shop.

271
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,036
They make her stay so late.

272
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,980
Penny, she hasn't been there
for five months.

273
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,548
She hasn't?

274
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,444
Isn't that a shame?
She was going to get me a hat I liked.

275
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,363
She works for bankers now.

276
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,682
Bankers? That's wonderful.

277
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,993
Essie's dancing teacher
wants to borrow $100 on his car.

278
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,119
Do you think she could fix it?

279
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,144
Sure, Kirby and Company
just loaned somebody $80 million.

280
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,743
I must speak to Alice about it.

281
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,817
Mr. DePinna was right.

282
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,027
The powder chamber
was too close to the balloon.

283
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,779
- Try a Love Dream, Father.
- No, thanks.

284
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,658
Mr. Poppins, this is Mr. Sycamore,
my son-in-law.

285
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,326
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

286
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,912
We're just testing a new skyrocket
and Mr. DePinna was saying...

287
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,996
Knew it all the time.

288
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,290
You can't have that powder chamber
so close.

289
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,584
Mr. Poppins, Mr. DePinna.

290
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,336
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

291
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,797
Mr. Poppins is going to stay
with us a while.

292
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,298
Really? How wonderful.

293
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,550
Just for a short time. You see...

294
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,887
Yes, that's what I thought, that day
nine years ago when I delivered the ice.

295
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,534
Nine years ago?

296
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,391
You were the ice man.

297
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,685
Mr. Poppins makes up things.

298
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,334
- Really, what sort of things?
- You do?

299
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,529
Say, that's wonderful.

300
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,489
Did you make that all by yourself?

301
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,574
That beats all.

302
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,576
I have other ideas, too. Better ones.

303
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,785
- You have?
- Yes.

304
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,287
- Let's go down to the shop.
- Yes, yes.

305
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,981
You have a shop? That's marvelous.

306
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,197
Mrs. Penny.

307
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,177
Why don't you write a play
about "ism" mania?

308
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,261
"Ism" mania?

309
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,971
Yes, sure.

310
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,827
You know, communism, fascism, voodooism,

311
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,000
everybody's got an "ism" these days.

312
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,732
I thought it was an itch or something.

313
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,005
Well, it's just as catching.

314
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,947
When things go a little bad nowadays,
you go out and get yourself an "ism,"

315
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,033
and you're in business.

316
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,388
I've got it. It might help Cynthia
to have an "ism" in the monastery.

317
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,848
It might at that.

318
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,854
Only give her Americanism.
Let her know something about Americans.

319
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,759
John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry,
Samuel Adams.

320
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,553
Washington, Jefferson, Monroe.

321
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:37,500
Lincoln, Grant, Lee,
Edison and Mark Twain.

322
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,665
When things got tough with those boys,
they didn't run around looking for "isms."

323
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,637
Lincoln said, "With malice toward none,
with charity for all."

324
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:56,178
Nowadays they say, "Think the way I do
or I'll bomb the daylights out of you."

325
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,210
Why don't you go back
to your war play, Mrs. Sycamore?

326
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,711
I like that one best.

327
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,280
Really, Rheba? Well, maybe I will.

328
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,236
Hello. Miss Alice Sycamore, please.

329
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,272
You know, every once in a while
I get a very strange sensation.

330
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,000
I seem to hear a ringing in my ears.

331
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,820
Me, too. I thought for a moment
it was the telephone.

332
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,172
Yeah.

333
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,057
I hear voices, too.

334
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,495
Voices that say, "If you don't
kiss her soon, you're a chump."

335
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,581
You know, if I were really clever,

336
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,417
I could answer the phone
without the use of my hands.

337
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,815
I saw it done in a circus once.

338
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,234
Good.

339
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,342
That's wonderful.
You'd be a sensation on a trapeze.

340
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,761
Mr. Anthony Kirby Junior's office.

341
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,740
Now, that's clever the way you say that.

342
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,287
Hello, Rheba.

343
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,518
No, Rheba.

344
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,562
Were you ever in a monastery?

345
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,896
Monastery.

346
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,568
No, but I'm the fellow
that got caught in a cave once.

347
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

348
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,637
Whatever happened to you?

349
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,305
Well, the cave caved in
and I haven't been heard from since.

350
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,247
Mrs. Kirby.

351
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,417
Hello, Mr. Hammond.
I'm just going in to see my son, Tony.

352
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,647
Well, he's a very busy man nowadays.
I doubt if you can see him.

353
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,176
Dinner? Just a minute, Rheba.
Wants to know if I will be home for dinner.

354
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,825
- No, no, no.
- The man says no, Rheba.

355
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,557
Tell Grandpa that I love him
just as much as ever,

356
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,332
but a terrible, young vice president
has me in his power.

357
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,713
Of course I'm struggling, Rheba.

358
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,547
It would do your heart good
to see me struggle, Rheba.

359
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,220
Hello, Mother.

360
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,232
If you'll excuse me, I think
I'll visit with your father for a while.

361
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,156
- Busy, wasn't he?
- Definitely.

362
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,413
Goodbye, Rheba.
The ceiling just fell in.

363
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,878
Would you be so kind as to give me
the want ad section of the newspaper?

364
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,616
I'm sorry, Alice.

365
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,310
Checks to be countersigned, Mr. Kirby.

366
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,975
I wouldn't mind his carrying on
right in the office,

367
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,560
but he's getting serious about her.

368
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,146
Why, Miriam, it'll be bigger
than steel and can together.

369
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,981
Talked to me for hours
about her last night.

370
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,232
Answer those.

371
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,692
- Who?
- Tony.

372
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,592
Talked to me for hours about his secretary.
Told me he was...

373
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,740
- Yes?
- Mr. Ramsey to see you.

374
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,824
Well, I'm too busy.

375
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,993
- He says he's in trouble.
- I don't care if he is in trouble.

376
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,310
Anthony.

377
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,998
Yes, yes, about Tony.
Well, I'll speak to him.

378
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,082
That was Ramsey.

379
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,334
Just found out what's up,
and is he screaming for help.

380
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,628
But in the meantime,
what about this girl?

381
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,838
No.

382
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,631
What sort of a family is she from?

383
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,885
- Who? The secretary?
- Yes. Not steel or can, or Ramsey, or...

384
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,137
All right, all right.
Don't get so excited about it.

385
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,640
The girl's a stenographer.
Boys like Tony don't marry stenographers.

386
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,619
Anthony, we've got to do something
about this girl.

387
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,103
All right, I'll fire her.

388
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,565
This isn't a business deal.
You can't settle anything by firing the girl.

389
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,234
All right, then I won't fire her. Hello.

390
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,802
No, no, no, I didn't mean you.

391
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,412
- You weren't going out, were you?
- Yes. I thought I...

392
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,935
We had a date, don't you remember?

393
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,833
I'm sorry. I forgot.

394
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,337
Yeah, we ought to discuss where to go,
don't you think?

395
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,630
- Well, I...
- Yeah, yeah,

396
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,175
we can't just pop out of the building
with no place to go.

397
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,198
That's a very bad idea that,
you know I...

398
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,515
I knew two people that did that once.
They went out of the building.

399
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:31,018
They were uncertain, so they just walked
and walked, and walked

400
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,396
and finally they just died of hunger.

401
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,690
Now, you wouldn't want
anything like that to happen.

402
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,884
Because if that happened...

403
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,090
You're so beautiful.

404
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,886
Sometimes you're so beautiful
it just gags me.

405
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,163
Maybe you're not real.
Maybe you're a phantom or something.

406
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,641
I keep expecting you to vanish.

407
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,919
Look, you better sit down
over here, I think, for a while.

408
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,523
Phantoms don't vanish very often
in a sitting position.

409
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,696
There. Now, wait a minute.

410
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,824
Here.

411
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,576
Here.

412
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,955
Now, let's see.

413
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,510
That's a very lovely picture.

414
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,951
- Tony, I...
- Now, wait a minute. Don't say anything.

415
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,661
Now look, phantom.

416
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,562
Last night I informed that irate lady
that was just in your office a minute ago

417
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,731
that I was going to marry you.

418
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,575
I don't remember you telling it to me.

419
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,574
No, well, you didn't ask me.

420
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,638
That's right, I didn't.

421
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,973
No, but she did.

422
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,392
I talked about you so much
that she finally said,

423
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,060
"Well, now the next thing
I expect to hear from you

424
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,312
"is that you're gonna marry the girl."

425
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,040
And I said, "Yeah, that's it exactly."

426
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,130
- What did she say?
- Nothing. Nothing.

427
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,320
Just fainted dead away?

428
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,923
No, no. No, she took it standing up.

429
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,257
You know, if you scratch
under the surface here

430
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,951
you'll find a proposal lying around.

431
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,131
I admit it's kind of left-handed.

432
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,220
I can't help that. I'm sort of
a left-handed guy, you know.

433
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,680
Tony.

434
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,035
What about them?

435
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,453
Mother and Dad?

436
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,581
Did you see the way she looked at me?
I know just what she was thinking.

437
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,916
Now, Alice. Now, listen now.

438
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,626
There seems to be the impression
around here

439
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,962
that the Kirbys are ogres or something.

440
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,964
Well, if they are,
that doesn't make any difference to me.

441
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,257
They're just putty in my hands, Alice.

442
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,718
I never in my life wanted anything
that I couldn't get

443
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,261
if I just yelled loud enough.

444
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,930
Worked like a charm when I was a baby,

445
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,057
and since then I've had so much practice
that I'm terrific.

446
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,830
Here, I'll give you a general idea.

447
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,670
Tony.

448
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,517
There's one little detail
I forgot to mention.

449
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,811
I love you, Alice.

450
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,572
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Hey, Grandpa.

451
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:56,703
Yes, I have some Love Dreams.

452
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,893
There he is. That's him.
The man with the crutches.

453
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,438
- You've got to get something on him.
- What do you want us to do with him?

454
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,480
I don't care what you do with him,

455
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,691
just so you make him sell that property,
that's all.

456
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,443
Hello, Grandpa, how's the foot?

457
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,279
Hello, Mac. Fine, thanks.

458
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,948
Say, what's the meeting
over at Jensen's bakery?

459
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,576
They're all excited about having
to move out or something.

460
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,412
- Move out?
- Yes, that's what I've heard.

461
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,264
They're coming over to see you now,
I guess.

462
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,628
Did you hear about it, Grandpa?
We maybe all have to move.

463
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,671
Who said so?

464
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,007
- Maggie just...
- Everybody around here is talking about it.

465
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,133
Somebody's buying up everything here.

466
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,302
I hear they're trying to buy it up
for a big factory or something.

467
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,138
My landlord told me he wouldn't have sold
only they offered him so much money.

468
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,015
Nobody wants to move, Grandpa.
You know that.

469
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,727
- Emil put up some new shelves. Cost $60.
- I've been here for 20 years, Grandpa.

470
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,457
- I think we ought to see somebody about it.
- Now, wait a minute. Don't get excited.

471
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,026
We've all been neighbors
for a long time. I know that.

472
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,112
But if they're buying this property up
for a factory,

473
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,323
they'll need every foot of ground,
won't they?

474
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,407
I guess so.

475
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,744
Well, now, suppose I won't sell 'em my place.
What are they going to do?

476
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,038
- That's right, you own your place.
- Sure, I do.

477
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,623
And they're going to need it,
too, won't they?

478
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:06,919
You bet they will, and it'll take more
than money to make me sell my property.

479
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,045
That's my boy.

480
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:13,072
Go on, get back to work and stop cluttering
up the street, or we'll all be arrested.

481
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,547
I'm sure we need more displays this year.
We've got nothing exciting enough.

482
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,697
Mr. Sycamore, if I may suggest,
why not the "Russian Revolution?"

483
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,991
There's plenty of fireworks there.

484
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,974
The "Russian Revolution," the clash
of the colors, the reds and the whites.

485
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,226
Mr. Poppins,
you've hit on something brilliant.

486
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,103
I don't understand.

487
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,565
A letter for me? Must be some mistake.

488
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,358
It had your name on it.

489
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,402
Where is it?

490
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,196
- I don't know. Where's Grandpa's letter?
- What, dear?

491
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,674
I said, where's that letter
that came for Grandpa last week?

492
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,242
Last week?

493
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,640
I don't know.
I remember seeing the kittens with it.

494
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,788
Who was it from? Did you notice?

495
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,123
The United States Government.

496
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:30,043
Really? I wonder what they wanted.

497
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
There was one before that
that came from the same people.

498
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,924
I can't imagine
what they'd be writing me for.

499
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,262
It seems to me that you could put
your printing to some practical use.

500
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,864
Wait a minute.

501
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,874
I have another idea.

502
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,686
That wasn't very loud, was it?

503
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,479
We can get it louder than that.

504
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,315
What is your idea, Mr. Poppins?

505
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,984
- Well, may I tell it?
- Yes.

506
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,777
Go back to work, Jim.
Go on, back to work.

507
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,488
Why shouldn't Ed
print something about the fireworks

508
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,324
and put it in the candy boxes?

509
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,993
That would advertise the Revolution,
wouldn't it?

510
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:07,289
Say, "Watch for the Revolution.
It's coming soon." How's that?

511
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,626
"Watch for the Revolution. It's coming soon."
Now I can use my big type.

512
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,129
We've got plenty of these Red Flags.
You can write about them.

513
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,609
The Red Flag will sweep the country.
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."

514
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,277
Ed made up a beautiful song today
by Chopin.

515
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,072
Hello, Miss Alice. Anybody get hurt
when the ceiling fell in?

516
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,991
Forks on the left, forks on the left
Forks on the left, forks on the left

517
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,534
Rheba, Rheba forks on the left

518
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,229
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."
How's that sound, Alice?

519
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,334
Gather 'round, everybody.
It's the town crier.

520
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,732
- The town crier.
- What is it?

521
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,718
Gather around, everybody.

522
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,470
Where's Grandpa?
I have an announcement to make.

523
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,846
Well, what is it?

524
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,431
A young gentleman is calling for me.

525
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,975
Is that all, Alice?

526
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,185
Wait a minute.
Maybe he's a special young gentleman.

527
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,687
You may go to the head
of the class, Essie.

528
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,147
Well, what's special about him?
Has he got horns or something?

529
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,525
- Maybe he's handsome like Ed.
- I'd better put a tie on.

530
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,610
- Where'd you meet him?
- Rheba, Rheba, set another place.

531
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,614
No. Mother, we're going out.
I thought he'd better take you in easy doses.

532
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,534
And, Mother, please, don't read
any of your plays to him

533
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,785
the first time he comes,

534
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,079
because, well, I like him.

535
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,581
Essie, I wouldn't dance
for him if I were you,

536
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,918
because we're going
to the Monte Carlo Ballet later.

537
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,253
Anybody know what time it is?

538
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,589
Well, it was 5:00
about two hours ago, wasn't it?

539
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,174
Never mind.

540
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,652
- Where's Grandpa?
- He's upstairs.

541
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,722
Incidentally, the young man's name
is Tony Kirby.

542
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,890
Let me know the minute he comes.

543
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,144
- Tony Kirby? Say, that's the boss's son.
- Really?

544
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,813
Yes, and she told me
they've just made him vice president.

545
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,356
Isn't that wonderful?

546
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,775
We could have the wedding right here
in this room.

547
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,569
Now, wait a minute, Penny.

548
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,738
This is the first time he's called
for the girl.

549
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,531
Well, you only called for me once.

550
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,700
Well, I know,
but young folks are different nowadays.

551
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,180
I don't know. Look at Ed and me.
He came to dinner once and just stayed.

552
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,415
That's right.

553
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,876
Yeah, and the whole Alabama
football team would have stayed, too

554
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,025
if you'd had 10 more Essies.
How am I doing, Essie?

555
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:30,599
Well, there's a lot of fuss being made
about a young man taking you out to dinner.

556
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,268
What's so exciting about that?

557
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,228
A proposal is exciting.

558
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,580
Proposal?

559
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,917
Well, that's something very different.

560
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,338
Move over there and give me some room.

561
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,928
Stop messing with that package.
And let's get down to cases.

562
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,396
In love?

563
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,833
Well, well, I...

564
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,211
"Well, I," my foot.

565
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,530
Either you are or you aren't.

566
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,070
Let me look at your eyes.

567
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,700
Yes, of course.

568
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,932
Now, come on, tell me all about it.

569
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,252
What kind of a boy is he?
Do you have fun together?

570
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,539
Well, that's no answer to any question.

571
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,750
Is he nice?

572
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,029
Can't even talk about him, can you?

573
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,489
Not rationally.

574
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,308
Who's asking you to be rational?

575
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,348
Listen,

576
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:37,308
when I was courting your grandmother,
it took me two years to propose.

577
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,643
You know why?

578
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,463
The moment she'd walk into a room,
my knees buckled.

579
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:48,694
The blood would rush up into my head
and the walls would start to dance.

580
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,888
Twice I keeled over in a dead faint.

581
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,223
Why, Grandpa.

582
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:58,353
Yeah, she finally dragged it out of me
when I was in bed with a 104-fever

583
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,626
and in a state of hysteria.

584
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,899
The moment she accepted,

585
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,469
the fever went down to normal
and I hopped out of bed.

586
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:12,017
The case was written up in all the medical
journals as the phenomenon of the times.

587
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,663
There was nothing phenomenal about it.
I just had it bad, that's all.

588
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,082
And I never got over it either.

589
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,559
No, sir.

590
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,713
Right up to the very last,
she couldn't walk into a room

591
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:29,660
without my heart going
thump, thump, thump.

592
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,037
You darling.

593
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,124
I wish I'd known her.

594
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,499
What was she like?

595
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,755
Look in there.

596
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,881
This was her room, too.

597
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,511
Did you ever notice
the peculiar fragrance in here?

598
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,143
Yes, but I never knew what it was.

599
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,527
It's hers. It's never left here.
She hasn't either.

600
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:09,240
I can still hear the tinkle
of her thin little voice

601
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,535
and see her eyes laughing.

602
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:19,039
That's the reason I've lived in this house
so many years and could never move out.

603
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,417
It would be like moving out on Grandma.

604
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,045
You go on back
to that infernal package of yours.

605
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,951
Now, wait just a minute. It's for you.

606
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,428
- For me?
- Yes.

607
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:42,916
Why, bless my soul.
It's a new harmonica.

608
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,794
- That's for your birthday.
- My birthday?

609
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:49,923
How do you know when my birthday is?
I don't even know myself.

610
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:53,093
Anytime I get an impulse to buy you
a present, that's your birthday.

611
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,070
Well, thanks, darling.

612
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,580
Grandpa.

613
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,851
Grandpa, I hope you like him.

614
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,814
Anybody you fall in love with
is all right with me, Alice.

615
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,316
- You know that.
- Thanks, Grandpa.

616
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,714
Incidentally, what's his name?

617
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,841
Tony Kirby.

618
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,092
- Not the son of "the" Kirby?
- Yes.

619
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,662
Pretty snooty outfit, aren't they?

620
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,915
Yes, but it's all right.
Tony told his mother all about it.

621
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,961
It doesn't matter, I'm so happy.
I can't think about anything.

622
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,655
You go right on being happy.

623
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:35,027
Yes, I think I'll go downstairs
and take a whack at this.

624
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,846
I wonder where Alice's boyfriend is.

625
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,042
- Isn't that the doorbell?
- Doorbell's ringing.

626
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,628
- Get the doorbell, somebody.
- Want me to go?

627
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,340
Never mind, everybody. I'm coming.
I'll answer it. It's all right, Rheba. I'll go.

628
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,051
Grandpa, he's here. Alice's young man.

629
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,678
Now, remember what she said.
Everybody be nice to him.

630
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:22,390
That's the first time
that doorbell's rung since Halloween.

631
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,992
Pipe, pipe.

632
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,230
- Welcome to our little home.
- How do you do?

633
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,506
I'm Alice's mother. Come right in.
Everybody's dying to know you.

634
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,403
Now, here we are.

635
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,281
That is Grandpa,
and that is Alice's father,

636
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,076
Alice's sister and her husband,
Ed Carmichael.

637
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,911
Let me take your hat
and make yourself at home.

638
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,288
- I'm afraid there's been some mistake.
- How's that?

639
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,640
My card.

640
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,794
"Wilbur G. Henderson.
Internal Revenue Dept."

641
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,191
Well, for heaven's sake.

642
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,840
- I'm looking for Martin Vanderhof.
- Right here, sir.

643
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,759
Excuse me. I've got some work to do.

644
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,843
Mind if I sit down?

645
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,887
Sit right down, sir. Sit down.

646
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:05,433
Mr. Vanderhof, the government wants to talk
to you about a little matter of income tax.

647
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,726
Income tax?

648
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,203
Is that Mr. Kirby, Mother?

649
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,874
No, dear, it's an internal
something or other.

650
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,792
Pardon me.

651
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,486
Mr. Vanderhof, we've written you
several letters about this,

652
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,655
but we've received no reply.

653
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,305
That's what those letters were.
Did you hear that, Penny?

654
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,161
This is the party
that's been writing to me.

655
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,732
Well, it's not me, Mr. Vanderhof.
You see, the Internal Revenue Office...

656
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,294
- That must be him now.
- Doorbell's ringing again.

657
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,630
- I heard the doorbell.
- Are you all right?

658
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,465
Want me to go?

659
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,067
Pipe, pipe.

660
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,767
- How do you do, Mr. Kirby? Come right in.
- Thank you.

661
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,915
We've been expecting you.

662
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,731
- You are Mr. Kirby, aren't you?
- Yes.

663
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,401
Well, thank heavens. Here he is.
This is really Mr. Kirby.

664
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:01,098
This is Alice's father, her grandfather,
her sister Essie, Essie's husband.

665
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,158
Won't you sit down, Mr. Kirby?

666
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,510
Yes.

667
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,694
- Mother, is that Mr. Kirby, Mother?
- Yes, dear. He's lovely.

668
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,046
I'll be right down.

669
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,195
- She'll be right down.
- Well, thank you very much.

670
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,194
Well...

671
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,368
- Do y'all play football?
- A little, yeah.

672
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,019
Gosh, you're... You're awful young
to be a vice president.

673
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,271
Well, you know what that means,
vice president...

674
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,841
All I have is just an office
with my name on the door.

675
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,360
Is that all?

676
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,655
I have a secretary.
A very lovely secretary, too.

677
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,598
Isn't that sweet, Ed?

678
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,391
How about salary?
Don't you get any salary?

679
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,939
A little. More than I'm worth,
I'm afraid.

680
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,085
I beg your pardon.

681
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,904
Well, I suppose you're ready
to settle down and get married now?

682
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,383
Come now, Penny.
I'm sure Mr. Kirby knows his own mind.

683
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,552
You mustn't rush him, Mother.

684
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,158
All I meant was, he's bound to get married,
and suppose the wrong girl gets him.

685
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,893
Mr. Vanderhof, I've got to be going.

686
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,063
Too bad. I'm sorry
you can't stay to dinner.

687
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,481
Drop in again.

688
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,834
If you don't mind, I'd like to settle
my business before I go.

689
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,611
He's selling something
for the government.

690
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,863
What can I do for you?

691
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:29,953
Mr. Vanderhof, our records show
that you've never paid any income tax.

692
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,976
- That's right.
- Why not?

693
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,352
I don't believe in it.

694
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,608
You don't believe in it?

695
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,633
Mr. Sycamore, I can't get these things
to go off. Look.

696
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,176
Not now, Mr. DePinna.

697
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,574
No, no. Not now, Mr. DePinna.
Grandpa's busy.

698
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,332
- Mr. Kirby. Mr. DePinna.
- How do you do, sir?

699
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,309
Mr. Kirby, of course.

700
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,980
Didn't I read something about your father?
He was indicted or something, wasn't he?

701
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,858
No, he just testified
before the Securities Commission.

702
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,193
- I thought the cops had got him.
- No.

703
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,611
Come along, Mr. DePinna. Come on.

704
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,946
Now see here, Mr. Vanderhof.

705
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,722
Whether you believe it or not, you owe
the government 22 years back income taxes.

706
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,329
Hey, wait a minute, mister. That's too
far back. That's outlawed, ain't it?

707
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,456
- What's your name?
- What difference does that make?

708
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,126
- Did you ever file an income tax return?
- No, sir.

709
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,460
What was your income last year?

710
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,404
- I don't know, about $85, wasn't it, Essie?
- I don't know.

711
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,029
Well...

712
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,950
Now, Mr. Vanderhof, that's a very
serious thing, not filing an income tax return.

713
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,891
Now, suppose I do pay you this money.

714
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:37,747
Mind you, I don't say that I'm going to,
but just for the sake of argument,

715
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,814
what's the government
going to do with it?

716
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,484
- What do you mean?
- Well, what do I get for my money?

717
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,781
For instance, if I go into a department
store and buy something,

718
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,600
why, there it is. I can see it.

719
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,769
But what are they going to give me?

720
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,498
The government gives you everything.
It protects you.

721
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,583
From what?

722
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,668
Well, invasion.

723
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,837
How do you think the government's
gonna keep up the Army and Navy

724
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,611
- with all those battleships?
- Battleships?

725
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,345
Last time we used battleships
was in the Spanish-American War

726
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:15,016
and what did we get out of that? Cuba.
And we gave that back.

727
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,436
Why, I wouldn't mind paying
for something sensible.

728
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,271
Something sensible.

729
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,899
What about Congress and the Supreme Court
and the President?

730
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,567
We've got to pay them, don't we?

731
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,841
Not with my money, no, sir.

732
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,699
Now... Now, wait a minute.
I didn't come here to argue with you.

733
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,201
Hello, everybody.

734
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,827
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello, Alice.

735
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,246
- Is everybody acquainted with everybody?
- Yes, indeed.

736
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,896
We've had a most delightful talk
about love and marriage.

737
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,586
- I'm sorry. I tried to hurry.
- No, come on, wait.

738
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,796
Look, Mr. Vanderhof.

739
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,715
All I know is you haven't
paid an income tax,

740
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,863
and you've got to pay it.

741
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,011
What was that?

742
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,472
I said you've got to pay it.

743
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,371
Well, you've got to show me.

744
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,062
We don't have to show you.
I just told you.

745
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,355
Who's going to pay
for all those buildings

746
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,607
down in Washington
and interstate commerce

747
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,401
and the Constitution?

748
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,654
The Constitution has been paid for
years ago.

749
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,225
And as for interstate commerce...
What is interstate commerce anyway?

750
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,392
There are 48 states, see?

751
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,082
And if it weren't
for interstate commerce,

752
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:25,028
nothing could go
from one state to another. See?

753
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,235
Well, why not? Have they got fences?

754
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,555
No, they haven't got fences.
They've got laws.

755
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:39,285
Holy smokes, I never ran across
anything like this before.

756
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,355
Well, I might pay you about $75,

757
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,708
but it isn't worth a cent more.

758
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,069
You'll pay every cent
just like anybody else.

759
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,822
Now, listen to me. You'll go to jail
if you don't pay, do you hear that?

760
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:53,948
That's law.

761
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,033
If you think you're bigger than the law,

762
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,325
you've got another thing coming.

763
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,618
You're just the same as anybody else.

764
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,016
And the sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

765
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,691
Holy smokes!

766
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,958
My father makes fireworks in the cellar.

767
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,913
- How did that sound to you?
- Pretty good.

768
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,630
Thanks.

769
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,733
Well, I guess we'd better
be going, Tony.

770
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,153
- Say, he was pretty mad, wasn't he?
- He certainly was.

771
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,073
That might get you into an awful
lot of trouble, Mr. Vanderhof.

772
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,677
No, not me. I was only
having fun with him.

773
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,079
I don't owe the government a cent.

774
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,207
- Well, we're going. Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

775
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,084
Hello, everybody.

776
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,276
Hello, Kolenkhov.

777
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:54,175
You know, never have I seen you look
more magnificent.

778
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,720
Thank you. Mr. Kirby, this is Mr. Kolenkhov,
Essie's dancing teacher.

779
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,013
- How do you do, sir?
- I do not know you,

780
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,474
- but you are a very lucky man.
- Thank you.

781
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,476
I practiced today, Mr. Kolenkhov.

782
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,294
My Pavlova.

783
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,732
Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?

784
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,859
You are in time for dinner, yes.

785
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,947
Well, goodbye, Mr. Kolenkhov.
We're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet.

786
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,642
The Monte Carlo Ballet? It stinks.

787
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,811
Yes? Well...

788
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,164
- Well, good night, everybody.
- Good night.

789
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,374
- Good night.
- Good night.

790
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,566
Bye.

791
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,460
The Monte Carlo Ballet.

792
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,153
Dinner's ready.

793
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,093
My little Rheba,
what would I do without my angel?

794
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,513
Only three shirts this time, but they must be
washed by your beautiful little hands.

795
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,957
And would you sew on two little buttons
on one of them?

796
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,228
Monte Carlo Ballet. Sergei Diaghilev.
Then you have ballet.

797
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,456
Quiet, please.

798
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,419
Quiet.

799
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,735
Well, sir. Here we are again.

800
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,656
We've been getting on pretty good
for quite a while now.

801
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,975
We're certainly much obliged.

802
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:05,413
Looks like Alice is going to get married,
and I think she'll be very happy,

803
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:09,768
because we just met the boy you sent her
and he looks fine.

804
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:15,941
Remember, all we ask is just to go along
the way we are and keep our health.

805
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,912
As far as anything else is concerned,
we leave that up to you.

806
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,412
Thank you.

807
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,267
Well, Kolenkhov,
did you bring me any Russian stamps?

808
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,792
No. Nobody writes to me.
They're all dead.

809
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,447
I was just thinking about that family
of yours.

810
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,823
Living with them must be like

811
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,451
living in a world that
Walt Disney might have thought of.

812
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,786
Everybody does just as he pleases,
doesn't he?

813
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,874
Yes, Grandpa started it.
He just suddenly left business one day.

814
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,125
He started up in the elevator,

815
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,711
turned 'round, came right down again
and never went back.

816
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,048
He could have been a rich man,
but he said he wasn't having any fun.

817
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,716
That's wonderful.

818
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,511
Then he started collecting stamps,
because that's what he liked best.

819
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,223
You know, he gets paid
just to appraise collections.

820
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,767
- He's an expert.
- That's marvelous.

821
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:12,589
My dad, he makes fireworks because,
well, because he never grew up, I guess.

822
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,816
And, Mother.
Do you know why Mother writes plays?

823
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,527
Probably likes literature
and good books.

824
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:23,449
No, because eight years ago, a typewriter
was delivered to the house by mistake.

825
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,766
No...

826
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,828
If it had been a plow,
she'd have taken up farming?

827
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,351
I'm sure of it, if she'd liked it.

828
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,525
This is making conversation,
but weren't we supposed to go to the ballet?

829
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,491
Yes. Well, let's see.

830
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,613
Yes, second seat over, miss.

831
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:57,441
I can talk and I can listen, or I can
just sit. What will you have?

832
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,714
Well, I think I'd like
to have this first.

833
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,918
Well, Mr. Moody,
what are you thinking about?

834
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,361
Me? No...

835
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,363
That family of yours.
Boy, they knocked me for a loop.

836
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,694
I don't know.

837
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:29,832
It just seems like, in their own way,
they've found what everybody's looking for.

838
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,727
People spend their whole lives
building castles in the air

839
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,645
and then nothing ever comes of them.

840
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,497
Wonder why that is?

841
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,091
Well, it takes courage.

842
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,173
Everybody's afraid to live. You know?

843
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,239
You ought to hear Grandpa
on that subject.

844
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,408
You know, he says most people nowadays
are run by fear,

845
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,160
fear of what they eat,
fear of what they drink,

846
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,954
fear of their jobs, their future,
fear of their health.

847
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,291
They're scared to save money,
and scared to spend it.

848
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,918
- You know what his pet aversion is?
- What?

849
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,421
That people who commercialize on fear,
you know, they scare you to death

850
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,173
so they can sell you something
you don't need.

851
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,050
Yeah, I agree with him.

852
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,200
So he kind of taught all of us
not to be afraid of anything

853
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,767
and to do what we want to do,
and, well, it's kind of fun, anyway.

854
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,811
Yeah, well that's it,
but that takes courage.

855
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,256
Especially that
do-what-you-want-to-do department.

856
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,679
I remember in college,
another guy and I had an idea to...

857
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,116
Mind if I talk about myself?

858
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,014
If you don't, I will.

859
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,308
Well, this guy and I had this idea.

860
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,465
We wanted to find out

861
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,909
what made the grass grow green.

862
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,136
Now, that sounds silly and everything,

863
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,305
but that's the biggest research problem
in the world today.

864
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,248
And I'll tell you why.

865
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:58,604
Because there's a tiny little engine
in the green of this grass

866
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,148
and in the green of the trees

867
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,650
that has the mysterious gift

868
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,847
of being able to take energy
from the rays of the sun and store it up.

869
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:14,100
You see, that's how the heat, and power
in coal, and oil, and wood, is stored up.

870
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,667
Well, we thought
if we could find the secret

871
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,671
of all those millions of little engines
in this green stuff,

872
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,881
we can make big ones,

873
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,676
and then we could take
all the power we could ever need

874
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,094
right from the sun's rays.

875
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,220
You see?

876
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,540
- That's wonderful. I never knew that.
- Yeah, yeah.

877
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,460
We worked on it and worked

878
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,666
day and night.
We got so excited we forgot to sleep.

879
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,836
If we'd make just one little discovery,

880
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,385
we'd walk on air for days.

881
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,635
Yeah, then what?

882
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,473
Well, then we left school.

883
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,651
And now he's selling automobiles

884
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,902
and I'm in some strange thing
called banking.

885
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,820
I saw him a couple of weeks ago.

886
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,372
Poor guy. Bob Smith is his name.

887
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,832
Got all excited again,
wanted to talk about nothing else.

888
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,998
And?

889
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,470
Well, he's married,
and his wife just had a baby.

890
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:34,179
Didn't think it was fair to gamble
with the future.

891
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:40,018
Anyway, that's his excuse
for lack of courage.

892
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,610
Don't say it. What's my excuse?

893
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:50,783
Well, the Kirbys have been bankers
for 9,000 years or something.

894
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,552
And that line just can't be broken.

895
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:58,328
Now, that's been pounded into my head
until I have softening of the brain.

896
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,169
That's my excuse.

897
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,673
Tony, that's kind of silly,
you're pretty young to...

898
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,777
Besides, I resent what you said
about your brain.

899
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,845
I think it's beautiful.

900
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,515
You do?

901
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,743
You don't say.

902
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:23,191
That's probably the first thing you noticed
about me, that you liked my colossal brain.

903
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:29,338
Well, no. No, it was the back
of your head.

904
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,756
- Back of my head?
- Yes.

905
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,467
- Nothing but a big bump back there.
- The shape of it.

906
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,411
Well, what happened
when I turned around?

907
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,557
Well, I figured
I'd just have to get used to that.

908
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,034
You figured?

909
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,437
I figured it might not take very long,
but I figured I'd just...

910
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,962
- You just figured that you'd get used to it?
- Yes.

911
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,928
- I'm glad you figured.
- Yes.

912
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,328
What do you say, mister?
Want to learn to do the Big Apple?

913
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,648
- That's against the law, you know?
- So is necking.

914
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,502
- How much is it?
- Ten cents.

915
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,275
Wouldn't do it for a nickel, would you?

916
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,593
I get it.

917
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,844
Can you do the Big Apple?

918
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,804
- No, can you?
- No.

919
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,349
All right. I'll take a chance.
There you are. What do we do?

920
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,518
You just watch them.
It's a lead pipe cinch.

921
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,122
Okay, Red.
You and Snoopy. Make it hot. Let her go.

922
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,667
You just watch them.

923
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,839
Yeah.

924
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,096
Okay. Dorothy, you take this man.

925
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,041
- Come on, wiggle.
- Wiggle?

926
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,167
Point your toe.

927
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,144
- Which toe?
- That one.

928
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,449
Come on, wiggle!

929
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,677
It's no good unless you wiggle.

930
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,030
That's right. Wiggle.

931
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,849
- Swell.
- Swell.

932
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,246
The winner.

933
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,812
- Come on.
- Take it easy, Alice.

934
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,897
- You ready?
- Ready.

935
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,045
- You all set now? And...
- Yep.

936
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,653
Shuffle, and shuffle, and move around.

937
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,072
Break, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

938
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,675
Step, kick, step, kick,
one, two, three...

939
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,494
Come on, sister, loosen up.
You're too stiff.

940
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,188
Yeah, Alice. Loosen up. That's it.

941
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,768
Very good. The new champion.

942
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,323
All right. Grab your partners.

943
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,154
Wonder whatever happened
to Astaire and Rogers.

944
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,823
Jiggers, the cops.

945
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,723
Some swank.

946
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,311
I've never been here before.

947
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,800
Good evening, Mr. Kirby. Good evening.

948
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,302
Say, we seem to be attracting
a little attention.

949
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,514
No. It isn't you they are watching.
It's Lord Melville.

950
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:26,890
- Lord Melville?
- Yes.

951
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,994
- Where is he?
- At your table with your father.

952
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,940
Now, Tony, don't ask me to go over there
because I won't.

953
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,276
- No, no, no, Alice. It will be all right.
- No, I...

954
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,596
I want you to meet
a four-star blueblood. Come on.

955
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,122
Good evening.

956
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,332
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Tony.

957
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,002
- No, please. Please sit down.
- Please be seated.

958
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,504
My son, Tony, and Miss...

959
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,339
- Alice...
- Sycamore, Sycamore. Alice Sycamore.

960
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,674
Sycamore, of course.

961
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,969
I never could remember names.
Lord and Lady Melville.

962
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,117
- How do you do? How are you?
- How do you do, sir?

963
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,390
Governor Leach and Mrs. Leach.

964
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,584
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you. How do you do?

965
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:12,895
Nice party.

966
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,731
- A couple of chairs, please.
- No, just a table for two.

967
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,675
- Yes, sir.
- Just want a table for two.

968
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,736
What do you have there, sir? A new game?

969
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:24,364
No, no. I was just seeing
how far I could trace my family tree.

970
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,200
For some reason your mother
was interested.

971
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,036
I thought all that family tree stuff
went out with the buffalo.

972
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,914
- Good.
- How can you be so absurd, Tony.

973
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:35,292
Why, America is more and more conscious
of its background.

974
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,629
It cost me $5,000 last year
to trace my family tree.

975
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,776
Really?

976
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,302
And you, Miss Sycamore.
Have you a family tree?

977
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,553
- Me?
- Yes.

978
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,888
Why... Why...

979
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,367
My dear sir, don't you know
that a sycamore is a tree?

980
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:57,964
No comment.

981
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,342
Good night.

982
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,087
Good night.

983
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,636
Good night.

984
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,804
Boy, there are going to be some questions
asked about my family, and their tree.

985
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:32,015
- I can just feel it.
- Good, I know all the answers.

986
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,267
You know, if we're honest now,

987
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,769
we're gonna save ourselves
a lot of embarrassment later.

988
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,963
Tony, I want you to invite them
to my house.

989
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,858
So that's what has been on your mind?

990
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:45,153
Give them an opportunity to meet everybody,
and then they'll know us.

991
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,115
All right. I think I can arrange that.

992
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:52,286
Let's see now, I can put each member
of your family in a separate cage

993
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:55,539
and then put tags on them and the Kirbys
can parade up and down like this.

994
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,623
Tony.

995
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,959
Well, do you think I'm going to put you
on exhibition like a circus?

996
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,733
- I don't mind.
- Well, I do. I'm just not going to bother.

997
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,630
We've got to.

998
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,950
To them, I'll always be
just a stenographer who...

999
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,973
Look at your mother.
She's still staring at me.

1000
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,142
Well, who wouldn't stare at you?

1001
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,415
Tony, promise you'll do it.

1002
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:23,567
You know, every time I think how lucky I am,
I feel like screaming.

1003
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,485
Tony, please promise you'll invite them.

1004
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,529
I feel a scream coming on right now.

1005
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,906
You know, we'll have to face it
sooner or later.

1006
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,950
It's starting right now in my toes.
Sort of a tingling sensation.

1007
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,995
- We can invite them for Wednesday.
- It's creeping up around my knees.

1008
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,165
It's going up my legs.
Traveling faster and faster.

1009
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,500
- You're not really going to scream.
- It's in my stomach right now.

1010
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,753
- I'm afraid it's got me, Alice.
- Not with your mother here, Tony.

1011
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,256
- Now it's going up. It's all over my body now.
- Please don't. No.

1012
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,716
It's in my throat now.

1013
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:51,845
What can I do? It's fighting to get out.
I can't hold it any longer. Here it goes.

1014
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,447
No!

1015
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,025
- What happened?
- What happened?

1016
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,945
- A mouse went right past there.
- A mouse? In this place?

1017
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,321
A mouse. What do you mean a mouse?

1018
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,698
- It was a rat that long with hair on it.
- A rat with hair on it?

1019
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,117
Yeah, about six of them.
Weren't there six or seven of them?

1020
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,036
- Where? Where?
- Where? Where?

1021
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,683
Where? Right under that table.

1022
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,483
There they go!

1023
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,733
Mr. Kirby, I'm terribly sorry,
terribly sorry.

1024
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,803
- Yes, Henri. Buy yourself some mousetraps.
- Thank you.

1025
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,367
Are you ready, Anthony?

1026
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,161
Are you serious about taking me
on this slumming tour?

1027
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,790
The more we fight him, the more he'll resist.
It's the only thing to do.

1028
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,418
Pretend, at least,
that we are willing to be reasonable.

1029
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,504
She's probably from some dull,
middle-class family.

1030
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,922
As soon as Tony sees us all together,

1031
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,717
he'll quickly realize
how impossible the situation is.

1032
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,761
Yeah. That, I take it,
is what is known as being subtle.

1033
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,953
Yes.

1034
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,873
Come here a minute, Donald.

1035
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,805
Donald, look and see if you can see a man
standing in front of the house.

1036
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,117
What are you so excited about, Ed?

1037
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,454
There's a man been following me the last
three days when I'm out delivering candy.

1038
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,103
Well, maybe he wants a piece of candy.

1039
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:49,463
What's the matter, Alice? Are you jealous?
Do you want to break your leg, too?

1040
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,423
Have to do it without holding. Essie.

1041
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,799
Mother, let me have a piece of paper,
will you?

1042
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,844
I have to make our list for Rheba
for tomorrow night.

1043
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:56,970
Essie, darling.

1044
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,765
Now, let Rheba have the kitchen
all day tomorrow, won't you? She'll need it.

1045
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,476
Yes, Alice. That's why I'm making
my Love Dreams now, so I'll be way ahead.

1046
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,518
Thank you, darling.

1047
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,771
Now, Mother, look,
tomorrow, before the Kirbys come,

1048
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,816
let them put everything down in the cellar,
the typewriter, the kittens, the vibraphone...

1049
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:14,821
The Kirbys are certainly going
to get the wrong impression of this house.

1050
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,970
I guess I'd better have cocktails
about 7:00.

1051
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,452
Dear, I wonder if I ought to let Rheba
cook the dinner.

1052
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,429
Stop worrying, Alice.

1053
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,750
From what I've seen of the boy,
the Kirbys are probably very nice.

1054
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:31,171
And if things aren't too elaborate tomorrow
night, why, it will be all right, too.

1055
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,634
Darling, I'm not trying to impress them,
or pretend we're anything that we aren't.

1056
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,345
We'll do everything we can
to make it a nice party.

1057
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,039
- Will you, Mother?
- Of course, dear.

1058
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,853
- Does Richard know where to go?
- Yes, I told him, Dad.

1059
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,482
Why did it have to be tonight?
I have more important things to do.

1060
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,568
Well, I didn't want to trouble you,
but Alice wants you to meet her family.

1061
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,030
There you are, Anthony.
She may be very nice after all.

1062
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,679
Why, Mother, you're breaking down.

1063
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,202
Heaven only knows
what they'll have to eat.

1064
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:05,539
You know how sensitive my stomach is.
Do we have to go there for dinner?

1065
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,624
There are sure to be
some vegetables, Anthony.

1066
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,523
Probably raw.
Mine have got to be cooked.

1067
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,421
- Mrs. Sycamore. Mrs. Sycamore.
- Yes?

1068
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,319
Look what I found.

1069
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,802
It's my painting of you
as the discus thrower.

1070
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,888
- Look, Grandpa.
- You remember, over eight years ago.

1071
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,475
I always meant to finish it, then I got started
on my plays and I never painted again.

1072
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,062
It's just as well.
I'd have been the next one to strip.

1073
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,065
I wish you would finish it, Mrs. Sycamore.
I'd kind of like to have it.

1074
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,442
Would you? Well, perhaps I will.

1075
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,654
Right tonight. Is the costume
still down in the cellar and the easel?

1076
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,905
Sure. I saved them.

1077
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,990
You go and get them, Mr. DePinna.

1078
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,659
- And I'll find my palette and brushes.
- Boy.

1079
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,371
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello, Kolenkhov.

1080
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:50,167
- Well, Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?
- Of course you are.

1081
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,144
That is why I like to come...

1082
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,754
What is that?

1083
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,859
That's a picture of Mr. DePinna.
Penny painted it.

1084
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,448
It stinks.

1085
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:07,267
I'm sorry to keep you, Mr. Kolenkhov.
My Love Dreams were on the stove.

1086
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,977
But I'll get into my dancing clothes
and be right down.

1087
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,251
My Pavlova,
you are like a beautiful swan.

1088
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,179
Essie making any progress, Kolenkhov?

1089
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,972
Confidentially, she stinks.

1090
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,638
As long as she's having fun.

1091
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,835
My, it feels nice
to get into my art things again.

1092
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,338
You're a breath of Paris,
Madame Sycamore.

1093
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,065
Thank you.

1094
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,472
Well, it happened again.
A man followed me every place I went.

1095
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,099
I'm ready, Mrs. Sycamore.
Where are you going to work?

1096
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,917
- Right here.
- All right, Grandpa?

1097
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,914
I'd forgotten that costume
was so classical.

1098
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,600
Now, your expression,
Mr. DePinna. There.

1099
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,124
I'm ready now, Mr. Kolenkhov.

1100
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,627
Good. We go to work.
Come, let's roll up the carpet, Ed.

1101
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,149
Yes, sir.

1102
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,556
I got a new piece. Can I play it?

1103
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,058
There are no new pieces.

1104
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:33,436
Play the Brahms' Hungarian Dance.
I feel so good.

1105
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,523
Life is running around inside of me
like a squirrel.

1106
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,817
Well, my Pavlova, now we work.

1107
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:42,467
Kolenkhov always said art is 110% sweat.

1108
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,531
That is better.

1109
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,725
- Ready, Eddie?
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,191
Tempo.

1111
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,713
Faster, Eddie.

1112
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,223
Mrs. Sycamore, please.

1113
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,725
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

1114
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,877
- Faster.
- Mrs. Sycamore. Mrs. Sycamore.

1115
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,354
Hey, faster.

1116
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,635
- Mrs. Sycamore.
- Go away, Rheba. I'm busy now.

1117
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:52,015
- Pull your stomach in a little, Mr. DePinna.
- I know, but, Mrs. Sycamore...

1118
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,617
My.

1119
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,386
Darling. Please, take all those...

1120
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,723
Here, dear.

1121
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,635
Take that.

1122
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,475
- Are we too early?
- I'll say.

1123
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,213
It's perfectly all right.

1124
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,508
Why, of course. Only we thought
it was to be tomorrow night.

1125
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,386
- Tomorrow night?
- That's funny.

1126
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:34,974
- Really, Tony, this is most embarrassing.
- No, we weren't doing a thing.

1127
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,477
Why, no,
just having a quiet evening at home.

1128
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:41,582
Yes. Don't let that bother you.
Please, come in.

1129
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,173
Come in, won't you?

1130
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,529
- This is Alice's mother.
- How do you do?

1131
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:52,476
And this is Alice's sister
and Mr. Carmichael,

1132
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,185
her husband.

1133
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,768
And this is Mr. Kolenkhov.

1134
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:13,200
And the discus thrower is Mr. DePinna.

1135
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,657
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1136
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,476
Excuse my costume.
I'll take it right off.

1137
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,078
Jim. Jim.

1138
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,710
Alice.

1139
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,987
Alice.

1140
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,155
What is it?

1141
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,533
Will you come down?
We have a big surprise for you.

1142
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,226
Be right down.

1143
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,786
Well...

1144
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,788
Won't you take your things off?

1145
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,518
Will you hang your father's coat up
over there? Shall I...

1146
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,030
I'm very uncomfortable, Tony.
This is all very embarrassing.

1147
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,424
Now, anybody can get mixed up.

1148
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,759
A chair for Mrs. Kirby.
Get that out of the way.

1149
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,053
The rug, dear, the rug.

1150
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,953
That one for Mrs. Kirby, I think.
And that one for Mr. Kirby.

1151
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,376
Ed, get that chair.

1152
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,663
Thank you.

1153
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,126
- Thank you, Ed.
- Yes, sir.

1154
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:16,201
What about some dinner
for these good people?

1155
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,745
After all, they did come
to dinner, you know.

1156
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,080
- Please don't bother.
- It's no trouble at all.

1157
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,250
Ed, tell Donald to run to Murphy's
and get half a dozen bottles of beer

1158
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,710
- and some canned salmon.
- Yes, ma'am.

1159
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,630
Wait a minute.
Mr. Kirby, do you like canned salmon?

1160
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,357
Don't trouble, please. I'm not hungry.

1161
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:34,093
We're having frankfurters, but I don't think
there will be enough now that you've come.

1162
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,288
Make it frankfurters,
and tell Donald to get...

1163
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:42,418
Tell Donald to get a dozen more
and an extra can of corn.

1164
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,663
- See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut.
- All right.

1165
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,231
- Tell Donald to hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

1166
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:49,801
It won't take long.
Murphy's Delicatessen is right next door.

1167
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,753
The pipe.

1168
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,764
This is Alice's father.

1169
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,824
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

1170
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,701
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1171
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,912
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.

1172
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,855
I couldn't find my other pants
down in the cellar.

1173
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,899
It's quite all right.

1174
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,650
Without holding!

1175
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:19,997
My.

1176
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,710
What do you think, Alice?
They thought it was tonight.

1177
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,248
Tony, don't you remember what...

1178
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,136
- Have you all met?
- Yes.

1179
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,155
Dear, I'm so confused.

1180
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,033
You see, I had such a nice party arranged
for tomorrow night.

1181
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,244
Perhaps we can come back again
tomorrow night.

1182
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,829
Yes, of course.

1183
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,307
- Sit down, Mr. Kirby.
- Thank you.

1184
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,466
Mother, I guess we'd better see
about getting dinner.

1185
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,909
That's all done, Alice.

1186
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,830
He didn't touch second.

1187
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,368
Mother, what did you send out for?

1188
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,688
Mr. Kirby should have told you
that he suffers from indigestion.

1189
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,809
Now, now, Miriam.
It isn't as serious as all that.

1190
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:32,983
Perhaps it is not indigestion.
Perhaps it is stomach ulcers.

1191
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,611
Ulcers?

1192
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,696
Don't pay any attention
to Mr. Kolenkhov.

1193
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:44,992
He's Russian and the Russians
are inclined to look on the dark side.

1194
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:49,838
All right, I'm Russian, but a friend of mine,
a Russian, died from stomach ulcers.

1195
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,878
Mr. Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby has indigestion
and that's all.

1196
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,004
All right, let him wait.

1197
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:02,009
Please, folks.
Let's not discuss Mr. Kirby's ulcers.

1198
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,287
Grandpa, please talk about something else.
Ask Mr. Kirby about business.

1199
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,185
I'll be right back.

1200
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:13,236
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kirby,
how are business conditions?

1201
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,233
What?

1202
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:19,284
Well, that depends
on what side of the fence you're on.

1203
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,870
Personally, I find an improvement.

1204
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:28,581
There are two schools of thought
on that subject, and I have no ulcers.

1205
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,332
You wait.

1206
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,720
- Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?
- Not at all. Of course not.

1207
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,524
What about the unemployment problem?

1208
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,818
Unemployment?

1209
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,513
Unemployment is not the main problem,
Mr. Vanderhof.

1210
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:08,683
- No? Why, that's I funny. I'd have thought...
- Yes, I know.

1211
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:12,754
But that sort of viewpoint
is purely emotional, not economic.

1212
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,257
Now, for instance, in 1929...

1213
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,349
My goodness, that's wonderful.

1214
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,077
It really frightened you, didn't it?

1215
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,020
Mr. Poppins.

1216
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,856
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

1217
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,334
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1218
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:39,109
Mr. Poppins makes up these masks
as a sort of hobby.

1219
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,174
Really?

1220
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,869
I think he ought to warn people
before he pops up in front of them like that.

1221
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:50,975
Now, let me see. What can we talk about?

1222
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,954
- Have you any hobbies, Mr. Kirby?
- Business is my hobby.

1223
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,798
- Grandpa plays the harmonica.
- Really?

1224
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,963
Did you ever try one, Mr. Kirby?

1225
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,402
Well, I...

1226
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,972
He used to be champ.
He won first prize at amateur night.

1227
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,512
Told me so himself, didn't you, Dad?

1228
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:13,227
Say, I bet you
and I could do a mean duet.

1229
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,875
I'm too busy a man
to fool around with harmonicas.

1230
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,477
Here we are.

1231
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,525
Did you get everything, Donald?

1232
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:25,051
Yes. They didn't have anymore weenies,
so I got pickled pigs' feet.

1233
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,720
Just take everything into the kitchen.

1234
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,890
Mr. Kirby, I'll have some scrambled eggs
made for you, and a plain salad.

1235
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,059
- Will that be all right?
- That'll be fine. Thank you.

1236
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,832
Forgot the mustard.

1237
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:49,218
That's that, I guess.
Fine impression we're making.

1238
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,370
Tony, how could you make
such a dreadful mistake?

1239
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,622
You knew it was for tomorrow night.

1240
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,601
Yeah, I guess it wasn't such a hot idea.

1241
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,362
You mean you did it on purpose?

1242
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,967
Tony, that's dreadful.
How could you do such a thing?

1243
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:10,096
Alice, you know I didn't want to bring them
down here at all, but you insisted.

1244
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,598
But if they have to meet you,
I want them to meet you as you are.

1245
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,893
Not on some trumped-up evening
with everybody acting unnaturally.

1246
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,396
There's nothing unnatural
in wanting them to like us.

1247
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,982
If they don't like you the way they are,
it's just too bad.

1248
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:24,026
It doesn't make any difference to me
what they think.

1249
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,613
If you'd just left things alone,
everything would have been all right.

1250
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,343
But, no, you had to go and get funny
and spoil everything.

1251
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,392
It was a pretty stupid idea, I know.

1252
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,875
But, Alice, I'm just trying to be honest
about this thing.

1253
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,401
I brought my family down here
just as they are, stuffed shirts and all.

1254
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:46,340
I'm not trying to put on an act with them.
Why should you have to with yours?

1255
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,175
Look, I'm trying to be honest, too.

1256
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,470
Can't you understand?
I've got to get their approval.

1257
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,014
I'm not going to stand for your mother

1258
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,933
looking at me as if I were
a thief or something.

1259
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,377
What do you think I am, a goop?

1260
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,496
Start the eggs, Rheba.

1261
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,083
Have you any hobbies, Mrs. Kirby?

1262
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,302
Well, as a matter of fact, I have.

1263
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,114
I'm a student of occultism.

1264
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,491
- What's that?
- That's spiritualism, dear.

1265
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,912
Spiritualism? Mrs. Kirby, I'm surprised.

1266
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:20,166
- Everybody knows spiritualism is a fake.
- I beg your pardon?

1267
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:23,544
Now, Penny. You mustn't criticize
other people's hobbies.

1268
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,465
- You got one or two of your own, you know.
- Yes, but not silly ones.

1269
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,691
Well, I...

1270
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:43,623
The perfect hobby should improve the body
as well as the mind.

1271
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,818
The Romans were great people. Why?
What was their hobby? Wrestling.

1272
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,739
In wrestling you must think quick
with the mind and act quick with the body.

1273
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,617
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
I agree with you.

1274
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,954
When I was young,
I was pretty good at it myself.

1275
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,207
- But, unfortunately, as one grows older...
- Foolishness.

1276
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,209
Once a wrestler, you never forget.

1277
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,879
I have not done it for six years,
but I forget nothing.

1278
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,151
Look.

1279
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,503
What's happening in here?

1280
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,962
Sit down, Mr. Kirby.

1281
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,908
- Where are my glasses?
- Here they are.

1282
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,352
Mr. Kirby, they're broken.

1283
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,190
I am sorry, but when you wrestle again,
Mr. Kirby, you will of course

1284
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,499
not wear your glasses.

1285
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:48,504
- I do not intend to wrestle again, sir.
- That was very silly, Kolenkhov.

1286
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,606
I'm sorry you did that.

1287
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,406
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1288
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,431
If you don't mind,
I think we better be going.

1289
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,308
- That's the best idea I've heard yet.
- Please don't go.

1290
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,207
You're absolutely right, Mrs. Kirby.
I think you should go.

1291
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:08,333
The whole thing was a mistake.
I'm terribly sorry for everything.

1292
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,277
Alice, let me stay.
I want to talk to you.

1293
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,946
No, I'd rather you wouldn't.
There's nothing to talk about.

1294
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,282
- Good night, Mrs. Kirby.
- Good night.

1295
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,952
Good night, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you didn't get hurt.

1296
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,477
No. It's a pleasure
to have met all of you.

1297
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,895
- Tony, come on.
- Alice, I...

1298
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,961
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- I don't know.

1299
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,109
- But I...
- Good night, Tony.

1300
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,909
Good night.

1301
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,557
- Stay right where you are, everybody.
- For heaven's sake.

1302
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,034
What's this all about?

1303
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,186
- Which one is it?
- That one over there.

1304
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,687
Who? Me? What do you mean?

1305
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,837
- Look here. We don't belong in this house.
- Keep your mouth shut, you.

1306
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,777
What's your name?

1307
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,196
Ed Carmichael,
and I haven't done anything.

1308
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,865
See here. This seems very high-handed.

1309
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:01,139
- What's it all about?
- Police Department.

1310
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,662
J-men.

1311
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,540
- G-men, Penny.
- Ed, what have you done?

1312
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,667
Nothing. I told you
somebody was following me.

1313
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,629
But these people don't belong here.
Please let them go.

1314
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,589
Don't let anybody out that door.

1315
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,613
This is outrageous.
Do you realize who I am?

1316
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,204
- What's your name?
- Beton Batopevitch Kolenkhov.

1317
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,408
- Where are you from?
- Omsk.

1318
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,212
- Where?
- Omsk.

1319
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,365
- These stairs lead to the cellar?
- Yes, they do.

1320
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,092
Look out, Chief.

1321
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,646
- What do you call this?
- It's called the New Monster.

1322
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,795
Playing boogieman?

1323
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,214
Yeah. Get over there.

1324
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:58,384
My goodness. He must've gotten out
of the wrong side of the bed this morning.

1325
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,718
Mike, Bill.

1326
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,320
Take a look.

1327
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,869
Come here, you.

1328
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:12,127
- Ever see these before?
- Yes, sir. I printed lots of them.

1329
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,276
- You print this stuff?
- Yes, sir.

1330
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:19,347
And you put them into candy boxes
to get them into people's homes?

1331
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,216
- My Love Dreams.
- But I didn't mean anything.

1332
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,469
- You didn't?
- No, sir.

1333
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,056
- "Watch for the Revolution."
- Radicals.

1334
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,666
"The Red Flag will sweep the country."

1335
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,878
I didn't mean that.
I just like to print, that's all.

1336
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:37,506
See here. The government
isn't in any danger from Ed.

1337
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,968
Why, printing is just his hobby.
That's all.

1338
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,012
Why he'd print anything.

1339
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,347
It's just like a play, isn't it?

1340
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,541
Now, look here, young man.

1341
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,477
Don't be so silly. I must get my pipe.

1342
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:51,562
We were right, Chief.

1343
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,314
There's enough gunpowder down there
to blow up the town.

1344
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:54,607
- But we only use that...
- Shut up.

1345
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,358
Everybody in this house is under arrest.

1346
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,610
What's that?

1347
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,278
Stay right here.

1348
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,447
- I tell you I must get it.
- You stay right where you are.

1349
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,764
It's lit.

1350
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,057
- What's that?
- The fireworks.

1351
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,249
Jim.

1352
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,210
- Anthony.
- Miriam, run!

1353
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,294
- Alice!
- Grandpa!

1354
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,941
Keep your shirts on.

1355
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,273
The Revolution!

1356
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,244
Home again.

1357
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,673
Just like Siberia. Only it stinks.

1358
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:20,192
It was fun being fingerprinted,
wasn't it?

1359
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,237
Mr. Kirby didn't think so.
It took three men to hold him down.

1360
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:27,950
Never a dull moment, that's what I say,
never a dull moment.

1361
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,743
I can walk alone.

1362
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,413
I never heard of anything so outrageous
in all my life.

1363
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,539
Never mind the argument.

1364
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,984
Stop pushing me around like this, you fools.
I'm Anthony P. Kirby. You hear that?

1365
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,377
Okay, pal, I'm George Washington.

1366
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,822
I want a telephone. I want to telephone
my attorneys, you numbskulls.

1367
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,488
We've made two calls for you already, mister.
Keep your shirt on.

1368
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:48,387
- But this is Mr. Kirby, the banker.
- Yeah, well, that ain't my fault.

1369
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,640
Night court's in session right now.
He'll have to wait his turn.

1370
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,664
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.
- You're sorry.

1371
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,895
That's something
after what I've been through.

1372
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,839
After all, you did come
on the wrong night.

1373
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,609
The mayor will hear of this
and so will the commissioner.

1374
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,571
- I'll have you all fired! Every one of you.
- Dad, don't get excited.

1375
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,072
- In a couple of hours...
- In a couple of hours...

1376
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:11,348
I hope you're satisfied with your mother
in there with a lot of cheap, common...

1377
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,954
Pipe down, big shot. We want music.

1378
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,102
Hit it up, Pop, and make it hot.

1379
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,092
Listen, Matron, I'm Mrs. Kirby.
Mrs. Anthony P. Kirby.

1380
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,677
I'll give you $100
if you'll get me a private room.

1381
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,679
Private room?
We keep those for the insane cases.

1382
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,640
Please do, she doesn't belong
here with us.

1383
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,586
Have her throw a couple of fits, lady,
and I'll try to fix it.

1384
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:23,232
Mrs. Kirby, please, believe me, I'm so sorry
to have gotten you into all this trouble.

1385
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,360
I'll appreciate it
if you'll leave me strictly alone.

1386
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,530
Don't let her get you, sister.
They're getting tougher every place.

1387
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,573
Say, where you been operating?

1388
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,096
You got class. That's the kind
of connection I'm looking for.

1389
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:38,806
Wasn't it exciting in that car
with the sirens screaming?

1390
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:45,442
You better sit on your hands, Mrs. Kirby.
It gets kind of cold after you sit awhile.

1391
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:50,993
All right, but don't say that I didn't
tell you when you begin to feel it.

1392
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,611
Good heavens.

1393
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,806
Why don't you come down off
your high horse, babe.

1394
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,307
I might be able to do you some good.

1395
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,977
If you don't mind,
I don't need anyone to do me good.

1396
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,187
Never can tell, sugar plum.
I know a good...

1397
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,523
Please, let her alone.
Can't you see she's a lady?

1398
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,502
A lady? They sure get around nowadays.

1399
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:13,031
You needn't waste your time trying
to protect me. That won't help you.

1400
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,701
If you had any sense, young woman,
you'd stay where you belong

1401
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,849
and stop being ambitious.

1402
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,440
Shall I sock her, Alice?

1403
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:25,604
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1404
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:47,546
Spend a quarter of a million dollars a year
for attorneys and I can't get one of them.

1405
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,677
Young man, will you get me
some bicarbonate of soda?

1406
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:16,869
What flavor?

1407
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:24,311
Well, I've got you to thank for this.
I hope it will teach you a lesson.

1408
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,979
Fooling around with stenographers.

1409
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:30,630
- Now, listen, Dad. I intend to marry that girl.
- Yes, I know. I know.

1410
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:35,489
I was going to marry a waitress once,
fortunately my father knocked it out of me.

1411
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,282
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Kirby.

1412
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:42,263
I don't believe anyone has the right
to interfere with young people in love.

1413
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:45,040
- Why don't you relax?
- Relax?

1414
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,960
With my son practically being stolen
from under my nose.

1415
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,880
Me being locked up
like a common criminal. "Relax!"

1416
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,424
You know what'll happen
if the newspapers get a hold of this?

1417
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,302
It'll jeopardize the biggest deal
of my career.

1418
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,904
Stop worrying.

1419
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:04,268
If I know my granddaughter, she isn't
going to marry Tony without your blessing.

1420
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:08,480
The only thing you've got to be concerned
about is this big deal of yours.

1421
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,816
What if it does fall through?

1422
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,590
What if all your deals fall through?

1423
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,697
- Might be a good thing for you.
- Man, you're crazy.

1424
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:20,927
Well, maybe I am,
but I used to be just like you once.

1425
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,767
Then one morning,
when I was going up in the elevator,

1426
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,767
it struck me I wasn't having any fun.

1427
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,445
So, I came right down
and never went back.

1428
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,923
Yes, sir. That was 35 years ago.

1429
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,776
Admirable. And you haven't done
a thing since?

1430
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:41,789
Yes. Just the things I wanted to do.

1431
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,824
Collected stamps.

1432
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:48,625
Went to the zoo when I got the notion,
took up the harmonica again

1433
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:52,625
and even found time
to notice when spring came around.

1434
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:56,778
This would be a fine country
if we all spent our time in the zoo

1435
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,363
and played the harmonica.

1436
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:02,138
You used to play one yourself.
Tony said so.

1437
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,887
Maybe you ought to take it up again.

1438
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:09,875
Maybe it would stop you trying to be
so desperate about making more money

1439
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,852
than you can ever use.

1440
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:15,819
You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby.
So what good is it?

1441
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:22,117
As near as I can see, the only thing you can
take with you is the love of your friends.

1442
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,164
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a pulpit somewhere?

1443
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,018
Well, I'm sorry.

1444
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,667
- Which one is Vanderhof?
- Right here.

1445
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:33,215
Hello, Mr. Vanderhof. Remember me?

1446
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,275
Twitch-face.

1447
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:40,097
Yes, I heard that you were in trouble
and came over to see if I could help you out.

1448
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,366
Why should you want to help me?

1449
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,369
To tell you the truth,
I thought that if I did you a favor...

1450
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:49,190
You're wasting your time,
Mr. Twitch, Mr. Blakely.

1451
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:54,336
- I have no intention of selling my home.
- We'll see how long you can hold out.

1452
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,530
Wait 'til a few more things
happen to you.

1453
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,926
- So you arranged this arrest?
- Yes, and it's just a starter.

1454
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,656
By the time I get through,
you'll be willing and glad to sell.

1455
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,453
So you did this?

1456
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:09,935
Why, Mr. Kirby.

1457
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,270
You blockhead.
Do you know what you've done?

1458
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:16,216
But, Mr. Kirby, I never dreamed
that you knew these people.

1459
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,235
I told you the police
were on their trail

1460
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,612
and you told me to go ahead
and make them sell.

1461
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,214
You blithering idiot, get out.

1462
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,825
If you've got an ounce of sense left,
you'll dig up my attorneys.

1463
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:27,895
- I've been here for hours.
- Yes, sir. I'll phone them all.

1464
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:34,067
So, you're the one
that's been holding up my deal?

1465
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,568
- Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it?
- What's funny about it?

1466
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:44,779
The idea of you engineering this whole thing
and being caught in your own trap.

1467
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:48,407
Maybe it won't be so funny
when I take that house away from you.

1468
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:53,687
Now I begin to see what's been going on.
That's a fine trick, Mr. Vanderhof.

1469
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:57,023
Using my son to get information,
and then making me pay through the nose.

1470
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:58,734
- Wait a minute...
- Nobody will make me pay for anything

1471
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,110
- unless I want to.
- Now you've got those all wrong.

1472
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,862
I'll show you how to do business
the Kirby way.

1473
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,029
Business?

1474
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:05,741
You're not a businessman.
You're like a lion in the jungle.

1475
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,201
Yes, and I've got the longest
and the sharpest claws, too.

1476
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:11,771
That's how I got where I am, on top,
and scum like this is still in the gutter.

1477
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,792
You're an idiot, Mr. Kirby.

1478
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,502
- What?
- A stupid idiot.

1479
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:20,230
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Yes, I can.

1480
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,823
Scum, are we?

1481
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,698
What makes you think
you're such a superior human being?

1482
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,306
Your money? If you do,
you're a dull-witted fool, Mr. Kirby.

1483
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:31,224
And a poor one at that.

1484
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:34,352
You're poorer than any of these people
that you call scum.

1485
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:37,898
Because I'll guarantee
at least they've got some friends.

1486
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:42,277
But you, with your jungle and your
long claws, as you call them

1487
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:47,634
you'll wind up your miserable existence
without anything you can call a friend.

1488
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:53,639
You may be a high mogul to yourself,
Mr. Kirby, but to me you're a failure.

1489
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:58,944
A failure as a man,
a failure as a human being,

1490
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,563
even a failure as a father.

1491
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,718
When your time comes, I doubt
if a single tear will be shed over you.

1492
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,662
The world will probably
cry "good riddance."

1493
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:13,558
That's a nice prospect, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

1494
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:18,789
I hope you'll get some comfort out of
all this coin you've been sweating over then.

1495
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,182
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1496
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,019
I haven't lost my temper like that
in 30-odd years.

1497
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,389
Don't know what came over me.

1498
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,484
I didn't mean anything I said.

1499
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:43,314
I wish you'd told me
to mind my own business.

1500
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:48,073
If there's any way
I could make up for it

1501
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:51,471
I would.

1502
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:55,075
Here, how'd you like
to have my harmonica?

1503
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:59,629
It's a new one and good, too.

1504
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,967
You might want to play it sometime.

1505
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:09,364
After all, who am I
to criticize anybody?

1506
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,514
All right, everybody out for night court.
Have your slips ready.

1507
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,788
I'm Mr. Kirby's attorney. Where is he?

1508
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,437
- Kirby.
- Yes, Kirby, Kirby.

1509
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:23,437
Yes. Just going to be arraigned.
Right through there.

1510
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:30,201
Wonder what he's so excited about.

1511
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,264
Attorney for Mr. Kirby.
Has he been arraigned yet?

1512
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:37,368
- Not yet. Right through that door.
- Thank you.

1513
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,499
Kirby?

1514
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:42,627
Anthony P. Kirby.

1515
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,610
- Is that Anthony P. Kirby, the banker?
- It's Kirby, the banker, you know.

1516
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:49,738
Just a minute, please.
Yes, that's Anthony P. Kirby.

1517
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,156
That's all we wanted to know.

1518
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,553
Boy.

1519
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,762
- What did you say your name was?
- Anthony P. Kirby.

1520
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,057
Psychopathic ward.

1521
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,945
I sentence you to 31 days
in the city jail

1522
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,258
but I'll suspend 30 days
of that sentence

1523
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:13,511
if you give me your word that as soon as you
get out tomorrow morning

1524
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,454
you'll go back to your folks in Kansas.

1525
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:19,368
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
- That's all right, run along.

1526
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,146
Your Honor, would you take
the Vanderhof case next?

1527
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,272
Why?

1528
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,608
We just found out
that one of them is A.P. Kirby.

1529
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,026
- The banker?
- Yes.

1530
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,277
What are the charges?

1531
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,864
Disturbing the peace and manufacturing
fireworks without a license.

1532
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:34,341
Fireworks?

1533
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:38,578
You mean to tell me that A.P. Kirby
has been held in the drunk tank?

1534
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,430
Well, well, well...

1535
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,709
Is that why
all these spectators are here tonight?

1536
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,811
No. They are Vanderhof's friends.

1537
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:49,589
I didn't know anybody had
that many friends anymore.

1538
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,549
The newspapermen heard about Kirby yet?

1539
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,385
- I don't think so.
- That's good.

1540
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,973
What a holiday they'd have if they knew
A.P. Kirby was in the drunk tank.

1541
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,225
Well, bring them in right away.
No use crucifying him.

1542
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:03,579
- Bring in the Vanderhofs.
- Vanderhof case next.

1543
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,547
Get away from me. Have you seen the...

1544
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,842
Hello, Grandpa.

1545
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:22,689
Order. Order.

1546
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:27,356
Quiet.

1547
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:29,312
Order.

1548
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:38,763
Your Honor, in arresting Mr. and Mrs. Kirby
and their son, a grave blunder was made

1549
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:39,848
and we would suggest...

1550
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:43,418
- Do all four of you represent Mr. Kirby?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1551
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,792
Quite an array of talent
for a misdemeanor.

1552
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:51,760
If there's any objection, Your Honor,
to Mr. Kirby being represented by counsel...

1553
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:56,222
Not at all. Not at all. In fact,
this court feels quite flattered.

1554
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,307
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1555
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,745
The charge is disturbing the peace.

1556
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,893
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, of course.

1557
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,790
Of course.

1558
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:09,252
Mister, are you represented,
or any of your people, by counsel?

1559
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,604
No, sir.

1560
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:14,174
I guess we were disturbing the peace

1561
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,762
if anyone took the trouble to make
a complaint against us.

1562
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:22,640
And if it's against the law
to make fireworks without a license

1563
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:27,086
I guess we're guilty of that, too,
because we've been doing it a long time.

1564
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,150
I don't feel guilty, do you, Essie?

1565
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,752
Order, order, please.

1566
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,530
Mr. Vanderhof,
on the charge of disturbing the peace

1567
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,409
you and the rest of your family are,
by your own plea, guilty.

1568
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,454
- However, I shall suspend sentence.
- Thank you.

1569
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:49,105
But, the manufacturing of explosives
without a license, I'm sorry

1570
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,104
I'm forced to fine you $100.

1571
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,149
One hundred dollars?

1572
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,860
That's a lot of money.

1573
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:04,224
Your Honor, Mr. Kirby,
who is noted for his charitable work

1574
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:07,578
would like to pay the fine
for this poor unfortunate family.

1575
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,772
No, thank you.
I couldn't let you do that.

1576
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:14,217
No, you don't. Grandpa don't need
your money. We'll pay that fine.

1577
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,132
Order, order! Order in the court.

1578
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,139
Order, order.

1579
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:36,735
No, it's all right, Officer.
It's all right. Let them come in.

1580
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,664
We'll pay the fine.

1581
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,791
We don't need your money.

1582
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:52,422
A whole hat full, Grandpa.
A whole hat full.

1583
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:59,504
We'll get it, Grandpa.

1584
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,956
There you are, Judge, is that enough?

1585
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,729
Yes, I think so.

1586
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,770
Take the money over to the clerk's desk.

1587
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,843
Mr. Vanderhof, you're a very lucky man
to have so many friends.

1588
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:22,969
Yes.

1589
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,555
- How about it, Lieutenant?
- You can't come in here.

1590
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,908
Come on, will you?
Let us take just one flash.

1591
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,451
Now, gentlemen.

1592
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:33,313
I'd like to dismiss the charges against
the Kirbys of disturbing the peace

1593
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:36,107
but unfortunately they were present
at the time of the arrest

1594
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,709
and if these people were guilty

1595
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:41,112
then I must naturally assume
that the Kirbys were guilty also.

1596
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,759
But Your Honor, that's absurd.

1597
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,554
Unless, of course, they can explain
what they were doing there.

1598
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,719
Don't say a word, Anthony.

1599
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,079
I'm afraid they've got you, Mother.

1600
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:53,625
Do you realize, Your Honor,
that this gentleman is Mr. Anthony P. Kirby?

1601
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,627
I've been made to realize that fact.

1602
01:36:55,727 --> 01:37:00,073
Perhaps Mr. Anthony P. Kirby himself
can explain what they were doing there.

1603
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,967
- Well, Your Honor...
- I don't think that that's important.

1604
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,785
Haven't we been embarrassed enough?

1605
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:09,408
It seems to me a little more respect
should be shown for our position.

1606
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,185
Your Honor,
this charge is absolutely ridiculous.

1607
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:15,980
Failing a satisfactory explanation,
I shall be obliged to have them stand trial.

1608
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,358
- But...
- They have the right to be heard.

1609
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,631
Your Honor, please.

1610
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:24,552
Mr. Kirby came to see me
about buying my house.

1611
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,828
- About buying your house?
- Yes.

1612
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:35,399
You see, he's been interested
in the property for some time now and...

1613
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:38,670
Well, he just came there
to talk a deal over.

1614
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:39,896
That's all.

1615
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,548
Why, of course that's why we were there,

1616
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:44,425
and I don't see
why we should be held accountable

1617
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:47,404
for anything that these people
might have done.

1618
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,806
- That's not true.
- Now, Alice.

1619
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,349
Grandpa, I won't stand for it.

1620
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:54,310
I won't stand for our being
humiliated like this.

1621
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,062
They're ashamed to tell you
why they were there.

1622
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,022
They're ashamed to admit
they came to look my family over

1623
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:00,191
to see if I was good enough
to marry their precious son.

1624
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,276
I never heard anything

1625
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,027
- so ridiculous in my life.
- Now just a minute, Your Honor.

1626
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,863
- She's right. That's the reason we were there.
- It's about time you spoke up.

1627
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,616
I've decided that it's your family
that isn't good enough.

1628
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:13,162
Why, I wouldn't be related to a bunch
of snobs like that for anything in the world.

1629
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,999
Your mother's all in a dither
because of her social reputation.

1630
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:19,774
- That's telling them, Alice.
- Who do they think they are?

1631
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:21,379
Order!

1632
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,548
Your reputation's safe
as far as I'm concerned

1633
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,509
and so is your son's,
and so's your old man's.

1634
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:27,635
What's up?

1635
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:30,847
Cinderella just told Prince Charming
to go take a flying leap.

1636
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,167
- How about us taking a flying leap?
- That's a good idea.

1637
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,998
Order in the court.

1638
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,873
Order. Officer, put these men out.

1639
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,699
The next time you want to go slumming,
stay away from our neighborhood.

1640
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:50,800
Alice, please.

1641
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:00,981
Order.

1642
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:05,906
Order.

1643
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,427
Dang gummit, Alice should've let us know
where she was going.

1644
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,450
Don't you think so, Essie?

1645
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,586
Any word from her yet?

1646
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:15,076
I've been all over town.
The detective agency worked all night on it.

1647
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:18,350
They've checked every hotel
for 100 miles around.

1648
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,000
Mrs. Sycamore, won't you please tell me
where she is?

1649
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,502
I don't know, Tony.

1650
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:27,171
Even if I did, I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you.

1651
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,590
- If I wrote her a letter would you see...
- You don't understand, Tony.

1652
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:32,260
She doesn't want to see you.
That's why she went away mostly.

1653
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,263
There's no use in your coming here anymore,
and trying to find her.

1654
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:38,663
You'll only make things worse for her.
For us, too.

1655
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,841
Well, I guess that's that.

1656
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:55,221
- We're all awfully sorry, Tony.
- Thank you, sir.

1657
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,063
Boy, I sure do feel sorry for Tony.

1658
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:10,524
Rheba say you want something
to eat, somebody?

1659
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,592
No, I'm not hungry, are you?

1660
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:16,162
I ought to be cleaning up the cellar.
It's in an awful mess.

1661
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:27,398
Look here, everyone.
Here's a letter from Alice.

1662
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:28,483
Really?

1663
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,318
- How is she?
- Where did you get it?

1664
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:33,529
Ned, the postman, chased me
down the street and gave it to me.

1665
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,741
He recognized her handwriting.
I've read it, Penny.

1666
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:38,075
Read it aloud, Penny.

1667
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:41,412
- Where's it from, Mother?
- Wait a minute. My hands are shaking.

1668
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:44,540
She's staying with Helen,
that school friend in Riverside.

1669
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,688
That's in Connecticut,
isn't it, Grandpa?

1670
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,003
Read the letter, Mother.

1671
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,546
Now, let me see.

1672
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:54,050
"And I was so miserable and confused
I had to do something.

1673
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,260
"I do hope you'll understand.

1674
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,263
"It's peaceful here
and I've thought it all out.

1675
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:04,227
"I know now the situation
between Tony and me is impossible.

1676
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:08,753
"Mrs. Kirby was right.
I should have stayed in my own backyard.

1677
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:12,902
"Don't worry about me, Mother.
I'll get over it.

1678
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:15,821
"My darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.

1679
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:18,699
"I don't know how I can stand it.

1680
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:22,724
"Last night I cried myself to sleep,
and that helped a little.

1681
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,855
"But this morning when I woke up
and realized I wasn't in my own bed..."

1682
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:36,572
"I wish I could rush back home.
But how can I, if I want to forget?

1683
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:42,241
"The newspapers, Tony, and a million
little things make it impossible.

1684
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:45,914
"Forgive me, my darlings.

1685
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:51,087
"I promise to write every day,
sometimes twice or even more.

1686
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,716
"Please, everybody,
take good care of yourselves.

1687
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:59,132
"Don't let anything happen to you.

1688
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,300
"All my love, Alice."

1689
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:07,022
Sounds to me like she's not coming back.

1690
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:10,108
Mr. Blakely, please.

1691
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:12,336
Mr. Blakely?

1692
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:16,048
Dad, you don't mean
you're thinking of selling the house?

1693
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:17,675
Alice is right.

1694
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:21,621
She can never come back here.
It would only make her miserable.

1695
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:26,955
I won't let her live alone.
We'll find a place up there with her.

1696
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:30,563
Mr. Blakely, this is Vanderhof.

1697
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:33,291
Do you still want to buy the house?

1698
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,799
You'll only pay $25,000 now.

1699
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,014
Well, all right. Certainly, today.

1700
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,843
All right, that's all. Goodbye.

1701
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:50,483
Well, we had to leave this house
sometime, anyway.

1702
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:56,422
I had a hard time,
but I made the old codger sell.

1703
01:43:56,522 --> 01:44:00,051
- Mr. Kirby's got all 12 blocks, solid.
- All right, Henry. We can go ahead.

1704
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,011
We've got the Vanderhof property.
Line up Kincaid right away.

1705
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:04,722
If that old gent hadn't sold,
the whole deal would've been blocked.

1706
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,349
What a spotty head, the sucker.

1707
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:10,955
To all tenants in the 12-block area. Notice.
You are hereby notified that...

1708
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:15,691
"You are hereby notified that 10 days from
this date your premises must be vacated."

1709
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:18,903
- That's the same as I've got.
- That certainly doesn't give us much time.

1710
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,471
- Does it?
- No.

1711
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:23,850
Look. The Jensens must have gotten
their notice. Let's go see.

1712
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:33,292
- Mr. Jensen, did you get one of these?
- Sure. We have to get out in 10 days.

1713
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,461
- We all have to move.
- I can't understand it.

1714
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:39,566
Grandpa said if they couldn't buy
his house, nobody would have to move.

1715
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,862
Look.

1716
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:10,746
Sorry, Mr. Kirby can't be disturbed.

1717
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:12,289
I think it's all over, don't you?

1718
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,938
Hello? Sorry, Mr. Kirby's not available.

1719
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:19,734
Hello. He's not answering
his phone. Sorry.

1720
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,465
I've just been upstairs.

1721
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:24,719
All our board members are there, and so are
the heads of those six little companies.

1722
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:27,054
Boy, is this merger
going to make history!

1723
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,640
I hear the market's going crazy.
They don't know whether to buy or sell.

1724
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,767
I hope we're right.
I have everything I own sunk in this.

1725
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:35,020
- Stop bellyaching. We can't miss.
- Let's get this over with. Where's Kirby?

1726
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,313
In there.
We've been waiting half an hour for him.

1727
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,481
Who's with him?

1728
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,151
Nobody. He's probably taking bows in front
of the other Kirbys on the wall.

1729
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,695
Hello. No.
Tell the senator to keep his shirt on.

1730
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:46,782
- Kirby wants him to stay in Washington.
- No newspapers until after the meeting.

1731
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:49,368
- Ramsey make trouble for us?
- You're crazy. He's broke.

1732
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:51,579
He's finished.
Kirby hasn't even left him carfare.

1733
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,330
You've got to hand it to the old man.

1734
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:55,750
How he squeezed down
on old Ramsey, beautiful.

1735
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:57,168
I saw Ramsey this morning, you know.

1736
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:59,086
It wouldn't surprise me
if he were to blow his brains out.

1737
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,212
I tell you, they're waiting up there.

1738
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:02,673
Let's get Kirby and get this thing
over with before something happens.

1739
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,717
- Good idea.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1740
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,010
You know he doesn't like that.

1741
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,261
Good heaven, man. Look at the time.

1742
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:10,181
I'll get him on the phone.
Maybe he won't mind that.

1743
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:12,329
Get me Mr. Kirby in the conference room.

1744
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:44,381
Hello. Yeah.

1745
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:47,576
Certainly. Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

1746
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:52,765
They're waiting upstairs.
We'd better be getting up there.

1747
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:55,226
- Good. Have you got your proxies?
- Right here. Including Kincaid's.

1748
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,853
He was tough. But when we offered
to make him president, he jumped at it.

1749
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,230
When you offered to make him what?

1750
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,815
I explained to him
that all you wanted to be

1751
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:01,982
was the chairman
of the board of directors.

1752
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,318
Tell him it's a mistake.
I've already chosen the president.

1753
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,112
- But we were saving...
- Anthony Kirby, Jr. is going to be president.

1754
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:09,406
- Tony? He's much too young, A.P.
- Yes. Is he?

1755
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,117
- What about our promise to Kincaid?
- You've got his proxy. Forget about him.

1756
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:15,037
- But A.P., we have our obligations...
- I say, forget about him. Come on.

1757
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,481
Now, please, Mr. Ramsey,
Mr. Kirby is very busy...

1758
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:27,533
Well, Mr. Kirby,
I suppose you're very proud of yourself.

1759
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:31,530
Another victory.
The greatest of your career.

1760
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:34,348
What do you want, Ramsey?

1761
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:36,246
You know something.

1762
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:39,912
I actually thought of coming here
to ask for mercy

1763
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:43,416
but I couldn't figure out a basis
on which to do it.

1764
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,258
Certainly not friendship.

1765
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:48,445
Once, a long time ago,
that might have been possible

1766
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:52,220
but you destroyed that, Anthony.
Remember?

1767
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,514
Look at me, Anthony.

1768
01:47:54,635 --> 01:47:57,980
Tomorrow the world will read
that Ramsey is broke.

1769
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:00,207
Doesn't that please you?

1770
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:04,778
I've seen men jump out of windows for less,
but I'm going to fool you, Anthony

1771
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:08,716
because I've suddenly realized
that I haven't lost a thing,

1772
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:11,927
that I never gained
one moment's happiness out of it.

1773
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:15,577
And I warn you, Anthony,
and neither will you.

1774
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:17,892
In spite of your victories,

1775
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:21,854
you can't shut out
every decent impulse and survive.

1776
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:26,317
You're top-heavy with power right now,
Anthony, but you're going to crack under it.

1777
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,795
You're bound to crack under it.

1778
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:33,258
And do you know what is going to happen,
Mr. Anthony P. Kirby?

1779
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:38,662
You'll scream for help and suddenly
find yourself alone in the world.

1780
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:42,249
You'll wriggle on the hook
and find that nobody gives a hang.

1781
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:45,461
I know because
that's what happened to me.

1782
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,254
And it will happen to you.

1783
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:50,174
That's what happens
to all men like us, Anthony.

1784
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:53,244
It's coming to us, it's coming to...

1785
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:19,286
- He's taking it kind of hard. Isn't he?
- Always was a weak sister.

1786
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:20,454
Sounded crazy to me.

1787
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:23,374
- They're waiting upstairs. Let's get up there.
- Come along, A.P., come along.

1788
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:26,168
Go upstairs and start things.
I'll be up in a minute.

1789
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:29,192
- But they're waiting.
- I'll be up in a minute.

1790
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:44,082
- Hello, Dad. May I come in?
- Hello, Son. Come on in.

1791
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:45,917
How are you?

1792
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:50,585
Glad to see you. Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

1793
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,514
You know what I always said
about the Kirbys and Tennyson's brook?

1794
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,157
They go on forever.

1795
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:59,326
If you're talking about
the meeting upstairs,

1796
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:03,288
- I know all about that. Congratulations.
- Thank you, but that's nothing at all.

1797
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:04,623
There's more to it than that.

1798
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:07,626
When I get through with them upstairs,
there will be a new president.

1799
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:12,106
- Do you know who that's going to be?
- Dad, I know you're going to be busy, so I...

1800
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,027
I'm quitting.

1801
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,992
You're quitting?

1802
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,808
I just handed in my resignation.

1803
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:24,810
I've been thinking about it
for a long time...

1804
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:28,480
So, you're quitting.
What are you going to do?

1805
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,048
I don't know.

1806
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:39,433
I think I'll go away for a while.

1807
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:42,306
Try and get myself organized.

1808
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:51,688
I'm was going to hang on to my job until
this thing with Alice got all straightened out

1809
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:54,444
but that's all over, so...

1810
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,909
There's no use waiting around for that.

1811
01:50:58,527 --> 01:51:00,655
I don't know, I...

1812
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:05,392
I thought, maybe after I get back,
I could start to work on that grass thing.

1813
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,937
You remember that thing Bob Smith
and I fooled around with in college?

1814
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,163
Yes.

1815
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:15,294
Dad, if you think it's funny, I'm sorry.
I came in here to say goodbye.

1816
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:19,656
Goodbye?

1817
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:22,305
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1818
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:27,355
I don't want any part of this, Dad.

1819
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,517
I never did.

1820
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:33,170
You can't do this,
after all the plans I made for you...

1821
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:35,756
Dad, if I can just make you
understand this.

1822
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:39,426
I think this business is great.
It's good for you because you like it.

1823
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:42,279
I don't. And I never will.

1824
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:51,790
I've tried to talk to you many times
about it, but I just couldn't get it out.

1825
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:57,361
I used to be able to talk to you, Dad,

1826
01:51:57,461 --> 01:51:58,963
but lately...

1827
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:21,490
I'll probably be gone
before you get home tonight.

1828
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,242
Goodbye, Dad.

1829
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:35,791
Goodbye, son.

1830
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:42,556
Maybe when I get back, we can sit down
and have a good old-fashioned gabfest.

1831
01:52:44,925 --> 01:52:46,677
Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:53:15,664 --> 01:53:17,837
- Yes.
- It's about Mr. Ramsey, sir.

1833
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,881
They just found him dead in the washroom.
The doctor said it was heart failure.

1834
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,122
Yes?

1835
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:36,022
- What did you say?
- They just found Mr. Ramsey dead.

1836
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:53,994
A.P., they're getting impatient upstairs.
I can't hold them any longer.

1837
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:16,270
Boardroom.

1838
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:22,903
Get everything set. We're on our way up.

1839
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,349
Hello, Mr. Kirby.

1840
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:34,451
Fifty-second. Fifty-second.

1841
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,215
Fifty-second, sir.

1842
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:53,412
Take me down.

1843
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:54,830
- Down?
- Down?

1844
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:56,623
- Where you going, A.P?
- We can't postpone this meeting.

1845
01:54:56,723 --> 01:55:00,068
- Take me down.
- We've been waiting on you for hours.

1846
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:10,321
What's the matter, Mr. Kirby?
Is there something wrong?

1847
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:23,900
Darned if I don't think
they enjoy this moving.

1848
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,378
Don't be silly. It's killing them.

1849
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:31,742
It certainly is going to be gay around here
when you leave, Grandpa?

1850
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:34,953
Grandpa found the cutest place
near where Alice is, right on the ocean.

1851
01:55:35,053 --> 01:55:37,581
- Lake, Penny. Lake.
- That's what I said, lake.

1852
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:40,459
We're going to invite you all up
to go deep-sea fishing.

1853
01:55:40,559 --> 01:55:43,545
- Gee, Mr. Kolenkhov, isn't it exciting?
- Exciting?

1854
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:47,946
With you moving and the Grand Duchess
out of a job, where do I eat?

1855
01:56:02,164 --> 01:56:05,609
- Hello, Mr. Vanderhof.
- So you're here again.

1856
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:08,153
Why won't you tell me where she is?

1857
01:56:08,253 --> 01:56:12,303
Because there's an unwritten law
in our family against snitching.

1858
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:15,994
But look, Mr. Vanderhof,
I just sort of feel

1859
01:56:16,094 --> 01:56:18,813
I can talk to you about this thing.

1860
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:24,403
I've left my job
and I'm going away tonight, and I...

1861
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:28,965
But I love Alice. And she loves me.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

1862
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:32,695
I'm convinced, young man,
but you're not marrying me.

1863
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:35,330
After all, Alice is the woman.

1864
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:39,205
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1865
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:43,205
I just thought I'd take a parting shot
before I left.

1866
01:56:43,371 --> 01:56:46,400
I certainly have messed
things up beautifully, haven't I?

1867
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,629
- Yes.
- Well, goodbye, sir.

1868
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:54,307
The trouble with young squirts nowadays
is they have no imagination.

1869
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:57,769
They don't use the old bean.

1870
01:56:58,094 --> 01:57:00,722
Well, I'll do anything you say, sir.

1871
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:04,167
- You want to see Alice again, don't you?
- Yes.

1872
01:57:04,267 --> 01:57:07,612
- And we can't tell you where she is?
- Yes, no, sir.

1873
01:57:07,938 --> 01:57:12,785
There's a big trunk of Alice's upstairs and
they're going to take it right where she is.

1874
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:15,120
Just don't say another word.

1875
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:19,078
Grandpa!

1876
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,311
Grandpa, I came just as soon
as I got your telegram.

1877
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:25,480
I'm too late.
You've already sold the house.

1878
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:29,025
Of course I've sold the house.
I got tired of it. That's all.

1879
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:31,027
Grandpa, it's all my fault.

1880
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:34,906
Alice, dear.
Alice, we were coming to you.

1881
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:37,367
Now everybody on the block has to move,
don't they?

1882
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:40,036
And Grandma. What about her?
You're walking out on her. Aren't you?

1883
01:57:40,136 --> 01:57:42,914
Now, don't be childish, Alice.
The thing is done.

1884
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:45,312
Now, go on upstairs
and pack your things.

1885
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:48,545
Alice, will you give me a chance
to talk to you?

1886
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,214
Well, they wanted the house
and they got it, the mighty Kirbys.

1887
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,383
- No, no. Wait.
- What are you doing here anyway?

1888
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:55,343
- Why don't you leave us alone?
- Now wait a minute!

1889
01:57:55,443 --> 01:57:56,928
I have something to tell you.
I want you to listen.

1890
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,221
Go ahead and scream.

1891
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,182
That's the way you've gotten everything
since you were a baby.

1892
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:03,161
Scream your head off
and see what it gets you now.

1893
01:58:06,955 --> 01:58:08,207
Alice, Alice.

1894
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,837
Alice.

1895
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:13,628
Alice.

1896
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:15,589
Alice.

1897
01:58:19,968 --> 01:58:21,578
I sure feel sorry for Grandpa.

1898
01:58:21,678 --> 01:58:25,457
I walked in the room and he was looking
at a picture of Grandma and he was crying.

1899
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:26,750
Crying?

1900
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,126
Yeah. He got kinda sore, too,

1901
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:31,254
because he caught me
looking at him, and threw something at me.

1902
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:35,008
There's only one thing worrying me.
Have they got relief up there?

1903
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:37,552
Sure they have.
They've got relief everywhere now.

1904
01:58:37,652 --> 01:58:38,887
- There is?
- Yeah.

1905
01:58:38,987 --> 01:58:41,490
Let's get on up there then.

1906
01:58:42,949 --> 01:58:45,602
Well, I guess we've moved everything
out of here.

1907
01:58:45,702 --> 01:58:47,500
Yes, that's about all.

1908
01:58:54,294 --> 01:58:55,716
Here's one that didn't go off.

1909
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:07,566
Be careful with it.
Especially the typewriter.

1910
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:11,191
I have a feeling I'm going to do
my best work at our new place.

1911
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,446
Dad.

1912
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:21,284
Now, Penny,
we've had enough wailing for one day.

1913
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:40,428
- Do you mind if I come in?
- No, no, not at all. Come right in.

1914
01:59:47,472 --> 01:59:50,166
We aren't quite prepared
for visitors, but...

1915
01:59:50,266 --> 01:59:53,003
Donald, put that chair down
for Mr. Kirby.

1916
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:56,607
Let me have that stool, too,
will you, Donald, please?

1917
01:59:58,108 --> 01:59:59,360
Thank you.

1918
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:05,390
- Mr. Vanderhof, could we be alone?
- Sure. Penny.

1919
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,912
Thank you.

1920
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:12,122
I don't know, Grandpa is talking to him.

1921
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:20,715
Mr. Vanderhof, you once told me
I was a failure as a father.

1922
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:25,428
- I didn't mean that.
- I know, but I am.

1923
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:30,144
Tony's walked out on me
and it's just about made a wreck of me.

1924
02:00:31,015 --> 02:00:34,770
Mr. Kirby,
you're beginning to act quite human.

1925
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:39,115
Look, you know about these things.
I don't.

1926
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:43,453
- I need your advice. I'd give a fortune to...
- Now, there you are,

1927
02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:47,123
you've got to stop thinking
in terms of fortune.

1928
02:00:48,283 --> 02:00:51,787
You know what I do
when I run smack into a crisis?

1929
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:56,900
I just take out my harmonica
and I play on it

1930
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,736
until that crisis just fades away.

1931
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:03,114
- Now, please don't joke about this...
- I'm not joking about it.

1932
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:06,242
You asked my advice
and I'm giving it to you.

1933
02:01:06,342 --> 02:01:11,122
I think that if we played a duet together,
you and I, on the harmonica...

1934
02:01:11,222 --> 02:01:15,193
- You brought it with you, didn't you?
- What? Well, I...

1935
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:17,028
Yes, fine.

1936
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,465
Now, let's play a duet good and loud.

1937
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:23,535
And you'll be surprised
at what might happen.

1938
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:27,031
Let's see, what shall we play?

1939
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:29,724
Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle?

1940
02:01:29,824 --> 02:01:32,060
- You ought to know it.
- Polly Wolly Doodle?

1941
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,879
We drove you almost crazy with it once.

1942
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:41,799
You know it, of course you do.

1943
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:46,808
Now, come on. Let's play it,
good and loud now, and swing it.

1944
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,660
What's that, Grandpa?

1945
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:08,409
Come on, Essie, let's get hot.

1946
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,242
Come on.

1947
02:03:35,825 --> 02:03:38,874
My Russian wrestling friend.

1948
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:48,759
Magnificent, magnificent.

1949
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,890
Thank you.

1950
02:03:52,634 --> 02:03:56,684
- Is my son here?
- You'll be surprised.

1951
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:05,689
Anthony.

1952
02:04:06,522 --> 02:04:08,967
Hello, Mother, come on.
You do the Big Apple, too.

1953
02:04:09,067 --> 02:04:11,386
Mr. Sycamore, you show her
how to do the Big Apple.

1954
02:04:11,486 --> 02:04:13,159
Come on. Why not?

1955
02:04:29,837 --> 02:04:31,614
Quiet, please.

1956
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:33,557
Quiet.

1957
02:04:35,343 --> 02:04:37,453
Well, sir, here we are again.

1958
02:04:37,553 --> 02:04:42,667
We've had quite a time of it lately,
but it seems as if the worst of it was over.

1959
02:04:42,767 --> 02:04:47,568
Of course, the fireworks all blew up,
but we can't very well blame that on you.

1960
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:52,031
Anyway, everything's turned out fine
as it usually does.

1961
02:04:52,443 --> 02:04:54,787
Alice is going to marry Tony.

1962
02:04:55,071 --> 02:05:00,168
Mr. Kirby, who's turned out to be
a very good egg, has sold us back our house

1963
02:05:00,618 --> 02:05:04,418
and he'll probably forget
all about big deals for a while.

1964
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:10,737
Nobody on our block has to move.
And with the right handling

1965
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:15,013
I think we can even thaw out
Mrs. Kirby in time.

1966
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:19,662
We've all got our health,
and as far as anything else is concerned

1967
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:22,140
we still leave that up to you.

1968
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:23,499
Thank you.

1969
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:24,896
Bring it on, Rheba.

1970
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:29,606
Now it is two easy lessons, Mrs. Kirby,
I will teach you...

1971
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:33,818
No holds barred.

1972
02:05:33,943 --> 02:05:36,287
I hope you like it, Mr. Kirby.

1972
02:05:37,305 --> 02:06:37,355
