1
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,726
Come on! Hit 'im! Hit 'im!

2
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,285
You're waltzin'.
Give the sucker some action.

3
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,256
You're fightin' like a bum.
Want some advice?

4
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,421
Water!

5
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,092
Should I bet the fight
don't go three rounds?

6
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:08,673
- You feel strong?
- Absolutely.

7
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,726
You want some good advice?
Keep moving.

8
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:01,727
Give him one!

9
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,800
All right, all right!

10
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:39,471
Next a six-rounder
between local lightweights

11
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,730
Kid Brooks and Sugar Johnson!

12
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,746
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

13
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:58,958
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.

14
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,708
You're a bum!

15
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,922
You're a bum!
You know that? You're a bum!

16
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,991
Hey...

17
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,277
You really got lucky tonight.

18
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:39,707
Spider, you get loser's share:
$40, less $15 locker and cornerman,

19
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:44,542
$5 shower and towel,
7% tax. Comes to 17.20.

20
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,162
You fought a good fight, Spider.

21
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:51,628
Balboa, you get winner's share:
$65, less $15 locker and cornerman,

22
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,597
$5 shower and towel and 7% tax.

23
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:57,178
Comes to 40.55.

24
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,188
- When do I fight again?
- Maybe two weeks. Gimme a call.

25
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:05,398
The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

26
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,683
Here, boy. Here, boy.

27
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,711
~ Take you back

28
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,210
~ Doo doo do-doo, take you back

29
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,092
- ~ Doo doo do-doo
- ~ I said I've been told by

30
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,133
~ Doo doo do-doo
Some people and they all

31
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,257
~ Said take you back

32
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:24,685
~ Doo doo do-doo
Take you back like before

33
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:28,430
~ But I don't call it a reason

34
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,729
~ I just call it believin' in myself

35
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,269
~ Doo doo do-doo, do-do-doo

36
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:38,237
~ Doo doo do-doo, push me back

37
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,534
You guys are gettin' better
every year, you know that?

38
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,702
Yeah!

39
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,205
~ What I saw before

40
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:53,120
~ I squeezed you then I held you

41
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:56,875
~ But I could not tell you I loved you

42
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,925
~ Doo doo do-doo, take you back

43
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,053
- ~ Doo doo do-doo
- ~ Well, you put me down

44
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:07,386
~ Doo doo do-doo
You put me down real nice

45
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,807
~ This love affair

46
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,605
~ Doo doo do-doo
Is takin' the largest slice

47
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:17,354
~ From my life, as I sing...

48
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,856
Hey! Your old man
did pretty good tonight.

49
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:02,530
Why weren't you there, huh? You shoulda
seen me. You guys hungry? No?

50
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,159
Here you go.

51
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,745
Here you go.

52
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:14,538
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

53
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,422
How you doin', Moby Dick?
You miss me today or what, huh?

54
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,344
Huh?

55
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:30,142
Here you go. Say hi. If you could sing or
dance, I wouldn't be doin' this, you know?

56
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,781
And this turtle food I got here, it's...

57
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,991
This turtle food, gotta add more flies in.
There are more moths in it.

58
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:58,711
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

59
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,749
How you feelin' this mornin'? Full of life?

60
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,415
- Fine.
- Hey, how you doin', killer?

61
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:29,133
- How's the turtle food this week?
- Fine.

62
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,217
- Me, I'm kinda aggravated, you know?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:36,892
- Ain't your fault. Wanna hear about it?
- I'll tell you somebody who don't.

64
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,930
How you doin', Gloria?

65
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:42,896
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies.

66
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,649
The moths get caught
in the turtles' throats.

67
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,156
They cough and I smack 'em on the back
of the shell. What do you think they get?

68
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,953
And they get what, huh?

69
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:57,952
Come on... Shell-shocked.
They get shell-shocked.

70
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,792
- Startin' with the bad jokes early, huh?
- Inventin' jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

71
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:04,961
That wasn't a joke.

72
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,498
How's my buddy doin' today? Yo, Butkus!

73
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,505
- I ain't had time to check 'im.
- Yo, Butkus!

74
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:23,353
Adrian, I want you to go downstairs and
clean all the cat cages. They're a mess.

75
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,831
You gotta pay for that
turtle food, Rock-head.

76
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:44,121
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria. You know that.

77
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,019
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?
- Real good.

78
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,526
- You fightin' again?
- Yeah, here and there.

79
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:16,524
- We'll make some money real soon, huh?
- Yeah, a million dollars.

80
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,903
Hey, you! Where you goin'?

81
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,586
Where you goin'? Huh?
Where you runnin'?

82
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,373
Hey! Hey!

83
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,841
- Don't hit the face!
- Shut up! Mr Gazzo wants the 200 now.

84
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:35,971
I'm broke!

85
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:39,263
Mr Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb.

86
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,975
- Please! Please! Don't break my...
- What's your name again?

87
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,939
- Bob!
- Listen, Bob...

88
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,687
You wanna dance,
you gotta pay the band.

89
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,061
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

90
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:57,023
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob,
you understand? Gimme some money.

91
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,531
Gimme some money. Come on.

92
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:06,366
- There's 130 here.
- That's it. I'm broke.

93
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,375
Hey, Bob. Hey, hey.

94
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,543
You're still $70 light.

95
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:15,797
You don't have to break nothin'. Here,
take my coat. It's worth 50, 60 dollars.

96
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,305
Here, take the coat. Take the coat!

97
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,890
- Be smart.
- You shoulda planned ahead, you know?

98
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,258
- You shoulda planned ahead.
- I'll tape up the hand!

99
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:28,097
- You shoulda planned ahead.
- Gazzo won't have to know!

100
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:32,529
He won't be wise to nothin'.
Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'!

101
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:34,698
He won't...

102
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:07,142
He only had 130, but I think he's
good for the rest next week, Mr Gazzo.

103
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,735
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

104
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:15,245
That's it for today.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.

105
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:19,914
- He's late three weeks and I don't like it.
- Tomorrow, three weeks, Del Rio.

106
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,249
I got it. How do you spell Del Rio?

107
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,501
- How'd you do last night?
- Real good.

108
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,711
- Hey, did you get the licence number?
- Of what?

109
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:32,970
- The truck that run over your face.
- Relax, buddy. Pull it over here.

110
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:36,133
I wanna let Rocky out,
then I'm gonna talk to him.

111
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,329
How come you didn't break his thumb?

112
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,747
- How do you know I didn't?
- I hear things.

113
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:06,285
- Did I give you a job this mornin'?
- Yeah.

114
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,544
So why didn't you break his thumb?

115
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,506
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad, Rock.

116
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:17,464
I figured... Look, if I break the guy's
thumb, he gets laid off, right? He can't...

117
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:22,345
Well, let me do the figurin', OK, Rock?
From here on, just let me do the figurin'.

118
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:26,524
These guys think we're runnin'
a charity and they're gonna get off light.

119
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,106
From here on in, do what I tell you to do,

120
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:33,779
because it's bad for my reputation,
you understand? You got it, Rock?

121
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,781
I got it.

122
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:41,071
Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

123
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,614
- Look in a dictionary, Rock!
- Come on!

124
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,534
Hey, I won't let that happen
no more - about the thumb.

125
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,211
You know?

126
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,667
So long, meatbag.

127
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,473
I shoulda broke your thumbs!

128
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:31,494
- I heard you did real good last night.
- Absolutely. You shoulda seen me.

129
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:34,204
- You oughta take a rest.
- No, my back is hurtin'.

130
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:37,046
- Your back?
- My back is hurtin'. You deaf?

131
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,891
No, I'm short.

132
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,675
Hey, yo, Mike. Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

133
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,288
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

134
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:57,883
What you talkin' about? It's been my
locker for six years. Where's my gear?

135
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,881
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

136
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,348
You put my stuff on skid row?

137
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:11,310
I been in that locker for six years
and you put my stuff on skid row?

138
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,978
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

139
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:18,190
- Where is he?
- He's outside, working with Dipper.

140
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:20,991
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

141
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:35,544
Put your hands up there. That's right.
Keep your hands up. That's right.

142
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,294
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

143
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:40,465
Attaboy!

144
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,827
Time! Time!

145
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,636
- What the hell? What do you want?
- How you feelin' today?

146
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,638
- What are you, a doctor or somethin'?
- You got problems today?

147
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:57,724
- Never mind my problem. What's yours?
- I've been talkin' to Michael.

148
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:01,729
- How come I been put outta my locker?
- Because Dipper needed it.

149
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:04,867
Dipper's a contender, a climber.
Know what you are?

150
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,821
- What?
- A tomato.

151
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:11,034
Yeah, let's face it. I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

152
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,040
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

153
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,205
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won KO in the second.

154
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,008
- Yeah? Who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

155
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,838
He's a bum!

156
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:25,420
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

157
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:30,264
You got heart, but you fight like a
goddamn ape. Nothin' special about you.

158
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:35,435
You never got your nose busted. Leave it
that way, and what's left of your mind.

159
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,400
Mick, I think I'll go take a steam.
You know why?

160
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,278
I did real good last night.
You shoulda seen me.

161
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:43,895
- Big deal.
- You shoulda seen me too.

162
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,317
Hey, kid, you ever think about retiring?

163
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,990
- No.
- You think about it.

164
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,446
- All right. Time!
- Hey, hey!

165
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:55,251
- What?
- I dig your locker, man.

166
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,874
Cold night.

167
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:40,096
Good night to catch
pneumonia, you know?

168
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,145
You need some help with that cage?

169
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:49,556
There's a good game
down at the Spectrum tonight.

170
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:54,446
You wanna go to a basketball game?

171
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:59,951
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

172
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,528
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

173
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,581
I had that locker for six years,
but it don't bother me.

174
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,543
Lockers are bad.
People get the combination.

175
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,453
I must've had 20 bucks taken
outta there in the past six years.

176
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,832
It don't sound like much, but it adds up.

177
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,672
You know? It doesn't matter. Who cares?

178
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:25,425
Cold night... Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here!

179
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,229
Look who's here. The giant worm.

180
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:33,649
Look at these birds. Don't these birds
look like candy? Like flyin' candy.

181
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,686
Want to fly me home?

182
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,607
Do you need somebody
to walk you home, you know?

183
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,234
No.

184
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,234
It's a cold night. If I was you and
you got the money, I would take a cab.

185
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,992
Too many creeps
around here, you know?

186
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:51,666
Every other block there's a creep.
You can always tell a creep.

187
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,914
All right, listen. I'm gonna go now.
I'll see ya's later, all right?

188
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,799
Now you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

189
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,888
So... I wanna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow, OK?

190
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:09,889
- Good night, Adrian.
- Good night, Rocky.

191
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,539
Yo!

192
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:34,878
There you go. I got a friend for you here.

193
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:38,209
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doin'? You seen Paulie?

194
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,299
He's in the steam room.

195
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:43,298
- Hey, Rocky, what's with the eye?
- Been fightin'.

196
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:47,973
- Hope ya's won it, at least.
- I did real good. You shoulda seen me.

197
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:53,350
- Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

198
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:56,648
- Hey, is he still around?
- Yeah, he's doin' real good.

199
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:02,565
He's doin' better than you are, that's
for sure! Hey, Paulie, you lock the door?

200
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:05,486
I'd like to kill the moron
who broke the mirror.

201
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,777
Hey, yo, Paulie!

202
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:12,207
Every day, every night I pass by.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.

203
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:15,953
- Forget her. You could do better than her.
- I don't forget nothin'.

204
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:20,916
Every night, I pass by the place, I tell
a joke. Every mornin', I tell a joke. Nothin'.

205
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:23,128
She just looks at me, you know?

206
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:26,298
- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

207
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:30,975
I need a Cadillac to connect with your
sister? Somethin' wrong with my face?

208
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:34,721
She's a freakin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,

209
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:38,191
- I could split her head with a razor.
- Don't get mental, man.

210
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,857
- You caught me in a bad mood.
- You always are.

211
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:44,322
- Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser.
- Hey!

212
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,028
She's pushin' 30 years old and if she
don't watch out she'll end up dyin' alone.

213
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,619
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll end up dyin' alone.

214
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:56,162
- I don't see no crowd around you.
- I'll kill the moron who broke the mirror.

215
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:59,747
Come on, let's get outta this stink,
would ya? Come on.

216
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:02,588
- I wanna talk to you, anyway.
- About what?

217
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:05,127
- Do you still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:08,015
Why don't you talk to him about me?

219
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:12,887
Well, I just don't think
Gazzo's hirin' right now, you know?

220
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:15,061
Come on.

221
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:19,941
- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?

222
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,568
My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.

223
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:27,647
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Come over and talk to her.

224
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:31,368
- Sure. Beer!
- Tomorrow you come for some bird.

225
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:34,368
Absolutely. You got it.

226
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,205
I gotta go. If I'm late,
she calls the hospital.

227
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:39,163
- Paulie!
- I got it.

228
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:44,338
<i>... with Mac Lee Green here in</i>
<i>Philadelphia at the fabulous Spectrum.</i>

229
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:47,006
<i>You're speakin' of your Bicentennial fight.</i>

230
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:51,301
<i>The greatest sportin' event in the</i>
<i>country's history. A gala occurrence.</i>

231
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:56,061
- <i>I'll beat him like he committed a crime.</i>
- Would you take a look at that guy?

232
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:59,475
Where are the real fighters
gonna come from, the pros?

233
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:02,279
All we got today are jig clowns.

234
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:07,235
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

235
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,989
<i>In keeping with great events</i>
<i>in our history,</i>

236
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,414
<i>I will duplicate the cracking of the</i>
<i>Liberty Bell by cracking Mac Lee Green.</i>

237
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,788
- You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?
- Well, what else? Look at him.

238
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,252
<i>Stay in school and use your brain.</i>

239
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,382
<i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,</i>
<i>carry a leather briefcase.</i>

240
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:27,961
<i>Forget sports as a profession.</i>
<i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>

241
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:31,382
<i>- Be a thinker, not a stinker.</i>
<i>- OK, thanks a lot, champ.</i>

242
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:34,054
Are you crazy?
He's champion of the world.

243
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:39,144
He took his best shot at becoming
champ. What shot did you ever take?

244
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:42,690
Hey, Rocky, if you're not
happy with your life, that's nice.

245
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:46,070
But I got a business goin'.
I don't have to take no shots.

246
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:50,695
<i>... no one having gone more than 12</i>
<i>rounds with him, and that was Jake...</i>

247
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:55,241
- Stick that up your business.
- What are you so insulted about?

248
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:59,704
You want me to take a shot?
All right, I'll take a shot!

249
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,936
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottom?
- No wine, man.

250
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:20,106
Come on! Just a little.
You're makin' a lot of money.

251
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:22,604
Marie, does your brother
know you're out?

252
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:26,779
- Screw you, yo-yo!
- These guys teach you to talk like that?

253
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:30,737
- Stuff it, man!
- Don't you say that to me. Come here!

254
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:33,275
Stick up on it!

255
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:35,571
Swivel on it, ya bum!

256
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,746
Hey, you know, when I was your age

257
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:43,214
there was one girl in the neighbourhood
who talked like that, you know? Just one.

258
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,257
What you doin'?
That'll make your teeth yellow.

259
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:49,338
- I like yellow teeth.
- And your breath like garbage.

260
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,424
- Maybe I like garbage.
- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.

261
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:57,515
Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking,
but guys never took her serious, you see?

262
00:26:57,645 --> 00:26:59,970
- They never took her out for a date.
- Why?

263
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:03,273
Guys laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

264
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:06,852
If you get a reputation,
you get no respect, you understand?

265
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:10,571
You get no respect.
I gotta use a bad word.

266
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,072
Whore. You understand? Whore.

267
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:17,366
You see, if you use dirty words,
you maybe end up becomin' a whore.

268
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:21,616
- Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.
- Hey, that don't matter you're 12.

269
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:26,879
You don't really have to be one.
You just act like one, and that's it - boom!

270
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,048
You get a bad rep, you understand?

271
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:33,127
20 years from now, people are
gonna say "Do you remember Marie?"

272
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:37,215
"No, who was she?" "The whore that
hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

273
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:40,021
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

274
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:45,852
You see, they don't remember you.
They remember the rep, you understand?

275
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:47,894
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

276
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:51,113
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
You know why?

277
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,155
Why don't you? Because you hang out
with them coconuts on the corner.

278
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:58,785
You hang around with coconuts,
you get nowhere. They're lemons!

279
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:01,750
Hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends.

280
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:04,628
Hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

281
00:28:04,754 --> 00:28:07,671
Hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

282
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,381
It's simple mathematics.
I hope you ain't gonna...

283
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:13,135
- I won't.
- What was I gonna say?

284
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:16,429
You hope I stop actin'
like a whore or I'll turn into one.

285
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:18,800
- Somethin' like that.
- Night, Rocky.

286
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:21,261
- Night, Marie. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

287
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:23,888
- Yo?
- Screw you, creepo!

288
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:35,738
Yeah, who are you to give advice,
creepo? Who are you?

289
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,264
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

290
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:04,311
It says that Green has suffered a severely
cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.

291
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:09,855
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

292
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:14,449
Hey, it ain't just Green! What about
all the time Apollo has invested?

293
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:17,492
- I believe we can find a solution.
- Solution nothin'.

294
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:20,324
Find me another contender
in a flash, Jergens.

295
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:25,082
Don't play games with my client. He's
done a million dollars' worth of publicity

296
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,046
and has made contractual obligations.

297
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:32,300
- He's not going to be embarrassed!
- I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

298
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:36,506
- Ernie is fighting in France that week.
- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.

299
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:41,881
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
I got hold of every worthwhile contender

300
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,933
and they all say five weeks
isn't enough time to get into shape.

301
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:50,608
Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They
know everybody's gonna see the fight.

302
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:53,441
None of 'em can whip me.
They're makin' excuses

303
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:56,775
so they don't get whipped
in front of the whole world.

304
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:59,863
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

305
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:03,365
I've promoted fights in every
goddamn country in the world

306
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,458
and I've broken my ass over this,
but I don't know what the hell else to do.

307
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:15,342
I do.

308
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:21,176
Without a ranked contender, what
this fight is gonna need is a novelty.

309
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,681
This is the land of opportunity, right?

310
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:29,932
So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives
a local underdog fighter an opportunity.

311
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:34,397
A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

312
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,191
And I'll tell you why.

313
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:41,200
Because I'm sentimental, like
a lot of other people in this country.

314
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:45,706
There's nothing they'd like better than
to see Apollo Creed give a local boy

315
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:49,783
a shot at the world title
on this country's biggest birthday.

316
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:52,412
Now that's the way I see it.

317
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,673
And that's the way it's gonna be.

318
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,877
Apollo, I like it!

319
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:59,419
It's very American.

320
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:02,426
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

321
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,449
- What is it?
- I just wanna check this out.

322
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:33,002
I pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli?

323
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:37,129
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

324
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,629
- Two yards. Yeah, I got it.
- OK, write it down, OK?

325
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:44,382
Who's this girl you're
goin' out with tomorrow night?

326
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:47,603
- How d'you know?
- Don't you think I hear things?

327
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,392
- A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.
- I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.

328
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:56,310
- I hear she's retarded.
- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

329
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:01,156
I'll tell you what to do. Take her
to the zoo. I hear retards like the zoo.

330
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,741
- This bum gotta say that?
- You callin' me a bum?

331
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:07,157
- I'm callin' you a bum!
- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.

332
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,747
- It's his prostate.
- He's always in a bad mood.

333
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:13,293
Count your blessings, Buddy.
You're still healthy.

334
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,747
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours!

335
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:17,757
- Kiss my ass!
- Move!

336
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:23,045
Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,
are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.

337
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,352
Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,
they just hate for no reason, you got me?

338
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,520
- Yeah.
- Come here.

339
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:35,727
There's 50 bucks.
You and Adrian, you have a nice time.

340
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,068
Thanks.

341
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:42,742
- Hey, how'd you know her name?
- You don't think I hear things?

342
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,370
- Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?

343
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,739
Take her to the zoo!

344
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,796
- Some more coffee, Mr Creed?
- No thanks, Shirley.

345
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:03,011
- What do you think about Billy Snow?
- Fouls.

346
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,263
- How about Big Chuck Smith?
- Yeah.

347
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:10,259
No, he's too old and dull.
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

348
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:15,521
- No, I don't feel the heat from that name.
- Joe Zack's a good prospect.

349
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:19,067
Exactly what are you lookin' for, Apollo?

350
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:23,783
This is what I'm lookin' for.
The Italian Stallion.

351
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,157
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

352
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:29,614
Look, it's the name, man.

353
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,501
The Italian Stallion.

354
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:37,373
The media'll eat it up. Now who
discovered America? An Italian, right?

355
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,959
What would be better than
to get it on with a descendant?

356
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,297
He's a southpaw.
I don't want you messin' with them.

357
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:49,389
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three.

358
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,683
"Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."

359
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,226
Sounds like a damn monster movie!

360
00:33:57,611 --> 00:34:01,226
What are you doin' with that bat?
I used to be deadly at stickball.

361
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:06,697
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.

362
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:10,162
The joints, from carrying meat
in and out of freezers.

363
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,492
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.

364
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:16,199
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

365
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:19,623
- What kind of turkey? Big or small?
- Talk to Gazzo about me.

366
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:23,293
Tell him I'm a good man
and nothin' bothers me.

367
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,129
I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.

368
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:32,177
A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.
That's a bad job, you know what I mean?

369
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:35,811
- You got a match?
- Go to him for me, as a favour.

370
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,776
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey,

371
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:44,738
it was when they had a $2 special
at Horn AND Hardart's about three years ago.

372
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:58,290
- Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure?
- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.

373
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,419
Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?

374
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,921
- I don't ask nobody twice.
- You don't ask nobody twice.

375
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,926
~ Stay away, baby

376
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:17,647
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

377
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:22,983
Paulie! You're late.

378
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:28,274
You called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

379
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:30,653
Yo, how you doin'?

380
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,244
I told you she's very excited.

381
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:38,416
Why didn't you say
you were bringin' him?

382
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:42,129
- Look at me. I'm not ready.
- Would it make a difference if you were?

383
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:46,090
- He's a friend and he's takin' you out.
- No, I can't.

384
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,921
I want you outta the kitchen
and I want you out right now.

385
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,512
I won't.

386
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:55,430
Hey! Hey!

387
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:58,595
Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!

388
00:35:58,732 --> 00:36:03,609
I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around
like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!

389
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:07,321
- Paulie, I can't go!
- Don't get wise with me now.

390
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,317
- I'm tired of you bein' a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!

391
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:14,371
<i>Apollo Creed is shopping</i>
<i>for another "victim"</i>

392
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:18,366
<i>to fill Green's vacancy for the</i>
<i>Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

393
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:21,124
You didn't tell me
you were bringin' him home!

394
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,422
I'm not gonna go, Paulie!
I can't go! I won't go!

395
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,543
Why?

396
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:30,627
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

397
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:33,719
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

398
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,233
You want the bird?

399
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:52,574
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

400
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,030
Oh, Paulie!

401
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:58,083
I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!

402
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,707
Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!

403
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,631
You hungry, Rock?

404
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,182
Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just
better forget all this, you know?

405
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:20,598
- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.

406
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,983
Ain't nothin' to say.
She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood...

407
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,780
You know how to do funny.
Wanna go out with her?

408
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,360
- Yeah.
- Well...

409
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,288
- I don't know what to say.
- Funny.

410
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,755
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

411
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,963
Rocky, you know?

412
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,137
Listen...

413
00:37:55,684 --> 00:38:00,145
I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never
talked to no door before, you know?

414
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:05,644
- I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen...
- Come on, you're doin' fine.

415
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:08,103
I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.

416
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:12,568
Keep doin' what you're doin'.
Funny. I know all about these things.

417
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,741
I feel like a jerk.

418
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:23,081
Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know?

419
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:25,370
Listen...

420
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:28,175
I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

421
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,927
Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't
got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.

422
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:38,133
So how about maybe you and I could
go out together and get somethin' to eat?

423
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:41,057
I don't know, maybe laugh
a little bit. Who knows?

424
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:43,645
Would you like to...

425
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:49,811
I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?

426
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:57,651
We're gonna have a good time.

427
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,324
We'll have a real good time, you know?

428
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:07,042
Thanks for the bird.

429
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,968
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

430
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,563
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

431
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:32,854
Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat
out. Who pays the bills around here?

432
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:41,238
Listen, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?

433
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:46,034
- But it was Thanksgiving.
- It was what?

434
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:50,500
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.

435
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:17,690
- Yo, looks kinda quiet.
- I think it's closed.

436
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:20,995
No, I think we're just early
or somethin' like that.

437
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:22,368
- Yo!
- Yo!

438
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,492
- We're closed!
- What?

439
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:27,462
- I said we're closed!
- Yeah. Hey, listen,

440
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:30,874
I'm gonna smooth this guy out.
Wait here for a few minutes.

441
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,297
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's OK.

442
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:36,879
Are you closed to the general public
or closed to everybody?

443
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:41,510
It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

444
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:45,937
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,
so do me a favour and leave, huh?

445
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:50,014
- Could you do me a favour?
- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.

446
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:52,903
Look, this girl here ain't feelin' well.

447
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:57,656
The doctor says she should exercise
and ice-skating's the best thing.

448
00:40:57,784 --> 00:41:02,161
- Yeah? So what do you want from me?
- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.

449
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:05,788
So if you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it.

450
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:09,867
- Ten minutes, ten bucks.
- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

451
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,331
Come on! It's Thanksgiving.

452
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:17,627
- All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

453
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:20,973
Gimme the blades.

454
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:25,012
- Aren't you skating?
- No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

455
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:27,553
That's when I started fightin'.

456
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,308
- Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?
- Yeah.

457
00:41:31,444 --> 00:41:34,113
You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?

458
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:40,529
Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin'
used to be tops with me, but no more.

459
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:43,283
All I wanted to do was
prove I was no bum,

460
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:45,822
that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

461
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:49,576
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't cryin', cos I still fight.

462
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:53,211
I kinda do it like a hobby.
The trouble is, I'm a southpaw.

463
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:56,341
- What's a southpaw?
- It means you're left-handed.

464
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:58,794
A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?

465
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:02,879
Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.
Nobody wants to look awkward.

466
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:06,601
- You know where southpaw came from?
- Nine minutes!

467
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,680
A long time ago, a couple of hundred
years ago, this guy was fightin'.

468
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:14,269
I think it was around Philadelphia.
He was left-handed.

469
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:16,812
His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.

470
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:20,199
And that's south,
so they called him Southpaw.

471
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:23,032
You see? Southpaw, South Jersey,

472
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:26,412
South Camden, Southpaw...
You know what I mean?

473
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:30,118
Things worked out for the best.

474
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:32,874
You never got a chance,
being left-handed?

475
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:36,706
Well, that's absolutely true,
you know? Watch out, watch out.

476
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:43,262
I just dislocated my finger.
Agh! Look at that.

477
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:45,798
No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look.

478
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:48,971
See? Look.
It's an old wound. You see that?

479
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:52,937
Look. See? Nothin'.
It bends like that. I originally done it...

480
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,107
Push the button... Bong! It works.

481
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:58,736
- It ain't your fault. I'll show you...
- Seven minutes!

482
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:01,902
I originally done it...
I keep pictures of all my fights.

483
00:43:02,035 --> 00:43:04,573
I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?

484
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:07,825
He's the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands.

485
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:14,043
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?

486
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:16,248
Come on. Are you havin' a good time?

487
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:20,463
I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't
too graceful. I don't move well.

488
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:23,632
But I can really swat, you know?
I can really hit hard.

489
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:28,926
But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to
fight a southpaw, you know what I mean?

490
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:35,230
Whooo! You know how
I got started in fightin'?

491
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,400
- Huh?
- No.

492
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,605
Am I talkin' too loud?

493
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,150
- No.
- Three minutes!

494
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:45,826
My father, he's...
My old man, he was never too smart.

495
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:50,582
He says to me "You weren't born
much of a brain, so start usin' your body."

496
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,165
So I've become a fighter.

497
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:56,795
You know what I mean?
Why are you laughin'?

498
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:01,053
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

499
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,929
What did she say?
What did she say, the opposite?

500
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:08,219
"You weren't born much of a body,
so you'd better develop your brain."

501
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:11,518
- Did she say that?
- Yo! Time!

502
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:15,273
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

503
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:19,652
- Why do you wanna fight?
- Cos I can't sing or dance.

504
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,440
Hey, yo!

505
00:44:21,573 --> 00:44:24,325
Don't fall! Don't fall!

506
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:28,283
Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this.
You like the way I skate?

507
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:31,414
The last fight I had was
with a guy named Spider Rico.

508
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,246
He bust my head up.
Do you see that scar?

509
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:37,295
I'll tell ya, things get
pretty rough in the ring.

510
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:50,473
You know, some people are
very shy by nature, you know?

511
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:52,643
I suppose.

512
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:57,936
I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?

513
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,108
Yeah... I suppose.

514
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,030
Hey! Hey!

515
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:06,526
The bum from the dock.
Get a job, ya bum!

516
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,365
You know, some people think bein' shy
is a disease, but it don't bother me none.

517
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,742
It don't bother me, either.

518
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:19,668
Why did I bother bringin' it up?
Cos I'm dumb, that's why.

519
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:26,384
I think we make a real sharp couple
of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy.

520
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:32,349
I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.

521
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,602
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

522
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,231
You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?

523
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,811
It's a racket where you're almost
guaranteed to end up a bum.

524
00:45:41,946 --> 00:45:45,481
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum, you know?

525
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:48,452
I'll tell ya somethin'.

526
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:52,243
The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?

527
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:57,201
I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're
nothin' but a large wound, you know?

528
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,376
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

529
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:03,088
I wanna call a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

530
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:07,963
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face
is all busted up, your hands is swollen.

531
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:12,427
Look at this face. 64 fights.
Look at that nose. See that nose?

532
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,885
That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.

533
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:19,564
I've had guys bustin' on it,
chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.

534
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:23,905
I mean, whack, boom. These guys
are hittin' my nose all the time.

535
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,649
Never broke. I'm proud of that.
Ain't that rare? That's rare.

536
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,035
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

537
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:37,372
- Cos you can't sing or dance?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

538
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,661
Hey, you wanna come inside?

539
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,252
- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, come on. I got some animals.

540
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:49,300
I got these very rare animals inside.
Come on. Come on in.

541
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:54,426
- No, no. I gotta go.
- I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.

542
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,183
- Go on.
- No, I gotta go.

543
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,351
Hey, look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust?

544
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:05,395
Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

545
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,986
Huh? Come on. Come on in.

546
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,948
Yo.

547
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,809
Flick.

548
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,729
- Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
- No.

549
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,655
I got some things in there. I got soda,
some doughnuts or somethin'.

550
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,073
A couple of cupcakes, huh?

551
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,453
No? I think I got some chocolate in there.

552
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,621
No?

553
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,256
Hot in here, you know?

554
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,176
I could go for some music.

555
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,264
Yo, Adrian.

556
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,067
These are the exotic animals
I told you about.

557
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:25,561
- These are my friends Cuff and Link.
- I sold 'em to ya.

558
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:29,610
Sure, I know you sold 'em to me.
You were workin' at that pet shop.

559
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:33,240
First day you was there,
I bought both these animals.

560
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,328
Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl
and I bought the animals themselves,

561
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:41,542
the food, the marbles
that go on the bottom there.

562
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:47,672
Remember that mountain? I had to get rid
of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'.

563
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,632
Yo, why don't you come on
over here and sit down?

564
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,050
It's a nice couch. I don't know...

565
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:04,054
There's big bugs in there, you know?
It's safer over here.

566
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,983
You wanna sit down?

567
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:15,823
Are these your parents?

568
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,279
Yeah, that's both of 'em there.

569
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:21,036
- Is this you?
- Yeah, that's me when I was eight.

570
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,501
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

571
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:31,049
Why don't you come on over and
make yourself comfortable? Relax.

572
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,719
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I ain't got no phone.

573
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:41,184
I had it pulled,
cos of people callin' all the time.

574
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,931
Who needs the aggravation, right?
The interruptions.

575
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:49,397
- Who do you wanna call?
- I wanna let my brother know where I am.

576
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:52,855
Why?

577
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:57,950
- I think he might be worried.
- Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem.

578
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:05,452
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
I'll call ya's back later! See ya!

579
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,211
You don't like the room, do ya?

580
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:17,550
- It's fine.
- Well, it's only temporary, you know?

581
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,890
It's not that.

582
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,600
What's the problem? You don't like me?
Or the turtles? What's the problem?

583
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:32,821
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's OK.

584
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,822
I don't belong here.

585
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:42,165
Well, you know, it's OK,
cos you're my guest, you know?

586
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,162
I don't know you well enough.

587
00:50:45,294 --> 00:50:49,244
I've never been in
a man's apartment alone.

588
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:53,592
Well, I have.
They're all the same, you know?

589
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,185
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

590
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:04,518
I don't feel comfortable.

591
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:08,561
Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.

592
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:13,271
- I should go.
- Don't go, please. Don't go.

593
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:15,813
Don't go. Don't go.

594
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,989
Don't go.

595
00:51:20,913 --> 00:51:23,665
- Do me a favour?
- What?

596
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,247
Take off these glasses.

597
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:31,962
You have nice eyes, you know?

598
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:36,339
Do me another favour?

599
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,927
Would you take off that hat?

600
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,602
I always knew you was pretty.

601
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:51,479
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasin' ya.

602
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,533
I ain't teasin' ya.

603
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,115
I just... I wanna kiss ya.

604
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:06,081
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want,

605
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,249
but I wanna kiss you.

606
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,074
I heard you had a fight comin' up.

607
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:25,204
Yeah, I'm gonna fight
next month, January 27th.

608
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:30,538
That's good, man. You come on down
the gym. We'll see that you get in shape.

609
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,662
Hey, Rock, how you doin'?

610
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:36,000
- Mick was lookin' for you up there, man.
- For me? You sure?

611
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:40,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you.
Get on up there and see him.

612
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,657
- You got somethin' for me?
- A guy from Miles Jergens was here.

613
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:06,865
- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
- When was he here?

614
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:11,245
- About an hour ago.
- Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

615
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:14,456
I said that before, you dumb dago!

616
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:19,961
I've been comin' here for six years
and you always stick it to me. How come?

617
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:23,095
- You don't wanna know!
- Yeah, I wanna know how come!

618
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,345
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!

619
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:30,267
OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had
the talent to become a good fighter!

620
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:33,231
And instead of that,
you became a leg-breaker

621
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,524
to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

622
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,689
- It's a livin'.
- It's a waste of life!

623
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,609
Yes? May I help you?

624
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,824
Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.

625
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,044
Mr Jergens is expecting you.
Just a moment.

626
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,880
Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

627
00:55:19,013 --> 00:55:21,005
Fine.

628
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,512
- Please go in, Mr Balboa.
- Can I have that?

629
00:55:23,642 --> 00:55:26,098
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

630
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:32,729
Mr Balboa.

631
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:36,477
How are you? George Jergens.
Take a chair, please.

632
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,653
Thanks.

633
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:42,161
- Mr Balboa...
- You can call me Rocky.

634
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:46,864
Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any
representation? You have a manager?

635
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:49,039
Uh, no, just me.

636
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:53,912
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

637
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:57,418
- About sparrin'?
- I beg your pardon?

638
00:55:57,552 --> 00:56:02,095
I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners
and I wanna say I'm very available.

639
00:56:02,223 --> 00:56:05,557
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely. It would be an honour.

640
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:08,770
And you know what?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

641
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:13,891
- I'd really be a good sparrin' partner.
- You don't understand me, Rocky.

642
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:19,105
My proposition's this. Would you be
interested in fighting Apollo Creed

643
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:22,112
for the world heavyweight championship?

644
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:29,079
- No.
- Listen, Rocky,

645
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:32,584
Apollo's seen you fight.

646
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,173
He likes you. He wants to fight you.

647
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,216
Well, it's just that, you see,
I fight in clubs, you know?

648
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:44,925
I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is
the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight.

649
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,010
But thank you very much,
you know? I appreciate it.

650
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:53,810
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

651
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:56,898
Yeah.

652
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:59,107
Apollo Creed does.

653
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:04,070
And he's gonna prove it to the world
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

654
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:07,040
And that unknown is you.

655
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,407
He picked you, Rocky.

656
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:13,502
Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.

657
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,872
You can't pass it by.

658
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,042
What do ya say?

659
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:27,088
<i>All right. That's enough pictures.</i>
<i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

660
00:57:27,188 --> 00:57:29,723
<i>How do you like</i>
<i>the city of brotherly love?</i>

661
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,308
<i>Well, just bein' in Philadelphia</i>
<i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>

662
00:57:33,444 --> 00:57:37,144
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
<i>wishin' me the best.</i>

663
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:40,780
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers.</i>
<i>I'm proud to be an American.</i>

664
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:45,655
<i>Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man</i>
<i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

665
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:47,996
<i>Look, if history proves one thing...</i>

666
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:51,790
<i>American history proves that</i>
<i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

667
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:55,539
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear of</i>
<i>Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

668
00:57:55,674 --> 00:57:58,877
<i>It is a coincidence that</i>
<i>you're fighting a white man</i>

669
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,300
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in US history?</i>

670
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:07,053
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's</i>
<i>fightin' a black man on the same day?</i>

671
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:09,225
<i>Right on! Tell the truth, brother!</i>

672
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:11,847
<i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>

673
00:58:11,983 --> 00:58:15,068
<i>How do I feel about him?</i>
<i>Come here, Rock.</i>

674
00:58:15,195 --> 00:58:19,193
<i>- My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

675
00:58:19,324 --> 00:58:24,070
<i>- Well now, what does that mean?</i>
<i>- If he can't fight, I bet he can cook!</i>

676
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:29,704
- Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.
- Paulie!

677
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:33,251
<i>Rocky, how do you</i>
<i>expect to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

678
00:58:33,381 --> 00:58:37,509
<i>Well, jeez, Creed's the best.</i>
<i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>

679
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:40,422
<i>Tell me, Rocky. Just between us,</i>

680
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:43,472
<i>where did you get</i>
<i>the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>

681
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,011
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i>
<i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>

682
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:54,266
<i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>
<i>Any comment?</i>

683
00:58:56,028 --> 00:58:58,354
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

684
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:00,280
<i>No comment, right.</i>

685
00:59:00,408 --> 00:59:04,026
<i>Wait a minute. I just wanna</i>
<i>say hi to my girlfriend, OK?</i>

686
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:08,455
<i>Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>
<i>Look at this. Can you believe all this?</i>

687
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:11,536
Rocky, you didn't!

688
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:14,587
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Quit pushin', man!</i>

689
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:15,829
<i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>

690
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:19,964
Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?
I'd break his lips.

691
00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:23,262
- He's takin' cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.

692
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:28,431
Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin'
for people to help you out.

693
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:31,232
- Help what?
- You know...

694
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:35,189
- Keep you livin' a clean life.
- I do OK, you know?

695
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,649
You need someone to help with
the exercise, stand by with a towel,

696
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:41,490
run errands.

697
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:46,659
Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
I think I'm gonna train myself, you know?

698
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:51,701
Without such good people around to help,
you don't have such a good chance.

699
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:54,754
Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.

700
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:57,170
- That so?
- Yeah.

701
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:02,804
Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was
blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance.

702
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,479
- Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
- You lookin' to do a good deed?

703
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,444
Keep outta my freakin' life!

704
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,860
- What did I do?
- Nothin'.

705
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,824
- Did I say something?
- You didn't say nothin'.

706
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:25,196
That's right, you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

707
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,870
I gotta go.

708
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,914
Where's the freakin' pretzels?

709
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:38,622
Goddamn the pretzels!
Hey, we don't have any beer!

710
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,301
I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer!

711
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,271
How'd you like hearin'
your name on TV tonight?

712
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,066
I was shocked. Why'd you do that?

713
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:02,065
- Come on, you're puttin' me on, right?
- Absolutely.

714
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:05,985
- What time should I expect you?
- Oh, about seven.

715
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:08,161
Hey.

716
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:22,902
Hey.

717
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:28,005
You know I said that stuff on TV
didn't bother me none?

718
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:30,110
Yeah?

719
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:33,894
It did.

720
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,535
Listen, the reason I've
brought you here is because...

721
01:01:47,664 --> 01:01:50,073
Have you got money
for trainin' expenses?

722
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:54,159
- I got a few dollars, you know?
- Well, here. Put this in your glove.

723
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:57,796
- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

724
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,007
You ain't never had any luck, but this time
Lady Luck may be in your corner.

725
01:02:03,138 --> 01:02:06,140
- What do ya think?
- Maybe. Maybe...

726
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:11,558
- Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.
- It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya.

727
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:13,148
- Wait a minute.
- What?

728
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:16,145
- You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on.
- Hey.

729
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:26,074
- Yo, Tony?
- What?

730
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:28,280
You gonna show up at the fight?

731
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:31,196
- Ringside.
- Hey, hey!

732
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:34,333
I'll see ya.

733
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:10,788
Yeah!

734
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:19,088
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

735
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:21,377
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good!

736
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:24,264
Hey, this is a nice place here.

737
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,557
Anyway, what I come to tell you is that...

738
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:32,019
...that what happened to you is freak luck.

739
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:35,315
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

740
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:39,276
They're good fighters.
They're colourful, they got good records.

741
01:03:39,406 --> 01:03:41,730
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

742
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:45,946
But you... you got a shot at the title.

743
01:03:46,078 --> 01:03:49,613
- Freak luck is a strange thing.
- Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?

744
01:03:49,749 --> 01:03:52,156
Yeah, sure.

745
01:03:52,293 --> 01:03:55,792
- What the hell are those?
- Oh, they're domestic turtles.

746
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:59,541
The one on top is Cuff and
the other is Link. The rest are marbles.

747
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:03,128
Yeah? They make good soup, do they?

748
01:04:03,263 --> 01:04:06,846
Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya

749
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:11,436
that you gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

750
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:16,605
Because, I don't know, like the Bible says,
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

751
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,855
- Yeah, all right.
- You thought of that, huh?

752
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:24,157
Well, what you need is a manager.

753
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,242
A manager. Listen to me.

754
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:30,954
I know, because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

755
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:34,334
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. God, I've seen it all.

756
01:04:34,462 --> 01:04:37,214
All of it. You know what I done?

757
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,879
- What?
- I have done it all.

758
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,711
You shoulda seen me when
I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring.

759
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:47,892
Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya.
September 14, 1923.

760
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:52,063
And it was the same night that
Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

761
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,225
- The same night. Who gets the publicity?
- Dempsey.

762
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,648
- That's right, but why?
- Cos he was champ.

763
01:04:57,778 --> 01:05:00,898
No! Because he had a manager.

764
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,653
I had nothin', man.

765
01:05:03,784 --> 01:05:07,367
I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute. Look.

766
01:05:07,496 --> 01:05:12,407
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

767
01:05:12,543 --> 01:05:16,043
You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.

768
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:20,336
The last time was with
that fight with Sailor Mike.

769
01:05:20,468 --> 01:05:23,469
I got the clippin' here. A good fight.

770
01:05:23,596 --> 01:05:25,506
Read that.

771
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,680
Well, it doesn't matter.

772
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:31,012
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

773
01:05:32,272 --> 01:05:35,475
Ah, Rocky Marciano!

774
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:40,731
You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, do you know that?

775
01:05:40,864 --> 01:05:44,482
- You really think so?
- That's right. You move like him.

776
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:46,657
And you got heart, like he did.

777
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:50,036
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

778
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:59,580
Anyway, you know,
when I begun in this business, kid...

779
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,469
Look, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

780
01:06:05,598 --> 01:06:09,347
It's no good for ya.
You don't mind my sayin'?

781
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:14,104
Anyway, when I started this racket,
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

782
01:06:14,232 --> 01:06:19,938
For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat
out. But I never had no management.

783
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:25,364
One time, this son of a bitch
that I fought, he put a nail right there.

784
01:06:25,494 --> 01:06:27,652
- In his thumb?
- Yeah, in the glove.

785
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:30,243
And he punched
so many holes in my face,

786
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:35,500
I had this spit shootin' outta
my cheeks. Can you imagine that?

787
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:39,129
When I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime...

788
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:42,129
I want ya to look at somethin'.
Will ya look at that?

789
01:06:42,261 --> 01:06:46,425
That's the way I looked
before these guys got at me.

790
01:06:46,557 --> 01:06:50,092
That's nice. You don't take
care of the picture, though.

791
01:06:50,228 --> 01:06:54,308
Well, I never had no management.
That was the trouble.

792
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:59,019
Now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here and I wanna give it to you.

793
01:06:59,153 --> 01:07:03,732
I wanna take care of you. I wanna make
sure all this shit that happened to me

794
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:07,532
doesn't happen to you.
You know what I mean?

795
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:11,446
- The fight's set.
- Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

796
01:07:11,582 --> 01:07:15,284
- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need no manager.

797
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:19,999
But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya.
I've got pain and I've got experience.

798
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:23,300
I got pain and I got experience too.

799
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:27,094
- Now listen, kid...
- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.

800
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:31,269
I needed your help about ten years ago.
You never helped me none.

801
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:34,598
- You didn't care.
- Well, if you wanted help...

802
01:07:34,732 --> 01:07:38,776
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

803
01:07:38,902 --> 01:07:42,402
Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!

804
01:07:42,531 --> 01:07:44,571
Well, I...

805
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:47,449
I...

806
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:50,743
I'm 76 years old.

807
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:57,002
And...

808
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,401
Ah, shit.

809
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:34,871
Took you long enough to get here.

810
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:39,878
Ten years to come to my house. What's
the matter? You don't like my house?

811
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:42,333
My house stink?

812
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:44,794
That's right. It stinks!

813
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,337
I didn't ask no favours from you!

814
01:08:47,474 --> 01:08:49,550
Don't throw it around!

815
01:08:50,018 --> 01:08:54,098
Talkin' about your prime.
What about my prime, Mick?

816
01:08:54,523 --> 01:08:56,978
At least you had a prime!

817
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:02,269
I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'!
Legs are goin', everything's goin'!

818
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:07,613
Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna
fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

819
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:11,280
I'm gonna go and fight that big fight.
I'm gonna get that!

820
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:14,167
I'm gonna get that!

821
01:09:14,294 --> 01:09:17,164
And you wanna be ringside
and see it? Do ya?

822
01:09:17,297 --> 01:09:21,377
You wanna help me out? Huh? Do you
wanna see me get my face kicked in?

823
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:26,385
Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'!
They go "Go on, fight the champ!"

824
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:28,554
Yeah, I'll fight him.

825
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,563
Get my face kicked in.

826
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:38,849
You come around here! You wanna move
in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house!

827
01:09:38,986 --> 01:09:42,070
Real nice! Come on in and move! It stinks!

828
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:45,320
This whole place stinks!

829
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:49,119
You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!

830
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:52,248
Come on! Help me out! I'm standin' here!

831
01:10:51,268 --> 01:10:57,105
<i>It's 28 degrees. We'll check that forecast</i>
<i>in a minute. I feel very weird.</i>

832
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,898
<i>Very... Well, the thing is</i>
<i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

833
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:04,065
<i>When I hit the seats this morning,</i>
<i>I just went "Whoo!"</i>

834
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:08,244
<i>I figured if I'm up, everybody</i>
<i>in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>

835
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:12,202
<i>Do you agree? At three minutes</i>
<i>past four, what else are you gonna do?</i>

836
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:17,211
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Mrs Kramer!</i>

837
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:19,912
<i>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia.</i>

838
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:22,967
<i>- How are you this morning?</i>
<i>- Huh? What?</i>

839
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:28,468
<i>I think you have a lot of nerve callin' me</i>
<i>at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i>

840
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:32,929
~ <i>WYBG</i>

841
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:39,435
~ <i>Philadelphia</i>

842
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:43,364
<i>Ha! We got Mrs Kramer up</i>
<i>and it's a good morning.</i>

843
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:47,702
<i>Boy, I need somethin' to struggle with.</i>
<i>28° - it's cold out there.</i>

844
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:53,118
<i>We've been getting away with murder</i>
<i>for weeks. Our high today could be 30.</i>

845
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:56,950
<i>Tonight we're back down in the 20° range,</i>
<i>colder in the suburbs.</i>

846
01:11:57,086 --> 01:12:00,954
<i>And tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>
<i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>

847
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:05,752
<i>But it's awfully chilly. Make sure you</i>
<i>have it bundled up before you bring it out.</i>

848
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,489
Come on. It stinks... Hey, come on!
It stinks in here, you know?

849
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:34,662
Yeah, I know.

850
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,212
Hey, do you kill all these things?

851
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:41,793
No, across the street.

852
01:14:43,426 --> 01:14:46,213
This place looks like
an animal morgue, you know?

853
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:49,430
- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.

854
01:14:54,062 --> 01:14:56,518
Who killed all these things?

855
01:14:56,649 --> 01:15:00,184
- What, are you crazy?
- Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook.

856
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:02,727
Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

857
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:08,534
Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's
why I want you to talk to him about me.

858
01:15:08,661 --> 01:15:11,151
I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer.

859
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:16,792
Why don't you do yourself a favour?
Keep this job, because you eat better.

860
01:15:16,918 --> 01:15:19,789
Moo... Does it ever snow in here?

861
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:26,335
You and my sister.
How are you gettin' along together?

862
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:29,139
How you think?

863
01:15:29,264 --> 01:15:31,589
I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

864
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:36,313
- About what?
- What's the story? What's happening?

865
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,524
- You really like her?
- Sure I like her.

866
01:15:41,987 --> 01:15:45,438
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

867
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:49,025
I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.

868
01:15:49,161 --> 01:15:53,324
- What's "gaps"?
- I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps.

869
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:56,161
Together we fill gaps. I don't know...

870
01:15:57,502 --> 01:15:59,661
You ballin' her?

871
01:15:59,796 --> 01:16:01,207
Hey!

872
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,424
Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.

873
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:08,341
You screwin' my sister?

874
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:13,926
You see? That's why I can't
connect you with Gazzo, Paulie.

875
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:18,273
Because you got a big mouth,
you know? You just talk too much.

876
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,646
- It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home.
- Cold in here?! It is cold in here!

877
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:26,113
It stinks in here! And you stink!

878
01:16:53,936 --> 01:16:56,605
You're breakin' the ribs.

879
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:19,746
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

880
01:17:21,464 --> 01:17:24,134
I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK?

881
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:39,269
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

882
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,358
You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

883
01:17:53,372 --> 01:17:58,165
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here.

884
01:17:58,294 --> 01:18:00,749
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

885
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:07,134
Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?

886
01:18:07,261 --> 01:18:09,219
I'm tired.

887
01:18:09,348 --> 01:18:11,388
Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.

888
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:15,562
There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'.
I wanna stay strong.

889
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:18,773
- You're not kiddin'.
- No, I ain't kiddin'.

890
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:23,437
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

891
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:26,275
Why don't you just make the meat, OK?

892
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:30,400
OK, I'll make the meat.

893
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:56,058
Yo.

894
01:18:56,813 --> 01:18:59,386
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

895
01:18:59,524 --> 01:19:01,564
Hey.

896
01:19:03,612 --> 01:19:05,652
Hey, c'mon.

897
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:08,613
C'mon.

898
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,255
Underneath. Underneath.

899
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:34,226
Underneath! Underneath! Come on!

900
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:36,926
Rock, hold it, hold it.
Hold it, Rock, will ya?

901
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:40,764
You're drivin' me crazy,
you're so sloppy. You're off balance.

902
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,895
Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it
to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack.

903
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,815
- I ain't never had good footwork.
- Never mind. You're off balance.

904
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:55,077
Marciano... He had the same problem
and this string cured it.

905
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:59,620
The idea is that if you can move
and hit without breakin' the string,

906
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:03,621
you got balance. You become
a dangerous person. You follow?

907
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:06,296
- You're lookin' good, Rock.
- Thanks.

908
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,218
That's it. Underneath!

909
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:10,837
Hey, Rock, how about an autograph?

910
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:15,303
Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt
me while I'm conductin' business.

911
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,141
Move your little chicken asses out.

912
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:22,222
Listen, kid. You...
You lay off that pet-shop dame.

913
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,767
Women weaken legs.

914
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:30,401
- Yeah, but I really like this girl...
- Then let her train ya!

915
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,121
- OK, no more foolin' around.
- OK, now hit it.

916
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:41,163
Women weaken legs, huh?

917
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:47,590
- Yo, Rock!
- Yo, Rocky!

918
01:20:53,726 --> 01:20:56,098
Yo!

919
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:58,720
- Yo!
- Yo, you look great.

920
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:02,390
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Terrific.

921
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:04,899
I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker.

922
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:09,027
You'll walk down the street,
breakin' hearts. Very sharp.

923
01:21:09,158 --> 01:21:12,076
- I got another surprise for you.
- What?

924
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,657
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus,
gimme a kiss! Come here!

925
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,461
To keep you company when you run.

926
01:21:25,175 --> 01:21:28,129
Come and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

927
01:21:28,262 --> 01:21:31,049
- He's yours if you want him.
- Boy, do I want him!

928
01:21:31,181 --> 01:21:34,052
- What's he eat, this dog?
- He eats little turtles.

929
01:21:34,184 --> 01:21:36,427
Yo, Butkus!

930
01:21:59,626 --> 01:22:03,411
What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? C'mon.

931
01:22:05,842 --> 01:22:08,511
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

932
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,389
- You need exposure.
- Don't breathe on me, Paulie.

933
01:22:13,516 --> 01:22:16,186
That's the big time...
I know about these things.

934
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:19,810
- What do these guys want from me, huh?
- To watch you train.

935
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:22,810
Hey, what is the matter with you?
This is private.

936
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:26,311
- I'm doin' you a favour.
- No, you're embarrassin' me

937
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:29,483
in front of everybody,
in front of your sister.

938
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:33,484
You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear.
Don't do these things to me.

939
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:37,915
You shoulda called me up or somethin'.
Leave a message. Don't do that!

940
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:40,498
My sister really likes you.

941
01:22:41,338 --> 01:22:45,086
- I'm gonna kill you one of these days!
- Come on, come on.

942
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:47,256
- Pretty...
- Baby.

943
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:51,882
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

944
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:55,265
Rocky Balboa, we wanna get
a brief interview in with you.

945
01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:56,936
- What about me?
- What about you?

946
01:22:57,062 --> 01:22:59,434
- In charge of the meat.
- Stand behind it.

947
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:01,806
Listen, just settle down. Just relax.

948
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:04,647
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions

949
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:07,269
about your unique training method.

950
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:11,154
Talk to the folks at home.
They wanna know how you got into this.

951
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:16,077
This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy,
you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here.

952
01:23:16,206 --> 01:23:20,336
- Just don't take no cheap shots.
- No, I won't do that. Just relax.

953
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:24,839
Today we're here with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason...

954
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,169
Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in.

955
01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:30,212
Let's try it again, Rocky.

956
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:34,175
<i>Today we're with heavyweight</i>
<i>challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

957
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,716
<i>The reason we're in</i>
<i>this refrigerated box</i>

958
01:23:36,853 --> 01:23:39,889
<i>is that Mr Balboa has</i>
<i>an unusual method of training.</i>

959
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:43,688
<i>In a moment, he's going to</i>
<i>demonstrate that for viewers at home.</i>

960
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,732
<i>But first, Rocky, how did you</i>
<i>come to train in an icebox?</i>

961
01:23:47,864 --> 01:23:51,280
<i>Well, my friend, the guy</i>
<i>over there, he let me in one day.</i>

962
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:53,448
<i>I hit the beef and I kinda liked it.</i>

963
01:23:53,578 --> 01:23:57,113
<i>Since I've become a challenger,</i>
<i>the owner don't mind neither.</i>

964
01:23:57,248 --> 01:24:01,329
<i>Is this a common training method?</i>
<i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

965
01:24:01,462 --> 01:24:06,622
<i>- No, I think I invented it.</i>
<i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>

966
01:24:06,759 --> 01:24:10,259
And be sure to fly my barber to Philly.

967
01:24:13,183 --> 01:24:15,852
How much is going to
West Coast advertising?

968
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:18,302
- $300,000.
- Make it 450.

969
01:24:18,438 --> 01:24:20,561
Send the mayor's wife 200 roses

970
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,608
and make sure we get
a picture for the newspapers.

971
01:24:23,735 --> 01:24:26,652
Do you want to run
15 radio spots in the Midwest?

972
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,449
You could spend better
in Canadian publicity.

973
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:34,734
Either way, I've got friends in Toronto
who could get you good tax breaks.

974
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:37,328
George, I like your friends.

975
01:24:44,215 --> 01:24:49,457
Hey, champ, you oughta come and look
at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

976
01:24:49,595 --> 01:24:52,881
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

977
01:24:53,015 --> 01:24:58,389
- Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee?
- Certainly, Mr Creed. I'll get you some.

978
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:20,159
<i>Diana Lewis, in the meat house,</i>
<i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>

979
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:11,339
- He called the reporters?
- It threw my trainin' schedule off.

980
01:26:11,472 --> 01:26:13,927
Don't be mad at him. He's tryin' to help.

981
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:19,052
Adrian, I ain't mad. It's just that when
reporters are around, I get out of joint.

982
01:26:19,188 --> 01:26:22,189
They take cheap shots. Paulie knows that.

983
01:26:22,316 --> 01:26:25,483
Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time,

984
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:28,446
but he don't know nothin' about fightin'.

985
01:26:28,572 --> 01:26:31,692
Are you gonna say anything to him?

986
01:26:31,825 --> 01:26:35,741
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

987
01:26:37,623 --> 01:26:40,244
I don't want nothin' from you.

988
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:43,502
I don't want nothin' from you.

989
01:26:43,629 --> 01:26:47,462
This ain't no charity case.
Get outta my house!

990
01:26:47,592 --> 01:26:50,297
It's not just your house.

991
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:54,426
He's no friend no more.
Get outta my house, I just said.

992
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:58,721
- Don't talk to him like that.
- Both of ya, get outta my house!

993
01:26:58,853 --> 01:27:02,554
Yo, it's cold outside, Paulie.

994
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,533
I don't want ya messin' her.

995
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,117
I don't raise ya to go with this scumball!

996
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,703
Yeah?! C'mon!
You wanna hit on me? C'mon!

997
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:24,128
I'll break both your arms,
so they don't work for ya!

998
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:30,051
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

999
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:34,471
Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way
up, you don't even throw me a crumb!

1000
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:39,261
When I go and get you meat every
mornin'! I even give you my sister, too!

1001
01:27:39,396 --> 01:27:42,812
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

1002
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:45,432
A pig gets you the best?

1003
01:27:45,569 --> 01:27:49,152
I'm a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

1004
01:27:49,489 --> 01:27:51,649
You can't live by yourself!

1005
01:27:51,784 --> 01:27:56,411
I put you two together, and you...
don't you ever forget it! You owe me!

1006
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:01,493
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

1007
01:28:01,627 --> 01:28:04,035
You're supposed to be good to me.

1008
01:28:04,172 --> 01:28:07,706
What do I owe you, Paulie?
What do I owe ya?

1009
01:28:07,842 --> 01:28:12,551
I treat you good. I cook for you, I clean
for you, I pick up your dirty clothes!

1010
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:16,807
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!

1011
01:28:16,933 --> 01:28:22,094
And you made me feel like
a loser! I'm not a loser!

1012
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,603
- You're busted!
- What?!

1013
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:28,567
You're not a virgin!
You let a man take down your pants!

1014
01:28:28,697 --> 01:28:31,651
She's busted!

1015
01:28:33,494 --> 01:28:36,578
I can't haul meat no more.

1016
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,822
You want a roommate?

1017
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:15,536
Absolutely.

1018
01:29:15,829 --> 01:29:20,990
OK, now when you walk into the ring
with the No.1 heavyweight of the world,

1019
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:23,534
you'll be ready, won't ya? Why?

1020
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:27,918
Because I've waited
for 50 years to make ya ready.

1021
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:30,588
You'll be able to spit nails, kid.

1022
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:35,097
Like the guy says, you're gonna eat
lightning and you're gonna crap thunder!

1023
01:29:35,224 --> 01:29:38,178
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

1024
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:41,347
- Yo, Mickey!
- Hey! Oh, Rock.

1025
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,600
I want ya to meet
our cut man here, Al Salvani.

1026
01:29:44,734 --> 01:29:47,605
- Take a look at his eye, kid.
- How you doin', Al?

1027
01:29:47,738 --> 01:29:50,692
- Not bad. I've seen worse.
- You ain't so bad yourself.

1028
01:29:50,824 --> 01:29:53,611
- Cover up. Things'll be OK.
- You cover up.

1029
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:58,570
- Go and take a shower, will ya?
- OK, Mick. I'll see ya's tomorrow.

1030
01:29:58,706 --> 01:30:02,620
- Hey, you covered that Whitmore fight.
- That's why he won.

1031
01:30:02,752 --> 01:30:05,622
Listen, we got a winner here.
We got a chance.

1032
01:30:05,755 --> 01:30:08,839
He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1033
01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:12,051
You just stand by for him.
We're gonna win.

1034
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:21,313
Hey, Rocky. It's OK I talk to ya?

1035
01:30:22,064 --> 01:30:24,520
OK you talk to me? Sure.

1036
01:30:25,568 --> 01:30:28,141
I figured an angle
to make money off your name.

1037
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:31,031
My name? How's that?

1038
01:30:31,157 --> 01:30:34,028
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

1039
01:30:35,745 --> 01:30:38,829
What do you know
about advertising? Huh?

1040
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:46,459
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, OK? I'm gonna take a shower.

1041
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,831
- Hey, wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

1055
01:35:22,834 --> 01:35:25,503
Mr Jergens, the poster's wrong.

1056
01:35:25,628 --> 01:35:30,586
- What do you mean?
- I'm wearin' white pants with a red stripe.

1057
01:35:34,096 --> 01:35:39,517
It doesn't really matter, does it? I'm
sure you're gonna give us a great show.

1058
01:35:40,436 --> 01:35:43,852
Try to get some rest, kid. Good night.

1059
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,568
I can't do it.

1060
01:37:20,956 --> 01:37:23,079
What?

1061
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:25,248
I can't beat him.

1062
01:37:26,294 --> 01:37:28,334
Apollo?

1063
01:37:28,463 --> 01:37:30,836
Yeah.

1064
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:34,051
I been out there, walking around, thinkin'.

1065
01:37:35,805 --> 01:37:39,933
I mean, who am I kiddin'?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

1066
01:37:44,397 --> 01:37:46,436
What are we gonna do?

1067
01:37:57,745 --> 01:37:59,784
I don't know.

1068
01:38:05,586 --> 01:38:08,040
You worked so hard.

1069
01:38:09,214 --> 01:38:12,714
Yeah, it don't matter,
cos I was nobody before.

1070
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:17,045
Don't say that.

1071
01:38:17,181 --> 01:38:20,680
Come on, Adrian. It's true. I was nobody.

1072
01:38:22,936 --> 01:38:25,606
But that don't matter either, you know?

1073
01:38:26,648 --> 01:38:28,890
Cos I was thinkin'...

1074
01:38:29,777 --> 01:38:32,861
It really don't matter if I lose this fight.

1075
01:38:34,573 --> 01:38:38,701
It really don't matter if this guy
opens my head either.

1076
01:38:39,787 --> 01:38:42,871
Cos all I wanna do is go the distance.

1077
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,920
Nobody's ever gone the
distance with Creed.

1078
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,505
And if I can go that distance

1079
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,094
and that bell rings and I'm still standin',

1080
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:06,762
I'm gonna know for
the first time in my life, see,

1081
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:12,529
that I weren't just another bum
from the neighbourhood.

1082
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:21,132
Time, kid. Let's go.

1083
01:40:23,853 --> 01:40:26,309
I'll wait for you here.

1084
01:40:28,107 --> 01:40:31,643
Well, how about I wait here
and you fight, you know?

1085
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:35,278
You're lookin' very great today.
You know that? Mm?

1086
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:39,993
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

1087
01:40:41,372 --> 01:40:44,409
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1088
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:46,500
Good luck.

1089
01:40:46,628 --> 01:40:50,127
Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, you know?

1090
01:40:50,256 --> 01:40:53,293
- Good luck.
- Don't leave town.

1091
01:40:55,512 --> 01:40:59,130
I'd like you to meet the man
working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.

1092
01:40:59,265 --> 01:41:03,477
Thank you, Bill Baldwin. The electricity
is all over the place tonight...

1093
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:09,311
What the hell is that? I trained you
to be a fighter, not a billboard.

1094
01:41:09,442 --> 01:41:12,313
- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1095
01:41:12,445 --> 01:41:16,146
- Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.
- Shrewd.

1096
01:41:16,282 --> 01:41:19,118
On tonight's fight, their difference in style,

1097
01:41:19,244 --> 01:41:23,159
a recent magazine said it could be
the caveman against the cavalier.

1098
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:27,917
The buzzing in the background could be
the challenger getting into the ring.

1099
01:41:28,045 --> 01:41:34,084
- Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200.
- Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work.

1100
01:41:34,218 --> 01:41:36,507
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

1101
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:39,638
A 50-1 underdog, a Cinderella story,

1102
01:41:39,765 --> 01:41:43,810
and he's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.

1103
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,229
We love you, Rocky!

1104
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:53,064
- Yo, champ!
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.

1105
01:41:53,195 --> 01:41:57,738
His record: 44 victories -
38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights.

1106
01:41:57,867 --> 01:42:00,406
Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it?

1107
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:05,033
The stamina and the skill to last
the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no.

1108
01:42:05,167 --> 01:42:08,618
Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.

1109
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:13,796
The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign
on the back of his robe there. See that?

1110
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:16,168
"Shamrock Meat Company."

1111
01:42:16,304 --> 01:42:20,551
There's a lot of noise.
You could go deaf with that noise!

1112
01:42:20,683 --> 01:42:22,972
Am I seeing right back there?

1113
01:42:23,102 --> 01:42:26,269
Is that the world heavyweight
champion, Apollo Creed?

1114
01:42:26,397 --> 01:42:30,525
He's riding in a boat. Is he
supposed to be George Washington?

1115
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:33,403
Obviously so.
He's got the hat on. Look at that.

1116
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:37,444
Well, it's been confirmed.
The world champion Apollo Creed

1117
01:42:37,575 --> 01:42:40,862
is doing an imitation
of George Washington.

1118
01:42:41,997 --> 01:42:43,741
He's throwing money.

1119
01:42:43,874 --> 01:42:48,086
Remember when we talked about
George Washington throwing a dollar?

1120
01:42:48,212 --> 01:42:53,004
Of course, throwing a dollar
in those days went a lot farther.

1121
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:56,218
The white wig came off,
the hat came off...

1122
01:42:57,179 --> 01:42:59,752
I want all of you!

1123
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:05,229
And the crowd is loving every minute of it.
Here is the world heavyweight champion.

1124
01:43:05,354 --> 01:43:09,850
For you around the world,
he was dressed as George Washington.

1125
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,068
I want all of you! Come on, Stallion!

1126
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,326
- Uncle Sam himself...
- I want all of you!

1127
01:43:19,452 --> 01:43:24,577
- All of you! I want all of you!
- He looks like a big flag.

1128
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,199
I want you! You!

1129
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:29,995
- Is he talkin' to me?
- He is.

1130
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:32,336
- Is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk.

1131
01:43:32,465 --> 01:43:34,956
I want the Stallion! Come on!

1132
01:43:35,093 --> 01:43:37,963
He says "I want the Stallion!"

1133
01:43:38,847 --> 01:43:43,010
In foreign countries during World War I
there was a picture of Uncle Sam

1134
01:43:43,143 --> 01:43:45,052
with his finger pointed -

1135
01:43:45,186 --> 01:43:49,647
a recruiting poster for our fellows
in the army and the navy. "I want you!"

1136
01:43:49,774 --> 01:43:51,814
That's what he's doing a take on.

1137
01:43:51,943 --> 01:43:54,861
- That's it. "Creed" he's yelling.
- "Creed in three."

1138
01:43:54,988 --> 01:43:57,362
What do you think that outfit cost?

1139
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:10,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

1140
01:44:10,756 --> 01:44:14,540
good evening. A very happy new year.

1141
01:44:14,676 --> 01:44:16,716
Welcome to Philadelphia.

1142
01:44:16,845 --> 01:44:19,929
Everybody who's anybody is here tonight.

1143
01:44:21,641 --> 01:44:27,846
Time does not permit me to introduce
the many luminaries of politics,

1144
01:44:28,523 --> 01:44:32,853
show business and the sporting world
who are with us tonight.

1145
01:44:33,487 --> 01:44:38,565
But I would like to present
one of the immortals of pugilism,

1146
01:44:38,701 --> 01:44:42,235
a champion in and out of the ring.

1147
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:45,040
Philadelphia's own Smokin' Joe,

1148
01:44:45,165 --> 01:44:48,286
the beloved Mr Joe Frazier!

1149
01:44:58,513 --> 01:45:02,213
Hi, how are you doing?
Don't hurt him, OK?

1150
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:05,600
What a credit he's been
in his career as a fighter.

1151
01:45:05,728 --> 01:45:07,935
He's coming over to talk with the champ.

1152
01:45:08,064 --> 01:45:11,100
- Hey, Joe!
- You been dumpin' me long time.

1153
01:45:11,234 --> 01:45:14,105
You next, Joe! You next, Joe!

1154
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,646
They must be friends.

1155
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:27,117
Joe Frazier!

1156
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:31,913
Fight fans around the world, get settled
down, because it won't be long now.

1157
01:45:33,549 --> 01:45:37,416
And now for the main event!

1158
01:45:41,015 --> 01:45:43,720
On my left, the challenger.

1159
01:45:44,769 --> 01:45:49,147
In white trunks, weighing 190lb,

1160
01:45:49,274 --> 01:45:52,145
Philadelphia's favourite son,

1161
01:45:52,278 --> 01:45:56,987
the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa!

1162
01:46:03,748 --> 01:46:08,456
And on my right,
wearing red, white and blue,

1163
01:46:08,586 --> 01:46:11,752
weighing 210lb,

1164
01:46:12,089 --> 01:46:15,292
undefeated in 46 fights,

1165
01:46:15,718 --> 01:46:18,338
the Master of Disaster,

1166
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:22,052
the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world,

1167
01:46:22,348 --> 01:46:24,388
Apollo Creed!

1168
01:46:26,352 --> 01:46:28,844
I want you! I want you!

1169
01:46:31,568 --> 01:46:33,857
You, chump! I want you!

1170
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:36,359
You've both fought in Philadelphia before.

1171
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:40,404
You know the rules. No low blows.
Watch your heads. No buttin'.

1172
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:45,696
- Shake hands now and come out fightin'.
- Put your hands up, chump. Come on!

1173
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:50,293
A little body play goin' on there.
Rocky taking it carefully, though.

1174
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:54,204
He's just going over and being calm,
it looks like from here.

1175
01:46:54,341 --> 01:46:56,879
There goes the big hat.

1176
01:46:59,304 --> 01:47:03,551
I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair!

1177
01:47:11,567 --> 01:47:14,734
And there's the bell for round one.

1178
01:47:14,862 --> 01:47:19,240
The fighters come out into the centre
of the ring, looking at each other.

1179
01:47:19,367 --> 01:47:24,326
Creed the champion zipping those
left-handed jabs, right in the head.

1180
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:29,827
The champ stinging
the slower challenger jabs at will.

1181
01:47:29,962 --> 01:47:33,960
In fact, it looks like Rocky is
blocking the blows with his face.

1182
01:47:34,091 --> 01:47:38,504
The champion doesn't look the best
he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly.

1183
01:47:38,637 --> 01:47:42,587
Well, the champion is smiling now.
He's toying with his man.

1184
01:47:42,725 --> 01:47:47,433
Tryin' to give the fans their money's
worth. He's makin' a show of it.

1185
01:47:47,563 --> 01:47:51,063
And a very badly outclassed
challenger right now.

1186
01:47:53,319 --> 01:47:55,478
Creed trying to make this man make...

1187
01:47:55,612 --> 01:47:58,530
See? Make him miss like that.

1188
01:47:58,657 --> 01:48:01,409
Oh, the champ is just taunting him now.

1189
01:48:04,455 --> 01:48:06,910
Creed dancing around.

1190
01:48:07,875 --> 01:48:10,366
I don't believe it! The champ is down!

1191
01:48:10,502 --> 01:48:12,542
Yes, he is!

1192
01:48:17,844 --> 01:48:21,011
Creed is down! What a surprise this is!

1193
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:26,643
This is the first time the champion
has ever been knocked down.

1194
01:48:28,022 --> 01:48:30,513
Six! Seven! Eight!

1195
01:48:30,649 --> 01:48:33,769
He appears to be all right.
Glancin' around...

1196
01:48:34,195 --> 01:48:38,607
Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs!
Let's go to work right now, Rock!

1197
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:44,488
Rocky comes back out. He's like
a bull in a china closet. He really wants it.

1198
01:48:44,622 --> 01:48:47,243
Apollo, left to the head.

1199
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:51,835
Now the champion's comin' back.
He's comin' off the floor now.

1200
01:48:52,713 --> 01:48:58,467
Another left, another right.
Combinations into the face. That's Apollo!

1201
01:49:01,555 --> 01:49:04,972
Now the champ is taunting Rocky
to come and get some more.

1202
01:49:05,102 --> 01:49:07,095
Left. Another.

1203
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:09,353
Another left!

1204
01:49:10,358 --> 01:49:12,813
And Rocky's coming back now!

1205
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:16,482
Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope!

1206
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:19,523
OK, let's break it.

1207
01:49:23,996 --> 01:49:27,697
There's no way they expected
this kind of hitting power.

1208
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:32,211
But the ability of
the champion, Apollo, is apparent.

1209
01:49:34,339 --> 01:49:38,835
Apollo unloading,
Rocky really tight against the ropes.

1210
01:49:45,768 --> 01:49:50,395
They're leading him back over to his
corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.

1211
01:49:50,523 --> 01:49:53,607
- I told ya! I told ya!
- Your nose is broke.

1212
01:49:53,735 --> 01:49:56,023
- How does it look?
- It's an improvement.

1213
01:49:56,154 --> 01:49:59,440
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
Stick and move.

1214
01:49:59,575 --> 01:50:01,152
Go for the ribs.

1215
01:50:01,285 --> 01:50:04,950
- Don't let that bastard breathe.
- The guy's great.

1216
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:08,698
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1217
01:50:08,834 --> 01:50:11,705
- Finish this bum and let's go home.
- Right.

1218
01:50:12,296 --> 01:50:14,538
Stay to the body! To his right!

1219
01:50:14,673 --> 01:50:18,172
Here we go. Round two.
Creed predicted he would win in three.

1220
01:50:18,302 --> 01:50:21,920
Creed got knocked down in the first.
He came back at the end.

1221
01:50:22,056 --> 01:50:24,133
Oh, he's working now.

1222
01:50:24,267 --> 01:50:26,758
Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right.

1223
01:50:26,895 --> 01:50:29,433
He's working Rocky into the corner again.

1224
01:50:29,564 --> 01:50:31,604
He's got Rocky back in the corner.

1225
01:50:31,733 --> 01:50:36,276
Pelting him left and right.
He's bouncing up against the ring.

1226
01:50:36,863 --> 01:50:39,817
Oh, Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.

1227
01:50:39,949 --> 01:50:44,658
- Battering him like a punching bag.
- What's keeping him up?

1228
01:50:51,837 --> 01:50:54,375
- He says he wants more!
- He wants more!

1229
01:50:54,507 --> 01:50:59,050
You folks in front of your television
are watching a battle, I tell you that!

1230
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:06,723
Balboa trying to fight back...
Ooh, a tremendous hook!

1231
01:51:06,853 --> 01:51:10,269
The champion is trying
to get himself out, but he can't.

1232
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:13,897
He is being barraged
with lefts and rights to his body!

1233
01:51:14,026 --> 01:51:17,644
Balboa is smacking the champion
right on the kisser!

1234
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,105
The referee's stepped in.

1235
01:51:20,241 --> 01:51:22,566
They're ready to keep going!

1236
01:51:22,702 --> 01:51:24,908
Back to your corner!

1237
01:51:25,037 --> 01:51:27,409
Come on, Creed!

1238
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:29,948
This is gonna be a tough one.

1239
01:52:36,571 --> 01:52:38,611
Hard left and right combination!

1240
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:41,824
What is keeping him up, Bill?
I don't know!

1241
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,620
He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself!

1242
01:52:54,296 --> 01:52:56,419
Down! Down! Stay down!

1243
01:52:56,548 --> 01:52:59,835
Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air!

1244
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:12,060
Five!

1245
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:14,646
Six! Seven!

1246
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,518
Eight! Nine!

1247
01:53:22,785 --> 01:53:25,240
OK, OK. Come on!

1248
01:53:27,373 --> 01:53:30,078
Apollo can't believe it!

1249
01:53:45,684 --> 01:53:49,634
The champion got a left
to the ribs, his right ribs.

1250
01:53:57,654 --> 01:54:00,525
- You OK, champ?
- Yeah, I'm OK, I'm OK.

1251
01:54:02,951 --> 01:54:06,367
I can't see nothin'.
I gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick.

1252
01:54:06,496 --> 01:54:09,996
- You don't wanna do it.
- Go on, cut me. Cut me.

1253
01:54:17,426 --> 01:54:23,298
- You're bleeding inside. I'm gonna stop it.
- You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.

1254
01:54:23,766 --> 01:54:26,221
You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.

1255
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,400
The 15th and final round.

1256
01:54:51,459 --> 01:54:54,544
They look like they've
been in a war, these two.

1257
01:55:03,055 --> 01:55:05,427
The champion really tightening!

1258
01:55:05,557 --> 01:55:09,473
And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

1259
01:55:14,609 --> 01:55:17,645
Hard left and right!
Look at the blood coming out!

1260
01:55:17,779 --> 01:55:21,148
Oh, he's spitting out blood now.

1261
01:55:23,284 --> 01:55:26,072
A tremendous right hand from Rocky!

1262
01:55:26,204 --> 01:55:28,078
Go for it, Rock!

1263
01:55:28,206 --> 01:55:31,077
- Listen to this crowd!
- Left to the ribs.

1264
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:37,336
Right to the chin!
He's got him up against the rope!

1265
01:55:41,929 --> 01:55:45,263
There ain't gonna be no rematch!

1266
01:55:45,391 --> 01:55:46,933
Don't want one.

1267
01:55:57,194 --> 01:55:59,686
Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.

1268
01:55:59,823 --> 01:56:02,990
- How do you feel?
- All right. It's all right.

1269
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,115
- Adrian! Adrian!
- What did you think in the 15th round...

1270
01:56:07,246 --> 01:56:11,079
- Rocky! Rocky!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1271
01:56:11,209 --> 01:56:14,413
- your attention, please!
- Rocky! Rocky!

1272
01:56:14,546 --> 01:56:19,208
Tonight we have had
the privilege of witnessing

1273
01:56:19,342 --> 01:56:25,132
the greatest exhibition of guts
and stamina in the history of the ring!

1274
01:56:25,265 --> 01:56:27,721
Adrian!

1275
01:56:28,101 --> 01:56:29,928
Rocky!

1276
01:56:30,062 --> 01:56:35,420
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a split decision!

1277
01:56:36,026 --> 01:56:39,442
- The judges voted...
- Adrian!

1278
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:42,649
- Rocky!
...8- 7 for Creed!

1279
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:46,951
Your fans want a rematch.

1280
01:56:47,079 --> 01:56:49,120
- There ain't gonna be one!
- Why not?

1281
01:56:49,249 --> 01:56:53,329
- Come on! I had enough. Adrian!
- You heard him.

1282
01:56:53,462 --> 01:56:56,961
- Let go! That's my friend. Rocko!
- He's everybody's friend.

1283
01:56:57,091 --> 01:56:59,498
- You're breakin' my jacket!
- Let's go.

1284
01:56:59,635 --> 01:57:02,838
- Paulie!
- Adrian! Adrian!

1285
01:57:02,971 --> 01:57:04,382
- Rocky!
- Adrian!

1286
01:57:04,515 --> 01:57:07,266
- Hey, where's your hat?
- I love you!

1287
01:57:07,893 --> 01:57:10,218
I love you.

1288
01:57:10,354 --> 01:57:13,687
I love you! I love you!

1289
01:57:14,858 --> 01:57:16,898
I love you!

1290
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:26,328
