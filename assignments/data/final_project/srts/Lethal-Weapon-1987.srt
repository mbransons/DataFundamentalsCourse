No, you can go ahead and eat without me.

I was just on my way out.

45
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,806
- I'm Feather.
- Feather?

46
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,242
If Riana had a friend named
Feather, I would've remembered.

50
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,016
ROGER JR.:
Feather, you forgot your belt.

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,820
D-Dad... y-you're up.

52
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,889
Yeah, I'm up. I was just getting to know

53
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,558
- your friend, Feather.
- Sorry. I'm such

54
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,393
a space case.

55
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,828
W-We were just...

56
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,766
upstairs. Yeah, making decorative belts.

57
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,365
- Studying.
- Otherwise, how would someone

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,067
just lose their belt, like, poof,
"My belt is gone"?

59
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,503
You're hilarious, Mr. Murtaugh.

60
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,876
It's Detective Murtaugh.

61
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,673
Not that hilarious.

62
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,576
Can I just say, we're all adults here.

63
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,877
Oh, are we?

64
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,346
You raised a great young man.

65
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,015
You should be proud.

66
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,716
Bye, babe.

67
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:37,083
- (door opens, closes)
- Dad, uh, let me explain.

68
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:39,252
- We-we had...
- I know what you had.

69
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,654
You had the audacity
to bring a girl in my house

70
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,623
while your mother and I
are up there sleeping?

71
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:44,924
And you think we wouldn't find out?

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,726
- It's not a big deal.
- It's not a big deal?

73
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:47,994
Well, guess what?

74
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:48,961
I'm grounded forever.

75
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,107
Maybe longer.

76
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:52,699
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Get upstairs.

77
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,907

81
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,728
Mm, morning.

82
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,597
Yep.

83
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:27,033
That's what it is. (groans)

84
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,168
You got somewhere to be?

85
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,404
Uh, yeah. I got this thing

86
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,207
that I, uh,
just completely forgot about.

87
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:35,575
Um...

88
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,641
yeah, look, there's some OJ in the fri--

89
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,348
no, do not drink the OJ
that is in that refrigerator.

90
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:44,283
Um...

91
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,091
(Murtaugh laughs)

92
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:54,852
My boy got some action last night.

93
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,331
What? Who did?

94
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,499
RJ.

95
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,140
Not only is he Princeton-bound,

96
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,569
but it turns out, he's inherited

97
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:05,605
his dad's charms with the ladies.

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,340
That's good news. (chuckles)

99
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,841
Yeah, that's what-- hey.

100
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,543
What in the...?

101
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,246
Is that a bathing suit you got on?

102
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:14,914
Uh, all my pants were stained up

103
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,616
and I didn't want to
look unprofessional.

104
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,117
Okay, you know what's unprofessional?

105
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,412
Is you blinding me
with those pasty legs.

106
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,722
Exactly. They need a little vitamin D.

107
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:23,704
Riggs.

108
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,492
You gonna tell me that this right here

109
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,194
is not even a little weird,

110
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:29,462
even for you?

111
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:31,664
Uh, this line of questioning
is a little weird.

112
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,999
And uncomfortable.

113
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:36,836
(sighing): Okay, it's
gonna be that kind of day.

114
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,006
(indistinct radio transmission)

115
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,474
Okay, so who is he?

116
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,442
Dale Reynolds, 35.

117
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:46,250
Had quite a party followed
by an accidental overdose.

118
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,217
Or not so accidental.

119
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:49,678
The bluish skin,

120
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,384
bleeding foam around his mouth,

121
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,785
all point to an OD, but...

122
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,220
check out the knot in the tourniquet.

123
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,822
BAILEY: It's on the outside of his arm.

124
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:57,815
Which means he had help.

125
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,393
What you got there, legs?

126
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:02,161
A wedding ring stuffed in his pocket.

127
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:09,235
Dale Reynolds, you cheating bastard.

128
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:11,304
MURTAUGH: Okay, well,

129
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,240
someone had to be the last
person to see him alive.

130
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:19,045
So, let's find that girlfriend,
boyfriend, intern, escort...

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,147
(woman laughing)

132
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:22,682
(echoing): Nice place you got here.

133
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,998
MURTAUGH: And make sure
that you call his, um...

134
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,166
- BAILEY: His wife?
- MURTAUGH: Yeah.

135
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,701
BAILEY: Yeah, tell her
we found her husband dead

136
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,604
in a hotel room, smelling like
another woman's cheap perfume.

137
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,947
I'm on it.

138
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,541
Is that what that smell is? (sniffs)

139
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,477
Doesn't seem to be
coming off the corpse.

140
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,646
I think...

141
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,615
it's coming from...

142
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,872
Riggs?

143
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,573

Sinner.

146
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:27,813
Me?

147
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,092
No, him.

AVERY: <i>Bailey, what do you got?</i>

150
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,463
There's security footage
of a van arriving

151
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,576
and leaving the hotel garage
that times out with our killer.

152
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, do you have a plate?

153
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,462
A partial and we're looking into it.

154
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,070
Good enough news.

155
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:58,434
Mr. City Attorney, in the house.

156
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,868
What a rare, unexpected treat.

157
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:01,203
Did I-- did I know you were...?

158
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:02,438
I just thought I'd pop in.

159
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:04,239
Awesome. You heard
we caught a grizzly one.

160
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,474
You're hear to scrub in?

161
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,576
We need to talk.

162
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:09,358
I have concerns.

163
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,313
Never a great opening.

164
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:14,550
Martin Riggs...

165
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,669
- how's he doing?
- Riggs? He's...

166
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
he's doing well.

167
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:20,689
Adjusting to the culture.

168
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,891
He-he should be here any minute,

169
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,526
you could ask him yourself.

170
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,028
I intend to.

171
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:28,330
But I want to hear from you first.

172
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,199
Make sure there aren't any issues

173
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,201
I should have heard about already.

174
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,003
None-- none that I can think of...

175
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,668
off the top of my head.

176
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,137
(elevator bell dings)

177
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,943
If you're sick, you should go home.

178
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,344
- I'm not sick.
- You threw up.

179
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,213
Barely. It was more about your cleanse.

180
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,340
MURTAUGH: Look, all I'm saying

181
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,683
is that you're not yourself,

182
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,119
and when you are yourself,
you're barely function...

183
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,329
AVERY: Roger.

184
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,264
You know Ronnie Delgado?
He had some concerns

185
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,932
about your partner, Riggs.
I was hoping you could, uh...

186
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,034
Why? 'Cause he wore shorts today?

187
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,970
- Shorts?
- Roger,

188
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:11,273
maybe you could
tell the city attorney how well

189
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:13,307
- your partner is doing.
- Is he drinking?

190
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,843
Behaving erratically?

191
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,445

192
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,813
Riggs? Drinking?

193
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:18,814
Um,

194
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,048
um... (clears throat)

195
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,784
I don't know what he does

196
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,285
after hours, but

197
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,721
you're asking:
is he drinking during the day?

198
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,192
Is-is what you're asking.

199
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,057
- Where is he?
- Hmm.

200
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,993
He's probably doing paperwork.

201
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,928
He loves paperwork.

202
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:33,862

203

I'm gonna see if I can find him.

204
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,199
- Yes.
- Good idea.

205
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,467

Riggs?

209
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,102
Are we okay?

210
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:07,629
Oh, hey, Doc.

211
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:09,097
Yeah, just another day in paradise.

212
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,033
What are you doing
under a vending machine?

213
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:14,036
Well, I needed a break
and this is a break room.

214
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,838
And now, I'm trying to get...

215

So, is this it?

221
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,750
Have we finally arrived at rock-bottom?

222
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,752
No, there's still some places to go.

Oh, Duke. How'd we do?

224

Uh, I got most of what you wanted.

225
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,125
Except for your wallet,
I couldn't find it.

226
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,228
No worries. Thanks, buddy.

227
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,362
Oh,

228
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,630
okay, so you're eating floor chips

229
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,599
and you sent a uni to
retrieve your pants?

230
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:44,967
Ah.

231
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,936
A wool cap.

232
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:50,505
It is getting chilly outside. Duke!

233
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,675

pretty clear cry for help.

you're not wrong.

Yes. Yes, I would.

239
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,754
Well, apparently,
I've misplaced my wallet.

240
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,657
And I'm starving,
so if I could borrow a buck,

241
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,858
that would be great.

242
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:15,163
I'm sorry, Riggs, all I have is a ten.

243
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,298
No problem, that'll work perfectly.

244

I don't know. It's Riggs.

One minute, I think he's doing better.

249

off a skyscraper into a pool.

So, worse. You're-you're saying worse.

I'm too busy trying to stay alive

256
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:38,787
All right, fair enough. But now,
Delgado's got his eyes on him.

257
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:41,857
Remember, I put you two together

had it out for your husband,

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,466
or had a grudge against him,

Oh, you had options.

333
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,763
How about trusting your partner, huh?

334
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,365
How-How about waiting for backup?

335
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,600
Shooting the guy in the leg?

336
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,402
But no, you had to take the one
where we plummeted

337
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:57,566
off a building,

338
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,273
through a tarp, into a box of nails?

339
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,242
I made sure that was
a controlled plummet.

340
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:04,032
- Oh, you made sure?
- Yeah, I made sure.

341
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,478
Because you got x-ray vision.

342
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,313
And you saw what was on
the other side of that tarp.

343
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,815
You had no idea

344
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,216
where we were landing.

345
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,307
So, uh, I'm just gonna go...

346
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,120
recalibrate the forceps.

347
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,258
I think she just made that up.

348
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,126
You know what, Riggs?
There's gonna come a time

349
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,462
when there's nothing
on the other side of that tarp.

350
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,564
And I'm not letting you
bring me down with you.

351
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,342
Now get dressed.

352
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,464
We have a suspect to interrogate.

353
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,573
GARVEY: <i>Dale Reynolds was a snake.</i>

354
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,976
He cheated on his wife
with my kid sister, Cynthia.

355
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:40,103
And that's why you killed him?

356
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:42,315
I didn't kill him.

357
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,851
Are you getting mixed signals
with this guy?

358
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,653
- I'm confused,
- I don't...

359
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,087
The son of a bitch

360
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:49,709
killed Cynthia.

361
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,292
He introduced her to heroin.

362
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,993
So your sister OD'd?

363
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,696
- And that's why you killed him.
- The same way he killed Cynthia.

364
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,031
I already told you,

365
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,265
I didn't kill him.

366
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,768
Even though I hated him,
and I wished he was dead.

Yeah, I saw him here
most of the evening.

394
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:09,197
I heard his confession
then he sat in on Mass.

I know Ben struggled

but I also know in my heart he
couldn't do something like that.

Unfortunately,
what we know in our hearts

422

doesn't necessarily qualify
as hard evidence, Father.

Well, evening Mass is live-streamed.

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,584
- you can get lost, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,219
You can go off-road

498
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:40,254
- and never make it back.
- TRISH: Yeah.

499
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,156
People do.

500
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,025
Howdy.

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,333
Was this planned?

502
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,096
What? Ooh.

503
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,898
- Dinner.
- It's not a good time, Riggs.

504
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,447
We're having a family, uh...

505
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,519
- Crisis.
- Yeah.

506
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,770
- Oh, I'm great in a crisis.
- Yes, Riggs, please,

507
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,572
I can't talk to these people anymore.

508
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,073
Oh, come on, they're all right.

509
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,409
I mean, your dad can be a little chatty.

510
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,563
I did not come empty-handed.

511
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,834
Martin, you didn't have to.

512
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:09,784
Oh, forget it. So, uh...
what's the problem?

513
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:13,187
Besides all that,
RJ wants to blow off college.

514
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:15,390
I want to see the world
with my girlfriend,

515
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,786
and we're gonna start in New Zealand.

516
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,760
Ooh, New Zealand. Wellington,

517
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:21,929
the capital...
(clicks tongue) beautiful.

518
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,631
- Go for it.
- Thank you.

519
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:28,403
Crisis averted. All right, let's eat.

520
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:30,371
I'm gonna grab a plate.

521
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,875
RIGGS: Anybody need anything?!

522
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,343
(video game gunfire)

523
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,950
Feather, huh?

524
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,242
Somebody named her that?

525
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,429
Yeah.

526
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,720
That's a name, all right.

527
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:48,798
He's out there filling RJ's head

528
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,460
with more foolishness,
if that's even possible.

529
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,078
I'm gonna go put an end to this.

530
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,525
Roger, don't.

531
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,065
Don't interfere.

532
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,900
If we push, RJ will push back.

533
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,469
So what do we do,
just sit back while his life

534
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,877
- goes down the drain?
- No, it's a phase. RJ will turn around.

535
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,172
I mean, when he finds out

536
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:08,871
how much a ticket to New Zealand costs.

537
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:09,985
Hmm.

538
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:11,705
You love her?

539
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,294
I do.

540
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,753
Never let her go. You hear me?

541
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:20,888
Yeah. We got plans to go...

542
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,276
What did I just say?

543
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:25,820
Y-You said never let her go.

544
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,629
Bingo.

545
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:32,205
(Riggs sighs)

546
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,693
Feather?

547
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:35,710
She spell that with a "Ph"?

548
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,340
What's going on with Riggs?

549
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,575
The drinking?

550
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,886
TRISH: That much drinking.
He's drowning in it.

551
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,114
I've never seen it this bad before.

552
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,090
He should sleep on the couch.

553
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:50,624
Or in the garage.

554
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:53,421
The couch.

555
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:54,856
Or the driveway.

556
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,394
(snoring lightly)

557
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,032
Hey, you good?

558
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,534
Mm-hmm.

559
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,630
I've got some pillows
and sheets and stuff for you.

560
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,573
Oh, no need. I am a simple man, buddy.

561
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,783
No, the sheet is for the couch, not you.

562
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,278
Oh... (clears throat)

563
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:19,580
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.
- No, no, no, no,
- no, no, no, no.

564
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:22,176
- You get your boots.
- All right.

565
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,452
- I got this.
- Oh. (clears throat)

566
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,162
(grunts, groans)

567
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:33,709
You all right? Mm-hmm.

568
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:37,450
Look at this little...

569
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,081
this little pouch you've made.

570
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,273
Okay.

571
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:49,677
Hey, if you wake up in a couple hours,

572
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:51,952
and you think about driving home,

573
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:54,581
do me a favor, don't.

574
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,409
Okay?

575
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:05,537
I cheated on my wife.

576
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:11,177
What?

577
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,002
Last night.

578
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,739
I drank too much,

579
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,975
and, um...

580
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:24,011
I didn't intentionally do it,
but I cheated on her.

581
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,796
Want talk about it?

582
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:33,888
We just did.

583
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:35,590
You want to hit those lights for me?

584
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,578
(clears throat)

585
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,978
WOMAN:<i> For someone who was</i>
<i>buried alive, she's doing okay.</i>

586
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:07,215
Vitals are stable, but she could be out

587
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,406
for another couple of days.

588
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,041
I'll call you if anything changes.

589
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,277
Thank you.

590
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:16,748
Same van, same message
left at the scene-- "sinner."

591
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,491
So it wasn't Garvey.

592
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,895
We got one less suspect
and one more victim.

593
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,653
What do we know about her?

594
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:25,789
Valerie Rausch, 48.
Never married, pays taxes,

595
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:27,791
and works as a social
coordinator at a senior home.

596
00:26:27,826 --> 00:26:29,527
That's a job?

597
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:32,844
Okay, Dale Reynolds
let his girlfriend die

598
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,212
of a heroin overdose.

599
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:37,649
And then someone shot him
full of heroin.

600
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,470
The question is...

601
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,184
Why does a never-married
social coordinator

602
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,154
get buried alive?

603
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:43,679
Mm-hmm.

604
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,451
WOMAN:<i> It's like something</i>
<i>out of a nightmare.</i>

605
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,054
Poor Valerie. Who would do
something like that?

606
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,022
We were hoping you could point
us in the right direction.

607
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,102
I wish.

608
00:26:58,026 --> 00:26:59,559
- Mr. Raines.
- Hmm?

609
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,828
We talked about this.

610
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:03,997
Shut it down.

611
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:07,301
(computer beeps)

612
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,137
Valerie's adored by the residents.

613
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,571
Me, not so much.

614
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,752
Does she have an office or a desk

615
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:14,776
or something we can look at?

616
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,101
A locker. I'll open it for you.

617
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:20,914
Are you a Mexican?

618
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,583
My last husband was a Mexican.

619
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:26,386
- Beautiful man.
- He sounds great, but...

620
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:29,456
Don't believe what anyone says.

621
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:31,992
You know Valerie.

622
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,714
She's an angel of death.

623
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:35,479
O-Okay...

624
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:38,198
And she killed Ethel Puckelwitz

625
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,933
for her life insurance.

626
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:44,504
Smothered her with a pillow
till she couldn't breathe.

627
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,206
Mm-mm.

628
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,006
You all right?

629
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,619
- V-Valerie was suffocated, right?
- Yeah.

630
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:55,225
I think I know
who we might be looking for.

631
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,417
Good, because I think
I know where to look.

632
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:58,851
I found this in Valerie's locker.

633
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:00,242
Church bulletin.

634
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,951
Guess which church.

635
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:05,325
PATTERSON: Valerie Rausch?

636
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,394
Yeah, I know her.

637
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:09,029
Well, she was buried alive last night.

638
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,457
Do you have any idea why?

639
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:11,935
We're thinking it might
have something to do

640
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:15,001
with her nasty habit
of smothering senior citizens

641
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:16,980
to get their life insurance.

642
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,653
He doesn't look surprised.

643
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:21,374
- He doesn't look surprised.
- If I told you something like that,

644
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,776
I'd be surprise... Would you not be...

645
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:24,211
- Would you please?
- I would go, huh? What?

646
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,213
Whoa, that's a surprised look.
That's what I was going for.

647
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:28,582
Let me guess, Father,

648
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,689
Valerie walked into
your little magic box

649
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:32,380
and told you all about
her unconventional use

650
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:34,271
of orthopedic pillows, and...

651
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,828
If such a thing happened,

652
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,937
I would have urged her
to turn herself in.

653
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:40,731
But she didn't, and someone
punished her for it.

654
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:41,989
Just like with Dale Reynolds.

655
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:44,631
What do you want from me?

656
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,166
A confession would be nice.

657
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,535
You know I was in the sanctuary.

658
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,869
Then tell us who it could be.

659
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:51,407
Who else knows what Valerie Rausch

660
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,093
and Ben Garvey confessed to you?

661
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,296
No one. It was between
the confessor and God.

662
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:56,515
(groans)

663
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,813
- It is so difficult to subpoena God.
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:02,415
All right, let's go turn
the confessional upside down.

665
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,618
Ooh, that's the surprised
look I was hoping for.

666
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:05,886
See that?

667
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,094
What are we looking for, anyway?

668
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,372
Hell if I know.

669
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:18,231
Kinda underwhelming, isn't it?

670
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:24,898
Hey, uh, I took your keys last
night when you weren't looking.

671
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,853
I took a bottle of Blue Label
this morning from the den.

672
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:36,116
Yeah, well, I knew
you were gonna do that,

673
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,351
so I switched it with a crappier bottle.

674
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,656
The girl from the other night...

675
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:46,105
...I don't even know her name.

676
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:48,161
I don't really remember anything.

677
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:50,060
I was... I was black-out drunk.

678
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,989
Well, that's got to be unsettling.

679
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:57,417
Is this happening a lot?

680
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,205
Waking up with unknown girls?

681
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,575
Getting blacked-out drunk.

682
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,647
More often than I should.

683
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,878
Well, that's got to be...

684
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,693
Well, I'm sure that wasn't
easy for you to say.

685
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,236
I think it's important that you did.

686
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,461
You know, realizing that
this is something

687
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:25,902
you need to look into.

688
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,012
And I appreciate...

689
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,367
No, I'm<i> honored</i>

690
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,675
that you would share that with me.

691
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,192
MURTAUGH: I mean,
I know I'm your partner and all,

692
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:43,686
but-- and I don't even care
if this is reciprocal or not--

693
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:46,486
but I consider you a friend.

694
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:49,602
(laughs softly)

695
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,727
Yeah, it's true.

696
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,337
I mean, you don't... you don't
have to say anything,

697
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:56,695
just... just process it.

698
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:03,823
Riggs, you processing?

699
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,363
Riggs?

700
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:13,839
Riggs! (voice echoes in church)

701
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:18,184
(whispers): Sorry.

702
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,726
(door opens, hinges creaking)

703
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,163
Oh, right here. Let's see.

704
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:31,965
Uh-huh.

705
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,571
RIGGS: Bingo.

706
00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:43,243
Hey, what you got behind
this door right here?

707
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:46,224
A maintenance room--
it's where Reuben keeps

708
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,915
supplies for the grounds,
for the soup kitchen.

709
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,775
The soup guy who had
the little tiny crackers?

710
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,658
(hinges creak)

711
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,934
I'll be damned.

712
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,288
Marty. I heard I might find you here.

713
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:36,917
Uh, it's almost never true. Um...

714
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:38,707
We're gonna need the room a few minutes.

715
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:39,763
You know what, I gotta go, too.

716
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:42,265
- We've got this vigilante killer...
- You'll take a minute!

717
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:45,177
For me.

718
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:50,807
We missed you Friday night.

719
00:32:56,295 --> 00:33:00,216
Catholic Church gives a grieving
spouse a year and a day

720
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:02,662
to mourn a loved one.

721
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,833
I-I know you're not
a religious man, but...

722
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,490
Friday was a year and a day.

723
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,359
That's why I picked the date.

724
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:10,794
Anna and I knew

725
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:15,098
this first one was gonna be difficult.

726
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,676
But we wanted to mark it,

727
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,301
to remember Miranda.

728
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,467
With family.

729
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,763
With friends.

730
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,819
Everyone she loved.

731
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,432
You were her husband.

732
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:33,149
I still am.

733
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,186
What were you doing Friday night

734
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:38,788
that you couldn't make it?

735
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:43,593
I was in no shape to be around people.

736
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:46,196
From what I've heard,

737
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,666
you're in no condition a lot.

738
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,810
(exhales) Ronnie, listen...

739
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:54,892
Marty.

740
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,840
You want to be a drunk,

741
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:59,094
you be a drunk.

742
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,645
But I won't allow you

743
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:08,020
to blame my daughter for it.

744
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,334
MURTAUGH: <i>There's a BOLO out</i>

745
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:25,335
on Reuben Tomar's car.

746
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,904
LAX, bus station, train station,
all have been alerted.

747
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:30,206
- Okay. So, what do we know about him?
- He grew up

748
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,041
in St. Valens Church
after losing both parents.

749
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,177
MURTAUGH: His father
was a violent alcoholic.

750
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:35,478
He beat his mother to death.

751
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,213
Actually got sent away to prison for it.

752
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,482
We have a problem.
Father Patterson is M.I.A.

753
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,584
Hospital security has
his car in the parking lot.

754
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,319
Sign of struggle and blood on the seat.

755
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,754
Why would Ruben take his priest?

756
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:46,089
Maybe he wanted to repent.

757
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:47,557
Pretty sure that's not how it works.

758
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,756
(grunts)

759
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,496
AVERY:<i> Okay.</i>
<i>Valerie Rausch, Dale Reynolds.</i>

760
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:56,533
Reuben went after them
for a reason. Why them? Why now?

761
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,434
Ruben found out they got away
with murder during confession.

762
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,270
<i>So he punished them the same way</i>

763
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,874
<i>they committed their crimes.</i>

764
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:03,439
If Father Patterson knew

765
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,908
that Reuben's dad was abusing his mom,

766
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,515
<i>he sure as hell would hold him</i>
<i>accountable as well.</i>

767
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:11,347
Reuben, stop.

768
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,917
God will forgive you.

769
00:35:13,952 --> 00:35:15,818
Like you forgave my father.

770
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,889
You freed him of sin.

771
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,186
Instead of saving my mom.

772
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:28,932
So now, you are going to
suffer as she suffered.

773
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,067
(leather belt creaking)

774
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:33,666
Dad liked to use belts.

775
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:36,272
Did he tell you that?

776
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:38,274
When he confessed to you?

777
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:44,614
The BOLO paid off. Here's Reuben
blowing a red light

778
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:46,816
on Normandie and Sunset
about 15 minutes ago.

779
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:49,052
Well, that's just a couple of
blocks from his childhood home.

780
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:50,286
The apartment where his mother died.

781
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:51,588
- Yep.
- Go.

782
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,223
♪ ♪

783
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:58,428
Stay with me, Father.

784
00:35:58,463 --> 00:35:59,875
Please.

785
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,298
No more.

786
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:11,074
I read the coroner's report.

787
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,278
He hit her

788
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,747
39 times

789
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:19,415
before she died.

790
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,051
I'm only up to ten.

791
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:25,910
My mother could take it.

792
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:29,425
So can you.

793
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:36,332
Childhood home
of deranged serial killer?

794
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,067
Seems kind of textbook.

795
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:44,641
- (whispers): Is that the house?
- Mm-hmm.

796
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:46,009
All right.

797
00:36:46,044 --> 00:36:47,343
PATTERSON: Please, stop! (blows landing)

798
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,845
Rueben, please.

799
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:53,082
Clear, left!

800
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,451
Clear!

801
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:56,853
Rog?

802
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,322
Yeah. (groaning)

803
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:00,690
You got this?

804
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,191
I got it.

805
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:07,263
Ambulance on their way.

806
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:09,465
(groaning)

807
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,080
Uh-uh-uh. Come on.

808
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,054
You need to come with me.

809
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:24,213
I'd rather go with God.

810
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:27,717
Eh, that's not really a good option.

811
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:29,052
You know.

812
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,355
Look.

813
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,524
I mean, I know it's majestic,

814
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,527
and the white dove,
and everything, but...

815
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:41,564
Hey, hey, hey, no!

816
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,033
(yells)

817
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:48,571
(grunting)

818
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:50,073
Hey!

819
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:51,507
I got you.

820
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:53,076
I'm gonna pull you up.

821
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,344
(grunting)

822
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,579
(metal groaning)

823
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:02,352
Rog, it's not gonna hold.

824
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:03,619
You're gonna fall, too.

825
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,854
(grunting)

826
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,623
Rog, it's not gonna hold.

827
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,424
Let me go.

828
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:09,826
No!

829
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:12,261
I'm not gonna let you go. (grunting)

830
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,699
Rog! Let me go.

831
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:18,368
I'm not letting you go.

832
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:21,404
Rog. It's okay. It's okay.

833
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:24,173
No. I'm not letting you go!

834
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,745
Ow!

835
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,813
What is wrong... You hit me!

836
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,548
Rog! You need to let me go, Rog!

837
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:34,484
I'm not letting you... go!

838
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,853

00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:44,794
- Ow.

842
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:48,931
Rog.

843
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,333
Tell the truth.

844
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,402
Did you know this tree was down here?

845
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:55,948
- I can't believe you hit me!
- Well...

846
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:09,618
AVERY: So, I read your report.

847
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:12,100
- Have some questions.
- You shouldn't. Everything's in there.

848
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,777
The shiner. Walk me through that.

849
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,316
You're on the roof with the suspect.

850
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:17,992
When did he punch you?

851
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:20,462
Suspect did not punch me.

852
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:22,446
Then who... Please, don't say

853
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,799
- Riggs.
- Riggs.

854
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,434
(clears throat)

855
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,502
Do me a favor.
If Delgado asks, tell him...

856
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:29,304
Baseball to the face,
got hit by space debris,

857
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,836
swordfishing accident...

858
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,265
Yes. Any of those things.

859
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,849
Why did he do it?

860
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,214
It's not his fault.

861
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:41,208
I had it coming.

862
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,954
I tried to save his life.

863
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:50,692
(sighs)

864
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,634
(exhales)

865
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,738
Quite the watering hole
you got here, Ronnie.

866
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,431
Can I buy you another drink?

867
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,736
Get another one of these
and a club soda. Thanks.

868
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,794
You don't have to abstain on my account.

869
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:21,989
It's not just you.

870
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,163
I'm starting to forget things about her.

871
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,035
Little things.

872
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:35,682
God knows I don't want to,

873
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:37,272
but, um... I am

874
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:40,625
and... I can't do anything about it.

875
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:42,783
So let us help you through it.

876
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:48,749
Look.

877
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:56,143
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

878
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,120

879
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:01,909
I can't do this.

880
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,823
I think it's best

881

If I don't see you guys anymore.

882

Martin.

883
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:16,435
You're our family.

884
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,237
No.

885
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,475
She was your family.

886
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:27,746

It's late. What are you doing?

893
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,467
I was just looking for things to do

894
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:51,169
with the money we saved on Princeton.

895
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:52,871
You're torturing yourself, honey.

896
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:54,806
No. I ran the numbers.
You know, we could take a cruise

897
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:58,210
around the world in a first
class cabin nine times.

898

Yes... But it's a boat.

900
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:02,080
I get seasick.

901
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:04,916
Well, there's a deserted town
in North Dakota

902
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:06,218
that we could buy.

903
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:07,753
RJ and Feather could move there,

904
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:09,988
and he could be the mayor
of Stupidville.

905

(laughs) Stop.

906

Don't drain the college fund just yet.

907
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:16,194
I have faith RJ
will make the right choice.

908
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:17,662
Maybe it'll take

909
00:42:17,698 --> 00:42:19,690
a few months, maybe a year.

910
00:42:19,725 --> 00:42:21,566
Feather just broke up with me.

911
00:42:21,602 --> 00:42:23,401
Or sooner.

912
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:24,503
- Hey, baby.
- Aw.

913
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:26,204
What happened?

914
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
She said she's not in a
head-space for a relationship,

915
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,141
