1
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,885
Honey, I'm home.

2
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,886
Roger that.

3
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,888
Copy at the boat house.

4
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,390
Right on time.

5
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,393
Faisal, get your butt
in here. Harry's inside.

6
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,096
Yeah, yeah.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

7
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,468
Were you born in a barn?

8
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,602
Poor house.

9
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,977
You got your fur coat
razor blade there,

10
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,480
And a bunch of guys with guns.

11
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,818
I'm switching to subvocal now.

12
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,288
Check, check.

13
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,223
It's talk radio.

14
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,658
<i>You're on the air.</i>

15
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,810
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

16
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,019
He's at the service door.

17
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,287
He's inside.

18
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,565
Have you seen khaled yet?

19
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,702
Yep. There he is.

20
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,572
How come billionaires
are always short?

21
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,540
Jamal...

22
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,845
Excuse me.

23
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,651
Colonel, how are you?

24
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,887
It's so good to see you again.

25
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,389
It's been a long time.

26
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,390
Terrific.

27
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,891
Who was that guy?

28
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,829
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

29
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,332
<i>You should be crossing</i>
<i>the main foyer</i>

30
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,833
<i>Heading for the stairs.</i>

31
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,742
O.K., keep moving. Keep moving.

32
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,353
I'm in the library,

33
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,689
And I'm heading out
to the second floor balcony.

34
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,346
Modem in place.

35
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,148
Transmitting now.

36
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,583
Affirmatory.

37
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,351
It's a good hookup.

38
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,353
These are encrypted
files, guys.

39
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,356
It's going to take
just a few minutes.

40
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,560
I got your password.

41
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,535
Magnificent, isn't it?

42
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,836
Yes, quite.

43
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,338
I thought I knew
most of khaled's friends,

44
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,807
But I don't believe
I've met you before.

45
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,677
<i>No, we haven't met because I
certainly would remember.</i>

46
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,079
Renquist, harry renquist.

47
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,382
Juno skinner.

48
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,417
Juno skinner.

49
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,185
Juno skinner.

50
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,687
Come on. Come on.

51
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,223
Juno skinner, arts
and antiquities dealer,

52
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,357
Specializing in ancient persia.

53
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,862
This is persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

54
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,863
Very good.

55
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,365
6th century b.C., to be exact.

56
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,234
Do you like the period?

57
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,603
Oh, I adore it.

58
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,809
Alarm! Alarm!

59
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,212
Harry, we got a problem.

60
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,015
Guards are going
ape-shit down there.

61
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,018
Acquired most of these
pieces for jamal.

62
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,453
Do you tango?

63
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,957
Tango?

64
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,325
<i>Harry? Harry?</i>

65
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,860
<i>You do not have time</i>
<i>to tango, buddy.</i>

66
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,329
<i>You copy?</i>

67
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,879
Don't be stopping
to smell the roses now.

68
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,948
You got to get out of there.

69
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,983
Yes! Files are unlocked!

70
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,385
Fast faisal strikes again.

71
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,853
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

72
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,355
I got my hand up her
dress, and I am going for the gold...

73
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,424
Just copy
the goddamn files, o.K.?

74
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,157
And I thought this
was just going to be

75
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,658
Another bunch of boring bankers

76
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,160
And oil billionaires.

77
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,063
Harry, seconds count, buddy.
Ditch the bitch.

78
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,366
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

79
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,868
I have a plane to catch.

80
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,072
Well...

81
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,374
Call me sometime.

82
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,876
My offices are in rome.

83
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,079
I would like that.

84
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,387
He's with her two minutes,

85
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,223
And she's ready
to bear his children.

86
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,692
All right, twinkle toes,
what's your exit strategy?

87
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,895
I'm going to walk right out
of the front gate.

88
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,863
<i>Ballsy.</i>

89
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,398
Stupid but ballsy.

90
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,405
Sir?

91
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,907
May I see your
invitation, please?

92
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,509
Sure. Here's my invitation.

93
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,120
Aw, shit. Here we go.

94
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,421
Slight change in plans.

95
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,355
Halt!

96
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,359
Go!

97
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,573
Stay.

98
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,663
We're en route to the
roller rendezvous point.

99
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,166
I repeat...
backup rendezvous point.

100
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,667
Watch it! Watch it!

101
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,902
It's called ice,

102
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,004
And it gets a little slick.

103
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,523
Harry, do you copy?

104
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,826
I got it.

105
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,894
Shit!

106
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,262
Whoops!

107
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,076
Oh, my god.

108
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,445
I got it. I got it.

109
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,182
There he is!

110
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,284
Hi, guys.

111
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,921
Oh, yeah, that worked good.

112
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,190
Right out the old front gate.

113
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,292
Can you lean back a second?

114
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,527
Let's go.

115
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,529
We can still make our flight.

116
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,312
All right, that's it
for mr. Renquist.

117
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,413
O.K., go.

118
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,383
All right, we got harry
tasker billfold,

119
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,385
Harry tasker passport,
ticket stub,

120
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,886
Hotel bill, tasker.

121
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,089
I got two postcards
here from geneva.

122
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,893
Got some house keys
right there,

123
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,263
And I've got a souvenir
swiss snowing village.

124
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,798
What's that for?

125
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,566
It's for dana, stupe.

126
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,568
You know, bring your
kid home a gift.

127
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,438
Nice touch. Pick me up
tomorrow at 8:00.

128
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,639
Will do.

129
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,843
The debriefing is at 1000.

130
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,613
See you at 8:00.

131
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,281
O.K. Hey, harry.

132
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,050
Did you forget something?

133
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,586
What a team.

134
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,989
All right. Sleep fast, buddy.

135
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,830
Hi, honey.

136
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,232
How was your flight?

137
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,835
Oh, it was fine.

138
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,036
Good.

139
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,285
Brought you a little gift
from switzerland.

140
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,287
Snowy village.

141
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,356
Thanks, dad.

142
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,358
I've never had one of these.

143
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,493
You're welcome.

144
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,962
You're late for school.
You better get going.

145
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,463
Don't forget to feed gizmo.

146
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,865
O.K.

147
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,833
It's pretty lame.

148
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,042
I'm late.

149
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,544
Me, too. How'd it go
at the convention?

150
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,047
Did you make all the other
salesmen jealous?

151
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,549
Oh, it was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

152
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,052
We were the big hit
of the show.

153
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,523
We did new model ordering system...
the 680 I told you about.

154
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,525
I can write up an order.

155
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,527
When the customer's name
comes up,

156
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,029
You see what
his credit line is,

157
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,532
What he's ordered in the
past, discounts given,

158
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,033
Every little detail.

159
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,134
Terrific.

160
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,171
It's fantastic. I love
the computer business.

161
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,673
Listen, the plumber called.

162
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,676
He says he has to dig
under the slab.

163
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,178
It's going to cost $600.

164
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,345
That's o.K.

165
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,848
Well, it's not o.K.
It's extortion.

166
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,850
So what did you tell him?

167
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,687
I slept with him, and he
said he'd knock off $100.

168
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,889
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

169
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,561
Hello.

170
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,051
Dana!

171
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,494
Boy, I remember the first time

172
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,996
I got shot out of a cannon.

173
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,198
Good morning. Go to school.

174
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,703
Thanks, dear.

175
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,173
Check these out.

176
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,774
Check 'em out.

177
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,776
Where's the image coming from?

178
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,279
Got a ccd camera
in a transmitter

179
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,382
In a pack of smokes.
Pretty cool?

180
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,921
What the hell.

181
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,794
Bye, dad!

182
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,296
What's she...

183
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,865
Dana! She's ripping
you off. Dana!

184
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,367
I knew it.

185
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,302
Dana!

186
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,005
Dana!

187
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,006
Go!

188
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,509
Can't stop, I'm late! Bye, dad!

189
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,212
Shit.

190
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,017
Kids... 10 seconds of joy,
30 years of misery.

191
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,518
I got married three times.

192
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,021
I was never dumb enough
to have any.

193
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,523
She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better.

194
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,692
But you're not
her parents anymore.

195
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,195
Her parents are
axl rose and madonna.

196
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,697
The five minutes a day
you spend with her

197
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,699
Can't compete with that
constant bombardment.

198
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,767
You're outgunned.

199
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,736
It's not just because
you're a bad parent.

200
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,607
Kids today are 10 years
ahead of where we were.

201
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,109
Do you think she's
still a virgin?

202
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,878
Don't be ridiculous.
She's only...

203
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:14,879
She's 14.

204
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,380
She's only 14.

205
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,883
Her hormones are going
off like fire alarms.

206
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,886
Bet she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

207
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,987
Not dana.

208
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,489
Denial... it's not just
a river in egypt.

209
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,993
She's probably stealing the
money to pay for an abortion.

210
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,395
Why don't you open the door?

211
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,930
Or drugs.

212
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,834
20 here, 50 there.

213
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,803
I figured my wife's
boyfriend was taking it.

214
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,304
He takes everything else.

215
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,306
Never a beer in the fridge.

216
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,808
Thought you moved out.

217
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,309
Had to move back in.

218
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,579
It'll help me get the house
during property settlements.

219
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,181
You still owe me $200.

220
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,116
Good morning, janice.

221
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,291
Good morning.

222
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,194
Gentlemen, please identify
yourselves to the scanner.

223
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,763
Harry tasker, 10024.

224
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,432
Albert gibson, 34991.

225
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,113
All right, frances,

226
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,550
I don't believe we need you
any longer now. Thank you.

227
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,560
Sweet jesus, harry.

228
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,997
You surely screwed the pooch
last night, didn't you?

229
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,000
Please tell me
how I can see this

230
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,269
As anything
but a total disaster.

231
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,305
Well, total is a strong word.

232
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,774
Yeah. There are different
degrees of totality.

233
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,444
It's a scale, really, with a
perfect mission on one end

234
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,480
And a total pooch-screw
on the other.

235
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,850
You're new on harry's team,
aren't you?

236
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,719
Yes.

237
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,222
What makes you think
the slack I cut him

238
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,892
In any way translates to you?

239
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,328
Let me show you what we got.

240
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,267
We think he's dirty,

241
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,936
So we raid his private
financial files.

242
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,771
$100 million in wire transfers

243
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,807
From the commerce
bank international.

244
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,810
Which is a front for countries
to finance terrorist activities.

245
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,646
That's why we think
something big's going down.

246
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,082
A week ago, four warheads
were smuggled out

247
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,084
Of the former soviet
republic of kazakhstan.

248
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,952
We think khaled's group
bought the nukes

249
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,488
And is trying to bring
them to u.S. Soil.

250
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,658
So far, this is not
blowing my skirt up.

251
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,261
Don't you have anything
remotely substantial?

252
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,563
Harry,

253
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,565
Do you have any hard data?

254
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,000
Nothing you would
call rock-hard.

255
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,335
Actually, it's pretty limp.

256
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,337
Then perhaps
you'd better get some

257
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,839
Before somebody parks
an automobile

258
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,609
In front of the white house with
a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

259
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,479
It's not like
he's saving the world.

260
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,481
I mean, he's a sales rep.

261
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,949
Whenever I can't sleep,

262
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,952
I just ask him
to tell me about his day.

263
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,453
Six seconds and I'm out.

264
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,356
He acts like he's curing
cancer or something.

265
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,859
So you didn't get away
for the weekend?

266
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,161
No. Harry had
to go out of town.

267
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,162
I'm shocked.

268
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,830
Well, you know harry.

269
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,467
What's up?

270
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,536
Here. Check this out.

271
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,538
There's a $2 million
disbursement

272
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,540
From khaled to juno skinner.

273
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,977
That's right,
the babe at the party.

274
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,379
Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

275
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,314
She buys antiquities
for khaled.

276
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,617
No. He keeps his antique buys

277
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,118
On a separate ledger.

278
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,621
And this is a little
above market rate

279
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,590
For the horizontal bop,
even for a biscuit like her.

280
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,626
I want a complete
work-up on her.

281
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,127
Do we know where she is?

282
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,695
Right here in river city.

283
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,197
She lives in rome,

284
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,000
But she has a lot of
diplomatic connections,

285
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,501
So she has offices here.

286
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,470
So I guess it's time

287
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,672
To send in a specialist.

288
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,607
Care to tango?

289
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,309
Yes, I would.

290
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,681
Assholes.

291
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,487
It's all set up.

292
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,223
I got fax machine, ghost
phones, the usual stuff.

293
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,724
You have a suite

294
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,762
At the marquis hotel under the
name of renquist. Reality check.

295
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,263
My name is harry renquist.

296
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,566
I own the corporate
art consultant company

297
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,336
In san francisco and have an
appointment with miss skinner.

298
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,337
Harry.

299
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,638
Oh, hello.

300
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,640
I thought I'd see you again.

301
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,543
I just didn't know
it would be so soon.

302
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,278
What's the point of waiting?

303
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,513
I agree.

304
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,852
So your clients are looking
for something for the lobby

305
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,320
Of their new
corporate headquarters?

306
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,822
Yes. They would like to see
something very dramatic.

307
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,324
That's a nice piece.

308
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,959
I talked to many people,

309
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,661
And they all said
you're the one to see.

310
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,662
Really?

311
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,131
Checking on me.

312
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,835
So what did these people
say about me, exactly?

313
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,404
They say you can read
ancient sanskrit

314
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,807
Without having to
sound out the words.

315
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,242
Art dealers and archaeologists

316
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,877
Don't like you very much.

317
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,580
Those wimps.

318
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,783
It's because I use
my diplomatic contacts

319
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,285
To export cultural treasures

320
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,021
From countries which
tell them to take a hike.

321
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,630
See, most of our pieces
come from ancient persia.

322
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,232
Unfortunately, ancient persia
sits 20 feet under the sand

323
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,368
Of iran, iraq, and syria,

324
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,604
Not the most popular
places lately.

325
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,607
So I've had to become an expert

326
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,309
In international diplomacy.

327
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,147
Well, mr. Renquist...

328
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,351
Do you see anything you like?

329
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,687
Maybe.

330
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,188
Give me a break.

331
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,524
I don't think they'd
bug my tuna sandwich.

332
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,027
She's importing stuff
from all over the mideast.

333
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,029
She could be moving anything.

334
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,531
We've been getting calls
to the ghost numbers,

335
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,533
Checking out
the renquist front.

336
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,136
Step up surveillance.
Put on two more guys.

337
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:16,740
Maurizio, I said Saturday...
not Tuesday, Saturday.

338
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,943
<i>Va béne. Ciao.</i>

339
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,281
Ms. Skinner, may I have
a word with you please?

340
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,194
Stupid, undisciplined bitch!

341
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,631
It's a good thing you're
paying me a lot of money.

342
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,168
Do you realize there are
surveillance teams

343
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,170
Watching this place right now?

344
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,238
Your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.

345
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,275
And you were busy
laughing and flirting

346
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,509
Like a whore
with this renquist...

347
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,078
He checked out o.K.

348
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,349
We do not tolerate mistakes.

349
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,189
What would you like me to do?

350
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,625
Find out where
this renquist is.

351
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,127
Hello. Techtel systems.
Mr. Tasker's office.

352
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,464
Hi, charlene? Hi.
It's helen. Is he in?

353
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,966
Harry's in a sales meeting, mrs.
Tasker.

354
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,469
Let me try him in there.
Hold please.

355
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,504
Relay 10024.

356
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,042
It's a patch from techtel.

357
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,144
It's helen.

358
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,145
Hello, honey.

359
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,147
How are you? What's going on?

360
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,149
I'm sorry to bother you.

361
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,652
Dana and I want to make sure

362
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,654
You're going
to be home by 8:00.

363
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,590
We're going to a lot of
trouble for your birthday,

364
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,026
And we wanted to make sure...

365
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,027
Absolutely!

366
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,696
This time you can count on me.

367
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,697
Great.

368
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,198
Gotta go. Bye.

369
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,199
Bye.

370
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,701
That's disgusting, dana.

371
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,935
Calm down.

372
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,406
We've got a friend.

373
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,342
Three cars back
on the inside lane.

374
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,245
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

375
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,746
In the station wagon?

376
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,249
Want me to lose them?

377
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,918
No. We need this lead.

378
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,119
Unit 7?

379
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:11,588
7 here.

380
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,823
<i>We need you</i>

381
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,559
At the georgetown mall
in three minutes.

382
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,095
Helen's going to be pissed.

383
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,597
Well, this is the problem
with terrorists.

384
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,099
They're really inconsiderate

385
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,334
When it comes
to people's schedules.

386
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,247
Pull over here. This is good.

387
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,086
O.K. Testing...

388
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,288
I got you. I got you.

389
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,194
O.K. They're right with us.

390
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,896
I make three of them
in the car.

391
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,074
Dickhead.

392
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,642
Blow me.

393
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,495
I got a couple
coming after you.

394
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,396
You think I'm blind?

395
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,932
<i>Well, you do look</i>
<i>like ray charles.</i>

396
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,467
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

397
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,170
Just getting a closer look
at beavis and butt-head.

398
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,172
There's a third one
still in the car.

399
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,807
<i>O.K. Stay on him.</i>

400
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,830
Hi, helen.

401
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,331
Yeah, it's gib.

402
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,833
Oh, not much.

403
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,335
Listen, harry forgot something
back at the office,

404
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:09,006
And you know harry, and...

405
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,842
Yeah, gib, I know harry.

406
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,843
Bye.

407
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,179
<i>Bye. See you soon.</i>

408
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,847
See?

409
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,991
Harry... Harry,
I lost the third guy.

410
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,604
Shit!

411
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,606
Hold it!

412
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,874
Oh, shit!

413
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,261
Hey!

414
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,527
Here. Cool off.

415
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,130
Move! Move!

416
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,106
Sorry about this.

417
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,415
Look out!

418
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,488
Hey! Freeze!

419
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,133
Oh, thank god.

420
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,453
Get into the car!

421
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,626
Here we go.

422
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,917
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

423
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,456
Sorry.

424
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,657
Hey!

425
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,205
Harry, what's your 20?

426
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,707
Westbound through the park.

427
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,943
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
coming out on franklin.

428
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,011
Copy that.

429
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,847
I want you on 14th
in case he turns south

430
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,950
And 7 on the north
side to box him in.

431
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,822
And make it quick because
my horse is getting tired.

432
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,857
Your horse?

433
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,476
That's him!

434
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,744
Come on!

435
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,059
Go around to the back.

436
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,194
<i>Copy that.</i>

437
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,331
Out of my way!

438
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,444
Out of my way!

439
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,180
Sorry.

440
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,181
Excuse me.

441
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,516
Excuse me.

442
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,894
Sorry.

443
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,730
Out of my way!

444
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,400
Excuse me.

445
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,002
Excuse me.

446
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,782
Out of the way!

447
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,992
Move! Move! Move!

448
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,395
Get off there!

449
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,396
Down! Down!

450
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,098
Get down or die!

451
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,034
Down! Down!

452
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,839
Hold still!

453
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,074
Come on!

454
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,954
Hold still!

455
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,256
Hold still!

456
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,670
Would you press the button
for the top floor, please?

457
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,306
Thank you.

458
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,012
No!

459
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Shut up!

460
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,020
Say something.

461
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,356
That's a f-fine animal.

462
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,557
Eww!

463
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,743
Flat against the car!

464
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,979
O.K. Come on.

465
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,781
I'm so sorry.

466
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,252
Stay there!

467
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,454
Don't move!

468
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,246
Come on. Come on, fella.

469
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,132
O.K...

470
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,400
Back up.

471
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,401
Back up.

472
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,007
You can do it.

473
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,142
Come on.

474
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,144
Good horse. Good.

475
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,145
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,747
Yeah. Go back now.

477
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,916
Come on.
Yeah. That's teamwork now.

478
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:53,917
Keep pulling.

479
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,185
Come on.

480
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,186
Good.

481
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,188
Now a little bit more.

482
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,890
Attaboy.

483
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,363
O.K.

484
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,877
Now, what the hell
were you thinking?

485
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,645
I had the guy,

486
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,048
And you let him get away.

487
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,850
Look at me when I'm talking.

488
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,285
What kind of a cop
are you anyway?

489
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,607
Hi, honey.

490
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,247
I know you're upset.

491
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,448
I'm sorry.

492
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,851
But I hurried home
as fast as I could.

493
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,122
It's o.K.

494
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,893
It's o.K.

495
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,363
I'm sorry.

496
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,332
Thank you for the party.

497
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,235
Yeah. It was great.

498
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,084
Hey.

499
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,722
That's him.

500
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,758
O.K. Pause it right there.

501
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,760
Salim abu aziz.

502
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,261
This guy's really hard-core.

503
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,430
Highly fanatical,
a real psycho.

504
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,433
He's been linked to dozens
and dozens of car bombings.

505
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,670
You know that cafe bomb
in rome last year?

506
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,171
That was his.

507
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,173
And the 727 out of lisbon.

508
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,175
This guy's a major player.

509
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,911
He's formed his own splinter
faction... crimson jihad.

510
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,914
The other terrorist groups
were too warm and fuzzy.

511
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,950
They call him the sand spider.

512
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:07,951
Why?

513
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,219
Probably because
it sounds scary.

514
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,822
Well, this is impressive,
gentlemen.

515
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,824
It would be even
more impressive

516
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,527
If you actually
knew where he was.

517
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,696
We'll get him.

518
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,198
Why don't you pull over
right here.

519
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,967
What's up?

520
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,670
Oh, I really screwed up
with helen last night.

521
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,708
I'm just going to see if
she's available for lunch

522
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,209
To smooth things over.

523
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,711
You want me to hang?

524
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,212
Yeah. Just hang.

525
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,715
O.K., buddy, I'll
just... Be hanging.

526
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,255
Hold please.

527
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,724
Helen...

528
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,026
It's your mystery man on two.

529
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,227
Simon?

530
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,631
Oh, my god!

531
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,570
Hello? Simon?

532
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,940
Yes, I can talk.

533
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,978
You mean right now?

534
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,849
Yes... I can meet you.

535
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,283
O.K.

536
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,119
I can't wait.

537
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,487
Bye.

538
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,489
Can you cover me for an hour?

539
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,990
Just an hour?

540
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,192
Tell that stud
to take more time!

541
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,694
Would you shut up?

542
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,697
I should have never
told you about him.

543
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,300
Hee hee hee hee!
Have a good time!

544
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,739
Get a little bit for me
while you're at it!

545
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,616
Hey, hold it!

546
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,617
Fucker.

547
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,686
You sick or something?

548
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,688
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

549
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,190
It's helen... It's helen.
It's helen.

550
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,794
Helen. It has something to
do with helen, I'm guessing.

551
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,795
Helen...

552
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,064
Helen.

553
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,398
Helen...

554
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,467
Helen...

555
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,836
Is having an affair.

556
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,109
Welcome to the club, man.

557
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,946
Nobody thinks it can happen
to them the first time.

558
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,949
Same thing happened to
me with wife number 2.

559
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,452
I had no idea. Nothing's
going on, right?

560
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,521
I come home one day, and the
house is completely empty.

561
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,991
She even took the ice cube
trays from the freezer.

562
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,993
What kind of a sick bitch

563
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,763
Takes the ice cube trays
from the freezer?

564
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,465
But helen...

565
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,900
Hey, harry. Hey, listen,
helen still loves you.

566
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,903
She just wants to
bang this guy a while.

567
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,605
You'll get used to it...

568
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,109
Stop cheering me up!

569
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,446
What'd you expect, harry?

570
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:54,417
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

571
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,620
It was just a matter of time.

572
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,028
You know what? I say we
concentrate on work.

573
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,398
That's what I do whenever
my life turns to dogshit.

574
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,833
Work gets me by.

575
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,970
This is gonna be great. We're
gonna catch some terrorists,

576
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,472
We're gonna beat
the crap out of them,

577
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,475
You're gonna feel
a hell of a lot better.

578
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,177
Watch your head now.

579
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,852
Women... can't live with them,

580
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,088
Can't kill 'em.

581
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,540
Came by your office today.

582
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,542
I was in the area
and thought that

583
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,711
You might want to have lunch.

584
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:00,650
Real-really? Well, you
must've just missed me.

585
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:05,588
They said you had to run out
or something like that.

586
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,090
Oh, it was this rush job...

587
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,559
They needed these documents

588
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,594
At the district courthouse.

589
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,596
So of course, the big problem?

590
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,097
Our printer shut down.

591
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,201
I went to the third
floor to use theirs,

592
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,203
But they have the 1720,

593
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,573
And of course, the disk isn't
formatted for the 1720.

594
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,576
So I have to go back
upstairs and reformat,

595
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,578
Go back downstairs
and use the printer,

596
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,748
Then I couldn't get
my car to start.

597
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,952
Then traffic... Well,
I barely got there.

598
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,022
That's a little excitement

599
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,024
In an otherwise dull day.

600
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,993
Did it work out o.K.?

601
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,829
Yeah.

602
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,064
Great.

603
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,900
I'll check on dessert.

604
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,035
I'm done.

605
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,942
The great thing is,

606
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,945
They're practically giving
us a blank check on wiretap.

607
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,916
I've set them up on all of juno's
shipping agents and her clients.

608
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,920
Faisal's made a list of possible u.S.
Contacts of the crimson jihad.

609
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,122
Now we can just sit around...

610
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,994
Hey, this national
security stuff boring you?

611
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,496
Put a tap on her phone.

612
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,965
What do you mean?
I already did that.

613
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,467
I'm talking about helen's.

614
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,970
Put a tap on her office line
and my house. Do it now.

615
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,772
Just come over here.
Sounds great.

616
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,776
I have a question. I got two
words to describe that idea...

617
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,445
In-sane. An unauthorized
wiretap is a felony.

618
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,881
And we're doing it
20 times a day.

619
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,151
So don't give me
that crap. Do it.

620
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,031
<i>Hello?</i>

621
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,232
<i>Helen, it's simon.</i>

622
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,767
<i>Is it safe to talk?</i>

623
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,368
<i>Yes. Go ahead.</i>

624
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,871
<i>I can't talk long.</i>
<i>Can you meet me</i>

625
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,205
<i>For lunch tomorrow?</i>

626
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,707
I suppose so. Where?

627
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,542
Same place.

628
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,543
1:00.

629
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,545
I have to go now.

630
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,614
See you tomorrow.

631
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:15,117
Remember, I need you.

632
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,439
I thought that we might have
lunch together tomorrow.

633
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,476
You know, darn it,
I'm meeting allison.

634
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,478
We're going to go shopping.

635
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,880
Sorry.

636
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,817
No problem.

637
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,287
I think you're going
about this all wrong.

638
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,024
See, women like you
to talk to them.

639
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,360
And maybe you're not in touch
with your feminine side.

640
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,696
I was watching
<i>sally jessy raphael...</i>

641
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,699
All right. O.K.
I got the usual stuff here.

642
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,201
I got a telemetry-burst
transmitter, a gps tracker,

643
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,237
An audio transmitter,
a power supply,

644
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,939
I've got it
sewn into the lining here...

645
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,474
Hey, harry?

646
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,644
If you need to talk...
Speak into the purse.

647
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,550
O.K. Here she comes.

648
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,053
She'll pop out
right in front of us.

649
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,254
Watch. Bingo!

650
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,693
Looks like she's going
into chinatown.

651
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:09,932
O.K., she's parking.

652
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,276
O.K., give me audio.

653
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,286
You sure you weren't followed?

654
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,092
No. I kept looking behind
me like you taught me,

655
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,827
But I didn't see anyone.

656
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:39,995
Things are a bit hot now.

657
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:43,466
If I get a signal, I may
have to leave suddenly.

658
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,034
I understand.

659
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,808
Look, it's my job to take
risks, but not yours.

660
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,311
I feel bad about
bringing you into this,

661
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,413
But you're the only one
I can trust.

662
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,815
Were you out on a mission?

663
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:05,354
We say "op." covert operation,

664
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,056
And this one, well,

665
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,357
Got a little rough.

666
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,692
Worse than cairo?

667
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,060
Cairo.

668
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:15,364
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

669
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,866
The guy's a spook.

670
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,267
But for whom?

671
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,736
Could be working her
to get to you.

672
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,239
Did you read
the papers yesterday?

673
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,007
Yes.

674
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,581
Sometimes the story's
a mask for covert operation.

675
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,084
See two men killed
in a restaurant

676
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,521
And two unidentified men in a
shoot-out at the marriott?

677
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,189
That was you?

678
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,724
<i>You see? You're very good.</i>

679
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,092
You recognize my style.

680
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,828
You're a natural at this.

681
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,230
He's taking credit
for our moves.

682
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,231
What happened?

683
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,866
Hardly worth talking about.

684
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,702
Two of them won't
bother me again.

685
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,703
Unbelievable!

686
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,239
<i>You chased one?</i>

687
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:01,243
I had to nail this guy
no matter what the risk.

688
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,113
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple times,

689
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,582
But I really can't take credit.

690
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,783
Why not?

691
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,318
It's the training.

692
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,654
It shapes you into
a lethal instrument.

693
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,456
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

694
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,458
I'm starting to like this guy.

695
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,262
We've still got to kill him.
That's a given.

696
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,870
<i>♪ More than a woman to me ♪</i>

697
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,640
<i>♪ more than a woman ♪</i>

698
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,012
<i>♪ more than a woman to me ♪</i>

699
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,015
<i>♪ more than a wo... ♪</i>

700
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,724
The guy is a goddamn
used car salesman.

701
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,594
This keeps getting
better and better!

702
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,097
I'm sorry. I know
this has got to be painful.

703
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,799
But it's pretty damn funny.

704
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,201
If it was some idiot
and not you,

705
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,869
You'd be laughing your ass off.

706
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,906
One born every minute.

707
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,909
It wants you, too.
Feel it vibrate?

708
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,079
Say, how about a little spin?

709
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,647
Sure.

710
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,818
See, it's not just a car.

711
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,820
It's a total image.
An identity.

712
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,888
You have to go for it.

713
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,391
This isn't some
high-tech sports car.

714
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,226
It doesn't even
handle that great.

715
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,729
But what are we
talking about here?

716
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,997
Pussy, right?

717
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,666
Absolutely.

718
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:38,240
Let's face it, harry.
The 'vette gets 'em wet.

719
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,742
But it's not enough.

720
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,678
If you really want
to close escrow,

721
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,681
Well, you gotta have an angle.

722
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,683
I suppose you have an angle.

723
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,184
Oh, it's killer.

724
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,688
Look at me. I'm not
that much to look at.

725
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,690
No, no. I can be honest.

726
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,692
But I got 'em lining up.

727
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,694
And not just
the skanks, either.

728
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,995
Well, some are.

729
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,163
What's your angle?

730
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,165
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

731
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,768
Sorry. Trade secret.

732
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,269
O.K. Just ask yourself...

733
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,204
What do women really want?

734
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,706
You take these
bored housewives,

735
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,208
Married to the same
guy for years.

736
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:16,045
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release!

737
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,681
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

738
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,716
I create that for them.

739
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:24,219
So basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

740
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,221
See, I couldn't do that.

741
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,223
What are you, a boy scout?

742
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,726
Think of it as playing a role.

743
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,728
You gotta work on their dreams,

744
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,264
Get them out of their
suburban grind.

745
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,632
What about their husbands?

746
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,069
Dickless! Face it, if they
took care of business,

747
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,572
I'd be out of business,
you know what I mean?

748
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,573
Those idiots.

749
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,710
Hey, hey!

750
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,678
You mind keeping it under 90?

751
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,681
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

752
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,683
Who are you working on now?

753
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,019
I always got a couple
on the hook.

754
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,522
There's this one, I got
her panting like a dog.

755
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,523
It's great.

756
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,325
What does she do?

757
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,327
Some sort of legal secretary.

758
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,329
You know, uptight
and conservative.

759
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,132
Oh! She could be so hot
if she wanted.

760
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,835
With you she gets
to be real hot.

761
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,170
Oh, red hot! Her thighs steam.

762
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,172
It's like a dying plant.

763
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,707
Just needs a little water.

764
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,075
Married to some boring jerk...

765
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,077
Married to some boring jerk?

766
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,712
Yeah. He doesn't
appreciate her.

767
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,781
She's like all these babes...

768
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,785
You get their pilot lit, they
can suck-start a leaf-blower.

769
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,787
She's got the most
incredible body

770
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:35,724
And a pair of titties
make you want to stand up

771
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,025
And beg for buttermilk.

772
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,561
Ass like a little boy...

773
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:48,203
So, then she must be really
good in bed then, eh?

774
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,973
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

775
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,686
See?

776
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,689
You and this car were
made for each other.

777
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,191
Why fight it?

778
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,493
I got some other
buyers on the line,

779
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,495
But I like your style.

780
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,730
What do you say?

781
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,166
Should we start up
the paperwork?

782
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,667
Let me think about it.

783
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,471
Hold it for me for a day, o.K.?

784
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,641
Hey. Because it's you.

785
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,142
I got today's transcripts.

786
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,078
Not much going on.

787
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,382
Nothing from simon?

788
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,050
No.

789
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,163
My turn to drive?

790
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,565
Give me the page.

791
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,599
What?

792
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,468
This jumped from
page 9 to page 11.

793
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,469
Where's page 10?

794
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,671
Give me the goddamn page!

795
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,243
O.K.

796
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,849
Seek help, harry.

797
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,016
<i>Hello?</i>

798
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,185
Helen, I need your help.

799
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,954
Can you meet me tonight?

800
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:12,955
What's happened?

801
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:13,989
It's serious.

802
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,991
Meet me on k street

803
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,493
Under the key bridge.

804
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,861
8:00 sharp.

805
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,631
Gotcha.

806
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:27,002
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

807
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,244
She's still at the house.

808
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,412
The purse is still
at the house.

809
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,114
Shit.

810
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,518
Unit 2, unit 7. Immediate roll.

811
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,654
Acquire subject at k
street and key bridge.

812
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,656
Vehicle is red and
white convertible.

813
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,157
You've got exactly six minutes.

814
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,159
Are you out of your mind?

815
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,662
You can't pull agents
off a priority surveillance

816
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,264
To follow your wife!

817
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,099
It's a misappropriation
of sector resources

818
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,101
And a breach
of national security.

819
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:00,536
You copy, harry?

820
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,105
You're losing it big-time, man.

821
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,673
I have to stop you.

822
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,174
Are you going to tell?

823
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,877
Both of our butts
are on the line.

824
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,879
So your life's in the crapper.

825
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,181
So you're wife's banging
a used car salesman.

826
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,685
It's humiliating, I know,
but take it like a man!

827
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,421
You tell on me, I tell on you.

828
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,423
I'm clean
as a preacher's sheets.

829
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,426
What about when you blew
a six-week operation

830
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,428
Because you were
getting a blowjob?

831
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:27,529
You knew about that?

832
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,031
Ha.

833
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,701
Let's take franklin.
It's quicker.

834
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,665
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

835
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,642
2 here.
Suspect, vehicle in sight.

836
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,178
One male, one female.

837
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,679
Don't be alarmed.

838
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:21,183
If I'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

839
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,185
You should keep your head down

840
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,821
Till we're out of the city.

841
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,023
Here. Let me help you.

842
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,860
That's better.

843
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:39,267
O.K., now the woman has her
head in the guy's lap,

844
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,270
Southbound on the key bridge.
2 in pursuit.

845
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,271
Roger, 2.

846
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,340
1 to condor, you got a visual?

847
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,644
<i>Roger, 1. This is condor.</i>

848
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,647
<i>Subject is in sight.</i>
<i>Repeat. We have the ball.</i>

849
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,383
<i>We got a pretty good</i>
<i>lockup on infrared.</i>

850
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,285
<i>She's got her head</i>
<i>in his lap, all right.</i>

851
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,286
<i>Ya-hoo.</i>

852
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,889
Maybe she's sleepy.

853
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,462
O.K., this is a safe house.

854
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,966
My place in the city
is too hot now.

855
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,269
So is the penthouse
in new york.

856
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:29,418
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

857
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:32,954
Helen, I want you
to be my wife.

858
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,990
But I'm married!

859
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,492
It's just for
the operation in paris.

860
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,194
I need to be married.

861
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,563
They'll be looking for
a man traveling alone.

862
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,666
Par-par... you want me
to go to paris?

863
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,869
Paris, with a quick
stopover in london.

864
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,674
Helen, there's a double
agent in my outfit.

865
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,509
I don't know who.

866
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,245
There's no one I can trust

867
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,247
Except you. Can you get away,

868
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,516
Just for a couple of days?

869
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,018
I just don't know.

870
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,020
Of course. I'm rushing you.

871
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,223
Forgive me. Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

872
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,961
Let me pour you some more wine.

873
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,708
O.K.

874
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,010
I'll do it.

875
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,746
I'll do it.

876
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,783
You just saved my life.

877
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,754
You are incredibly brave.

878
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,256
I have to remind
myself of the fear

879
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,258
You must be feeling.

880
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,394
For me, fear is not an option.

881
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,897
In order to pull
this cover story off,

882
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,266
We have to look like two people

883
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,802
Who are completely
intimate with each other.

884
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,072
The enemy can spot
a fake easily.

885
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,244
You see what I mean?

886
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,311
Sorry.

887
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,781
That reaction could
get us both killed.

888
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:06,782
I'm sorry.

889
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,917
We can't afford that.

890
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,418
Try to relax.

891
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,921
It... it's just been a long time

892
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,357
Since anybody but harry's
touched me like that.

893
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:19,661
I know. It's awkward
for me, too.

894
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:20,662
I'm sorry.

895
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,797
That's all right.
Just sit back.

896
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,166
I'm o.K.

897
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,667
There. That's better.

898
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,804
Just let yourself...

899
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,305
Slip into the role.

900
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,249
That's it.

901
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,352
There we go.

902
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,522
Let yourself go.

903
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,992
Yeah. That's good.

904
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,527
That's great.

905
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,497
That's it.

906
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,333
No. I can't do this.
I can't do this.

907
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,835
What's wrong? It's o.K.

908
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:02,637
No. I cannot do this.
I cannot... Do this!

909
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,677
If not for me...

910
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,413
Do it for your country?

911
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,293
Shit!

912
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,277
God! Don't hurt me!

913
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:43,645
Don't hurt me!

914
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,814
I'll do whatever you want. Oh!

915
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,117
Please! I didn't do anything!

916
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,089
Oh, no!

917
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,461
Damn it!

918
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,584
Take her! Take her!

919
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,452
Oh, god, don't hurt me!

920
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,525
Son of a bitch!

921
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,145
<i>Sit down.</i>

922
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,750
I said sit down.

923
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,857
<i>Who do you work for?</i>

924
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:42,130
Stern, kessler,
goldstein & krumpnick.

925
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,566
I'm just a legal secretary.

926
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,267
Sure, mrs. Tasker.

927
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,769
<i>What were you doing</i>

928
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,270
<i>With the international</i>
<i>terrorist</i>

929
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,239
<i>Carlos the jackal,</i>
<i>taking dictation?</i>

930
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,743
How long have you been a
member of his faction?

931
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,746
I don't know anything
about a faction.

932
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,715
I just met simon...

933
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,218
Or whoever you say he is...

934
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:06,187
Just a couple weeks ago.

935
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,689
I barely know him.

936
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,192
That's not what it looked
like when we found you.

937
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,294
How did you meet him?

938
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,899
Well, ahem...

939
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,811
Keep this for me.

940
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,313
I can't afford to be
taken with it.

941
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,381
What?

942
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,283
It's a matter
of national security.

943
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,351
No.

944
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,319
Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

945
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,522
Oh, shit.

946
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:14,689
<i>Why did you continue</i>
<i>to see him?</i>

947
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,192
He said he needed my help.

948
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,195
<i>Not because you</i>
<i>were attracted to him?</i>

949
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,663
No!

950
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,866
You were not attracted
to him at all?

951
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,668
No.

952
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,874
Well, maybe just a little.

953
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,578
So, is cheating
a common thing for you?

954
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,912
No. Never.

955
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,415
You're telling me
this was your first time?

956
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:43,151
I wasn't cheating!

957
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,154
Tell me about your husband, mrs.
Tasker.

958
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,556
Harry?

959
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,029
I... I... what can I say
about harry?

960
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,067
I mean, he's a sales rep
for a computer company.

961
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,403
So sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag anymore.

962
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,507
That is none
of your goddamn business!

963
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,342
What kind of questions
are these?

964
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,711
<i>You're in trouble. I
suggest you cooperate.</i>

965
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:12,313
If we want to know intimate
details about your life,

966
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,748
You'd better tell us.

967
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,454
My husband is a good man.

968
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,624
But he's not exactly
ringing your bell...

969
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,827
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

970
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,297
<i>Why did you go</i>
<i>to carlos' hideout?</i>

971
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:34,669
He wanted me to go to paris
with him on a mission.

972
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,704
To... Pose as his wife.

973
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,373
And you agreed?

974
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,776
<i>Why?</i>

975
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,480
I don't know.

976
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:49,450
I guess I needed something.

977
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,153
What did you need?

978
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,595
I needed to feel alive.

979
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:06,734
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

980
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,507
And it felt really good...

981
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,376
To be needed.

982
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,549
And to be trusted.

983
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,888
And to be special.

984
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,824
It's just that there's

985
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,627
So much I wanted to do
with this life,

986
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,563
And it's like I haven't
done any of it.

987
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,066
And the sand's running
out of the hourglass,

988
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,569
And I wanted to be able
to look back and say,

989
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,371
See? I did that!

990
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,007
I was reckless, and I was wild,

991
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,042
And I fucking did it!

992
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,850
Quite frankly,
I don't give a shit

993
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,620
Whether you understand
that or not.

994
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,390
This simon...

995
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:07,962
Did you sleep with him?

996
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,998
No.

997
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,199
She's lying.

998
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:16,304
You mean you did not have
sexual relations with him?

999
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,376
Listen, if you're going to
ask me every question twice,

1000
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,878
This is going to take
a long time,

1001
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,881
And I have to get back
to my family.

1002
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,316
You're not going anywhere.

1003
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,818
Just let me out of here!

1004
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,920
<i>Answer the question.</i>

1005
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,691
Answer the question!

1006
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,393
No!

1007
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,529
I did not...

1008
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,530
Sleep...

1009
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,499
With him!

1010
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,533
Calm down, please.

1011
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,902
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

1012
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,771
Calm down.

1013
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,740
She could be telling the truth.

1014
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,109
Calm down, mrs. Tasker.

1015
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,580
<i>Calm down, please.</i>

1016
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,952
I've only one more
question, mrs. Tasker.

1017
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,188
What?

1018
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,957
Do you...

1019
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:13,094
Still love your husband?

1020
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,601
Yes, I love him.

1021
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,839
I've always loved him.

1022
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,809
And I will always love him.

1023
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,817
She loves you! Now what?

1024
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,290
There's only one solution to
your problem, mrs. Tasker.

1025
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,226
<i>You must work for us.</i>

1026
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,363
What are you doing?

1027
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,832
Just giving her
a little assignment.

1028
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,800
You gotta be shitting me!

1029
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,335
She wants a little adventure.

1030
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,338
I'll give her one. I'm
offering you a choice.

1031
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,842
If you work for us, we
will drop the charges.

1032
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,844
You can resume
your normal life.

1033
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,514
If not, you will go
to a federal prison,

1034
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,717
<i>And your husband and
daughter will be left</i>

1035
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,219
<i>Humiliated and alone.</i>

1036
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,421
<i>Your life will be destroyed.</i>

1037
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:18,993
Oh. Gee.

1038
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,495
Let me think.

1039
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,830
<i>Yes or no?</i>

1040
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,533
Of course yes.

1041
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,968
What's involved?

1042
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,104
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

1043
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:34,242
The code name of your
contact will be boris.

1044
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,411
And your code name will be...

1045
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,512
Natasha?

1046
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,646
<i>No.</i>

1047
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,582
Doris.

1048
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,062
Pricks!

1049
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,606
You son of a bitch.

1050
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,975
Did you think you could
elude us forever, carlos?

1051
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:10,912
You got the wrong guy.
My name's simon!

1052
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:14,115
Just let me go. There's
no need to kill me.

1053
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,783
I haven't seen your face...

1054
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:20,788
No! Don't! Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

1055
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:24,325
Y-y-it's you!

1056
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:27,428
Hey, you still interested
in that 'vette at all?

1057
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,496
Hey, carlos.

1058
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:29,997
The game's over.

1059
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:33,534
Your career as an international
terrorist is well-documented.

1060
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,671
Oh, no! I sell cars.
That's all!

1061
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,173
Come on. I'm not a terrorist!

1062
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,008
I'm actually a complete coward.

1063
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,544
If I ever saw a gun... oh, god!

1064
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,681
Oh, please, don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't kill me!

1065
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,952
I'm not a spy.

1066
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,787
I'm nothing!

1067
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,590
I'm navel lint!

1068
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,793
I have to lie to women
to get laid!

1069
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,761
And I don't score much.

1070
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,664
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic!

1071
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,102
Oh, god.

1072
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,539
Oh! Would a spy pee himself?

1073
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,042
Oh, god!

1074
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,445
Please, I'm not worth a bullet.

1075
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,946
Have mercy, sir.

1076
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,249
Get the fuck outta here?

1077
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:23,084
Just beat it. Go on.

1078
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:27,188
No! Soon as I turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

1079
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,090
You're gonna shoot me!

1080
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,093
Please, you can have
the car for free.

1081
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,562
What do you say?

1082
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,899
Get lost, dipshit.

1083
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:00,721
So last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.

1084
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,627
My flat tire?

1085
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,629
Actually, it was a little scary

1086
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,833
Because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

1087
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,041
I'll get it.

1088
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,245
Hello?

1089
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,446
<i>Doris?</i>

1090
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,218
Yes?

1091
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,287
Yes?

1092
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,623
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

1093
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,759
In exactly one hour, go
to the hotel marquis.

1094
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:43,764
<i>Pick up an envelope marked
doris at the front desk,</i>

1095
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:44,799
<i>And dress sexy.</i>

1096
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:45,900
What?

1097
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,134
Hello?

1098
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:51,172
No, no. Turn around.

1099
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,241
Do it <i>dulcimo.</i>

1100
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:56,944
Do it very slowly.

1101
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,946
You've reached
a new all-time low.

1102
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,449
You're really using the
suite at the marquis?

1103
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:05,086
I can't afford
a suite on my salary.

1104
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,088
<i>Is jean-claude done yet?</i>

1105
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,089
Hang on.

1106
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,824
Who wrote this shit... harry?

1107
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,325
<i>C'est la merde.</i>

1108
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,027
It's going great.

1109
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,240
Hi.

1110
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,443
Do you have an
envelope for doris?

1111
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,928
This is doris.

1112
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:51,999
Listen, you are a
prostitute named michelle.

1113
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,501
Go to the room.

1114
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,703
There will be a man there.

1115
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,872
<i>He is a suspected arms dealer.</i>

1116
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,874
Now, wait a minute. Wait.

1117
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:02,376
You don't expect me to...

1118
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:03,377
You know.

1119
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,245
<i>No.</i>

1120
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,515
He has particular tastes.

1121
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,650
<i>He likes to watch.</i>

1122
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:10,685
<i>Tell him</i>

1123
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,521
That his regular girl carla

1124
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:16,023
<i>Is sick. If he likes you,</i>

1125
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,992
<i>He will tell you what to do.</i>

1126
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,261
You must plant the bug

1127
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:23,764
<i>Near the telephone by the
bed before you leave.</i>

1128
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:26,767
If you do not
complete your mission,

1129
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,036
The deal is off.

1130
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,406
I'm gonna go to hell.

1131
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,891
Hello?

1132
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,968
Hello.

1133
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,511
<i>Have some champagne.</i>

1134
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,160
<i>Come in here.</i>

1135
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,415
My name is michelle.

1136
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:31,752
Carla thought you'd like me.

1137
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,988
<i>Let me do the talking.</i>

1138
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:37,892
<i>You may start by</i>
<i>unzipping your dress.</i>

1139
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,262
<i>No, no.</i>

1140
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,063
<i>Turn around.</i>

1141
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,532
<i>Do it</i> dulcimo.

1142
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,935
Do it very slowly.

1143
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,075
<i>Good.</i>

1144
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,381
<i>Now slip the dress down slowly.</i>

1145
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,494
<i>Good.</i>

1146
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,035
<i>Now slide your nylons off,</i>

1147
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,537
<i>One by one.</i>

1148
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,707
I'm not wearing any.

1149

Bastard!

1179
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,809
Helen. Helen. Wait, wait, wait.

1180
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,048
Harry?

1181
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,649
Yes, it's harry.

1182
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,353
I know it looks bad,
but I can explain.

1183
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:10,290
Nobody move!

1184
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:11,391
Don't move!

1185
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,597
Helen, just don't do anything.

1186
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,098
No, he isn't involved.

1187
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,067
I'm the one you want!

1188
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,603
Quiet, helen. Do what they say.

1189
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,742
Guys, let the hooker go.
She's not important.

1190
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,244
You don't need her.

1191
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:33,247
Harry, please just
let me handle this.

1192
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:34,448
Shut up!

1193
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:38,085
What were you doing there?

1194
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,587
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

1195
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,789
Talk again, I'll kill you!

1196
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:22,796
Harry.

1197
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:26,800
I wish I could say
it's nice to see you again.

1198
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,502
You know her?

1199
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,373
You know, this shade's
totally wrong for you.

1200
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,309
So who's your little friend?

1201
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:36,810
I'm helen tasker.

1202
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,312
Harry is my husband.

1203
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,980
And you are...?

1204
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,849
So now it's tasker,
not renquist.

1205
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:47,888
She's just some wacko
hooker I met at the bar.

1206
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,890
Harry, what's
the matter with you?

1207
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,892
Just tell her the truth.

1208
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:54,394
We are married,
and we have a daughter.

1209
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,363
I don't know what's she's on,

1210
01:28:56,431 --> 01:29:00,067
But cut her loose and let's
get down to business.

1211
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:03,070
Oh, yeah? Where did I
get this then?

1212
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,138
Where did I get this?

1213
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:13,080
Something before takeoff?

1214
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:17,684
That hurt, you b...

1215
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,591
She was telling the truth,
wasn't she, harry?

1216
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,793
She really doesn't know.

1217
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,264
How interesting.

1218
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:22,349
Bring them.

1219
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:31,892
Incredible, aren't they?

1220
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:36,630
I call them the four horsemen.

1221
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,331
They're warrior figures...

1222
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:43,703
From the persian empire
of darius I,

1223
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,939
Around 500 b.C.

1224
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,644
They're absolutely priceless.

1225
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:53,280
Pity.

1226
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,604
Wait! Wait!

1227
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:21,374
Open it.

1228
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,106
Do you know what this is?

1229
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,210
I know what this is.

1230
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:02,382
This is an espresso machine.

1231
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,785
No, no, no.

1232
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,922
It's a sno-cone maker.
That's what it is.

1233
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:15,295
Is it a water heater?

1234
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:20,500
Do you know why you've
been brought here?

1235
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:23,503
So that this man can
verify to the world

1236
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:27,207
The crimson jihad is
now a nuclear power.

1237
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,410
How can he do that?

1238
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:33,179
He's just a salesman,
for christ's sake.

1239
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:38,785
You're wrong about him.

1240
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,388
Or the last thing you will see

1241
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:44,291
Will be your blood
spraying across his face.

1242
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:54,534
It's a soviet murph-6 from
an ss-22 air launch vehicle.

1243
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:58,672
The warhead contains 14.5
kilograms of enriched uranium

1244
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,173
With a plutonium trigger.

1245
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,943
The nominal yield
is 30 kilotons.

1246
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,359
What can I say?

1247
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,061
I'm a spy.

1248
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,604
You bastard!

1249
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,706
You lying son of a bitch!

1250
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:33,873
Sorry, honey.

1251
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:35,475
Don't you call me honey!

1252
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:38,478
You don't ever get to
call me honey again!

1253
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,380
You understand me, you pig?

1254
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,683
I can verify that
they have the arming box

1255
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:46,186
And all the equipment necessary

1256
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:49,356
To detonate all four warheads.

1257
01:33:57,565 --> 01:34:01,301
You have killed our women
and our children,

1258
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:05,171
Bombed our cities from afar
like cowards,

1259
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,742
And you dare
to call us terrorists?

1260
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:12,245
Now the oppressed have
been given a mighty sword

1261
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,248
With which to strike back
at their enemies.

1262
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,851
Unless you, america,

1263
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:19,352
Pulls all military forces

1264
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,723
Out of the persian gulf area
immediately and forever,

1265
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:26,426
The crimson jihad
will rain fire

1266
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,629
On one major u.S. City
each week

1267
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,631
Until our demands are met.

1268
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:34,434
First, we will detonate
one weapon

1269
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,536
On this uninhabited island

1270
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:39,506
As a demonstration
of our power.

1271
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:41,274
And the crimson jihad's
willingness

1272
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,144
To be humanitarian.

1273
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,647
However, if these demands
are not met,

1274
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:50,150
The crimson jihad
will rain fire

1275
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:53,053
On one major american city
each week...

1276
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:58,124
Battery, aziz.

1277
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:07,267
Get another one, you moron.

1278
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:08,768
I think I have...

1279
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,438
In the truck.

1280
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,306
Jurias?

1281
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:14,307
What?

1282
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,476
Look at this.

1283
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:17,977
That's not mine.

1284
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,547
Nice transmitter.

1285
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,718
Miami tower, jetstar
6479 delta on final.

1286
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:27,754
We'll be on the ground
in 12 minutes.

1287
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:31,758
Tell the d.E.A. To be ready
to fly in 12 minutes.

1288
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,326
Signal's definitely
stopped moving.

1289
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,496
It's an island in the keys
out past marathon.

1290
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:42,435
We lost the signal.

1291
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:43,703
Shit!

1292
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:04,924
All right, everyone.
This is samir.

1293
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:10,296
For 50 points, see if you
can guess his specialty.

1294
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,298
Oral hygiene?

1295
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:14,300
Not exactly.

1296
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:15,802
Harry, what's going on?

1297
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,805
Samir's going to ask harry
a few questions.

1298
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:22,308
We're not even sure which
agency harry works for.

1299
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:24,811
Now, samir's
absolutely first-class.

1300
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:27,313
On the other hand,
we have harry here,

1301
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,815
Who's managed
to lie convincingly

1302
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:31,317
To the woman he loves
for 15 years.

1303
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:32,819
So it'll be interesting

1304
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:35,822
To see how long he can resist.

1305
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:38,291
This will help.

1306
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:41,494
You know, you should
swab that with alcohol.

1307
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:45,465
I might get an infection.

1308
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:49,536
I'll return when this
has taken effect.

1309
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,070
Then we'll talk.

1310
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:54,073
I'm looking forward to it.

1311
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,277
Now, why are you helping
these raving psychotics?

1312
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,280
Because they're very
well-funded raving psychotics,

1313
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:03,483
And I'm getting a lot of money.

1314
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:09,122
What, you think I care
about their cause?

1315
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:10,623
Or yours?

1316
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:12,926
Not at all.

1317
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,262
You're damaged goods, lady.

1318
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,104
Did you tell her
about us, harry?

1319
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:28,474
There is no "us,"
you psychopathic bitch.

1320
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,009
Oh, sure.

1321
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:32,812
You say that now.

1322
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,719
Thanks for everything, harry.

1323
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:42,021
Wasn't bad while it lasted.

1324
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:44,324
Let's go.

1325
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:46,459
You two stay here.

1326
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:54,033
There was nothing.

1327
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,237
I swear.

1328
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,161
What did they give you?

1329
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:28,835
Sodium amytal,
or some other truth agent.

1330
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,804
It makes you tell the truth?

1331
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:37,610
Is it working?

1332
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:41,948
Ask me a question that
I normally would lie to.

1333
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,485
Are we going to die?

1334
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:46,986
Yep.

1335
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:48,488
I'd say it's working.

1336
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,490
They'll shoot us in the head

1337
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:53,192
Or they'll torture us to death

1338
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,461
Or they'll
leave us here until...

1339
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:56,663
Harry!

1340
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:05,204
How long have you
been a spy, harry?

1341
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:11,244
17 years.

1342
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:25,191
Have you ever killed anyone?

1343
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:30,330
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1344
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:03,096
Is there anything
you want to tell me

1345
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:04,597
Before we start?

1346
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:06,099
Yeah.

1347
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:09,102
I'm going to kill you
pretty soon.

1348
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:10,636
I see.

1349
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:14,173
How, exactly?

1350
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:19,212
First, I'm going to use you
as a human shield,

1351
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,215
Then I'm going to kill
this guard over there

1352
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:25,585
With the patterson troika
on the table,

1353
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:28,921
And then I was thinking
about breaking your neck.

1354
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:33,726
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

1355
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:35,928
You know my handcuffs?

1356
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:39,265
I picked them.

1357
01:41:02,656 --> 01:41:04,290
Let's get out of here.

1358
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:55,541
Come on!

1359
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:37,016
Harry!

1360
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:39,986
Drop the gun!

1361
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:47,827
Honey...

1362
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,029
Next time, duck.

1363
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:56,569
Let's go.

1364
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:58,538
I married rambo.

1365
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:25,998
What are they doing?

1366
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,324
It is done.

1367
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:55,962
In 90 minutes...

1368
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:58,431
A ball of holy fire...

1369
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:00,600
Will light up the skies.

1370
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:06,105
To show to the world...

1371
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:08,874
That we speak the truth.

1372
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:26,759
We are set on our course.

1373
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:29,128
No force can stop us now.

1374
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:32,098
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1375
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:33,666
If we're on an island,

1376
01:44:33,734 --> 01:44:35,001
Why are they using trucks?

1377
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:37,503
We must be in the florida keys.

1378
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:39,005
The overseas highway

1379
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:40,840
Connects the islands
to the mainland.

1380
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:42,842
There's no borders, no customs.

1381
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:45,845
They can go anywhere
in the u.S.

1382
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:47,380
There's nothing to stop them.

1383
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:49,915
Just us.

1384
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:52,818
Here.

1385
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:53,819
Take this.

1386
01:44:53,887 --> 01:44:55,054
Oh, shit.

1387
01:46:21,007 --> 01:46:22,341
Shoot!

1388
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:54,033
Shit!

1389
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:32,805
Shit!

1390
01:49:09,643 --> 01:49:11,577
Yes!

1391
01:49:39,372 --> 01:49:40,973
Let's go.

1392
01:49:46,646 --> 01:49:50,215
Oh. My condolences
to the widow.

1393
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:09,268
We may need the hostage.

1394
01:50:11,638 --> 01:50:14,807
O.K., let's go, suzy homemaker.

1395
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:22,047
Hurry up!

1396
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:25,250
Just get her in the car.
Let's get going.

1397
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:38,157
I thought this looked
like your work.

1398
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:40,526
Let's go. I'll brief
you in the air.

1399
01:51:40,593 --> 01:51:41,994
You're welcome.

1400
01:51:42,062 --> 01:51:44,296
Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

1401
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:46,565
Let's go. Come on!

1402
01:52:08,588 --> 01:52:10,556
You tell that son of a bitch

1403
01:52:10,623 --> 01:52:12,558
This is a bright boy alert.

1404
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:14,693
I repeat. A bright boy alert.

1405
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,696
This is not a drill.
Do you understand that?

1406
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:19,198
All right. Hold on.

1407
01:52:19,265 --> 01:52:21,700
Put me through
to the white house.

1408
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:24,703
No, see, the minimum safe
distance is 12 miles.

1409
01:52:24,771 --> 01:52:27,206
Get the marine patrol
in right away.

1410
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:29,708
I want coast guard
and sheriff's department.

1411
01:52:29,776 --> 01:52:33,212
Anyone that cannot make that
distance, get 'em out by air.

1412
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:34,680
You've got exactly 34 minutes.

1413
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:38,350
I can get two marine corps
harriers here in 11 minutes.

1414
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:41,019
Get them. I'll brief
them on the way in.

1415
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:42,821
Send 'em in right away.

1416
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,701
Would you like one?

1417
01:53:02,909 --> 01:53:05,844
I want state police driving
through the streets

1418
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:07,346
On their damn loudspeakers.

1419
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:09,014
Hey, here they come.

1420
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:22,127
Lime 0-1's got a tally on three
trucks eastbound on the bridge.

1421
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:23,562
Roger, lime 0-1.

1422
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:24,930
You're clear to engage.

1423
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:26,431
Break loose.

1424
01:53:26,499 --> 01:53:28,100
In hot with guns.

1425
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:30,068
Let's get some.

1426
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,634
O.K., marines,
time to kick ass.

1427
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:38,637
Recommend using your mavericks
to take out the bridge.

1428
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,639
Roger that. Lime flight,
switch mavericks.

1429
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,574
<i>Two.</i>

1430
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:44,977
Missiles won't set off
those nukes, will they?

1431
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:48,180
Negative. That's a
negative, lime 0-1.

1432
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:51,617
<i>Fire.</i>

1433
01:55:13,339 --> 01:55:14,273
Bingo!

1434
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:15,374
Good shooting, marines.

1435
01:56:06,492 --> 01:56:08,393
I'll kill you!

1436
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:27,746
It's out of control.

1437
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,114
Somebody capped the driver.

1438
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:37,923
Bitch!

1439
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,454
Like one?

1440
01:57:09,522 --> 01:57:11,390
How about two?

1441
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,484
Get down to the limo!

1442
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:45,524
Come on. Take it down. Let's go!

1443
01:57:46,592 --> 01:57:47,526
Get down!

1444
01:57:47,593 --> 01:57:49,661
Take it down. All right.

1445
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,169
Harry?

1446
01:57:57,236 --> 01:57:58,637
Harry!

1447
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:01,006
The bridge is out!

1448
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:02,007
What?

1449
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:05,143
The bridge is out!

1450
01:58:05,211 --> 01:58:07,245
I can't hear you!

1451
01:58:07,313 --> 01:58:09,014
What?

1452
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,417
Oh, god!

1453
01:58:12,485 --> 01:58:13,919
The bridge is out!

1454
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:16,254
The bridge is out!

1455
01:58:16,322 --> 01:58:17,589
Harry!

1456
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:18,690
Harry, come on!

1457
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:19,724
Come on!

1458
01:58:19,792 --> 01:58:21,493
Speed up a little bit.

1459
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:23,662
Get down there.

1460
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:32,471
Come on! Hurry!

1461
01:58:32,538 --> 01:58:34,506
Hurry, harry!

1462
01:58:34,574 --> 01:58:36,208
Grab my hand!

1463
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:37,843
Come back! Harry!

1464
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,044
To the right.

1465
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,913
I can't reach! Get lower!

1466
01:58:43,282 --> 01:58:45,250
Lower! Harry!

1467
01:58:51,624 --> 01:58:54,092
Let's go! Hold on!

1468
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,627
Hold on really tight.

1469
01:58:57,797 --> 01:58:59,865
Harry!

1470
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:00,866
Harry!

1471
01:59:00,933 --> 01:59:02,901
Oh, come back!

1472
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:04,636
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

1473
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,908
Grab my hand! Do it!

1474
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:11,409
I can't reach!

1475
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:13,078
Come down!

1476
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,747
God, harry!

1477
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,149
Harry!

1478
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:22,954
Oh... Shit.

1479
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:26,158
Come on, baby.

1480
01:59:28,828 --> 01:59:32,764
Ooooaaaaahhhh!

1481
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:34,900
Hold on!

1482
01:59:34,967 --> 01:59:36,701
I got you!

1483
01:59:38,337 --> 01:59:39,771
Hold on tight!

1484
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:41,640
Harry!

1485
02:00:13,005 --> 02:00:16,007
O.K., let's get
this thing on the ground.

1486
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:27,819
All right, let's get these
aircraft on the ground, gentlemen.

1487
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:31,656
We got a nuclear bomb
going off in about one minute.

1488
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,695
Any minute now. Go, go, go.

1489
02:00:36,762 --> 02:00:39,397
Come here. Give me a bullhorn.

1490
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,368
All right, everybody,
it's show time.

1491
02:00:43,436 --> 02:00:46,304
Do not look at the flash.
Do not look at the flash!

1492
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:47,973
Get down over there.

1493
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,874
We should be safe here.

1494
02:00:56,849 --> 02:00:58,850
Tch, tch.

1495
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:01,219
This is the wrong finger.

1496
02:01:38,824 --> 02:01:39,891
Harry.

1497
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:41,760
Hey, harry! Come here!

1498
02:01:41,827 --> 02:01:42,994
Go to work.

1499
02:01:43,062 --> 02:01:43,895
O.K.

1500
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:45,597
Bye.

1501
02:01:45,665 --> 02:01:48,600
Listen, aziz's copter
landed about 20 minutes ago

1502
02:01:48,668 --> 02:01:51,136
Atop a high-rise
in downtown miami.

1503
02:01:51,203 --> 02:01:53,872
He rendezvoused with about
a dozen faction members,

1504
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:56,541
And they're holed up
on the 20th floor.

1505
02:01:56,609 --> 02:01:59,577
I got s.W.A.T there. The
cops cordoned off the area.

1506
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:02,147
Harry, they got a hostage.
It's dana.

1507
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:04,549
What do you mean? My dana?

1508
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:06,051
I'm real sorry, harry.

1509
02:02:06,118 --> 02:02:09,054
I guess he grabbed her in
the middle of the night.

1510
02:02:09,121 --> 02:02:10,789
We just found out.

1511
02:02:10,856 --> 02:02:13,291
But don't worry.
We'll get her back.

1512
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:16,127
I've already got a guy inside.
Harry, listen.

1513
02:02:16,195 --> 02:02:18,763
We're going to get her back.
Here we go.

1514
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:23,234
Excuse me, captain. I got
to borrow your plane.

1515
02:02:23,302 --> 02:02:24,536
Excuse me, sir?

1516
02:02:24,603 --> 02:02:27,572
You were cleared to give us
total cooperation, right?

1517
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,573
Yes, sir, but...

1518
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:30,475
That comes directly
from the president

1519
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:31,710
Of these United States.

1520
02:02:31,777 --> 02:02:34,446
Bu-but, sir, you have to
sign for this aircraft.

1521
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:37,682
I'll sign. You got a pen?
You take care of it.

1522
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:39,084
It has been 10 years

1523
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:41,886
Since you've been behind
the wheel of one of these?

1524
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:45,423
I break it, they can
take it out of my pay.

1525
02:02:45,491 --> 02:02:48,493
Harry, listen, we got
a guy in the inside.

1526
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:56,868
Got to move back,
everybody. Go!

1527
02:03:14,553 --> 02:03:17,822
All right, everybody,
it's going to be all right!

1528
02:03:19,024 --> 02:03:21,626
He's got hundreds of hours
in the harriers there.

1529
02:03:25,598 --> 02:03:27,031
He's a little rusty,

1530
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:29,768
But that's a trademark
tasker takeoff.

1531
02:03:29,835 --> 02:03:33,104
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget, really.

1532
02:03:36,308 --> 02:03:39,144
We might want to seek shelter!

1533
02:03:43,516 --> 02:03:44,716
Sorry.

1534
02:04:07,773 --> 02:04:10,175
<i>The streets are filled</i>
<i>with running people</i>

1535
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:13,044
<i>As police try to</i>
<i>evacuate the buildings.</i>

1536
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:15,680
<i>Appear to be shooting</i>
<i>wildly into the air.</i>

1537
02:04:15,748 --> 02:04:17,582
<i>These seem to be warning shots.</i>

1538
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:20,552
<i>So far, they have not</i>
<i>fired at us or police.</i>

1539
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:22,687
<i>This apparently</i>
<i>is the same group</i>

1540
02:04:22,755 --> 02:04:25,690
<i>Which just detonated a nuclear
bomb in the florida keys.</i>

1541
02:04:25,758 --> 02:04:27,692
<i>Crimson jihad will rain fire</i>

1542
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:30,195
<i>On one major</i>
<i>u. S. City each week</i>

1543
02:04:30,262 --> 02:04:32,197
<i>Until our demands are met.</i>

1544
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:34,699
<i>This tape was released</i>
<i>to the media</i>

1545
02:04:34,767 --> 02:04:36,701
<i>Just minutes</i>
<i>after the terrorists...</i>

1546
02:04:36,769 --> 02:04:39,204
I have to go to the bathroom.

1547
02:04:39,271 --> 02:04:42,207
<i>We'll repeat the tape</i>
<i>in just a few moments</i>

1548
02:04:42,274 --> 02:04:44,709
<i>Following this live
report from the scene.</i>

1549
02:04:47,246 --> 02:04:49,614
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

1550
02:04:49,682 --> 02:04:52,016
The video crew
you wanted is here!

1551
02:04:52,084 --> 02:04:54,085
Send them!

1552
02:04:55,054 --> 02:04:57,489
They're coming in.
They're unarmed.

1553
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:15,573
Come on. Let's go.

1554
02:05:15,641 --> 02:05:16,941
Go.

1555
02:05:22,982 --> 02:05:25,917
This is a communique
from crimson jihad.

1556
02:05:25,985 --> 02:05:28,953
You have seen a
demonstration of our power.

1557
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:32,490
Do not force us
to destroy this city,

1558
02:05:32,558 --> 02:05:34,692
And do not use
force against us.

1559
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:37,595
I... we... are all prepared to die.

1560
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:40,598
With one turn of that key...

1561
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:43,601
2 million of your people
will die...

1562
02:05:43,669 --> 02:05:44,602
Instantly!

1563
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:45,603
What key?

1564
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:47,605
That key!

1565
02:05:47,673 --> 02:05:49,774
Who's taken the key?

1566
02:05:55,948 --> 02:05:57,148
Shoot her!

1567
02:06:22,708 --> 02:06:24,876
Holy shit!

1568
02:06:56,241 --> 02:07:00,011
Unit 1 to unit 7.
Give me a situation report.

1569
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:01,646
1 to 7. Give me a sit rep.

1570
02:07:01,714 --> 02:07:03,748
Faisal, do you copy?

1571
02:07:03,816 --> 02:07:06,184
7 here. 21st floor secure.

1572
02:07:06,251 --> 02:07:09,187
About 12 faction members
on the 20th floor.

1573
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:10,588
No hostages there.

1574
02:07:10,656 --> 02:07:11,689
Where's dana?

1575
02:07:11,757 --> 02:07:13,958
She's on the roof.

1576
02:07:14,026 --> 02:07:15,493
Give me that address again.

1577
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,768
You shoot me, this'll fall!

1578
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:27,405
Stay where you are!

1579
02:07:27,473 --> 02:07:29,340
Stay where you are!

1580
02:07:32,711 --> 02:07:34,445
Give me the key!

1581
02:07:34,513 --> 02:07:36,714
I'll drop it, I swear!

1582
02:07:36,782 --> 02:07:37,915
No!

1583
02:07:40,285 --> 02:07:42,220
Give me the key.

1584
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:43,721
Come on, child.

1585
02:07:43,789 --> 02:07:46,357
You don't want to die, do you?

1586
02:07:48,093 --> 02:07:49,360
Give me the key...

1587
02:07:49,428 --> 02:07:52,630
And you won't get hurt.

1588
02:07:52,698 --> 02:07:54,866
I give you my word!

1589
02:07:54,933 --> 02:07:58,536
No way, you wacko!

1590
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:05,977
Help me!

1591
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,763
Please don't come any closer!

1592
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:03,134
Help me! Help me!

1593
02:09:03,202 --> 02:09:04,769
Somebody!

1594
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:08,806
Help me!

1595
02:09:08,874 --> 02:09:10,308
Help me, please!

1596
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:12,343
Help me, somebody!

1597
02:09:12,411 --> 02:09:14,078
Help!

1598
02:09:16,715 --> 02:09:18,516
Dana, jump down!

1599
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:19,851
Come on down. Jump down.

1600
02:09:19,918 --> 02:09:22,053
Dad?

1601
02:09:30,462 --> 02:09:32,163
Help me!

1602
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:34,499
Daddy!

1603
02:10:07,633 --> 02:10:10,001
Daddy! Come back!

1604
02:10:14,706 --> 02:10:16,974
Daddy, get me down!

1605
02:10:17,042 --> 02:10:18,442
Daddy!

1606
02:10:20,612 --> 02:10:22,146
Dana, jump!

1607
02:10:22,214 --> 02:10:25,349
Jump! Daddy will catch you!

1608
02:10:25,417 --> 02:10:26,484
Jump!

1609
02:10:26,552 --> 02:10:27,685
I can't!

1610
02:10:30,789 --> 02:10:33,257
Hold on. Hold on!

1611
02:10:42,768 --> 02:10:45,002
Daddy, don't you
let me fall, please!

1612
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,003
Daddy!

1613
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:47,305
Dana, I got you!

1614
02:10:47,372 --> 02:10:48,506
I'm slipping!

1615
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:52,910
No, dana!

1616
02:10:52,978 --> 02:10:55,112
Help me! I'm gonna fall!

1617
02:11:01,453 --> 02:11:03,221
Hold my hand!

1618
02:11:07,125 --> 02:11:09,460
Hold on tight, honey.

1619
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:11,062
Yaah!

1620
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:07,885
Daddy, he's behind you!

1621
02:12:07,953 --> 02:12:09,754
Take this plane down... now!

1622
02:12:09,821 --> 02:12:11,389
I'll kill her!

1623
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:14,358
Take it down... now!

1624
02:12:31,076 --> 02:12:33,177
My god, do something!

1625
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,053
You're fired.

1626
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:29,667
It's o.K.

1627
02:13:31,403 --> 02:13:32,336
Dana.

1628
02:13:32,404 --> 02:13:33,270
Honey.

1629
02:13:33,338 --> 02:13:35,139
It's over.

1630
02:13:44,182 --> 02:13:46,183
Hi, pumpkin.

1631
02:13:49,588 --> 02:13:51,622
<i>Just seconds after</i>
<i>the jet landed,</i>

1632
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:54,625
<i>The unidentified pilot</i>
<i>was escorted from the scene</i>

1633
02:13:54,693 --> 02:13:56,127
<i>By federal agents.</i>

1634

<i>Though it is unclear</i>
<i>which agency was responsible</i>

1635
02:13:59,197 --> 02:14:02,133
<i>For the operation which
ended the terrorist threat</i>

1636
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,201
<i>So dramatically</i>
<i>early this morning,</i>

1637
02:14:04,269 --> 02:14:05,870
<i>We've learned</i>
<i>from miami police...</i>

1638
02:14:07,205 --> 02:14:08,139
1...

1639
02:14:08,206 --> 02:14:09,607
No, wait. Stop.

1640
02:14:09,674 --> 02:14:11,142
Just begin. Now watch.

1641
02:14:11,209 --> 02:14:12,610
It's not just 1.

1642
02:14:12,677 --> 02:14:14,645
O.K., ready? Do it properly.

1643
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:15,646
1...

1644
02:14:15,714 --> 02:14:18,149
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,

1645
02:14:18,216 --> 02:14:20,151
I declare a thumb war.

1646
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:21,786
5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8,

1647
02:14:21,853 --> 02:14:23,654
Try to keep
your thumb straight.

1648
02:14:23,722 --> 02:14:25,423
Stop it!

1649
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:26,690
You don't... wait!

1650
02:14:26,758 --> 02:14:28,459
I got you.

1651
02:14:28,527 --> 02:14:30,494
Just listen.
Listen to the rules.

1652
02:14:30,562 --> 02:14:31,495
1, 2...

1653
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:34,632
No, just start over.

1654
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:36,634
Hello?

1655
02:14:39,738 --> 02:14:41,605
We're on.

1656
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:45,342
Yes? Go ahead.

1657
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:14,705
Colonel, how nice
to see you again.

1658
02:15:14,773 --> 02:15:16,173
Good evening.

1659
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:18,909
Who's that?

1660
02:15:28,286 --> 02:15:29,720
What's the scoop, team?

1661
02:15:29,788 --> 02:15:31,155
You see your contact yet?

1662
02:15:31,223 --> 02:15:33,023
Haven't seen him yet.

1663
02:15:34,526 --> 02:15:37,528
But I see somebody I'd
like to say hello to.

1664
02:15:37,596 --> 02:15:39,530
Let me pour you more champagne.

1665
02:15:39,598 --> 02:15:42,233
I got to keep up
the waiter bit.

1666
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,734
These stakeouts can be tricky.

1667
02:15:43,802 --> 02:15:46,237
You never know when
things might explode

1668
02:15:46,304 --> 02:15:48,239
Into a life or death situation.

1669
02:15:48,306 --> 02:15:51,242
If it gets rough, stay
low until it's over,

1670
02:15:51,309 --> 02:15:52,743
And I'll contact you later.

1671
02:15:52,811 --> 02:15:53,744
Maybe you should...

1672
02:15:53,812 --> 02:15:55,813
So, we meet again, carlos.

1673
02:15:55,881 --> 02:15:57,615
Yuh!

1674
02:15:58,917 --> 02:16:01,719
Honey, I'm just going to
do him right here, o.K.?

1675
02:16:01,786 --> 02:16:03,787
Go for it.

1676
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:06,891
Oh, god.

1677
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:15,199
Fear is not an option.

1678
02:16:26,878 --> 02:16:28,879
Dance?

1679
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,284
Tango. Oh, no.

1680
02:16:33,351 --> 02:16:34,718
Oh, shit. Here we go.

1681
02:16:50,602 --> 02:16:51,869
Harry, helen...

1682
02:16:51,937 --> 02:16:53,037
Guys?

1683
02:16:53,104 --> 02:16:56,040
Come on, now. Let's
not get distracted.

1684
02:16:56,107 --> 02:16:57,741
Get to work.

1685
02:17:03,114 --> 02:17:05,549
All right, guys. Come on.

1686
02:17:05,617 --> 02:17:07,551
Getting pretty
serious in there.

1687
02:17:07,619 --> 02:17:10,254
I'd be serious
if I was in there.

1688
02:17:12,157 --> 02:17:13,691
Don't ignore me, harry.

1689
02:17:13,758 --> 02:17:15,426
That's rude.

1690
02:17:17,629 --> 02:17:19,930
All right, guys. Come on.

1691
02:17:23,134 --> 02:17:25,069
National security,
guys. Come on.

1692
02:17:25,136 --> 02:17:26,770
Life or death.

1693
02:17:29,641 --> 02:17:31,008
Harry.

1694
02:17:32,143 --> 02:17:33,577
Harry.

1695
02:17:33,645 --> 02:17:34,578
Helen?

1696
02:17:34,646 --> 02:17:37,581
Helen, I was always
on your side.

1697
02:17:37,649 --> 02:17:40,284
I was always there
for you, helen.

1698
02:18:18,523 --> 02:18:21,458
You know what? I'm sick
of being in the van.

1699
02:18:21,526 --> 02:18:24,395
You guys are going to be
in the van next time.

1700
02:18:24,462 --> 02:18:27,197
I been in the van
for 15 years, harry.
