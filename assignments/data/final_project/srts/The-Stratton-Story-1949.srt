1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,204
Attaboy! Come on, Monty.

3
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,052
Strike one.

4
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:27,972
Strike two.

5
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,731
Fire away, Monty.

6
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:36,244
Strike three. You're out!

7
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,568
- Pretty mean ball, Monty.
- Thanks, Mr. Higgins.

8
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,291
Well, that's it for this year.
See you next season?

9
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,125
Sure, I'll be here. So long.

10
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,413
- Nice game you pitched today, son.
- Thank you, mister.

11
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:54,643
You ever think of
pitching regular professional baseball?

12
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,689
I guess that's just about all
I ever do think about.

13
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:58,764
Well, what are you wasting your time
around here for?

14
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,526
Wasting my time?
I get $3 every time I pitch a game.

15
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,173
Yeah. Look, son, I think you and I
ought to have a little talk.

16
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,721
Well, I'd like to talk to you, mister,
but I gotta get going.

17
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,007
- Where are you heading?
- Home.

18
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:11,085
- Okay if I trot along?
- Sure, sure, if you like.

19
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,847
Say, boy, where is your home anyway?

20
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,446
It's about four miles up this road.

21
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,445
Yeah, well, can't we hitch a ride
or something?

22
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,127
No. It might be an hour
before a car comes along here.

23
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,692
Well, I can wait.

24
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:35,762
Happy.

25
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,330
Hi, Ma, how's my girl?

26
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,411
- You've been playing ball again?
- Sure have. Only gave them four hits.

27
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:45,371
Fine way for the man of the family
to be spending his time.

28
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:48,411
I had time to kill today.
Did all the chores before I left.

29
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,802
I still got time to pick a little cotton.

30
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:54,169
Hey, you got a nice profit in a day.

31
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,331
How do you do, madam?

32
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:20,165
- I guess you must be Monty's ma.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:23,689
- I'm Barney Wile. Monty around?
- He's out picking cotton.

34
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,445
You mean after sprinting 10 miles
and pitching nine innings

35
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,171
- he's picking cotton?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,528
He must want to play baseball awful bad.

37
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,002
All he thinks about is throwing a ball.

38
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,606
Well, I don't wonder, madam.

39
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,083
He can transform a baseball
into a streak of gray lightning

40
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,165
and curve it in
like it was weaving through traffic.

41
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:45,086
I'd say he's got a great future in baseball.

42
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,321
- You a baseball man?
- Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,252
Then I'd say he's got a better future
on the farm.

44
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,125
Hey, hey, come here!

45
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,407
Oh, hi. What, did you get a lift?

46
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:03,972
Yeah. Part way.

47
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,802
That's quite a jaunt. I'm all fagged out.

48
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,011
Guess you're not in very good shape, huh?

49
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:13,085
Well, I haven't been in training
for a marathon.

50
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,841
You walk up there and back
every time you pitch?

51
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,002
Yeah.

52
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,688
See, the walk up
sort of gets my muscles nice and loose,

53
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:23,412
and the walk back
keeps them from tightening up.

54
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,644
- Works out pretty good.
- Yeah, I never thought of that.

55
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,564
But about your pitching,
like I was saying,

56
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:30,644
you've got a nice easy motion.

57
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,329
I guess you didn't walk
all the way out here

58
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,005
just to tell me you like the way I throw.

59
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,244
Of course, you're a little ragged yet.
You need some smoothing out.

60
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,325
But I don't think
that'll give us much trouble.

61
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:43,641
Ever play any ball?

62
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,167
- I've had my innings.
- Where?

63
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,212
Oh, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston.
I've been around.

64
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,369
- What, the big leagues?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,808
- What'd you play?
- Behind the bat.

66
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:59,488
- You were catcher, huh?
- Oh, I caught all the big fellows.

67
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,527
- Well, well...
- Oh, I know, I...

68
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,451
I was a fool.

69
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,930
A grand slam, double-barreled fool.

70
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:11,166
Breaking training and hitting the bottle,

71
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,289
you don't stay up there very long.

72
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,087
And by the time I learned my lesson,
I was out,

73
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,482
and it isn't so easy to get back in.

74
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:22,808
But when I saw you,
I was seeing a dream come true,

75
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:26,801
my dream of finding a hot prospect
and coming back into baseball.

76
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,322
Well, I sure would like to work with you.

77
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,444
It's still light. Do you wanna catch a few?

78
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:37,048
Maybe you haven't had enough exercise
for one day, but I have.

79
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:41,409
But we might be able
to work out tomorrow.

80
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:43,085
What, are you staying around here?

81
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,482
Well, not exactly.

82
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,610
- Oh, just passing through?
- Yeah, something like that.

83
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,763
I'm on my way to California.

84
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,165
Course, it doesn't have to be California.

85
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,766
I could... I might...

86
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,764
I could... I could help...

87
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,403
You ever do any farm work?

88
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:06,043
Oh, I've, I...

89
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,885
You look kind of flabby.

90
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:11,329
Oh, son, I've got muscles
I haven't even used yet.

91
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,686
- You meet my mother?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,082
- I struck out.
- That figured.

93
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,368
Well,

94
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,721
I guess this is what us baseball men
would call a squeeze play.

95
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,008
Yeah.

96
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,961
May I offer my compliments,
Mrs. Stratton.

97
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,283
This was a meal fit for kings.

98
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:40,452
And this pie.
Nothing like the pie Mother used to make.

99
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:41,892
Is that so?

100
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:45,171
- My mother couldn't boil water.
- You don't say.

101
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,007
Mr. Wile here, he's sort of looking around
for something to do.

102
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:54,051
I thought maybe he could
sort of hole up here for the winter

103
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,725
and help out around the place.

104
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,771
You know as well as I do, Monty,
we can't afford no hired hand.

105
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:03,131
Oh, well, he wouldn't expect any pay.
Just room and keep.

106
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:06,364
I didn't realize you were so overworked
you needed help.

107
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,092
Oh, no, it's not that, Ma.

108
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:13,451
It's just that a lot of things need doing
Mr. Wile could be mighty handy with.

109
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,933
There's fixing that fence down
at the pig pen,

110
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:19,892
and fixing the roof on the chicken coop,

111
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:23,007
pulling those stumps down by the creek.

112
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,450
Ma, we'd get this place in real fine shape.

113
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:29,411
When your papa died,
he left this place to you, Monty.

114
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,529
You're the man of the house.

115
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:34,571
If you want Mr. Wile around,
I ain't gonna raise a fuss.

116
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:37,486
You ought to be old enough
to know what you're doing.

117
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,162
Well,

118
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:50,692
say, you know,
somehow I feel sort of tired.

119
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,605
I can't imagine why.

120
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,729
What do you say we turn in, Barney?

121
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,969
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night.

122
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,567
Good night, ma'am, and thank you.

123
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,683
This farm's all Monty's got, Mr. Wile,
but it's worth something.

124
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,162
The land always is, if you look after it.

125
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,847
But you and Monty,
you go ahead and talk baseball,

126
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,323
and maybe someday
he'll do as good as you did.

127
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:23,002
Now, wait a minute, son. Wait a minute.

128
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:24,924
When you swing back,

129
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:27,883
you pivot around like this.

130
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,569
But don't try to strike out every batter.

131
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,247
Use your control
and let your fielders help you.

132
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:40,130
And as you come forward, use your body.

133
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,212
Follow through.

134
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:46,051
I guess in a spot like that
the best pitch would be...

135
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,524
Nice and easy.
Now follow through, nice and easy.

136
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,882
Oh, that's it, boy. That's beautiful.

137
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,562
There.

138
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,407
And always cover first base
when the ball's hit deep.

139
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:05,088
Nice pitch, boy, nice pitch.

140
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,367
Now let me look at the curve ball.

141
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,483
Oh, good hook. Good hook!

142
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,643
Now let me see the big one.

143
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,369
Well, that's it for the day.

144
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,010
Get your coat on, son.
Keep that arm warm.

145
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,684
Well, you're ready.

146
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,807
- You're joking.
- No, I've taught you all I know.

147
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,168
The rest you gotta find out for yourself.

148
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:48,084
Now we gotta get you some action.

149
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:49,891
Yeah, well, not very much action
around here.

150
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,770
No, but there is in California.

151
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,411
Jimmy Dykes and the White Sox

152
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,688
are starting their spring training there
next week.

153
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,445
- Chicago White Sox?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,889
Jimmy Dykes is an old friend of mine.
I've known him for 20 years.

155
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,851
All I have to do is say the word
and he'll give you a tryout.

156
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,412
- He will?
- Sure.

157
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,969
- But out in California?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:16,363
Looks like we've got
another squeeze play coming up.

159
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,522
Yeah.

160
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,609
Barney and I are sort of thinking
about taking a little trip out to California.

161
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:27,808
Is that so?

162
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:31,124
- What baseball team's over there?
- It's the White Sox. They...

163
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:33,488
How'd you know that?

164
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,962
I didn't reckon you'd be going over there
for anything important.

165
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:39,170
- But this is important, ma'am.
- Worth giving up the farm for?

166
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:42,768
Oh, if they take him on,
the least he'll get is $300 a month.

167
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,052
That's a powerful lot of money
for just throwing a ball.

168
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,806
And Monty won't have to give up the farm
while he's trying out.

169
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:50,008
I talked to Cousin Earnie.

170
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,845
He said he'd be glad
to take care of it for me.

171
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,401
That $300 a month,
that'll buy a lot of stuff we need.

172
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:57,371
What makes you so sure
they'll give you a tryout?

173
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:59,284
They try just anybody?

174
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,452
Well, they sure don't.

175
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:04,093
Why, Barney and Jimmy Dykes
are old friends.

176
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,288
- Who?
- Jimmy Dykes.

177
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:06,886
He's the manager of the ball team.

178
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,043
That way, I'll get a chance for sure.

179
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,169
The land's the only place
where you're sure.

180
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,926
Well, lots of people
don't live on farms, ma'am.

181
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,163
Lots of people don't eat regular, too.

182
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:26,682
You...

183
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,244
You made up your mind, ain't you, son?

184
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,893
I've just gotta give it a try, Mother.

185
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,369
How you fellas figuring on getting along?

186
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:42,172
Oh, don't worry. We'll make out all right,
won't we, Barney?

187
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:45,131
Well, of course, they don't pay you
while you're trying out.

188
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,522
But that won't be any problem
or anything.

189
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:57,643
I don't think you ought
to discourage contributions, son.

190
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,372
- Contributions? We're lucky to be going.
- Well...

191
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,046
Here's the...

192
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,252
Here's $5 I saved from selling that calf.

193
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:09,532
- It's all you get.
- Thank you, Mother.

194
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:12,969
And don't you worry, Mrs. Stratton,
I'll take good care of him.

195
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,850
Let him take care of himself.

196
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,006
Good night, Son.

197
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,130
You've got one big leaguer
in the family already.

198
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:11,165
Get in there with the pitchers
and warm up your arm.

199
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:12,402
Shouldn't we be meeting Mr. Dykes?

200
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:15,724
Oh, you let me worry about that, will you?
Go ahead. Go ahead.

201
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,243
- Is it okay?
- Sure. Go ahead.

202
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,002
Where did the little man
get all that speed?

203
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,563
- Just get here?
- Yes, sir. My name's Stratton.

204
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:40,883
- Lyons is mine.
- Well, I'm glad to know you, Mr. Lyons.

205
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,201
How are you?

206
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:45,444
Don't mind Eddie. He's caught
too many foul tips with his head.

207
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:46,852
Is that right?

208
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,841
That's the way to play it.

209
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,730
Come on now, Luke. Wrist out in front.

210
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,281
Make that bat go around in there.
Come on now.

211
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:54,886
Attaboy.

212
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,445
Come on, now. Come on, boy.

213
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:01,451
Red, who's that kid down there
in the leather jacket?

214
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,568
I don't know.

215
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,803
The best right-hand prospect
since Christy Mathewson.

216
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:07,612
Oh, no! Not Barney Wile again.

217
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:10,526
Jimmy, my boy,
haven't seen you in some time.

218
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,331
- Not since last spring.
- That's right.

219
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,369
- Did you bring that kid out here?
- You bet I did.

220
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,489
- I want you to have first crack at him.
- Thanks.

221
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,724
He's got everything.
I've been working with him all winter long.

222
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:20,962
Who supplied the hooch?

223
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,205
Oh, no, no, Jimmy, I haven't had a drop
since I first saw the boy.

224
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:30,806
Listen, son, Barney's probably filled
your head with a lot of cockeyed ideas.

225
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:33,566
But I can't waste time
with every kid he digs up.

226
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,403
- What, are you... You Mr. Dykes?
- That's right.

227
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,245
Oh, Jimmy, you can't do this.

228
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,723
Barney, how many times have I told you
not to bother me this way?

229
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,962
I'm sorry I busted in on you, mister.

230
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,604
Oh, that boy's hitched
and walked miles to get here, Jimmy.

231
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,810
- Pretty good control for a young pitcher.
- Watch him throw a couple.

232
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,087
Monty.

233
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,289
Monty, don't go running away like this.

234
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,648
- Country! Country!
- Monty, he means you.

235
00:15:58,733 --> 00:15:59,927
Heads up!

236
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,921
Eddie, let me have that glove, will you?

237
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,644
Come on, Country. Throw me a couple.

238
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,008
Yeah, come on, Monty, get your coat off.

239
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,765
Burn them in, boy.

240
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,482
My, my.

241
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,484
Some stuff, eh, Jimmy?

242
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,727
Come on, you.

243
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,364
He really breaks them off, doesn't he?

244
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,284
Now let's have your fastball.

245
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:48,009
- Nice play, Walt.
- Down the line.

246
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,688
Maybe you better work out awhile.

247
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,688
Keep him around. He may have something.

248
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:05,242
- But for Pete's sake, get him a haircut.
- Sure, Jimmy, sure.

249
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:11,290
- In five minutes.
- Okay.

250
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,364
- You get four for one?
- That's all there is to it, buddy.

251
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,573
Hey, Luke.
How would you like a date for tonight?

252
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:22,564
Fine. I'll go ask my wife if it's okay.

253
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,690
But I'm in a spot. My date for tonight
has some hick gal from Omaha with her

254
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,650
and I can't even afford one gal,
let alone two.

255
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,848
How about loaning me $10?

256
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,572
Shove off, rookie,
you're in me for $20 already.

257
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:32,882
Yeah.

258
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,845
It's no dice, baby.
But can't you get rid of her?

259
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,332
No, it's too late.

260
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,242
This is a better machine than yours.

261
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,288
Baby, everything's gonna be all right.

262
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,290
Say, Country, is that the only suit you got?

263
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,604
I know, I know. And I told you
I didn't think this was such a good idea.

264
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:13,002
Oh, forget it. Here they come now.

265
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:21,328
- Is that mine?
- No, mine. Not bad, huh?

266
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,691
Oh, that's mine.

267
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,649
You always hit the jackpot?

268
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,366
Oh, there's Eddie.

269
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:31,881
Hi, Dot.

270
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,368
Oh, no.

271
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:58,128
Eddie's a pretty fast stepper, isn't he?

272
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:01,845
He's a fast worker, too.

273
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:06,086
I'm glad I insisted
that Dot bring you along tonight.

274
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,731
Thank you.

275
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,450
Dancing with you
is like dancing on a cloud.

276
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,569
- Well, share it around.
- That's right, Eddie.

277
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,371
On your feet, Dottie.

278
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,808
I'm sorry I can't ask you to dance,
but I don't know how.

279
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,645
Oh, that's all right.

280
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:39,246
Oh, I guess baseball's about all I know.

281
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,370
Well, that's something.

282
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,885
Seen us work out yet?

283
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:48,048
- Us? Who's us?
- The Chicago White Sox.

284
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:54,005
No. No, I guess
that's the one thing I've missed.

285
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,683
Well, the team looks good.
It looks awful good.

286
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:58,411
We have a nice, tight infield.

287
00:20:58,493 --> 00:20:59,892
Oh, that's nice.

288
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,883
I'll bet you're pretty good yourself.

289
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,533
Well, I don't know. I'm still trying out.

290
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:10,646
You're a big fella.
I'll bet you can hit a baseball pretty far.

291
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,323
Well, I'm not expected to hit very much.
You see, I'm a pitcher.

292
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:17,848
Well, I bet you can pitch far.

293
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:24,412
No, you don't get the idea.
You see, I just have to pitch about 60 feet.

294
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,166
All right, then I'll bet you can pitch fast.

295
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:31,410
Oh, well, sometimes you have to rear back
and sort of let her go fast,

296
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,610
and at other times
you just sort of whip it.

297
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,485
Like that, curve her in,

298
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:40,043
or in some spots
you just sort of float her in.

299
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,601
That's what you call change of pace.
You know, you sort of...

300
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:46,163
Speaking of change of pace,
it probably isn't any of my business,

301
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:49,802
but would you mind telling me
what that noise is?

302
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:52,686
- What? The what?
- Jingling noise.

303
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:58,652
Look at that.

304
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,322
I was gonna get a haircut over at the hotel
and I noticed those machines in the lobby.

305
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:07,290
I never did see them before.

306
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:11,441
I sort of wondered about them,
and before I knew it I popped a quarter in

307
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,001
and a whole lot of fruit
started spinning around like...

308
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:17,563
And then it sort of slid to a stop
and nothing happened.

309
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,486
Well, before I knew it,
I popped in another quarter

310
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:24,129
and that was the last of the haircut.

311
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,329
I was down to my last quarter.

312
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,765
Well, I figured I might as well be broke
as the way I was,

313
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,684
so in went the last quarter.

314
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:34,731
Fruit took off again
and slowed up and stopped.

315
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,926
All of a sudden, the quarters
started popping out of that thing

316
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:40,004
like hens through a busted fence.

317
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,651
Went and got a haircut.

318
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:48,251
Well, if you don't make it in baseball,
you've a pretty good future in gambling.

319
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,688
- No, I'm through gambling.
- Why?

320
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:54,488
Well, I found out what it's like to lose
and what it's like to win.

321
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,052
Why keep at it?

322
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,367
Yes, sir.

323
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:12,207
We're gonna make a big night of it.

324
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:15,212
There's a lot of spots in California
for having a good time,

325
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,284
and, Ethel,
I'm gonna show them all to you.

326
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:19,648
Oh, I wouldn't think
of putting you to all that trouble.

327
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,883
Trouble? No trouble at all.

328
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,562
Showing you a good time
will be a pleasure.

329
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,644
Now, there's a little place up at Malibu.

330
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,770
Oh, soft music, dancing under the stars.

331
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:32,243
But of course,
if you go for hot music, now,

332
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,893
there's an outfit in Hollywood
that really beats it out.

333
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:36,770
Baby, when I get through
showing you this town,

334
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,969
you won't ever wanna go back to Omaha.

335
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:40,372
We'll make the rounds.

336
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:43,286
And what we don't hit tonight,
we'll hit tomorrow night.

337
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:44,601
Just leave it to me.

338
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:47,765
Your Uncle Eddie's gonna
take care of everything.

339
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,332
Have fun, I always say.

340
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:52,405
Now, what's the use of living
if you don't have a good time?

341
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:54,165
You only live once.

342
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,284
And you can't take it with you.

343
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:57,722
- And I'm not...
- Let's go.

344
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,246
- Where?
- Home.

345
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,687
Why, Country? The night's young.

346
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,684
- Lots of spots we haven't hit yet.
- Yeah. You hit them.

347
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:06,163
We're heading home.
I'm very glad to have met you. Good night.

348
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:20,927
Did it occur to you that I might have
wanted to go on somewhere with them?

349
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,647
Well, what you wanted
wasn't so important.

350
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,844
- Oh, it wasn't?
- No, no.

351
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,050
What was important
was the way Eddie was treating Dot.

352
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,092
If he was trying to shine up to you,
he shouldn't have done it in front of her.

353
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:38,801
- Or in front of you.
- No. Oh, no, no. That's not what I mean.

354
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:43,131
Look, I'm sorry about tonight.

355
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,647
You sort of got stuck with me, didn't you?

356
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,723
- Oh, that's silly.
- No, it isn't.

357
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:54,090
I just never had much experience
with girls.

358
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,046
What's so funny?

359
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:10,121
- And you got stuck with the check.
- It was worth it to get out of there.

360
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:13,926
Here we are.

361
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:30,250
- Well, good night.
- Good night, Monty.

362
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,927
Monty, I'm sorry about tonight.

363
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,969
I behaved very badly.

364
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:39,522
But I haven't had too much experience
myself, with ballplayers.

365
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:43,367
Well, I'm not exactly a ballplayer yet.
I still have to make the team.

366
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:45,212
You'll make it.

367
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,968
Well, how do you know? You said
you didn't know anything about baseball.

368
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,646
I could learn.

369
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,163
When do you go home to Omaha?

370
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,012
A while yet.

371
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,330
- Time for me to come and call on you?
- Should be.

372
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:08,122
- Good night, Ethel.
- Good night, Monty.

373
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:14,927
Hey, bud!

374
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:19,171
Hey, you!
Where do you think you're heading?

375
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,810
- How's that?
- I said, where do you think you're heading?

376
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:26,285
Man, I sure don't know.

377
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:01,161
Monty, you sure looked good there today.

378
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,813
Boy, that old arm was
really whipping today, wasn't it?

379
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:07,442
Team's moving east tomorrow, son.
We're gonna take you with us.

380
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,730
When you get dressed, come in the office
and we'll sign you to a contract.

381
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,486
Barney, did you hear that?

382
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,052
What are you gonna do, Barney?

383
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,604
Well, if it's all right with you,
I sure would like to tag along with the boy.

384
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:22,048
- Can't have people just tagging along.
- Well, look, Mr. Dykes...

385
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,089
Can't have people hanging around
doing nothing.

386
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:25,731
Well, Jimmy, I'll do anything.

387
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:29,249
What could you do?
Offhand, I can't think of anything.

388
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,643
Unless you'd like
to coach the young pitchers.

389
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,168
Hi.

390
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,164
- Hello, Monty.
- Hello, Mr. Dykes.

391
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:12,371
We didn't have too much time
at that, did we?

392
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,604
- Enough to make me wish it was more.
- Maybe there will be.

393
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,002
What, you got any doubts about it?

394
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:23,323
California turned out much better
than I thought it was gonna.

395
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:27,208
Yes, it was nice,
your making the team, wasn't it?

396
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:30,171
Well, that's not what I mean,
and you know it.

397
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:32,248
I know, Monty.

398
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,527
All aboard!

399
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:36,850
- Goodbye, Ethel. Let's get going, boy.
- All right.

400
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:40,451
- You will write, won't you?
- Well, I don't know.

401
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:43,001
Well, how will I know you're thinking
about me if you don't write?

402
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,402
Well, I'll never be able
to write down what I'm thinking.

403
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:47,131
I'm not much of a letter writer.

404
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,010
All aboard! All aboard!

405
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,010
Hey, aren't you coming with us?

406
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:05,932
Well, goodbye.

407
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,007
Goodbye.

408
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:47,566
Yeah.
Now, this fellow likes an outside pitch.

409
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,689
You gotta keep them inside on him.

410
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,126
Yeah, now this fella, he murders curves.

411
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,767
You've gotta power them at him
high and fast.

412
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,209
Hey now, with a man on first,

413
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:13,524
the batter will try to hit it
behind the runner into right field.

414
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,683
So you gotta pitch it inside to him.

415
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,603
That's a good thing to know
if I ever get a chance to use it.

416
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:23,045
Don't rush it, son.
You get an education this way.

417
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:24,931
Good view of the game.

418
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:28,085
- I ought to be paying for this seat.
- Easy, boy.

419
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:41,245
Those Yankees are murder.

420
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,202
Time!

421
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:52,842
Time!

422
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:02,525
- Pretty rough, huh?
- A guy can get killed out there.

423
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:06,368
What a gang. Dickey, DiMaggio, Gehrig.

424
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,888
You can't power it past them, kid.

425
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,884
If you're gonna get by,
you gotta outthink them,

426
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:13,441
cross them up,
give them what they don't expect.

427
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:16,001
I guess what they don't expect is me.

428
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,852
They don't have to worry about me
outthinking them from here.

429
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:21,811
Boy, every time I get paid,
I feel like I was stealing.

430
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,087
Play ball!

431
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:30,847
Country!

432
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:33,361
Warm up.

433
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,764
What I've been waiting for. Let's go.

434
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:41,083
Oh, not at a time like this.

435
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:45,365
Those Yankees have sent
more pitchers to Omaha...

436
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:53,691
<i>Now pitching for Chicago,</i>
<i>number 25, Monty Stratton</i>.

437
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,650
Well, Country,
you finally got off the bench.

438
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,293
<i>Now batting for New York, Bill Dickey</i>.

439
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,244
I guess I didn't know when I was well off.

440
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,006
Just another ballplayer.
You gotta face them all.

441
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,807
Play ball.

442
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,683
Come on, rookie, let me see a nice one.

443
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:37,447
Omaha.

444
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:50,008
Hi.

445
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:54,484
- Hi!
- Hello, darling.

446
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,643
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

447
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,371
What are you doing here?
I thought you were...

448
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:01,603
I know, I know, I know.
Now come on, sit down.

449
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,763
I want to have a little talk with you.
I got a problem.

450
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,684
But you said in your letter
you might pitch this week.

451
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,048
I did, yeah.
That's what I want to talk to you about.

452
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,089
- What happened?
- Well, everything.

453
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,971
Honey, you know,
when I left you in California,

454
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:14,406
- I sort of figured...
- What was the score?

455
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,247
That's not important. They murdered me.
The thing that's bothering me is that...

456
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,403
Well, they can't expect you
to win every game.

457
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:23,212
Honey, they don't expect me
to win any games.

458
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,968
They shipped me down here to Omaha.
Said I needed more experience.

459
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,567
Well, they don't put you in jail
for playing in Omaha.

460
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,723
I know, I know.
There's nothing wrong with Omaha,

461
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:34,646
but it's just that
I might not even make it here.

462
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:37,088
I don't know. We're going out on the road
for a couple of weeks.

463
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,289
First thing I know, I'll be back on the farm.

464
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:42,365
- Don't you like the farm?
- Sure, sure. It's all right.

465
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,522
- But it...
- Well, then?

466
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:46,923
Well, it's just that
things are different now, that's all.

467
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,285
Now there's you.

468
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,125
Am I your problem?

469
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:56,922
- Well...
- Would it help any if I said I love you?

470
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,005
That's the problem.

471
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:01,367
Oh, I see.

472
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,563
Oh, no, you don't see, Ethel. I...

473
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:08,125
No matter what I was doing,
I kept thinking about you.

474
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:12,206
And every time I'd see something exciting
that I'd never seen before,

475
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,090
I kept wishing you were there
to see it with me.

476
00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:17,290
I don't know.
If that's love, man, I really got it.

477
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:21,288
Oh, you had me worried.

478
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:24,968
Oh, but I had all sorts of plans for us,
honey, going up in the big leagues and all.

479
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:26,452
Now I don't know where I'm headed.

480
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:29,127
It doesn't matter to me
whether you're in the big leagues or...

481
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:31,363
But a man's gotta know where he's going.

482
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,445
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Well, just give me a chance to make it.

483
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,445
I just wanna make sure
that I'm not gonna let you down.

484
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:40,082
All right, Monty, if that's what you want.

485
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,085
You're what I want.

486
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:48,326
Oh, I love you, Monty.
You could never let me down.

487
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:52,724
- Monty?
- Yes, dear?

488
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,565
What was the score?

489
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,805
16-0.

490
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:03,487
Sixteen?

491
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,012
- To nothing?
- Nothing.

492
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:13,007
Honey, do you know
there's a tailor in Chicago

493
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,482
that gives a suit of clothes away
to every ballplayer

494
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,848
that hits the scoreboard in center field?

495
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,164
As of yesterday, the New York Yankees
are the best-dressed team in baseball.

496
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,452
Ted, warm up.

497
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:39,727
Stratton won another game yesterday.

498
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:46,289
Yes, sir. That makes six in a row now.

499
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,483
Three of them were shutouts, too.

500
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:53,049
Gave them only two hits yesterday.

501
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:56,364
That's what we sent him down there for,
to get some seasoning.

502
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:59,208
Ought to be mighty tasty by now.

503
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:27,932
Excuse me.

504
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,049
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

505
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,089
- Lose something, sir?
- No, no.

506
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:50,732
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

507
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,532
- What are you looking for, sir?
- I'm not looking...

508
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,124
I'm looking for a girl by the name of...

509
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,362
Ethel!

510
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,850
- Quiet, will you?
- Monty.

511
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:04,568
My feet.

512
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,689
Darling, what... I'm sorry.
What are you doing out here?

513
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:07,762
Honey, I got a problem.

514
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,366
Will you take your problem
somewhere else?

515
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:10,966
Yes, sir. Come on.

516
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,567
- Problem? Again?
- Yeah.

517
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,805
- Let's sit down here.
- All right.

518
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:21,287
I have to catch the 11:00 train for Chicago.
The White Sox have recalled me.

519
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,285
Oh, then everything's worked out fine.
What's your problem?

520
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,967
I can't figure out what to give you
for your birthday next week.

521
00:37:27,053 --> 00:37:29,487
- My birthday?
- I've looked at a whole lot of stuff,

522
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:31,882
but I just can't seem to be able
to find the right thing.

523
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,850
Oh, Monty, we don't want
to talk about that here.

524
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,049
No, no, no. We got to.
We gotta get it all settled.

525
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,727
Of course,
I know what I'd like you to have.

526
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:41,805
- Well, why don't you surprise me?
- You may not want it.

527
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,482
- What do you want to give me?
- Me.

528
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,610
That's just what I've always wanted.

529
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:57,483
Look, bud, you two ain't bad,
but that's better.

530
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:16,965
Fine. Fine.

531
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:19,768
Now, remember,
serve it with the coffee, huh?

532
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:22,128
- Yes, sir. With the coffee.
- Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:31,803
Well, still dancing, huh?

534
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:41,206
That Ted's a pretty good dancer, isn't he?

535
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,648
I don't know. I never danced with him.

536
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:48,765
I hope it doesn't take Ethel as long
to make good with your ma as it did me.

537
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,288
Well, Ethel's a little better shaped
than you are.

538
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,522
I...

539
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:58,726
Thank you, Ted. I enjoyed it.

540
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:02,169
Can't figure out, Ethel, how
Country here got himself a girl like you.

541
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:05,325
Oh, that wasn't easy.
I just wouldn't take no for an answer.

542
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,643
She's pretty, but she's not very smart.

543
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:12,368
- Here come the Bombers.
- Bombers?

544
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,285
Yeah, a few of the Yankees.

545
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,092
That's them.

546
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,281
- Hello, Ted.
- Hi, Barney.

547
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:24,647
- Hello.
- Hi.

548
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:25,848
- Hello, Ted.
- Hello, Bill.

549
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,571
- You know Barney Wile?
- How are you, Barney?

550
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:28,642
And Monty Stratton?

551
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,325
- How are you?
- Mrs. Stratton, this is Bill Dickey.

552
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:31,448
How do you do?

553
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:34,923
- Met you early this season, didn't we?
- Yeah, everything I threw.

554
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:37,803
- Are you back up with the Sox now?
- That's right.

555
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:41,044
- Glad to hear it.
- What, are you running short on suits?

556
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:43,809
- Nice to have met you, Mrs. Stratton.
- Thank you.

557
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:44,928
- Good luck, Monty.
- Thanks.

558
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,162
So long.

559
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,212
Why, he's nice.

560
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:52,043
I told you she wasn't very smart.

561
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,283
You just wait
till you see him tomorrow, honey.

562
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:56,045
They don't call them the Bombers
for nothing.

563
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:58,601
Some poor guy's gonna
have a rough afternoon.

564
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:03,253
By the way, who is gonna pitch tomorrow?

565
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,368
You.

566
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:07,888
Me?

567
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,331
Yeah. A couple of the boys
have sore arms. You'll work.

568
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,128
What do you... Have you unpacked yet?

569
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,524
- Not yet.
- Well, don't.

570
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,409
- Hello. White Sox?
- Yes.

571
00:40:34,493 --> 00:40:36,211
Well, I'm Mrs. Appling, shortstop.

572
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:38,682
This is Mrs. Piet, third base,
and Mrs. Shea, catcher.

573
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,765
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Monty Stratton, pitcher.

574
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,566
Come on in.

575
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,645
How do you feel, son?

576
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,891
- Almost as nervous as you are.
- Oh, me? No, I...

577
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,725
Well, this is it.
Give them everything you've got.

578
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:58,442
All right, Barney.

579
00:40:58,533 --> 00:40:59,727
Play ball!

580
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:03,247
Nervous?

581
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:06,123
We're pulling right along with you.

582
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:50,088
<i>Now batting for Chicago,</i>
<i>number 25, Monty Stratton</i>.

583
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,368
Come on, Monty. Give it to them.

584
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:55,889
- Lasted a little longer today, Monty.
- Yeah. I'm sticking around.

585
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:58,762
Hey, there, you Charlie. Cover your boy.

586
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:15,522
Safe!

587
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,131
Almost what you might call
a one-man team, huh?

588
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:53,891
He's getting tired.

589
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,164
He'll get out of it all right.

590
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,365
<i>Now batting, number eight, Bill Dickey</i>.

591
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:11,804
Come on, Monty. Come on, Monty.

592
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,082
Strike.

593
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:36,207
Strike.

594
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:45,046
Just one more, boy, just one more.

595
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,249
- You're out!
- Not mad, are you?

596
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:59,205
Nope. Feel right friendly.

597
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:09,888
- Loveliest thing I ever read.
- Yeah, I guess we can stay a few days.

598
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:12,168
Oh, it is too bad
the season's almost over.

599
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:15,131
Maybe I can manage to win a few more
before it ends.

600
00:44:15,213 --> 00:44:16,282
Listen to this.

601
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:18,967
"Stratton had the Yankees
eating out of his hand."

602
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:22,284
Yeah, sort of felt like they were nibbling
on that hand in the ninth inning.

603
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,728
"Stratton got himself out of jams
like a seasoned veteran."

604
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:27,122
Oh, yeah. Sure make it sound easy.

605
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:31,767
"Of course, Stratton was helped
considerably by a nearsighted umpire."

606
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:33,081
What was that?

607
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,164
"The umpire kept seeing home plate
under the ball,

608
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,209
"no matter where Stratton threw it."

609
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:40,091
And Stratton cut the inside corner!

610
00:44:41,173 --> 00:44:43,846
"When Stratton pitched, the safest place
to stand was on the plate."

611
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,924
Stratton cut the outside corner.

612
00:44:46,013 --> 00:44:48,208
"He was floating them up
like big, white balloons."

613
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,284
Stratton smoked one down the middle.

614
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:52,091
"And then the infielders..."

615
00:44:55,613 --> 00:45:00,050
Now, now, no, look, how long am I gonna
have to put up with all this abuse?

616
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:02,563
Oh, about 70, 80 years, I hope.

617
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,824
<i>Ladies, here's one of my favorite recipes</i>
<i>that you won't wanna miss</i>.

618
00:45:10,904 --> 00:45:14,817
<i>Old-fashioned apple pie</i>
<i>like Mother used to make,</i>

619
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:17,300
<i>with that tasty, crisp, flaky crust</i>...

620
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,739
He's gonna tell me how to make apple pie.

621
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:25,819
Well, now,
if you'll call off your dog, ma'am,

622
00:45:25,904 --> 00:45:27,462
why, I've got some books here.

623
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:30,104
Monty! Oh, my!

624
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:32,857
- How's my girl?
- I didn't know you, Son.

625
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:33,979
New clothes and all.

626
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,214
Yeah, and this isn't the only thing new.
Here's Ethel.

627
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:37,419
Hello.

628
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:41,657
Monty's been writing me about you,
but he don't write as pretty as you look.

629
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:43,700
Seems to me
you've been running over with luck, Son.

630
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,536
- Sure have.
- Why, you got a new car.

631
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:47,615
Yeah, I bought myself a bucket of bolts.

632
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,057
- Well, get your things out.
- All right.

633
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:50,816
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

634
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:52,656
I'd better get busy
and rustle up some dinner.

635
00:45:52,744 --> 00:45:53,938
I'll help you.

636
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,698
She look like that
and know her way around a kitchen, too?

637
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:57,853
She does all right.

638
00:45:57,944 --> 00:45:59,297
- Oh, Earnie!
- Howdy.

639
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,978
How are you, Earnie?
Ethel, this is my cousin Earnie.

640
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:03,816
- Hello, Earnie.
- Ma'am.

641
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:05,373
Hear you're pitching good.

642
00:46:05,464 --> 00:46:08,376
Well, I managed to win a few
before the season ended.

643
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:09,897
What, you a...

644
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:13,015
- You a fan now?
- Nope.

645
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,895
Guess you won't be needing me anymore.

646
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,099
Well, I'll tell you, Earnie,

647
00:46:19,184 --> 00:46:21,744
I sort of wish you would stick around
for the winter.

648
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:24,099
We got a lot of things we can fix up
around here.

649
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:28,063
We've got to mend the fences
and paint the place up a little

650
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:31,503
and build one of those nursery rooms.

651
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:39,940
How about some supper, Grandma?

652
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,380
They're sure hacking away
at Stratton today.

653
00:46:44,464 --> 00:46:46,136
Well, he's gotta lose one sometime.

654
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:48,215
He's won three in a row,
and the season just started.

655
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,499
Yeah, but he doesn't look right today.

656
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,140
Hey, you forget something?

657
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:56,260
I've a feeling your mind's not on the game.

658
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:58,300
Why, I ought to be in Chicago with Ethel.

659
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:00,693
What are you, a doctor or a pitcher?

660
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,539
I hope she's not having
as tough a time as he is.

661
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:08,694
Well, this won't happen every day.

662
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:12,815
Right now, I wouldn't trade him
for any other pitcher in baseball.

663
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:13,893
Hear, hear.

664
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:16,134
What a future that boy's got.

665
00:47:17,144 --> 00:47:18,372
Play ball!

666
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:45,902
Pour it on them, Pop!

667
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:47,303
It's a boy!

668
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:50,013
What?

669
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:53,140
Come on, Pop.

670
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:00,503
Today you are a man.

671
00:48:02,904 --> 00:48:05,213
If he looks like an umpire, leave home.

672
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:07,772
Hey! What's going on here?

673
00:48:07,864 --> 00:48:10,253
- Play ball!
- Oh, sure.

674
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:13,701
Come on, Pop. Put one in here.

675
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:20,573
Time.

676
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:21,859
Time.

677
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,583
Come on, Pop. Out of there.

678
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:44,093
- Six of each, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

679
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:50,742
That'll be 36 cents.

680
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:53,783
Nice going, Monty.

681
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,334
Oh, boy, what a game!
Three measly hits he gave them.

682
00:48:57,424 --> 00:48:59,699
What's with you, Barney?
You act like you pitched the shutout.

683
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:03,413
Oh, that's the first pitcher in the league
this year to win 14 games.

684
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,663
- Plenty of stuff in there today, Monty.
- Thanks, Ted.

685
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,939
- That's your fourth shutout, son.
- Yep.

686
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:11,497
Boy, what a flipper.

687
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:15,016
Barney, you better take a shower
and cool off.

688
00:49:16,304 --> 00:49:18,215
Hello, honey, how's everything?

689
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:20,576
Good. How's Junior?

690
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,653
Fine.

691
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:25,984
Oh, we did all right. 3-0.

692
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:27,458
Say, honey,

693
00:49:28,624 --> 00:49:30,774
I don't think
you'd better wait dinner for me.

694
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:33,094
No, I'm gonna be tied up again tonight.

695
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:36,378
It's another one of those press interviews.

696
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:39,781
Another? What press interview?

697
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:41,303
I don't know.

698
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,616
No, honey, I won't be late.

699
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:47,859
When those country boys go to town,
they really go.

700
00:49:54,344 --> 00:49:56,141
We're gonna go see Grandma.

701
00:49:56,224 --> 00:49:59,296
And she's gonna be so surprised
when she sees you.

702
00:49:59,384 --> 00:50:00,703
You're so big.

703
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:04,254
We'll look to see who's at the door.

704
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,141
- Ethel.
- Hello, Barney.

705
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:08,813
Junior.

706
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:12,343
Well, you're all set to shove off, huh?

707
00:50:12,424 --> 00:50:14,016
Yes, as soon as Monty gets here.

708
00:50:14,104 --> 00:50:16,698
He phoned and said
he'd be a little late again.

709
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:19,942
Yeah, those press interviews.

710
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:22,692
Oh, but what a season he's had, huh?

711
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:26,663
I knew the boy was good, but I never
expected him to come through this fast.

712
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:29,133
Leading right-hand pitcher
of the American League.

713
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:31,692
- Great, isn't it?
- Yes, it is, Barney.

714
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:35,695
But I'm glad the season's over
and we're going back to Texas.

715
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,103
Yeah, I know.

716
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:41,336
You'll have him all to yourself then.

717
00:50:41,424 --> 00:50:43,813
Oh, I'm not complaining.
I guess we're pretty lucky.

718
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:45,257
- Yes.
- Sure.

719
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:47,733
Don't you guess we're pretty lucky?

720
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:49,059
Hi, Barney. Hello, honey.

721
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:50,133
- Hi.
- Hello.

722
00:50:50,224 --> 00:50:51,623
- You all ready?
- Yes, I'll get my coat.

723
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:53,899
Well, Son, you all set to go down
and see your grandma?

724
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,181
Say, it's none of my business, Monty,
but what's all this with these interviews?

725
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,982
- What?
- And the shenanigans.

726
00:50:59,664 --> 00:51:01,655
You think you can carry him
without dropping him?

727
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:05,054
I won't make an error, son,
but can we depend on Junior?

728
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:12,096
There, now, that's the last one.

729
00:51:12,184 --> 00:51:15,415
Now, scat. You just got here
and you've been at it all day.

730
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,574
- Why not? I enjoy it.
- You do?

731
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:20,172
Why, sure.
I could hardly wait to get down here.

732
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:22,175
Don't you two have
a good time in the city?

733
00:51:22,264 --> 00:51:24,414
I'd think you'd be on the go all the time.

734
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:26,540
Believe it or not,
I see more of Monty down here

735
00:51:26,624 --> 00:51:28,262
than I do in Chicago.

736
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:30,255
For goodness' sakes, why?

737
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:33,222
Well, part of the time,
the team is traveling,

738
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:38,055
and rest of the time, Monty has meetings,
interviews, speeches.

739
00:51:38,584 --> 00:51:41,701
Speeches? Monty making speeches?

740
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:45,899
You may not realize it,
but your son is a big celebrity now.

741
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:49,021
But down here we have him
all to ourselves, don't we, Junior?

742
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:51,379
Anyway, I want the baby
to get used to the farm,

743
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:53,694
so he'll grow up like his daddy.

744
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:56,582
We won't get anything done
talking this way.

745
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:58,936
- Hi. Supper ready?
- Hi.

746
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:00,935
Can't tell with this new contraption.

747
00:52:01,024 --> 00:52:04,733
I don't have to cook no more.
Just turn buttons and off she goes.

748
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:08,703
Seems like everything's got buttons.
It ain't right.

749
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:11,614
I been down at the north pasture.

750
00:52:11,944 --> 00:52:16,062
I'll have to clear it out
if we're going to plant there next spring.

751
00:52:19,984 --> 00:52:22,020
Sounds like supper's ready.

752
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,658
Darned if it doesn't always come out right.

753
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:32,099
My, baseball sure hasn't hurt
Monty's appetite any.

754
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:35,780
None of those ballplayers are shy
with a knife and fork.

755
00:52:36,224 --> 00:52:40,217
If appetite means anything,
reckon Junior'll be quite a ballplayer.

756
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:42,655
He looks a little sleepy,
don't you think, Ethel?

757
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,860
No, let me help you with the dishes first.

758
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:48,095
Oh, there's nothing to help,
with this newfangled gadget.

759
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:51,454
Well, a little dressy, ain't you, Son?

760
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:54,058
Oh, no, not another press interview
down here?

761
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:56,100
No, no. No, no.
I just thought maybe we'd go out

762
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:57,219
and do a little celebrating.

763
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,772
You know, Junior's going to be
six months old tomorrow...

764
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:01,775
- Go on, go on, what are you waiting for?
- Come on.

765
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:04,424
I have to catch my breath.
This is an event, you know.

766
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:06,335
We don't get to do much celebrating
in Chicago.

767
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:08,255
Now, look, if you two girls
are going to sit around

768
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:10,858
and chew the fat all evening,
I'm gonna go out and celebrate myself.

769
00:53:10,944 --> 00:53:11,979
- Goodbye.
- Oh, no.

770
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,374
- You hold him while I get ready.
- Now hurry up, will you?

771
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,459
Now, hold on, boy.
No southpaws in this family.

772
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,098
Southpaw.

773
00:53:30,504 --> 00:53:32,256
Well, now, let's see.

774
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:36,216
- I think we'll have some champagne.
- Yes, sir.

775
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:42,859
- Care to dance?
- Monty, you're acting very strangely.

776
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:44,138
Well, now, it's a fine thing

777
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,818
when a man has to plead
with his own wife to dance with him.

778
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:49,657
- But you don't dance.
- You like to dance, don't you?

779
00:53:49,744 --> 00:53:52,497
- Yes, I do.
- Well, maybe it's about time I learned.

780
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:54,415
Besides, this is
one of my old campaign songs.

781
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:55,573
Now, come on. Come on.

782
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,894
- You'll look funny.
- Won't be the first time.

783
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,542
Come on. Come on.

784
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:08,096
What do I do now?

785
00:54:08,424 --> 00:54:10,142
This was your idea.

786
00:54:18,224 --> 00:54:20,499
- You're dancing.
- Oh, it's nothing.

787
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:23,462
- But you said you didn't know how.
- I didn't.

788
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:28,742
Honey, I just got sick and tired
of everybody dancing with you but me.

789
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:31,464
Did you ever hear of Inez and Papanya?

790
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:33,256
Inez and Papanya?

791
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:37,535
Monty, you've been taking
dancing lessons.

792
00:54:38,744 --> 00:54:41,053
Yeah, they've got schools
all over the American League.

793
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:44,022
Of course,
you always don't get Inez or Papanya.

794
00:54:44,104 --> 00:54:45,378
Sometimes you get...

795
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:48,774
Oh, I remember, in Detroit I got Drusilla,

796
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:52,300
and in St. Louis I got a little short one
by the name of Angelita.

797
00:54:52,384 --> 00:54:53,419
Cleveland, I got...

798
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:56,496
Oh, then all those press interviews
and meetings...

799
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,978
Boy, I took so many dancing lessons
through the season,

800
00:55:03,064 --> 00:55:05,897
it's a wonder
I had strength enough to pitch.

801
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:12,696
Say, I got a few fancy steps here.
Do you think you can stick with me?

802
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:14,979
- Oh, I'll stick with you.
- All right. Here we go.

803
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:10,700
- Come on.
- I can't move.

804
00:56:17,104 --> 00:56:19,095
I sure got me some fellow.

805
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:21,374
Shucks, didn't you know that?

806
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:34,457
Good morning.

807
00:56:34,544 --> 00:56:35,738
Morning?

808
00:56:35,944 --> 00:56:37,900
It was morning
when you came in last night.

809
00:56:37,984 --> 00:56:39,895
Yes, it was pretty late.

810
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:41,941
It must have been 4:00.

811
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:45,539
What could you two
have been doing all that time?

812
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:46,977
- Dancing.
- Dancing with Monty?

813
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:48,338
- Sure!
- You were dancing?

814
00:56:48,424 --> 00:56:49,743
We sure were. I wouldn't be surprised

815
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,099
if we did some more dancing tonight.
How about a date, ma'am?

816
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:54,539
- Why, sure.
- Look, look, look at this.

817
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:56,740
This is the Inez and Papanya special.

818
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:57,813
- Are you ready?
- Yep.

819
00:56:57,904 --> 00:56:59,860
One, two, three, four...

820
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:01,742
This has a twirl in it.

821
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,133
Once more.

822
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:04,942
- How about that? Let's try it, Ma.
- Oh, no.

823
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:06,696
Now you clear out.
I got to get the dinner ready.

824
00:57:06,784 --> 00:57:08,103
Hap, what do you want?

825
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:11,062
Hey, why don't you two girls
get dinner ready,

826
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:13,738
and Hap and I'll go out
and look for a couple of rabbits, okay?

827
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:14,813
If it's all right with the rabbits,

828
00:57:14,904 --> 00:57:17,020
- I've got no objections.
- Bye.

829
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:10,616
Hap, Happy, go home.

830
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,537
Go home, Hap. Get Ethel.
Go on, go on home.

831
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:19,940
Go on, Hap. Hap, come on.

832
00:58:20,424 --> 00:58:21,903
Go home. Go on.

833
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:24,493
Hap. Hap, go home.

834
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:27,062
No, Hap. Hap.

835
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,096
Go on home. Go on home.
Get Ethel. Go on home.

836
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,417
Monty's back.

837
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:50,698
Well, I guess everything is about ready.

838
00:58:57,864 --> 00:59:00,776
Happy, be quiet.
That dog makes such a racket.

839
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:08,098
That dog.

840
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:09,863
Get the butter?

841
00:59:10,264 --> 00:59:11,617
I'll get it.

842
00:59:14,904 --> 00:59:16,496
I don't see Monty.

843
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:18,018
You don't?

844
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:22,218
The dog is crazy.
What's the matter with you?

845
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:25,135
Get back there. Go on.

846
00:59:26,344 --> 00:59:28,619
I wonder why he came back alone.

847
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:50,373
Monty.

848
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:54,574
Monty. Monty, what happened?

849
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,299
I guess I shot the wrong rabbit.

850
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:23,621
There's no alternative.
It's his leg or his life.

851
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,500
But his legs are his life.

852
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,939
The infection is spreading.
If we don't operate immediately...

853
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:30,503
But his leg...

854
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,702
He's a ballplayer.

855
01:00:32,864 --> 01:00:37,255
He's a man whose life is in danger.
We must have your permission to operate.

856
01:01:27,144 --> 01:01:29,214
I flew down as soon as I heard.

857
01:01:29,304 --> 01:01:30,623
Oh, Barney.

858
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,532
That's right, kid. Cry it out.

859
01:01:34,184 --> 01:01:37,176
- Barney, his leg.
- I know, I know.

860
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:46,058
Well, he had some innings.

861
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,056
At least he had that.

862
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,096
Guess you're glad to be back,
huh, Monty?

863
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,253
Yeah.

864
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,302
Hi, young fella.

865
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:14,337
He's home, Ma.

866
01:03:21,944 --> 01:03:23,775
He hasn't seen me cry.

867
01:03:27,184 --> 01:03:29,061
I've got no tears left.

868
01:03:39,824 --> 01:03:41,257
Hello, Monty.

869
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:43,303
How's my girl?

870
01:03:47,944 --> 01:03:50,777
- Do you want to rest, Son?
- Yeah, I guess so.

871
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:00,984
Looks like I sort of gummed things up.

872
01:04:01,944 --> 01:04:05,254
We've always been able
to handle our share of troubles.

873
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:21,382
Look at the mail today.

874
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:24,900
Must be hundreds of letters here
from people all over the country.

875
01:04:25,224 --> 01:04:27,579
- Don't you wanna look at them?
- No.

876
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:31,661
Well, if people are nice enough
to write them, you should read them.

877
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:34,861
If you like them so much,
why don't you read them yourself?

878
01:04:36,184 --> 01:04:39,494
What do they say,
"Merry Christmas"? "Happy New Year"?

879
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,778
Not enough eggs to pay for their feed.

880
01:05:01,424 --> 01:05:03,494
- Ain't too big, neither.
- No.

881
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:11,938
Monty gonna start moving around soon?

882
01:05:12,184 --> 01:05:13,936
Trying to get him to.

883
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:16,375
You figure he's gonna?

884
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:18,662
That's up to him.

885
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,977
Active fella like he was
ought to get around.

886
01:05:24,744 --> 01:05:27,577
He ever gonna use that leg
they made for him?

887
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:29,702
I don't know, Earnie.

888
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:33,454
Ethel's doing the best she can,
but she can't nag him.

889
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:36,741
He's gonna have to want to do something
before he does it.

890
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:42,184
I've been straightening out the shed.
A lot of stuff's piled up.

891
01:05:42,264 --> 01:05:43,458
Maybe you ought to come out and tell me

892
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:45,375
what you wanna keep
and what you wanna get rid of.

893
01:05:45,464 --> 01:05:47,056
Get rid of it all.

894
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:52,097
Well, I suppose there is a lot of stuff
lying around we don't need.

895
01:05:53,024 --> 01:05:56,573
But I thought maybe there would be
some things you'd wanna hang on to.

896
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,053
Like this ball the team all signed.

897
01:06:28,744 --> 01:06:30,063
I'm sorry.

898
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,340
What are we gonna do, Ma?

899
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,135
Guess there's nothing you can do

900
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:01,614
except keep on trying and hoping.

901
01:07:03,944 --> 01:07:06,333
But he isn't interested in anything.

902
01:07:07,744 --> 01:07:09,063
Or anybody.

903
01:07:09,384 --> 01:07:12,740
Everything I do or say
seems to drive him further away.

904
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:16,262
He's all by himself.

905
01:07:17,544 --> 01:07:19,774
I just can't seem to reach him.

906
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,332
Well, I guess it wouldn't be right

907
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:25,541
if he was letting it roll off his back
like it was nothing.

908
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:30,454
I know Monty.
He's taking a bad beating now,

909
01:07:31,864 --> 01:07:34,822
but one of these days
he'll start swinging back.

910
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:37,897
But will he, Ma?

911
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:40,416
Do you think he will?

912
01:07:41,744 --> 01:07:44,212
Well, there's something about Monty.

913
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:47,139
Good sense, I guess you'd call it.

914
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,455
But whatever you call it, if you got it,
no doctor can amputate it.

915
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:09,577
- How's the cotton look, Earnie?
- Good.

916
01:08:14,184 --> 01:08:16,334
What you figure it'll come to?

917
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:18,974
Might go half a bale an acre.

918
01:08:19,144 --> 01:08:20,941
Pretty good, huh, Son?

919
01:08:21,304 --> 01:08:22,373
Yeah.

920
01:08:26,544 --> 01:08:28,296
Sonny wants to say good night.

921
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:29,863
He talking now?

922
01:08:30,304 --> 01:08:33,376
Well, of course.
You say good night to Uncle Earnie.

923
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:37,379
See?

924
01:08:37,464 --> 01:08:38,499
Yep.

925
01:08:38,944 --> 01:08:40,343
What'd he say?

926
01:08:40,424 --> 01:08:42,335
Well, he said good night.

927
01:08:42,504 --> 01:08:45,018
Regular little blabbermouth, ain't he?

928
01:08:46,704 --> 01:08:48,456
He sure is an armful.

929
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:53,501
Come on to Uncle Earnie.

930
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,543
Well, he took a step.

931
01:08:56,624 --> 01:08:58,421
- He's really trying to walk.
- Darned if he ain't.

932
01:08:58,504 --> 01:09:00,460
Come on, Sonny.
Let's see you do that again.

933
01:09:00,544 --> 01:09:03,104
Come on, come on. Here, come on.

934
01:09:04,664 --> 01:09:07,462
Oh, look, Monty,
he's really starting to walk.

935
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:08,533
Isn't that wonderful?

936
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:11,741
What's so wonderful about it?
He's got two legs, hasn't he?

937
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,416
Look at that road.

938
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:34,894
I used to do 10 miles on that road
like it was nothing,

939
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:36,822
just to pitch a game.

940
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:41,136
Now I can hardly reach it,
let alone walk on it.

941
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:46,778
And then to top everything else,
now I'm ornery into the bargain.

942
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:52,102
I shouldn't have sounded off before.
I know you have it rough enough as it is.

943
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:55,654
- I'm not complaining.
- No. Maybe it'd be better if you did.

944
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,542
You can't keep it all stored up inside you.

945
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:03,823
You told me once,
"A man's got to know where he's going."

946
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:08,295
Where are you going, Monty?

947
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:10,143
I don't know.

948
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,780
I guess I'm just not going.

949
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:18,338
And you said you couldn't let me down.

950
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:23,137
What about the baby, Ma, yourself?

951
01:12:23,784 --> 01:12:27,015
- Are you gonna let everything down?
- Do you think I want to?

952
01:12:27,104 --> 01:12:28,696
What do you want?

953
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:32,213
It's not clear in my mind, I...

954
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:34,943
Before, I could do things, but now...

955
01:12:35,024 --> 01:12:36,935
Nothing's really changed.

956
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:40,097
You're still the same fella
I've always been in love with.

957
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:44,539
I've made out much worse than you.

958
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:47,336
You lost your leg.

959
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:50,937
But I lost you.

960
01:12:51,904 --> 01:12:53,178
Oh, honey,

961
01:12:54,944 --> 01:12:57,412
I still feel the same way inside.

962
01:12:57,504 --> 01:13:00,940
I know you do, darling.
That's what I've been trying to tell...

963
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:18,744
I guess I got a squawk coming, too.

964
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:26,575
Sure wasted a lot of money
on those dancing lessons.

965
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:37,373
Gee, I sure got me some gal.

966
01:13:37,784 --> 01:13:39,900
Shucks, didn't you know that?

967
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:53,732
We're going to town to do some shopping.
Will you watch the baby?

968
01:13:53,824 --> 01:13:55,735
Sure. What's he gonna do?

969
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:57,179
Very funny.

970
01:13:57,264 --> 01:14:00,062
Nothing like having a comedian
in the family.

971
01:14:11,704 --> 01:14:14,457
You're not doing that so good, young fella.

972
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:21,902
Here, I'll show you.

973
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:28,863
Looks like we got our work cut out for us.

974
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:01,655
Sure is trying, ain't he?

975
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:07,175
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

976
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,938
- But you always have two...
- No, no. No, no.

977
01:15:31,584 --> 01:15:34,621
He'll be up and down now,
getting into everything.

978
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:40,580
- He'll be all right.
- Oh, upsy-daisy. There.

979
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:42,539
See?

980
01:15:57,464 --> 01:16:00,376
I kind of think
Junior needs a little sunshine.

981
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:04,822
Go on, get his coat on.

982
01:16:05,584 --> 01:16:06,619
Sure.

983
01:16:12,544 --> 01:16:15,900
We mustn't keep Daddy waiting.
Put your little arms in.

984
01:16:17,384 --> 01:16:20,217
Now you be a good boy.
Please be a good boy.

985
01:16:20,704 --> 01:16:21,819
There.

986
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:26,816
Come on. There we go.

987
01:17:01,144 --> 01:17:02,543
Sure is a mess.

988
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:04,615
Yeah, I guess we ought to save some of it.

989
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:05,978
I guess so.

990
01:17:08,904 --> 01:17:10,496
Want to keep this?

991
01:17:11,664 --> 01:17:12,858
Yeah, I guess so.

992
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:14,297
All right, then. Keep it.

993
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:16,056
Well, no, put it in the box.

994
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:17,816
If you wanna throw so much,
let's go outside

995
01:17:17,904 --> 01:17:19,656
- before you wreck the shed.
- No, honey, I don't want...

996
01:17:19,744 --> 01:17:22,338
Too much rich living.
A little exercise isn't gonna hurt you.

997
01:17:22,424 --> 01:17:24,415
Come on, let's throw a few.

998
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:33,738
You're a fine-Iooking baseball player.
Can't even see you behind the mitt.

999
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:57,136
Say, this is fun.

1000
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:11,375
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.

1001
01:18:13,544 --> 01:18:17,139
I think I know what I did wrong.
Come on, let's throw some more.

1002
01:18:20,704 --> 01:18:23,059
That's the first time
I ever been kissed by a catcher.

1003
01:18:23,144 --> 01:18:25,135
Oh, catchers don't do that, huh?

1004
01:18:25,224 --> 01:18:27,692
Not as a rule, no.
Sort of slows up the game.

1005
01:18:27,784 --> 01:18:30,901
Well, don't just sit there.
Let's see the big pitch.

1006
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:34,093
Come on. Lay it in there, Country.

1007
01:18:38,024 --> 01:18:40,015
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

1008
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:44,498
You're late for practice.

1009
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:46,575
Well, I was finishing up
out in the north pasture.

1010
01:18:46,664 --> 01:18:48,700
All right, now, let's see something today.

1011
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:49,978
Come on.

1012
01:18:51,024 --> 01:18:53,777
Come on.
Just throw it right over the plate.

1013
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:58,263
Oh, that's pretty bad.
You can do better than that.

1014
01:18:58,344 --> 01:19:00,300
Come on, right over the plate.

1015
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:02,974
Now let's see the fastball.

1016
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,338
Fastball?

1017
01:19:04,784 --> 01:19:07,537
Well, even if I did have one,
what would you do with it if I threw it?

1018
01:19:07,624 --> 01:19:11,617
Well, just throw it and find out.
Come on, get it right over the plate. Come.

1019
01:19:12,624 --> 01:19:16,412
You call that a fastball?
You had more hop on it a month ago.

1020
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:19,223
Hey, you're fixing
to get your head knocked off.

1021
01:19:19,304 --> 01:19:23,502
Don't argue with the catcher.
When I say a fastball, I mean a fastball.

1022
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:32,216
Now come on.
Put it right in here, right over the plate.

1023
01:19:33,624 --> 01:19:34,613
Okay.

1024
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:36,183
Right in here.

1025
01:19:42,664 --> 01:19:46,100
- Gee, honey, I'm sorry, you hurt?
- No, no, I'm all right.

1026
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:49,623
But you've just lost yourself a catcher.

1027
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:52,659
Never had a catcher quit me before.

1028
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:56,020
You never had a catcher before
who was going to have a baby.

1029
01:19:57,944 --> 01:19:58,979
What?

1030
01:20:02,904 --> 01:20:06,658
Come on, Hap, come on. Come on.
You're slowing up the game. Here we are.

1031
01:20:06,944 --> 01:20:08,343
That's a boy.

1032
01:20:17,224 --> 01:20:19,658
Hey, can a fella catch a meal here?

1033
01:20:19,864 --> 01:20:21,013
Barney.

1034
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:25,622
- Ethel.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you.

1035
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:27,657
I was on my way down to Houston.

1036
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:30,656
I couldn't pass through
without seeing my kids.

1037
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:34,255
Prettiest sight in Texas.

1038
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:37,142
Oh, you've been looking
at too many ballplayers.

1039
01:20:37,944 --> 01:20:40,981
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

1040
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:45,453
Junior, come to your Uncle Barney.

1041
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,938
- How is Monty?
- Oh, he's just fine.

1042
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:54,137
What in the heck is that?

1043
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,818
Better get used to it
if you're figuring on staying awhile.

1044
01:20:56,904 --> 01:21:00,692
Oh, Ma. Don't you worry,
I'm not planning to stay all winter.

1045
01:21:00,784 --> 01:21:02,103
Oh, go on.

1046
01:21:04,184 --> 01:21:05,299
Say...

1047
01:21:11,104 --> 01:21:14,892
Come on, Happy. Lots of pepper.
That's a boy. Nice boy.

1048
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,343
Say, what's going on here?

1049
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,098
Come on. That's the way to go, Hap.

1050
01:21:24,824 --> 01:21:27,133
Now you're working in there, boy.

1051
01:21:28,784 --> 01:21:31,503
Hey, let's see that big one, Country.

1052
01:21:31,704 --> 01:21:34,582
Why, Barney, you old son of a gun!

1053
01:21:34,984 --> 01:21:36,815
How are you?
What are you doing out here?

1054
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:40,260
Well, I came down to scout
that All-Stars game in Houston.

1055
01:21:40,344 --> 01:21:41,538
Oh, I see.

1056
01:21:41,624 --> 01:21:44,013
Say, you look in pretty good shape.

1057
01:21:44,744 --> 01:21:47,178
No use in my asking you
how things are going.

1058
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,141
No, no complaints, Barn.

1059
01:21:49,584 --> 01:21:52,860
- Hey, bag-snatcher!
- Oh, you gotta keep your eye on her.

1060
01:21:53,064 --> 01:21:54,736
You're gonna stay awhile,
aren't you, Barney?

1061
01:21:54,824 --> 01:21:57,497
- If I'm cornered, I might stay all night.
- You're cornered.

1062
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:59,176
- Afternoon mail.
- Thanks, Earnie.

1063
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:02,813
- Howdy, Mr. Wile.
- How are you, Earnie? You're looking well.

1064
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,693
Fancy suit. Yes, sirree, that's real fancy.

1065
01:22:08,104 --> 01:22:10,572
Great conversationalist, that fellow.

1066
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:13,933
- What is it, Monty?
- This is from Josh Higgins.

1067
01:22:14,024 --> 01:22:17,255
He manages one of the All-Star teams
Barney's gonna scout.

1068
01:22:17,344 --> 01:22:20,495
He wants me to come down to the game.
How about it, honey?

1069
01:22:20,944 --> 01:22:22,059
Well, if you want to, Monty.

1070
01:22:22,144 --> 01:22:23,862
Well, why not?
As long as Barney's going down...

1071
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:26,538
Well, sure, it's a great idea.
We'll all go together.

1072
01:22:26,624 --> 01:22:28,216
- Sure.
- Like old times.

1073
01:22:28,304 --> 01:22:32,138
I'll tell Ma. Maybe she'd like to go, too.
Might as well do this up right.

1074
01:22:36,104 --> 01:22:38,538
You've done wonders with him, Ethel.

1075
01:22:39,224 --> 01:22:42,899
- He did it himself.
- No, he couldn't come this far alone.

1076
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:47,733
Barney, I don't know whether
he ought to go to the game or not.

1077
01:22:48,024 --> 01:22:49,776
It might bring back memories.

1078
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,661
Well, sooner or later,

1079
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,178
he's gotta find out
that he's not a player anymore,

1080
01:22:54,264 --> 01:22:55,856
just a spectator.

1081
01:22:56,824 --> 01:22:59,861
It can't do him any harm
just to watch a game.

1082
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,742
No, I guess not.

1083
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,855
- I'm glad we're all going.
- Yeah.

1084
01:23:07,944 --> 01:23:09,696
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

1085
01:23:17,344 --> 01:23:18,823
230, that's us.

1086
01:23:22,024 --> 01:23:24,254
Say, I think I'll go back
and say hello to some of the boys.

1087
01:23:24,344 --> 01:23:26,904
- That's a good idea. I'll go with you.
- Don't you think you better...

1088
01:23:26,984 --> 01:23:28,576
No, no, you go on,
but don't gab back there

1089
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:30,017
and hold up the game.

1090
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:32,334
Ma, you'd have made a great umpire.

1091
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:36,863
Yeah, he's got the good knuckleball.
Good pitcher.

1092
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:38,297
- Left-handed.
- Hello, Matt.

1093
01:23:38,384 --> 01:23:39,703
How are you, boy?

1094
01:23:41,144 --> 01:23:42,623
- Hello, Monty.
- Hello, boy.

1095
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,695
Wally, you old walrus,
give me five.

1096
01:23:44,784 --> 01:23:46,103
What are you doing down here?

1097
01:23:46,184 --> 01:23:47,936
Chuck, how are you?
You better be good today.

1098
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:50,060
I just talked to the umpire
and the Western manager.

1099
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,738
Now, if you get a hit,
you got to get to first base on your own.

1100
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:54,496
Then we can put a runner in for you, okay?

1101
01:23:54,584 --> 01:23:55,573
Right.

1102
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:58,178
Those Western guys want
to win their share of this game.

1103
01:23:58,264 --> 01:23:59,538
They're not gonna give you any breaks.

1104
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:02,377
That's the way I want it.
Let's just play a ballgame.

1105
01:24:02,464 --> 01:24:03,692
Good luck.

1106
01:24:04,104 --> 01:24:05,219
Monty.

1107
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:09,773
But this is big baseball.
They're playing for important money.

1108
01:24:09,864 --> 01:24:11,775
- They're gonna be tough.
- I know.

1109
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:14,776
That's the reason I wrote Josh
and asked him to let me pitch this game.

1110
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:18,254
The tougher they are,
the better I'll know just what's what.

1111
01:24:19,424 --> 01:24:21,540
Your arm is probably all right,
but, you know,

1112
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:24,536
you don't just pitch with your arm.

1113
01:24:24,624 --> 01:24:28,094
I know what you're thinking.
I don't even have a knee.

1114
01:24:28,504 --> 01:24:32,019
But I got to pitch a game, Barney.
I just got to find out.

1115
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:34,776
I understand, son.

1116
01:24:39,384 --> 01:24:42,456
Suppose they start bunting?

1117
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:45,058
- How you going to get around? It's all...
- I know, I know.

1118
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:48,022
I'll just have to figure that out
when I get to it.

1119
01:24:49,704 --> 01:24:53,538
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen</i>.
<i>Here are the batteries for today's game</i>.

1120
01:24:53,624 --> 01:24:56,821
<i>For the Western All-Stars,</i>
<i>Gene Bearden pitching,</i>

1121
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:58,462
<i>Partee catching</i>.

1122
01:24:58,864 --> 01:25:01,776
<i>For the Southern All-Stars,</i>
<i>Milliken catching</i>.

1123
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:05,698
<i>And in his first comeback appearance,</i>
<i>Monty Stratton pitching</i>.

1124
01:25:16,504 --> 01:25:18,972
- Ethel.
- Barney, please don't stop me.

1125
01:25:31,144 --> 01:25:34,978
- Why didn't you tell me about it, Monty?
- I wanted to surprise you.

1126
01:25:35,584 --> 01:25:37,575
I got so I was throwing the ball
pretty good

1127
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,973
and I was all steamed up and I...

1128
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:42,136
But now I'm afraid.

1129
01:25:42,584 --> 01:25:44,973
Afraid? Afraid of what?

1130
01:25:45,584 --> 01:25:48,701
- You've been beaten before.
- No, this is different.

1131
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:52,620
I keep saying to myself
that I'm just the same as everybody else,

1132
01:25:52,704 --> 01:25:54,854
but I wanted to prove it.
I wanted to show you.

1133
01:25:54,944 --> 01:25:57,458
You don't have to prove anything
to me, darling.

1134
01:25:57,544 --> 01:26:00,297
Well, maybe I don't have to,
but I wanted to.

1135
01:26:00,504 --> 01:26:02,699
But I can't go through with it.

1136
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:05,657
Monty, I came down to stop you.

1137
01:26:06,424 --> 01:26:08,654
I was just as afraid as you are.

1138
01:26:09,104 --> 01:26:12,414
But you can't turn back now.
That won't solve anything.

1139
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:14,222
You're a ballplayer.

1140
01:26:14,864 --> 01:26:16,263
I used to be.

1141
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:20,499
You still are, or you wouldn't have
come this far yourself.

1142
01:26:21,904 --> 01:26:25,214
Us saying I'm still a ballplayer
doesn't make me one.

1143
01:26:25,624 --> 01:26:27,580
Well, then let's find out.

1144
01:26:29,104 --> 01:26:31,493
Maybe I won't like what I find out.

1145
01:26:31,584 --> 01:26:33,700
Would you rather stop trying?

1146
01:26:41,984 --> 01:26:43,656
Good luck, darling.

1147
01:26:49,744 --> 01:26:51,177
Do I look all right?

1148
01:26:52,384 --> 01:26:54,056
You look just fine.

1149
01:27:39,784 --> 01:27:40,933
Monty! Monty!

1150
01:28:00,824 --> 01:28:04,373
Yeah. Ma, you see
how the fans feel about our boy?

1151
01:28:04,664 --> 01:28:07,224
- Is this your idea?
- No, I...

1152
01:28:07,304 --> 01:28:09,215
He wanted to surprise us.

1153
01:28:11,384 --> 01:28:13,739
Well, Stratton's on the mound,
taking his warm-up throws.

1154
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,382
This is a big moment for Monty.

1155
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:17,102
Remember,
before his unfortunate accident,

1156
01:28:17,184 --> 01:28:19,823
he was the leading right-handed pitcher
in the American League.

1157
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:22,259
This comeback attempt must mean
an awful lot to the big fellow.

1158
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:23,663
Play ball!

1159
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:27,776
All right, Monty, go.

1160
01:28:28,944 --> 01:28:31,253
Hang right in there now, Monty. Come on.

1161
01:28:31,344 --> 01:28:33,619
In you go, Monty.
Quick-fire at him now, Monty.

1162
01:28:33,704 --> 01:28:35,103
Come on, boy.

1163
01:28:35,304 --> 01:28:36,623
Get in there and pitch.

1164
01:28:36,704 --> 01:28:38,023
Fire, Monty.

1165
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:48,502
Come back. Come back.

1166
01:28:53,384 --> 01:28:54,817
Come on, boy.

1167
01:28:57,944 --> 01:28:59,013
Play ball.

1168
01:28:59,104 --> 01:29:00,776
Get on that pitch, Monty.
Start him off right.

1169
01:29:00,864 --> 01:29:03,901
Attaboy. Never mind him now, Monty.
Come on.

1170
01:29:07,544 --> 01:29:08,533
Hurry.

1171
01:29:10,464 --> 01:29:12,295
Get back here. Come on.

1172
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:18,296
Well, Stratton's off to a bad start.
Two clean hits in a row.

1173
01:29:18,384 --> 01:29:21,501
Zarilla on first. Beringhele on second.
Steve Messner up.

1174
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:39,095
Hurry up there! Come on.

1175
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:43,217
Both runners advance to scoring position
after the catch.

1176
01:29:43,304 --> 01:29:45,056
Runners on second and third.

1177
01:29:45,304 --> 01:29:47,499
They're hitting everything he throws.

1178
01:29:49,464 --> 01:29:50,692
Have Fred warm up.

1179
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:52,217
Fred, warm up.

1180
01:29:59,344 --> 01:30:02,063
There goes Dobernic
out of the bullpen to warm up.

1181
01:30:17,344 --> 01:30:18,857
- Safe!
- Safe!

1182
01:30:19,024 --> 01:30:23,176
Safe all around. Ed Stewart's
chop infield hit drives in the first run.

1183
01:30:23,264 --> 01:30:25,255
Well, Stratton's really in trouble now.

1184
01:30:25,344 --> 01:30:28,142
One run in, one out, men on first and third.

1185
01:30:29,264 --> 01:30:31,414
He'll settle down in a minute.

1186
01:30:49,264 --> 01:30:51,016
Get back there. Come on, run.

1187
01:30:51,104 --> 01:30:52,139
Safe!

1188
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,662
Another sensational catch by Maddern
for the second out.

1189
01:30:55,744 --> 01:30:57,575
His quick peg holds the runner on third.

1190
01:31:05,624 --> 01:31:08,297
Just a second.
There goes Higgins out to the mound.

1191
01:31:08,384 --> 01:31:10,181
That may be all for Stratton.

1192
01:31:10,704 --> 01:31:12,774
Will he take him out, Barney?

1193
01:31:13,424 --> 01:31:15,016
How do you feel, Monty?

1194
01:31:15,104 --> 01:31:17,698
I can't seem to get anything on the ball.

1195
01:31:18,704 --> 01:31:21,423
Boy, these fielders are gonna be
all worn out if this keeps up.

1196
01:31:21,504 --> 01:31:23,540
Don't let that worry you, fella.
They're all with you.

1197
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:26,457
Loosen up, Monty.
This is just another ballgame.

1198
01:31:26,544 --> 01:31:28,500
Make them play it your way.

1199
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:39,023
Bockman's the next batter
stepping up to the plate.

1200
01:31:39,104 --> 01:31:41,618
- Men on first and third. Two outs.
- Batter up!

1201
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:52,459
Strike!

1202
01:32:04,304 --> 01:32:05,578
Strike two!

1203
01:32:13,104 --> 01:32:15,538
Come on, Monty. You can do it, boy.

1204
01:32:20,904 --> 01:32:22,542
Strike three!

1205
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:30,657
Nice going, Monty. Attaboy.

1206
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:32,621
- Nice pitching.
- Okay?

1207
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:36,898
- Come on, Jerry, get ahold of one.
- All right.

1208
01:32:53,624 --> 01:32:54,943
Play ball!

1209
01:32:58,784 --> 01:33:00,297
Come on, Monty.

1210
01:33:06,864 --> 01:33:08,058
Strike!

1211
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:45,980
Come on, boy. Hit one, boy.

1212
01:34:04,024 --> 01:34:06,458
I guess I started my slide too soon.

1213
01:34:08,784 --> 01:34:10,183
You're all right.

1214
01:34:14,544 --> 01:34:16,694
Well, they're getting to Bearden now.
Two hits in a row.

1215
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:19,537
Come on, Eddie. Hurry up.
Get down. Down.

1216
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,182
It's been a pitchers' duel
since the first inning,

1217
01:34:25,264 --> 01:34:28,461
but the Southern All-Stars have two on
with two out.

1218
01:34:28,624 --> 01:34:30,535
And Milliken, a very good hitter,
is coming up.

1219
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:33,343
They need a hit now.
This may be their last chance.

1220
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:38,215
This guy can hit, Gene.

1221
01:34:38,744 --> 01:34:41,178
Let's walk him and work on Stratton.

1222
01:34:42,064 --> 01:34:43,133
Okay.

1223
01:34:50,024 --> 01:34:51,093
Ball!

1224
01:34:51,664 --> 01:34:54,736
Barney, they're going to walk him
to get at Monty.

1225
01:34:55,024 --> 01:34:56,935
Yeah. That's baseball.

1226
01:34:59,504 --> 01:35:00,732
Ball two!

1227
01:35:06,544 --> 01:35:07,818
Ball three!

1228
01:35:13,144 --> 01:35:14,213
Ball four!

1229
01:35:16,904 --> 01:35:20,738
We got a pinch hitter now for Stratton,
with the bases loaded and two out.

1230
01:35:21,544 --> 01:35:24,581
Monty, I'd sure like to see you
finish this game if it was just up to me,

1231
01:35:24,664 --> 01:35:27,462
but these guys have a big stake
in this game.

1232
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,259
I think I can get them in.

1233
01:35:30,344 --> 01:35:31,777
Well, I'd sure like to see you do it, son,

1234
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:35,982
but we're a run behind and the bases full.
I've got to put in a pinch hitter.

1235
01:35:40,384 --> 01:35:41,533
Get ahold of one, Monty.

1236
01:35:41,624 --> 01:35:44,092
- Come on, Monty.
- You can do it, boy.

1237
01:35:44,464 --> 01:35:46,216
Come on, Monty, take your cut.

1238
01:35:46,304 --> 01:35:48,295
- Attaboy, Monty.
- Get them.

1239
01:35:56,064 --> 01:35:58,578
No, wait. Wait a minute.
Here comes Stratton.

1240
01:35:58,664 --> 01:36:00,143
They're not taking him out.

1241
01:36:00,224 --> 01:36:04,012
Well, that's not good baseball percentage,
but they're going all the way with Monty.

1242
01:36:04,104 --> 01:36:06,379
Listen to that crowd. Are they with him.

1243
01:36:25,704 --> 01:36:27,296
Come on, Bearden, get this guy!

1244
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:38,812
Ball one!

1245
01:36:49,104 --> 01:36:50,253
Strike!

1246
01:37:00,704 --> 01:37:03,013
Stay with it, Monty. Come on, boy.

1247
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:27,982
Nice hitting, Monty.

1248
01:37:33,424 --> 01:37:36,097
Well, you gave us a one-run lead.
Now get out and hold it.

1249
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,140
- Nice hitting, Monty.
- Nice hitting and pitching.

1250
01:37:40,464 --> 01:37:42,022
Hey, Al, Stevie.

1251
01:37:42,784 --> 01:37:45,378
I hate to do this, but we gotta get on.

1252
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:46,939
Bunt him.

1253
01:37:47,024 --> 01:37:49,060
All right, come on. Get in there.

1254
01:37:58,704 --> 01:37:59,932
Get them, Monty.

1255
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:02,379
Quick-fire at him now, Monty.
Come on, boy.

1256
01:38:05,264 --> 01:38:06,663
Attaboy.

1257
01:38:11,024 --> 01:38:12,696
- Move it.
- Safe!

1258
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:40,213
Safe!

1259
01:38:41,104 --> 01:38:43,937
Stratton's in a bad way now.
Two on. Nobody out.

1260
01:38:44,024 --> 01:38:45,821
They're bunting this game right out
from under him.

1261
01:38:45,904 --> 01:38:48,259
I'm afraid there's nothing
he can do about it.

1262
01:38:48,344 --> 01:38:50,983
There's Milliken, the catcher,
out to talk to him.

1263
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:54,181
That looks like the pattern, Monty.
What can we do about it?

1264
01:38:54,424 --> 01:38:57,257
Well, I'll just have to
get off the mound quicker, that's all.

1265
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,539
- I'll get out there.
- All right, fella.

1266
01:39:00,384 --> 01:39:01,703
Play ball!

1267
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:06,340
All right! Batter up there!

1268
01:39:09,824 --> 01:39:10,893
Monty.

1269
01:39:19,504 --> 01:39:22,860
Monty was off the mound with the pitch
and nailed that man at first.

1270
01:39:22,944 --> 01:39:24,377
But he's not out of the woods yet.

1271
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:27,501
The runners advanced to second and third.
Only one out.

1272
01:39:27,984 --> 01:39:29,337
Hey, Eddie.

1273
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:33,096
He's moving around too good now.
Take a cut at it.

1274
01:39:40,424 --> 01:39:41,698
Play ball!

1275
01:39:45,904 --> 01:39:47,098
Strike!

1276
01:39:47,624 --> 01:39:51,014
Now they're taking their full cuts again,
but any kind of a hit will do it.

1277
01:39:51,104 --> 01:39:53,618
Even a long fly will tie up this ballgame.

1278
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:01,858
Strike two!

1279
01:40:06,904 --> 01:40:08,895
One more! One more, Monty.

1280
01:40:12,024 --> 01:40:14,299
Strike three! You're out!

1281
01:40:15,944 --> 01:40:19,061
And Bockman went down swinging
for the second out.

1282
01:40:19,224 --> 01:40:21,784
This next one can be
the big out for Monty.

1283
01:40:21,864 --> 01:40:23,013
But look who's coming up.

1284
01:40:23,104 --> 01:40:25,857
The power hitter of the league,
Big Johnny Lindell.

1285
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:36,493
Here we go, Monty.
Quick-fire at him now, Monty.

1286
01:40:36,584 --> 01:40:37,983
Come on, boy.

1287
01:40:44,424 --> 01:40:45,743
You're out!

1288
01:40:54,904 --> 01:40:57,702
<i>Monty Stratton has not won</i>
<i>just a ballgame</i>.

1289
