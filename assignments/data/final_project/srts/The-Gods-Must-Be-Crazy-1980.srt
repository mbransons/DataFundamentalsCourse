1
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,491
<i>It looks like a paradise, but it is the
most treacherous desert in the world:</i>

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>The Kalahari.
After the short rainy season...</i>

3
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,498
<i>...there are many water holes,
and even rivers.</i>

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>But after a few weeks, the water sinks
away into the deep Kalahari sand.</i>

5
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>The water holes dry,
and the rivers stop flowing.</i>

6
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>The grass fades to a beautiful
blond colour...</i>

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,095
<i>...that offers excellent grazing for the animals.</i>

8
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,640
<i>But for the next nine months,
there'll be no water to drink.</i>

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>So most of the animals move away,
leaving the blond grass uneaten.</i>

10
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,609
<i>Humans avoid the Kalahari like the
plague because man must have water.</i>

11
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,446
<i>So the beautiful landscapes
are devoid of people.</i>

12
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,618
<i>Except for the little people
of the Kalahari.</i>

13
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>Pretty, dainty, small and graceful,
the Bushmen.</i>

14
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>Where any other person
would die of thirst in a few days...</i>

15
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,844
<i>...they live quite contentedly
in this desert.</i>

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>They know where to dig for roots
and bugs and tubers...</i>

17
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>...and which berries and pods
are good to eat.</i>

18
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,327
<i>Of course they know what to do
about water.</i>

19
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>In the early morning,
you can collect dewdrops...</i>

20
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>...from leaves that were carefully
laid out the previous evening.</i>

21
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>Or a plume of grass
can be a reservoir.</i>

22
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>If you have the know-how, a clump
of twigs can tell you where to dig...</i>

23
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>...and you come to light
with an enormous tuber.</i>

24
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>You scrape shavings off it with a stick
that is split for a sharp edge.</i>

25
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>You take a handful of the shavings, point
your thumb at your mouth and squeeze.</i>

26
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,915
<i>They must be the most
contented people in the world.</i>

27
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,627
<i>They have no crime, no punishment,
no violence, no laws...</i>

28
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,214
<i>...no police, judges, rulers or bosses.</i>

29
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:59,847
<i>They believe that the gods put only good
and useful things on the earth for them.</i>

30
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>In this world of theirs,
nothing is bad or evil.</i>

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>Even a poisonous snake is not bad.</i>

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>You just have to keep away
from the sharp end.</i>

33
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,780
<i>Actually, a snake is very good.
In fact, it's delicious.</i>

34
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,366
<i>And the skin makes a fine pouch.</i>

35
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,621
<i>They live in the vastness of the
Kalahari in small family groups.</i>

36
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,709
<i>One family of Bushmen might meet up
with another once in a few years.</i>

37
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,129
<i>But for the most part,
they live in complete isolation...</i>

38
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>...unaware there are other people
in the world.</i>

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,762
<i>In the deep Kalahari, there are Bushmen
who have not heard of civilized man.</i>

40
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,725
<i>Sometimes they hear a thundering
sound when there are no clouds.</i>

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,813
<i>They assume the gods have eaten too
much and their tummies are rumbling.</i>

42
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:54,151
<i>Sometimes they can even see
the evidence of the gods' flatulence.</i>

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,196
<i>Their language has
an idiosyncrasy of its own.</i>

44
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,866
<i>It seems to consist
mainly of clicking sounds.</i>

45
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,499
<i>They're very gentle people.</i>

46
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,627
<i>They'll never punish a child
or even speak harshly to it.</i>

47
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>So the kids are extremely well-behaved.
Their games are cute and inventive.</i>

48
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,476
<i>When the family needs meat...</i>

49
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,146
<i>...the hunter dips his arrow
in a brew that acts as a tranquilliser.</i>

50
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,858
<i>When he shoots a buck, it feels
a sting and the arrow drops out.</i>

51
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,736
<i>The buck runs away,
but soon it gets drowsy...</i>

52
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,947
<i>...and it stops running.</i>

53
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,910
<i>After a while, it goes to sleep.</i>

54
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:54,461
<i>The hunter apologizes. He explains
that his family needs the meat.</i>

55
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:00,759
<i>The characteristic which really makes
them different from all other races...</i>

56
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>...is that they have
no sense of ownership at all.</i>

57
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>Where they live,
there's nothing you can own.</i>

58
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,518
<i>Only trees and grass and animals.</i>

59
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,355
<i>These Bushmen have never seen
a stone or a rock in their lives.</i>

60
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,775
<i>The hardest things they know
are wood and bone.</i>

61
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:23,365
<i>They live in a gentle world, where nothing
is as hard as rock, steel or concrete.</i>

62
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,122
<i>Only 600 miles to the south,
there's a vast city.</i>

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,628
<i>And here you find civilized man.</i>

64
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,529
<i>Civilized man refused
to adapt himself to his environment.</i>

65
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,365
<i>Instead he adapted his environment
to suit him.</i>

66
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,452
<i>So he built cities, roads,
vehicles, machinery.</i>

67
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,873
<i>And he put up power lines
to run his labour-saving devices.</i>

68
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,958
<i>But he didn't know when to stop.</i>

69
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,253
<i>The more he improved his
surroundings to make life easier...</i>

70
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,631
<i>...the more complicated he made it.</i>

71
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,676
<i>Now his children are sentenced to
10 to 15 years of school, to learn...</i>

72
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,180
<i>...how to survive in this complex
and hazardous habitat.</i>

73
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,434
<i>And civilized man, who refused
to adapt to his surroundings...</i>

74
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,103
<i>...now finds he has to adapt
and re-adapt...</i>

75
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,274
<i>...every hour of the day
to his self-created environment.</i>

76
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,401
<i>For instance, if it's Monday...</i>

77
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:46,365
<i>...and 7:30 comes up, you have to dis-
adapt from your domestic surroundings...</i>

78
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:50,369
<i>...and re-adapt yourself to an
entirely different environment.</i>

79
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,338
<i>8:00 means everybody
has to look busy.</i>

80
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,221
I've got a good story
about handicapped children.

81
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:14,518
<i>Handicapped children? No! You don't
recommend stuff you don't...</i>

82
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:19,731
Sorry. I'll only print sweetness and light,
even if it bores the pants off them.

83
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,111
<i>10:30 means you can stop looking
busy for 15 minutes.</i>

84
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,032
<i>And then,
you have to look busy again.</i>

85
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,952
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Pete.

86
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,122
Can you use this about the
teacher shortage in Botswana?

87
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,623
- Good story?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,209
They'll take anybody
who can read and write.

89
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,921
I don't know. I got bawled out
for writing a story on mugging.

90
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,384
My page should be sweet and light,
like Liberace and Jackie Onassis.

91
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,096
<i>Your day is chopped into pieces.
In each segment of time...</i>

92
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:55,434
<i>- ...you adapt to new circumstances.</i>
- May I share a table?

93
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>No wonder some people go
off the rails a bit.</i>

94
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,109
Does the noise in my head
bother you?

95
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,904
No.

96
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,490
Still got that story about
the teacher shortage in Botswana?

97
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,119
- Yeah. You gonna use it?
- No. Maybe they can use me.

98
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:20,250
<i>In the Kalahari, it's always Tuesday,
or Thursday if you like. Or Sunday.</i>

99
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,296
<i>No clocks or calendars tell you
to do this or that.</i>

100
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,467
<i>Lately, strange new things
sometimes appeared in the sky.</i>

101
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>Noisy birds that flew
without flapping their wings.</i>

102
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,403
<i>One day, something fell from the sky.</i>

103
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,963
<i>Xi had never seen anything
like this in his life.</i>

104
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:10,968
<i>It looked like water, but it was harder
than anything else in the world.</i>

105
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:15,180
<i>He wondered why the gods
had sent this thing down to the earth.</i>

106
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,980
<i>It was the strangest and most
beautiful thing they had ever seen.</i>

107
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,441
<i>They wondered why the gods
had sent it to them.</i>

108
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,952
<i>Pabo got his finger stuck in the thing and
the children thought he was very funny.</i>

109
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:54,386
<i>Xi tried the thing out to cure thongs.
It had the right shape and weight.</i>

110
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,724
<i>It was also beautifully smooth
and ideal for curing snakeskin.</i>

111
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,481
<i>And Pabo discovered
you could make music on it.</i>

112
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:12,112
<i>And every day they discovered
a new use for the thing.</i>

113
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,993
<i>It was harder and heavier and smoother
than anything they'd ever known.</i>

114
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,413
<i>It was the most useful thing
the gods had ever given them.</i>

115
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,749
<i>A real labour-saving device.</i>

116
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,879
<i>But the gods had been careless.
They had sent only one.</i>

117
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,966
<i>Now, for the first time, here was a
thing that could not be shared...</i>

118
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,135
<i>...because there was only one of it.</i>

119
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,478
<i>Suddenly, everybody needed it
most of the time.</i>

120
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,773
<i>A thing they had never needed before
became a necessity.</i>

121
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,817
<i>And unfamiliar emotions
began to stir.</i>

122
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>A feeling of wanting to own,
of not wanting to share.</i>

123
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:08,919
<i>Other new things came.
Anger, jealousy, hate and violence.</i>

124
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,187
<i>Xi was angry with the gods.</i>

125
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,315
<i>He shouted, "Take back your thing!
We don't want it!</i>

126
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,276
<i>Look at the trouble it brought."</i>

127
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,194
<i>The gods did not take it back.</i>

128
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>He shouted, "You must be crazy
to send us this thing! Take it back!"</i>

129
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,784
<i>Then he shouted,
"Look out! Look out!"</i>

130
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,124
<i>But he spoke too late and
the thing felled his daughter Dani.</i>

131
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,061
<i>Xi carried the thing away
from the shelter and buried it.</i>

132
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,746
<i>That evening, there was no laughter
and no chatter around the family fire.</i>

133
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,417
<i>A strange feeling of shame
had come over the family...</i>

134
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,212
<i>...and they were very quiet.</i>

135
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:41,720
<i>Xi said, "I have buried the thing.
It will not make us unhappy again."</i>

136
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:01,365
<i>That night, a hyena smelled the blood
on the thing, and dug it up.</i>

137
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:11,834
<i>A bad-tempered warthog chased the
hyena away and it dropped the thing.</i>

138
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,965
<i>The next day, Dani found it.</i>

139
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,230
<i>Her brother Toma heard her playing on it
and said, "Let me try. Let me try too."</i>

140
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,730
<i>That night the family was very unhappy.</i>

141
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,575
<i>They began to talk about this thing.
They did not have a name for it.</i>

142
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,328
<i>They called it the "evil thing."</i>

143
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,045
<i>Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods
were absent-minded...</i>

144
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,881
<i>...when they dropped
the evil thing on the earth.</i>

145
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:46,220
<i>They've always sent only good things,
like rain, trees, roots and berries to eat.</i>

146
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:52,768
<i>We are their children and they love us.
But now they've sent this evil thing."</i>

147
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,734
<i>Xi said, "The thing does not
belong on the earth.</i>

148
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,696
<i>Tomorrow I will take it to the end
of the earth and throw it off."</i>

149
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,993
<i>Gobo said, "I think the end of the earth
must be very far.</i>

150
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,664
<i>I think you'll have to walk
for 20 days. Perhaps 40."</i>

151
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,919
<i>Xi said,
"I will start walking tomorrow."</i>

152
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,330
<i>Two thousand miles to the north
in the state of Birani...</i>

153
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,624
<i>...trouble was brewing.</i>

154
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,508
It's 35 million to combat erosion
in the valley.

155
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:11,096
- And 6 million for improvement of the...
- Hold it, minister. We can't expect...

156
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,470
Get out. We need the car.

157
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,953
That was Sam Boga's gang.
You said they were in Cabinda.

158
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,331
- That's what I thought.
- How many got away?

159
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,292
There were two jeeps.
Four got away.

160
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,961
- Sam Boga was there?
- No.

161
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:30,259
This time, he's got to die.
Find him and kill him yourself.

162
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,015
Bring him here.

163
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,526
Where is Sam Boga?

164
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,865
Where is your hideout?

165
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,704
Bring the one in the corridor.

166
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,456
Bring that one.

167
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:13,468
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?

168
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,220
Take them...

169
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,391
...to the helicopter.

170
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,901
They went south.

171
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,820
- I'll direct you from the helicopter.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,167
Gas guzzler.

173
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,045
<i>Four of the eight assassins
got away in two jeeps.</i>

174
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,216
<i>The other four were shot in the
Cabinet room by the security guards.</i>

175
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,344
- Bastards.
<i>- The assassins wore brown T-shirts...</i>

176
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,763
<i>...the trademark
of the terrorist gang...</i>

177
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,848
<i>...led by the notorious Sam Boga.</i>

178
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:05,562
<i>However, eyewitnesses state Sam Boga
did not take part in the assassination.</i>

179
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:10,651
<i>It is assumed that he masterminded the
attack, some distance from the capital.</i>

180
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,278
<i>Sources announced
that the assassins killed...</i>

181
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:17,282
<i>...the ministers of education,
public works and agriculture.</i>

182
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,954
<i>The president, who survived the hail
of bullets with only a flesh wound...</i>

183
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,998
<i>...will be addressing the nation
in a few moments.</i>

184
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:35,092
We did it! We did it! We got the
president, and five of his ministers!

185
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,594
You didn't, you know. That's him.

186
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,514
It was the will of the Almighty
that I was spared.

187
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,850
We mourn the deaths
of three members...

188
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,853
<i>...of my Cabinet.
We extend our deepest sympathies...</i>

189
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,605
He's lying. We got six.
I saw them go down.

190
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,818
You killed three and wounded five.

191
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,487
And you lost four.

192
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,408
Why do I have to work with
amateurs? Did you get away clean?

193
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,620
Yes, we were in and out in two
minutes. They will never find us.

194
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,061
Attention.

195
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,528
- What happened?
- We ran out of gas.

196
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:40,199
- How long ago?
- About 15 minutes, sir.

197
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,367
Okay, let's go!

198
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,083
Now, you tell me.

199
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,921
Where is Sam Boga?

200
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,382
Where is your hideout?

201
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,059
Next time you're going
to be a bit higher.

202
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:10,771
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

203
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,568
I'll tell you, I'll tell you! I'll show you.
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

204
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,071
I'll tell you. I'll show you where.

205
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,698
<i>- Do you hear me?</i>
- Right here, general.

206
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,327
<i>- Banana forest at Dumgaze. Follow me.</i>
- Right, general.

207
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:30,415
The man we want is the president,
not the bloody minister of education.

208
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,962
Understand? I'll come with you.
We'll get him in his bed.

209
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,756
Cover up! Cover up!

210
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,805
Come on. Mount the bazooka.
Move it, move it!

211
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,851
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

212
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,354
Now take cover. You, you go there.

213
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,148
Not there, you bloody fool.
Get out of there.

214
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,658
- Well?
- They're there. They're there.

215
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,786
You cannot see them,
but they're there.

216
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,957
Okay.

217
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,801
You see, there they are.

218
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,144
Okay. No, hold it.

219
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,205
Okay. Shit.

220
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,210
Cut it out, man!

221
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,087
Okay.

222
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,817
- Born to be our champion.
- You showed them.

223
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,819
- Beautiful, man.
- Hey.

224
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,446
Quiet.

225
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,408
Stand by.

226
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,385
Let's go.

227
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,983
<i>The most inquisitive creature
in Africa is the baboon.</i>

228
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,631
<i>Xi said,
"That is a very evil thing you've got.</i>

229
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:09,968
<i>You better give it back so I can
take it and throw it off the earth.</i>

230
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,639
<i>It brought unhappiness to my family.
If you don't give it to me...</i>

231
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,642
<i>...it'll bring grief to you
and your family too."</i>

232
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:23,524
<i>He spoke long and earnestly until
the baboon began to pay attention.</i>

233
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,070
<i>He must have convinced it,
and it dropped the thing.</i>

234
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,657
<i>And Xi said,
"You have done a very wise thing."</i>

235
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:59,560
<i>- So you want to go to Botswana?
- I want to get away from all this.</i>

236
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,228
<i>But in the Kalahari?</i>

237
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:05,399
<i>Mom, it's not in the Kalahari.
Botswana isn't all desert.</i>

238
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:07,836
Get in there. Why do they put the
nuts where you can't get at them?

239
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,673
Right in my bloody face.

240
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,638
Every year I have to lay here
on my back.

241
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:23,101
Keep it down a bit, Mpudi.
I'm trying to tune the scanner.

242
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,689
Okay, Mpudi. Go ahead.

243
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:32,736
Every year you come here with a bigger
and better tent and equipment.

244
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:38,242
And every year, you turn up with this
and I have to work my ass off.

245
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:45,040
That's funny. This elephant's dung
shows a complete lack of boron.

246
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,511
Hello, Reverend.
What are you doing on a horse?

247
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,681
I hit a rock with my crankcase.
Cracked it wide open.

248
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:04,393
The trouble is, I have to meet the
new schoolteacher at Mabula.

249
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,688
You can have that one,
but she's in a terrible shape.

250
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,482
We've been knocking around
in the Hamadulas.

251
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,696
I promised Mpudi that I'd work here,
so he could have a week to patch it.

252
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,364
Here, Reverend.

253
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,367
- Thank you.
- Get in there, you bloody...

254
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,327
Morning, Mpudi.

255
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,163
Morning, Mpudi.

256
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,249
- Morning.
- Will this make it to Mabula and back?

257
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,210
She's gonna be a bastard to start.
Sorry, Reverend.

258
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:35,132
- I put in new rings and they're tight.
- But will she make it?

259
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,259
You said I could have a whole week.

260
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,930
This is an emergency. We want to know
if she'll make it to Mabula and back.

261
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,975
I haven't looked at the brakes
or steering gear.

262
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,019
- Mpudi.
- Okay, she'll make it.

263
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,607
As soon as I connect the steering
rack, but she'll be a bastard to start.

264
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,610
There we are, Reverend.
Then she'll be all yours.

265
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:59,406
I don't think I can handle her.
I hear Mpudi calls her the antichrist.

266
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,951
Well, she is a thing.

267
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,499
I was hoping... I was ho...

268
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,675
- I was hoping you could go.
- I'm very awkward around women.

269
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,303
- Yes, aren't we all?
- No, it's not like that.

270
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:26,183
When I'm in the presence of a lady,
my brain switches off or something.

271
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,394
- I turn into an idiot.
- You ought to meet more women.

272
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:33,899
- It only gets worse.
- But you will do this for me?

273
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,869
Come on, Prince. Come on. Go, boy.

274
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,581
Come on, boy.
Come on, come on. Okay.

275
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,125
Okay.

276
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:57,548
Son of a...
Choke. Choke, choke, choke, choke.

277
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,304
You tried to murder me,
you son of a...

278
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,350
Don't switch her off or let her stall.
You'll never start her.

279
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,019
Don't park on a slope.
You got no hand brake.

280
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,813
Now you tell me.

281
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,398
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Andrew.

282
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,359
- Take care, now. Goodbye.
- Bye, Mpudi.

283
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:31,915
<i>One day, a very noisy animal rushed
past where Xi was sleeping.</i>

284
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:39,631
<i>It left very peculiar tracks, as if two
enormous snakes had slithered past.</i>

285
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,319
Everybody lie down on the ground.

286
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:18,280
All of you, lie down!

287
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,616
Come on, lie down, you and you!

288
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,618
Everybody lie down!

289
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,747
Hey, you! Didn't you hear me?
Lie down!

290
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,795
He can't hear you, sir.

291
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,506
- He's deaf.
- Shut up!

292
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,399
Hey, wake up!
Come and give us petrol here.

293
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:37,192
Did two jeeps pass here?

294
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,820
Yes, sir. They took half my stock.

295
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:43,282
They took a big can of petrol,
and they made me to lie down.

296
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,368
If you find them, ask them.
They must pay me my money.

297
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,203
It's a lot of stuff they took.

298
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,927
Morning.

299
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,521
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes.

300
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,940
- My name...
- How do...?

301
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,736
My name... My name is...

302
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,363
My name...

303
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,586
My name is Andrew Steyn.

304
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,880
How do you do?

305
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:44,843
The Reverend cracked his crankcase,
so he asked me to...

306
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:00,651
Thank you.

307
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,343
How far do we have to go?

308
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,680
How far do we have to go?

309
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:30,973
How...?

310
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,599
Oh, sorry.

311
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:39,940
Hello, Andrew.

312
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,608
Hello, Phineas.

313
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,194
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

314
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:46,822
- I'm sorry, madam. Sorry.
- It's all right.

315
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:49,199
Here. I'm truly sorry,
madam. Sorry.

316
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,784
It's all right.

317
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,750
What are you doing?

318
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,638
What...? What...? What are you...?
Your brakes are shot.

319
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,348
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

320
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,685
I'm opening the gate.

321
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,690
How do I get out of here?

322
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,818
No, it's all right. I...

323
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:31,241
Now I just...

324
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:46,006
- Oh, this is too weird. I'm getting out.
- No, it's okay. I just have to...

325
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,761
- What are you doing now?
- I'm closing the gate. But don't worry.

326
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:54,431
Are you crazy? It has no brakes!
Do you wanna get me killed?

327
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,684
- Are you crazy?
- All right, it'll come back.

328
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,938
- What?
- The Land Rover, it'll come back.

329
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,483
- What do you mean, it'll come back?
- It's all right.

330
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,445
- I suppose you think it was funny.
- I'm sorry. The brakes don't work.

331
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:10,906
I noticed.

332
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:36,807
<i>Xi saw a strange-looking person,
and greeted him.</i>

333
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,685
<i>But the man didn't hear him.</i>

334
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:50,737
<i>Xi said, "This is a funny stick.
Did it grow on a tree?"</i>

335
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,507
<i>He couldn't understand
why he ran away.</i>

336
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:14,136
<i>He realized the man must've seen
the evil thing he was carrying.</i>

337
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,804
<i>That's what made him run.</i>

338
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,535
- She stopped.
- I noticed.

339
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,954
Can you start her again?

340
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:44,833
No. We gave her new rings,
and they're very tight.

341
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,296
- How far are we from the mission?
- About 30 miles.

342
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,090
- Will we get there before dark?
- I don't know.

343
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:56,053
- This thing has stopped.
- I noticed.

344
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,138
Are you sure you can't start her?

345
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,391
Yes. This morning it took a horse
and three men.

346
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,477
- So now what?
- I can make a fire.

347
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,772
And there's some food
and a sleeping bag.

348
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,148
Spend the night?

349
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,275
I'm afraid so.

350
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:12,236
You sure this thing's stopped?

351
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:15,405
Yes. Didn't you notice?

352
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,329
I can carry you across.
Then you don't have to...

353
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,790
Okay.

354
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,925
Watch it! Be careful!

355
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,304
Thank you.

356
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:43,976
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,730
- I'm sorry.
- Look at my dress! I lost my shoes!

358
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,900
- Your what?
- My shoes.

359
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:55,821
I'm sorry.

360
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:57,698
Well, watch it, buster.

361
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,451
I'm sorry.

362
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:04,580
- Sorry. I'll fetch your bags.
- No! You'll drop them!

363
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,249
I'll get them myself.

364
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,879
I'm all right. I'm okay.

365
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,852
Leave that one. I don't need it.

366
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,573
Idiot.

367
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:10,103
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! Don't you dare!

368
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,815
- Go away!
- It's all right. She's gone!

369
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:15,609
Keep away! You keep away from me!

370
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,320
No, I wasn't... There was this warthog.

371
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,697
- What warthog?
- She's gone, but...

372
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,908
Keep away.

373
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:24,785
- I wasn't...
- Go away!

374
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,289
I wasn't...

375
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,501
I didn't...

376
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:36,547
<i>Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.</i>

377
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:42,928
<i>The rhino is the self-appointed
fire-prevention officer.</i>

378
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:47,432
<i>When he sees a fire,
he rushes in and stamps it out.</i>

379
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,828
- Do you work here in Botswana?
- Yes, I... Yes. Yes.

380
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,913
And what do you do?

381
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,168
I... I collect manure. I...

382
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,712
Get away from... Get away from...

383
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,090
Leave me alone!

384
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,285
Miss Thompson?

385
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,748
Miss Thompson?

386
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,211
Miss Thompson!

387
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:01,590
Miss Thompson!
Oh, it's all right. He's gone.

388
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,717
- Who's gone?
- The rhinoceros.

389
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:05,594
What bloody rhinoceros?

390
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,639
Didn't you see him?
He stamped out the fire.

391
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,807
You stamped out the fire.
I saw you.

392
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,394
No, he did it first.
I didn't want him to come back, so...

393
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,480
- But didn't you see?
- Keep away.

394
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:22,611
Miss Thompson, if you make a fire,
and a rhinoceros sees it...

395
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,655
...he comes and stamps it out.

396
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:29,159
Rhinos do that.
It's a most interesting phenomenon.

397
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:32,996
You get sudden urges, and come
up with warthogs and rhinoceroses.

398
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:37,668
All right, I'll show you.
I'll make another fire.

399
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:42,673
Think I'm lying. I'll show you.

400
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:51,181
You see how I'm making another fire?

401
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,226
You'll see he'll come back.
Think I'm a liar.

402
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,654
Maybe it's too far away.

403
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,573
Maybe it's upwind.

404
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:25,465
Mr. Steyn.

405
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:43,859
Ask them. They'll tell you
rhinoceroses always stamp out fires.

406
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:45,777
I don't speak the language.

407
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,572
Okay, I'll ask them.

408
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,747
- See?
- I noticed.

409
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:01,877
They're Tswanas. They always shake
their heads when they mean to say yes.

410
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,408
What are you doing?

411
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,453
I'm making coffee.

412
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,303
Some people didn't show
me their passports.

413
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:57,057
They smashed the barrier.
They've got guns. This is Frank.

414
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,142
<i>- Were they in two jeeps?</i>
- Yes, sir.

415
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,979
<i>They're being followed by
armoured cars. Can you see them?</i>

416
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,481
Excuse me, sir.

417
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,194
- Yes, sir. I can see one.
<i>- Stop them!</i>

418
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:10,696
Yes, sir.

419
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,365
Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

420
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,162
<i>Frank?</i>

421
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,373
<i>Frank? Frank, what was that noise?</i>

422
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,334
<i>Frank?</i>

423
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,004
I stopped them, sir.

424
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:30,507
<i>Right. Explain that they cannot cross
our border under arms.</i>

425
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:34,052
<i>We cannot allow them to violate
our territorial integrity.</i>

426
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:38,974
Request permission to cross
your border in hot pursuit of Sam Boga.

427
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:42,811
<i>Sorry. We cannot allow an armed force
to come into Botswana.</i>

428
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:45,689
I gotta get Sam Boga.
He shot up half our Cabinet.

429
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:49,902
<i>Our police will track him down and
hand him over to you, dead or alive.</i>

430
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:03,415
Bye. Bye. Can't they help us?

431
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,918
They'll take a message to the river.

432
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:09,004
I think I can get the thing
out of the river.

433
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:12,591
There's an electric winch on the front.

434
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:28,250
Mr. Steyn?

435
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,003
Mr. Steyn!

436
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:36,341
- Miss Thompson?
- Could you help me, please?

437
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,760
Don't look.

438
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:43,515
That's a watape tree. You mustn't go
near a watape tree. They grab you.

439
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:48,020
Could you hand me my gown, please?
It's in the suitcase.

440
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,361
The pink one with the white edging.

441
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:09,041
Ow! Thank you.

442
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,171
Sorry.

443
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,100
Sorry.

444
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,528
Sorry.

445
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,510
Thank you very much. Thank you.

446
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:38,255
<i>That morning, Xi saw the ugliest
person he'd ever come across.</i>

447
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,259
<i>She was as pale as something
that had crawled out of a rotting log.</i>

448
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,094
<i>Her hair was quite gruesome...</i>

449
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:47,347
<i>...long and stringy and white,
as if she was very old.</i>

450
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,891
<i>She was very big.</i>

451
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:53,353
<i>You'd have to dig the whole day
to find enough food to feed her.</i>

452
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,403
Go away.

453
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:07,451
<i>Although it was a hot day,
she was wearing skins...</i>

454
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:11,288
<i>...that looked as if they
were made from cobwebs.</i>

455
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:17,961
<i>She was doing strange
and magical things.</i>

456
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:20,506
<i>It struck him that she must be
one of the gods.</i>

457
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:23,008
<i>He wondered what she
was doing on earth.</i>

458
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:26,178
<i>He was glad he met her.
He'd give her the evil thing...</i>

459
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,305
<i>...and go home to his family.</i>

460
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:32,809
<i>He said tactfully that he didn't need
the thing, and she could have it back.</i>

461
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:36,730
<i>But she was very rude,
and she walked away.</i>

462
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:44,321
- That's a Bushman. How'd he get here?
- I don't know. He's rude.

463
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,241
<i>There was another god.
He had a fire inside him.</i>

464
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,160
<i>The smoke came out
through his mouth and nostrils.</i>

465
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:53,872
<i>Xi said politely, "It was kind of you
to send us this thing...</i>

466
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,875
<i>...but it made my family unhappy.
Please take it."</i>

467
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:59,211
Sorry, <i>no sabe</i>.

468
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,463
Where's the truck?

469
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,480
I'll try and get it down.

470
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:23,193
<i>There was a peculiar sound, and Xi saw
a most amazing animal approaching.</i>

471
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,863
<i>Its legs went around
instead of up and down.</i>

472
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:28,574
<i>And there was
a weird-looking god on its back.</i>

473
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,493
<i>He wore blue skin on his head
and red on his body.</i>

474
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,495
<i>And hair grew on his face.</i>

475
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:37,541
What the hell happened?
Where have you been?

476
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,169
<i>The funny thing was
that they couldn't speak.</i>

477
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,087
<i>They made sounds like monkeys.</i>

478
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:46,466
- Hi.
- What happened? Where's the antichrist?

479
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:53,015
What the hell did you do that for, huh?

480
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:55,684
I'll tell you later. Let's get it down.

481
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:58,937
And the little Bushman?
What's he doing in these parts?

482
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:02,232
I don't know. He was trying
to tell me something.

483
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,570
- You speak Bushman?
- Yeah.

484
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:12,659
<i>The hairy one could speak.</i>

485
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:20,834
He says, "Thanks for the bottle,
but you can have it back."

486
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,503
I didn't give it to him.

487
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,924
- Well, he don't want the bottle.
- Then he'd better throw it away.

488
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:32,554
<i>The hairy one said, "We don't want it.
You'll have to throw it away yourself."</i>

489
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,681
<i>Xi was very disappointed.</i>

490
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:38,227
<i>It was unfair of the gods to make him
throw it off the earth.</i>

491
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:43,315
<i>In fact, he began to doubt
whether they really were gods.</i>

492
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:57,329
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get in there.

493
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:00,666
Get in there! Move it! Move it!

494
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:04,670
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

495
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:34,908
Yes, yes, yes. Here comes
the great white hunter to the rescue.

496
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:36,618
Miss Thompson, I presume.

497
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:40,289
Hello, Steyn. How would you like
to travel in style for a change?

498
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,958
Yes, thank you.

499
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:47,546
How do you open this thing?
With a can opener?

500
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,052
Quaint. Milady?

501
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:57,723
- Thank you very much, Mr. Steyn, for...
- Bye-bye, Steyn.

502
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,141
Goodbye, Miss Thompson.

503
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,934
By the way, I am Jack Hind.

504
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:04,146
The Reverend's worried.
He got to me on the short-wave...

505
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,483
...so I offered to look for you.
That was very sweet of me.

506
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,194
- It sure was.
- Would you like to sit over there?

507
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,570
Sure.

508
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:14,531
Thank you, Mr. Steyn.

509
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,951
See you, Steyn. See you, Mpudi.

510
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:55,072
I don't want to talk about it.

511
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:59,618
She thinks I'm a lunatic,
and I don't blame her.

512
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:04,957
You know, she asks me what do I do,
and I say I collect manure.

513
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:08,418
I don't tell her I analyse it
for my doctoral thesis.

514
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:11,922
I bet you she thinks I shovel the stuff.

515
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:15,759
Was it rough?

516
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,595
I'd rather not talk about it.

517
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:20,222
That rough.

518
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,517
It won't be long now,
and your suffering will be over.

519
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:27,437
When you get there, you'll have to
stand there and look beautiful...

520
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:30,774
...while the whole tribe sings
their welcome song at you.

521
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,944
Then you can relax, have a bath
and a nice breakfast.

522
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:38,157
Is it true that when a rhino sees a fire,
he stamps it out?

523
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:42,452
Where did you hear that one?
Did Steyn tell you?

524
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:44,454
Why would he tell you that?

525
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:47,291
I'd rather not talk about it.

526
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:51,461
- Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
- That's all I need.

527
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:58,802
She wouldn't believe me about
the warthog and the rhinoceros.

528
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,805
- What bloody rhinoceros?
- I don't want to talk about it.

529
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:04,850
So how did this thing get up the tree?

530
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:08,854
She got stuck in a watape tree
and I had to...

531
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,566
You know she's got flowers
on her panties?

532
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,903
So that's how this thing got up the tree.

533
01:02:16,153 --> 01:02:18,197
Yes.

534
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,364
Don't I wave or take a bow
or something?

535
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:02,199
No.

536
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:23,428
<i>Notorious Communist guerrilla leader
Sam Boga and his band...</i>

537
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,848
<i>...have crashed through into Botswana.</i>

538
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:29,059
<i>- They are heading for Mozambique.</i>
- Well, how many?

539
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:30,936
Not even 300.

540
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:33,438
I told you bastards,
don't waste ammunition!

541
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:35,941
Now we can't even fight back anymore.

542
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,487
All of you switch your guns over
from automatic to single-fire.

543
01:03:40,946 --> 01:03:44,491
<i>Anyone withholding information
which could lead to their capture...</i>

544
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,286
That's automatic. That's single.

545
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,873
<i>Citizens are warned that Sam Boga
is a dangerous person...</i>

546
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:55,586
<i>...and that he and his gang
are well-armed. So it'll be unwise...</i>

547
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:57,504
And why are you so beautiful?

548
01:03:57,671 --> 01:03:59,965
I'm going to the school
to give her these.

549
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,800
You gonna look like that?

550
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,677
- Like what?
- Like it's a funeral.

551
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:06,471
You've gotta smile
and tell her she looks good.

552
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,474
How are you an expert on women?

553
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,684
I got seven wives. How many you got?

554
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:14,188
- Why aren't you at home with them?
- I know how to marry them.

555
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:18,609
- Nobody knows how to live with them.
- So, what did you marry them for?

556
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:23,405
Someday I have to tell you
the facts of life.

557
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:32,498
"And yet we all agree
that every plate we break...

558
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:35,292
...was cracked by Mr. Nobody.

559
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:39,171
'Tis he who tears our books, who..."

560
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:58,524
Come in.

561
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,819
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

562
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,655
Morning, class.

563
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,491
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

564
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,869
I... I brought...

565
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:38,105
Please, just leave it.

566
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:43,569
I brought you your shoes.

567
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:51,493
Come in.

568
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,210
Come in.

569
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,757
Shoe.

570
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,779
You don't want to talk about it, huh?

571
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:32,826
Shame.

572
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,427
<i>The animals looked ridiculous
but good to eat...</i>

573
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:51,929
<i>...and he was hungry.</i>

574
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:27,881
<i>Suddenly a young boy made
chattering noises at Xi.</i>

575
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,843
<i>So he said, "I shot
one of those animals.</i>

576
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:34,513
<i>It'll go to sleep soon,
and then we can eat it."</i>

577
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:40,018
<i>But the boy ran away, maybe to call
his family to join in the feast.</i>

578
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,708
<i>There was a weird sound...</i>

579
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:06,670
<i>...and another of those strange animals
with the round legs appeared.</i>

580
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:13,886
<i>The young boy and a grownup got
out of it, and seemed very excited.</i>

581
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:17,431
<i>Xi said, "Come, sit down.
There's enough meat for all of us."</i>

582
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:25,647
<i>But the man was rude and greedy.
He took the whole animal.</i>

583
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:30,777
<i>He said, "You have very bad manners.</i>

584
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,948
<i>If you eat the whole thing,
I'll have to shoot another for myself."</i>

585
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:40,829
<i>The man shouted,
but he didn't want anything to do...</i>

586
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:44,208
<i>...with such an uncouth person,
so he ignored him.</i>

587
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:47,211
<i>Suddenly there was a thunderclap.</i>

588
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:51,048
<i>The animals ran away, and he ran
after them. He was very hungry.</i>

589
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:10,901
Do you speak English?

590
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:14,446
You are free to remain silent
until you have seen your lawyer.

591
01:09:14,613 --> 01:09:18,867
If you speak now, whatever you say will
be taken down as evidence against you.

592
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,053
And why are you so beautiful?

593
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,055
I got to go to court.

594
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:41,765
What did you do?

595
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:46,019
The cops were here. They say they
caught a little Bushman for stock theft.

596
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:50,149
They say all he can speak is "Xixo,"
so they want me to interpret.

597
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:53,735
Call me now. Xixo.

598
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,534
<i>They brought Xi into a place
with several people.</i>

599
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:04,580
<i>He smiled at them in greeting,
but nobody smiled back.</i>

600
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:17,134
Interpreter.

601
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:28,770
You, Xixo, are hereby charged with
wrongfully and unlawfully slaughtering...

602
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:33,400
...one goat on the 21st of September,
1980, in Oniamatokwe.

603
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:36,320
How plead you?
Guilty or not guilty?

604
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:40,324
<i>Mpudi found it difficult to interpret
because, in his language...</i>

605
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:42,534
<i>...there was no word for "guilty."</i>

606
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:48,582
Finally he asked,
"Did you shoot an animal?"

607
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:53,629
<i>Xi said, "Yes, I did, but that man took it.
He did not want to share it with me."</i>

608
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:57,257
- Well, what does he plead?
- Not guilty.

609
01:10:57,424 --> 01:11:01,845
- They gave him the death sentence.
- For killing a goat? No.

610
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:06,975
Three months in jail, same thing.
He gonna die for sure.

611
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:10,270
He never seen a wall.
Now, he got walls all around him.

612
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:12,564
But didn't you explain to them?

613
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:16,985
- They said, "Silence in court."
- Yeah, but surely they ought to know.

614
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,614
Nobody knows the Bushmen.

615
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,742
Nobody ever goes
into the deep Kalahari.

616
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:26,537
How come you know so much
about them?

617
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:31,416
When Botswana belonged to the British,
I hit a policeman for insulting my father.

618
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,670
So I fled, right into the Kalahari.

619
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,548
I died, you know. Dehydration.

620
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:40,551
Some of those little buggers
found me, and buried me.

621
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,052
Only my head stuck out.

622
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:45,430
For two weeks, they pushed water
and food into my mouth.

623
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:48,016
And when they dug me up,
I was nearly white.

624
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:49,518
Like you.

625
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:54,273
I lived with them for three years.
They're the sweetest little buggers.

626
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:56,733
He gonna die for sure.

627
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:11,832
Can I go to Mahadi tomorrow?

628
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:14,459
You wanna go and see
little what's his name?

629
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,837
I want to get him out.

630
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:19,047
Now, don't do anything silly.

631
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:21,300
They got to let him out.

632
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:24,845
Maybe if we explain to them.

633
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:28,599
- You coming too?
- Yes.

634
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:52,122
Says he's sorry.
He try to eat the food tomorrow.

635
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:56,210
- Has he eaten anything? It's been a week.
- No.

636
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:01,632
Of course we're worried.
We can't force-feed him.

637
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,676
- You've got to let him out.
- He's got 11 weeks to go.

638
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:08,555
Well, is there no way?
Can't we buy him out or something?

639
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:12,267
Well, if somebody wants to employ
him as a convict-labourer.

640
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,978
But he has no experience,
no qualifications.

641
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,897
He got qualifications.

642
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:20,108
He can teach you things
about plants and animals.

643
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:24,488
Yes. We want to employ him
as an ecological expert.

644
01:13:33,872 --> 01:13:36,625
He will have to remain in your employ
for the full 11 weeks.

645
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:40,504
If he leaves, we will hunt him down
and lock him up for a long time.

646
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:42,381
Okay, thanks.

647
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,773
We can't put him inside.

648
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,608
No, you're right.

649
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:49,656
I understand the words,
but the meaning...

650
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:54,119
Talks about a bad thing,
an evil thing.

651
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:56,371
And about the end of the world.

652
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:00,834
Well, explain to him he has
to stay with us for the full 11 weeks.

653
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:05,214
- He doesn't know from weeks.
- We'll tell him when it's okay to go.

654
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,516
- Hello, Andrew. Mpudi.
- Hello, Jack.

655
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:17,810
I hear a Bushman's working for you.

656
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:19,978
Yeah, his name is Xi.

657
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:22,856
- Are they good trackers?
- Best in the world.

658
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:24,399
Mind if I borrow him?

659
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:27,319
One of my guests wounded a cougar.
My trackers can't find it.

660
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,245
This is where we lost him.

661
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,518
You'll see, he'll find him.

662
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,576
Hey! Hey!

663
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:31,800
Scram, go away!

664
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:34,470
Get!

665
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:39,933
Go away!

666
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:57,576
- I'm sorry, I didn't realise...
- I don't want to talk about it.

667
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,214
What do you want?

668
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:14,301
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Get them out.

669
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,721
Come on. Get him.
Hurry up, man.

670
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:32,820
You can drop those guns.

671
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,162
Bastard.

672
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:44,248
You want me to let fly?

673
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:50,963
Now get out.
With your hands up.

674
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:58,971
Bring out all the kids.

675
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:05,644
Sergeant, I'm going to walk due east
from here to Motambe...

676
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:08,021
...and I'm taking
all these kids with me.

677
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:11,358
If I see one truck or one aeroplane
or one policeman...

678
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:14,027
...or one soldier or one person...

679
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:16,780
...we'll mow these kids down.

680
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,199
- Have you got shortwave in there?
- Yes.

681
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:25,164
Now get on to headquarters, and tell them
I want a corridor 10 miles wide.

682
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:29,001
The army and the police
better clear out everybody.

683
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:32,546
And they've got to put down food
and water every 20 miles.

684
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:36,884
And then get the hell out of the way
before we get there. Tell them that.

685
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,181
All right, get them into a circle.
I want a big circle around me.

686
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:45,809
Leave the small ones. It's miles
to Motambe. They'll never make it.

687
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,398
Okay, now buzz off.

688
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:53,567
Clear out the people from this end...

689
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:56,862
...because I want to start marching
in two hours.

690
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:03,535
And I warn you,
you better clear out everybody.

691
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:09,333
Clutch.

692
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,590
Brake. Brake.

693
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,635
Clutch. Clutch!

694
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,642
I'm teaching him to drive.
Just for the hell of it.

695
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:29,269
Nothing else to do around here anyhow.

696
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:32,439
- Still mooning about the schoolmarm?
- Sort of.

697
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:35,984
I want to move up to Nioko for a
few days so we can do a game count.

698
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:39,613
- How will this get us through the jungle?
- We strip it down.

699
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,923
Come on, Xi. Come on!

700
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,680
He don't know from doors.

701
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:43,051
Stop playing that bloody game.

702
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,554
Okay, it's time. Let's go.
Move them.

703
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,097
Come on. Everybody up.

704
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:50,225
Come on, let's go.
Keep them going.

705
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,186
Keep them in a circle around me.

706
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,855
Move them!
Don't leave any stragglers.

707
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,399
- Keep your paws to yourself!
- Shut up.

708
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:01,320
Get them into a circle.
A circle, a circle!

709
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:06,116
- Stop yelling at them.
- That's not a bloody circle.

710
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:08,827
- Can't you do anything right?
- I can't get them into a circle.

711
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,746
They keep coming up in a square.

712
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:13,582
Then, make it a square.
Let them walk in a square.

713
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,710
Keep them going.
Don't let them straggle.

714
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:20,088
Who says they'll come this way?

715
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:23,717
He says he wants a corridor
10 miles wide.

716
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:28,597
I'm sorry. We'll have to get out of the way
for now until he passes this point.

717
01:21:28,806 --> 01:21:30,724
Where can I find Andrew Steyn?

718
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:33,727
You'd better warn him too.
He's five miles that way.

719
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:35,354
You turn right at the...

720
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:37,523
Damn it, I'll come and show you.

721
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:40,901
Johnny, will you take them to Machadi?

722
01:21:57,084 --> 01:22:01,129
- Tell them to sing.
- Come on, everybody. Sing, sing!

723
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:26,673
Wouldn't you know?

724
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,425
Now where do we find him?

725
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,641
They left this morning.

726
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,352
Come on!

727
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,674
They went through.

728
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,801
They'll meet up with Boga for sure.

729
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:14,596
- Is there a way around this?
- It's a hell of a long way.

730
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,473
Well, let's go.

731
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:49,798
Mpudi.

732
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:14,239
One, two, three, four, five...

733
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,533
...six adult oryx.

734
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:23,373
He says there are people
things down there.

735
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,584
- Where?
- Down there.

736
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,806
Army truck. Unloading something.

737
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:42,976
I wonder what they're up to.

738
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:49,650
Looks like food.
Cooking pots and stuff.

739
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:51,902
Maybe it's a picnic.

740
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,405
Funny. They're going away.

741
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:02,329
- They went away and left their stuff.
- Yeah, funny.

742
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,166
Oh, well.

743
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,877
One, two, three, four, five, six...

744
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,025
You've got to let them rest.

745
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,695
The smaller ones can't keep up.

746
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,030
They can rest
when they get to the food.

747
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:40,534
- You're driving them too hard.
- It's a long way to Motambe.

748
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,829
You said 20 miles.
They can't walk 20 miles without eating.

749
01:26:44,037 --> 01:26:45,455
Halt!

750
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,923
Look at that!

751
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:58,969
I told you,
stop playing that bloody game!

752
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:05,976
You've got to let
the little ones turn back.

753
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,978
Nobody turns back.

754
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:11,732
Next thing,
everybody's gonna get sore feet.

755
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,735
Next one drops out, I shoot him!

756
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,780
You, you, help her.
If you got to carry her, carry her.

757
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:22,951
If I catch you playing again,
by God...

758
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:24,995
March!

759
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:28,165
They can't march 20 miles.
They're not soldiers!

760
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:32,085
If they want to eat,
they'd better march 20 miles!

761
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:37,633
Are you scared it'll spoil your image
if you admit you made a mistake?

762
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:41,428
Halt!

763
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:50,604
You! Come here!

764
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:58,779
See that hill over there?

765
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,033
Go to the top, and wave this thing
until the army people see you.

766
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:09,331
Then you go down to them, and
tell them Sam Boga made a mistake.

767
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:16,046
Now I want them to leave food
every 10 miles.

768
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:17,965
- Understand?
- Yes.

769
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,092
Now, get going. Move!

770
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,223
March!

771
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:28,642
One ostrich and four, five...

772
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:31,436
...six, seven, eight...

773
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:45,534
A lot of children. The food
must have been left there for them.

774
01:28:45,701 --> 01:28:48,162
- What the hell? They've got guns.
- The kids?

775
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:52,583
No. There are men down there
with guns. It's no picnic.

776
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:55,335
I think those kids are hostages.

777
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:58,172
What was that on the news
about Sam Boga?

778
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:07,514
That man said I must go to the top,
and I must wave my conga.

779
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,856
So Miss Kate said 20 miles
is too much.

780
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,400
- Is she down there?
- Yes.

781
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:32,039
We'll have to immobilise them.

782
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:35,501
- Are Bushmen good stalkers?
- Best in the world.

783
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:37,586
Let him have a look at them.

784
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,136
All right.

785
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:51,225
Explain to him that the men with the guns
are bad. We have to put them to sleep.

786
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,234
He want to know how did
those people get in there?

787
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,070
No, no, they're not...

788
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:05,572
You explain.

789
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:07,741
One hour, then we move!

790
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,160
I'm gonna have a snooze.

791
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,353
"Dear Miss Thompson:

792
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:41,108
Your abductors have been injected
with an immobiliser.

793
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:44,820
When they go to sleep,
you must disarm them."

794
01:30:45,696 --> 01:30:49,366
Tell him he must give her the note
only after he's shot all the men.

795
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:56,957
When he shoots, he must
pull back on the thread quickly...

796
01:30:57,124 --> 01:31:01,128
...so the man can think it was a horsefly
or a wasp that stung him.

797
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:12,723
He's fast. It'll work.

798
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,601
He must dip the needle each time.

799
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:53,138
I can't see the little bugger.

800
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,224
Yeah, I see him.

801
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,119
Now, look at that.

802
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:18,747
Yeah, he's clever.

803
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:26,523
Nothing's happening down there.

804
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:28,525
It takes time.

805
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,492
Who are you?

806
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:23,580
Some of those guys are down.
She'll need help when they wake up.

807
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:29,169
Hey, wake up, man.
You gotta wake up.

808
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:33,132
Come on, you can't sleep now.
Come on.

809
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:59,950
We need some rope.
There's plenty in the Land Rover.

810
01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:02,828
He can fetch it.
I didn't teach him for nothing.

811
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,210
Says he don't understand the gears.

812
01:35:12,004 --> 01:35:14,882
- Told him he can drive in any gear.
- Let's go!

813
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:16,758
And you take that one.

814
01:35:16,925 --> 01:35:19,178
And you, that one.

815
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:20,387
And I'll take...

816
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:24,558
There's only six.
There should be eight.

817
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:36,945
Maybe they're asleep as well.
I don't know.

818
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,201
All right.

819
01:35:42,618 --> 01:35:45,746
I want you to circulate
among the children.

820
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:49,458
Quietly. And tell them that
when we grab the guns...

821
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:53,295
...they must run fast into that crevice
behind us and take cover.

822
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:55,631
Okay? Good.

823
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,521
Ready? Go!

824
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:18,278
Come on!

825
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,497
No! Get down, get down!

826
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:31,250
And stay there!

827
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,673
Get back! All of you!

828
01:36:39,758 --> 01:36:41,468
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry.

829
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:57,651
We've got to outflank them.
You go around. I'll keep you covered.

830
01:37:19,423 --> 01:37:21,425
Get back! Get back!

831
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:24,052
Hurry up!

832
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:37,816
- You okay?
- Yep.

833
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:39,776
- Who are they shooting at?
- I don't know.

834
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:46,783
Four, five, six.

835
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:48,327
Two are missing.

836
01:37:48,535 --> 01:37:51,205
This one here, and I heard
shots from over there.

837
01:38:00,798 --> 01:38:01,840
Look.

838
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:19,733
Roll over.

839
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,278
Mpudi, hold him.

840
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:51,867
What's happened?

841
01:39:52,284 --> 01:39:54,244
Have you got water in there?

842
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:56,413
Hold these for me.

843
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:03,962
- Get up.
- But what happened, man?

844
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:06,048
Oh, it's a long story.

845
01:40:06,548 --> 01:40:09,384
What happened to those guys?
Are they all dead?

846
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:12,429
Did you kill them?

847
01:40:12,596 --> 01:40:14,223
They've been immobilised.

848
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:16,683
Where's Kate and the kids?

849
01:40:16,809 --> 01:40:19,561
They're hiding back there.
They can come out now.

850
01:40:19,728 --> 01:40:21,396
Oh, my God. Mpudi.

851
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,234
Keep that guy covered.

852
01:40:32,282 --> 01:40:36,578
Kate! It's okay.
You can come out now!

853
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:42,918
We've got everything under control.
You can come out!

854
01:40:43,085 --> 01:40:46,046
- Jack?
- Hi there. The marines have landed.

855
01:40:46,255 --> 01:40:48,590
It's okay. You can all come out.

856
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:52,052
All right, come on. Come on.

857
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:09,528
You're safe now.

858
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:13,657
Better collect those men before
they wake up. You were right.

859
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:16,827
- Did you fix him good?
- Yeah, get up.

860
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,247
Walk.

861
01:41:29,631 --> 01:41:32,134
Boy, you had a tough time, huh?

862
01:41:32,885 --> 01:41:33,927
Watch out!

863
01:41:34,136 --> 01:41:35,762
Stop fooling around, Steyn.

864
01:41:36,889 --> 01:41:38,932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

865
01:41:56,033 --> 01:41:57,493
I'm sorry.

866
01:41:57,701 --> 01:42:00,162
It's all right, Steyn. Move.

867
01:42:08,796 --> 01:42:10,672
Milady.

868
01:42:12,508 --> 01:42:16,512
Sergeant, get on the radio and organise
some buses to take the kids home.

869
01:42:17,054 --> 01:42:19,223
How come suddenly he the big hero?

870
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:23,185
We'd better get back to our equipment.

871
01:42:34,071 --> 01:42:37,324
Says thank you, goodbye and
hopes you have lots of children.

872
01:42:37,449 --> 01:42:40,202
- Tell him thanks. I'll miss him.
- He can't use that.

873
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:42,746
- I have to...
- Bushmen don't know about money.

874
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:46,041
- What can I give him?
- There's nothing here he can use.

875
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:50,045
- Bushmen don't need things.
- He's gotta take the money. It's the law.

876
01:42:57,136 --> 01:43:00,097
He's going the wrong way.
The Kalahari's that way.

877
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,436
Says he got to find the
evil thing and get rid of it.

878
01:43:06,728 --> 01:43:08,397
I don't know.

879
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:12,901
- I'm going to miss the little bugger.
- Yeah, me too.

880
01:43:13,068 --> 01:43:15,571
- You gonna look like that forever?
- Like what?

881
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:17,739
Like Jack Hind is better than you.

882
01:43:17,906 --> 01:43:21,285
- No, I'm going to talk to her.
- Tell her you were the big hero.

883
01:43:21,451 --> 01:43:23,078
No, I can't do that.

884
01:43:23,287 --> 01:43:25,455
But I do want to talk to her.

885
01:43:25,664 --> 01:43:27,249
I'll tell her...

886
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:30,502
I'll say, "Look, Miss Thompson...

887
01:43:30,961 --> 01:43:32,880
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

888
01:43:33,005 --> 01:43:35,299
...but normally I'm quite normal.

889
01:43:35,466 --> 01:43:38,427
It's only when I'm in the presence
of a lady that I...

890
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:42,097
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

891
01:43:42,306 --> 01:43:46,935
If a man who is susceptible to a type
of para-Freudian syndrome like this...

892
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:49,646
...encounters a nubile
female, what happens?"

893
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,649
I suppose another big word happens.

894
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:56,278
- Too erudite?
- Yeah, whatever that means.

895
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:59,281
Okay. I'll put it more simply. I'll say:

896
01:44:00,157 --> 01:44:01,950
"Look, Miss Thompson.

897
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:05,496
Kate. Kate.

898
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:08,999
It's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon."

899
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:12,002
She'll understand that bit.
She's a schoolteacher.

900
01:44:12,211 --> 01:44:15,047
I'll say, "When there's no lady present...

901
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:17,674
...I can catch an insect
without hurting it."

902
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:20,803
If she knew me better, she'd
see I'm not a stumblebum.

903
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:25,516
- All I need is a little practise. If I...
- Wait for me. You need moral support.

904
01:44:46,578 --> 01:44:48,038
There she is.

905
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,254
You better do your thing
before the pupils come.

906
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:57,089
Yeah.

907
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,972
Morning.

908
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:07,558
Morning, Miss Thompson.

909
01:45:07,933 --> 01:45:09,560
Morning.

910
01:45:09,768 --> 01:45:12,020
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

911
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:13,897
Fine, thanks, and how are you?

912
01:45:14,857 --> 01:45:16,608
I'm fine, thank you.

913
01:45:19,528 --> 01:45:21,238
Kate...

914
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:23,740
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

915
01:45:23,991 --> 01:45:26,743
...but I'm not really like that. It's...

916
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:28,996
...only when I'm around wom...

917
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,458
Around you. I'm sorry.

918
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:35,502
Normally, I'm quite normal.

919
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:38,589
But whenever I'm
in the presence of a lady...

920
01:45:38,755 --> 01:45:43,927
...my fingers turn into thumbs,
my brain switches off.

921
01:45:44,511 --> 01:45:45,929
Watch it!

922
01:45:50,517 --> 01:45:51,894
It's flour.

923
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:53,520
I noticed.

924
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:56,106
It's actually...

925
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:05,157
Actually, it's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

926
01:46:05,324 --> 01:46:08,160
Perhaps it's some Freudian syndrome.

927
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,538
When I brought you your shoes,
I came to apologise...

928
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:14,792
...for the stupid things I did
when I met you at Mabula.

929
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:17,544
To explain that I'm not as stupid as that.

930
01:46:17,795 --> 01:46:20,047
But then, of course, I blew it, and I...

931
01:46:20,297 --> 01:46:22,966
So I don't blame you if you think...

932
01:46:23,342 --> 01:46:26,678
But it's really only an
interesting psychological...

933
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:33,143
When you get to know me better, you'll
see that I'm not always stumbling.

934
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:43,695
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

935
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:47,491
Yes, you are a very interesting
psychological phenomenon.

936
01:46:47,658 --> 01:46:49,576
And I think you're very sweet.

937
01:47:19,857 --> 01:47:22,901
<i>Xi was beginning to think he'd
never find the end of the earth.</i>

938
01:47:23,068 --> 01:47:25,821
<i>And one day, suddenly, there it was.</i>
