1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,973
Listen to me! Killing a few hostages
is not sufficient!

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,681
The Americans must be made to suffer.

3
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,101
We must humiliate them.

4
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,586
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.

5
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,651
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them to Damascus,

6
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:09,572
until they include us
in the peace process.

7
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:14,303
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.

8
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:18,291
I say wipe out Washington
and New York.

9
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:22,081
What? And spoil
three years of good PR?

10
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:25,277
The Americans believe I'm a nice guy.

11
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:29,688
In some of their polls, I'm more
popular than their president!

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,601
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.

13
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,020
If we do nothing else this week,

14
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:43,940
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act

15
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:46,861
that will show all the world

16
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,948
that the United States,
the great Satan,

17
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:53,200
is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,

18
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:58,080
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.

19
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,758
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.

20
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,115
I knew it!

21
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,351
Hey, who are you?

22
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:06,018
I'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.

23
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:09,368
And don't ever
let me catch you guys in America!

24
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,480
Watch out!

25
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,637
...98, 99, 100. It's all here.

26
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,931
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.

27
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,114
100% pure.

28
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,476
It better be - all 40 kilos.

29
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,982
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.

30
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:59,613
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'

31
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,481
Police! Throw down your guns!

32
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,929
Kill him.

33
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:47,638
It's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...

34
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,192
There he is!

35
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:01,357
No flowers, thank you.

36
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,066
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We heard about it.

37
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,282
Thanks. I want to know one thing -
is it true about Victoria?

38
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:12,990
I'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.

39
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,659
They got married last week.

40
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:19,415
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.

41
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,292
I did it for her. Everything.

42
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:24,876
And now she's gone.

43
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,132
And you came down here
to get a hot story, didn't you?

44
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,761
Pictures of me
to sell your newspapers.

45
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:35,598
- Frank...
- Sure, you think I'm a big hero.

46
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:40,229
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?

47
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,439
Frank, they're not here for you.

48
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,026
"Weird Al" Yankovic is on the plane.

49
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,323
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?

50
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,829
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.

51
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,582
I can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?

52
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:03,919
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

53
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:06,168
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast

54
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,936
and it's the best sex she's ever had.

55
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:14,635
I trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.

56
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,347
I'm just gonna have
to learn to forget.

57
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:22,561
That's why I took my vacation
in Beirut - to find some peace.

58
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,689
It won't be easy.

59
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:28,201
Everywhere I look,
something reminds me of her.

60
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,987
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.

61
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,493
What about Nordberg?
I came as soon as I heard.

62
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,952
He's alive, but on life support.

63
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,747
He's got a 50/50 chance of living,

64
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,972
though there's only
a 10% chance of that.

65
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,024
Mrs Nordberg, I think
we can save your husband's arm.

66
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,155
Where would you like it sent?

67
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:19,368
- Frank! I'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, I came as soon as I heard.

68
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:21,118
Thank you, Frank.

69
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:24,374
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.

70
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:27,969
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.

71
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:32,348
I'll get it!

72
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:38,940
Get the switch
at the back of the bed!

73
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:46,604
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?

74
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,693
I... love you.

75
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:53,899
I love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?

76
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:57,656
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. A boat.

77
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,994
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,

78
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,869
- just like last year.
- No... Drugs.

79
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:08,374
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?

80
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:10,919
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...

81
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:14,212
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!

82
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:16,591
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.

83
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:19,854
Give me a couple of days
on that one.

84
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,433
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.

85
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:30,899
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

86
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,647
It's hard to tell.

87
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:37,787
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer,
an angry husband, a gay lover...

88
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,074
Frank, get a hold of yourself!

89
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,121
A good cop - needlessly cut down
by some cowardly hoodlums.

90
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:50,709
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.

91
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:53,713
A parachute not opening -
that's the way to die,

92
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,255
getting caught in a combine,

93
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,966
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.

94
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,103
That's the way I want to go.

95
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,723
Frank! This is terrible!

96
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:11,148
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.

97
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:16,275
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

98
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,359
He's right, Wilma,

99
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:23,364
but don't wait till the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.

100
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:27,158
What I'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

101
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,411
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

102
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:34,552
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
but that's only common sense.

103
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,937
Do you know why Nordberg
was at the waterfront?

104
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,524
No...

105
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:48,021
But I found this at home in a drawer.

106
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:55,645
A photograph!
"I Luv You" out of Caracas.

107
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:58,404
A Panamanian ship.

108
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:02,699
When he said "I love you", he was
telling you the name of the ship!

109
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,869
I realise that... now.

110
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:09,742
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on it.

111
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,912
I can't spare anybody.

112
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:16,129
We're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.

113
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,882
Wilma, whatever scum did this,

114
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:23,472
no man will rest until he's behind
bars. Let's grab a bite to eat.

115
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:33,850
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

116
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:38,733
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

117
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:42,992
as one of the cities she'll visit
during her American tour.

118
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:48,741
Will the city hire
additional security officers?

119
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:53,994
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,

120
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:57,207
a special division
of the Police Department,

121
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,390
represented here
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.

122
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:06,394
Thank you, Your Honour.

123
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:09,318
Louder!

124
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:14,446
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.

125
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:24,900
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety

126
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:29,240
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

127
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:33,410
No matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

128
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:38,503
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

129
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,347
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.

130
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:48,175
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion

131
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,890
of the Queen's American tour
is completely protected.

132
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:57,814
And we can take pride
that the Queen...

133
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,858
Indeed, it is for all the people,

134
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:11,200
who will be able to share
in these... celebrations...

135
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,670
Especially exciting...

136
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:22,586
will be... the Queen's...
public appearances.

137
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,403
We also would like...

138
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:03,710
Ed and I drove to where Nordberg
had been found floating.

139
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:08,839
Without leads, you have to start
somewhere, and that was the harbour.

140
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:12,215
Please disperse. Please disperse.

141
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,638
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.

142
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,556
Where did they find him?

143
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,724
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?

144
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:24,020
No, I took care of that
at the press conference.

145
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:27,397
It doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future...

146
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,816
then something like this happens.

147
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,947
He was found by the nightwatchman.

148
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:34,784
I'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.

149
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,918
I'll walk around and snoop.

150
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,207
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.

151
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,876
I remember you. What do you want?

152
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,672
I wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?

153
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:56,134
I don't know.
My memory ain't so great.

154
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:59,225
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.

155
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,351
- Still hazy.
- How about this?

156
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,600
I remember. Why do you want to know?

157
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:07,229
- I can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.

158
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,857
- I don't think I should.
- Still don't think so?

159
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:14,447
- It's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.

160
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,281
- What?
- He was dirty!

161
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,287
Scum! I ought to
run you in right now!

162
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:22,911
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.

163
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:26,333
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should I tell you?

164
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:29,587
- Maybe this'll help.
- I shouldn't tell you.

165
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,130
Can you spot me a 20? How about now?

166
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,380
I'm going down to Ludwig's office.

167
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:37,100
I'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

168
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,268
Vincent Ludwig owned one
of the city's largest corporations.

169
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,932
A respected business man
and civic leader,

170
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:49,229
he was to chair the Queen's reception
committee.

171
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,574
Now I was about to question him about
drugs and attempted murder.

172
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,576
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

173
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,628
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.

174
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,056
Show him in.

175
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,594
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.

176
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:21,468
Nice to meet you, too. Cuban?

177
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:26,058
No, Dutch-Irish.
My father was from Wales.

178
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,687
Sit down.

179
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:31,023
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

180
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:35,653
Most objects I have collected
over a period of many years -

181
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:40,449
my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!

182
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:45,495
They are objects which I feel
reflect my personality,

183
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,790
like the Japanese fighting fish -

184
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,916
beautiful, graceful, elegant...

185
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,250
yet single-minded of purpose

186
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:57,006
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.

187
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:02,220
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.

188
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,931
A luxury item, to be certain,

189
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:08,935
but I am a man who appreciates
the finer things in life.

190
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,105
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen,

191
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,111
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.

192
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:20,240
Unbreakable.
Impervious to everything but water.

193
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:25,202
- Its value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.

194
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:30,247
But I'm sure you didn't pay this
visit for a lecture on fine art.

195
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,003
To what do I owe the honour?

196
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:36,929
I'm investigating the attempted
murder of a dock worker,

197
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:42,351
a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.

198
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,264
He is still alive, then?

199
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,732
He was shot six times.

200
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,062
Fortunately, the bullets missed
every vital organ.

201
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:55,853
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...

202
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:58,439
So they got him
to the hospital in time?

203
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:02,529
He's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

204
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,867
This certainly comes
as a shock to me.

205
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:11,201
As you know, I'm not the kind of man
who takes such things lightly.

206
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:15,209
There is no room in my organisation
for criminal activity.

207
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:19,712
Look out there - a vast
commercial development built by me.

208
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:23,890
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?

209
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,427
You bet you do. Orange groves!

210
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:30,601
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

211
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:35,572
But now that land will generate
ten times the amount of profit.

212
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:39,563
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

213
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,983
Let me get you some Kleenex.

214
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,528
Has this officer -

215
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:47,742
What's his name? Nordberg -

216
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,872
been able to tell you anything?

217
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:56,457
Well, he hasn't been able
to tell us a thing so far,

218
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,463
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

219
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:03,676
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

220
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,217
- Pardon?
- I've taken up a lot of your time.

221
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:09,930
I'd like to look
at your employment records

222
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,474
and speak to someone in Personnel.

223
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:14,141
Of course.

224
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,935
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,735
I am quite busy making arrangements
for the royal visit,

226
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,738
but I will have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

227
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:30,198
You've been very co-operative.
I'll note that in my report.

228
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,124
My pleasure.

229
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:39,594
Miss Spencer! This is
Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.

230
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,220
Hello... Mr Drebin.

231
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,311
Hello.

232
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,903
Oh!

233
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:13,207
Her hair was the colour
of gold in old paintings.

234
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:17,539
She had a full set of curves

235
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:22,419
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.

236
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:26,216
She gave me a look
I could feel in my hip pocket.

237
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:32,142
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.

238
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:41,355
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:45,448
- I just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.

240
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:50,532
This should be
what you're looking for -

241
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,368
the shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

242
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,548
Thank you.

243
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,704
I've heard police work is dangerous.

244
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,127
Yes, that's why I carry a big gun.

245
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,043
Couldn't it go off accidentally?

246
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:06,420
I used to have that problem.

247
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,549
What did you do about it?

248
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,136
I just think about baseball.

249
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,220
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

250
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:19,099
Did it slip down there again?

251
00:23:19,203 --> 00:23:22,060
Yes, well...
I'll quickly go through these

252
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:24,189
and get them back to you tomorrow.

253
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:28,941
Fine, but there's no rush.
I mean, whenever you're through.

254
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:33,196
Thank you. I wish there was
some way I could repay you.

255
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,494
How about dinner? I know a place
that serves great Viking food.

256
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:42,708
It's tempting, but I'm afraid
I must rest this evening,

257
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,834
tomorrow being Arbor Day.

258
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:47,793
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

259
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:51,466
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.

260
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,180
Thank you for your help,
Miss Spencer.

261
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:58,556
My pleasure.

262
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,309
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!

263
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:04,270
I'm sorry, my dear.

264
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:07,523
Did you give the lieutenant
what he wanted?

265
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,188
I gave him copies of the files
for Pier 32.

266
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:12,320
Good. That's good.

267
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:17,405
He is an intriguing fellow,
don't you think?

268
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,494
Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.

269
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,456
He seems very nice.

270
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,749
Jane, I realise
this is an unusual request,

271
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:30,171
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

272
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:34,046
I need to know about it,
so we can root it out.

273
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,215
That's why I want you to...

274
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,554
well, to get to know Drebin
a little better,

275
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,683
find out what he knows.

276
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:45,559
Wouldn't this be best handled
by the police?

277
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:48,981
We are letting the police handle it,
my dear!

278
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:52,152
But we need to know
the facts quickly

279
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,361
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

280
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:59,910
Don't forget, I have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

281
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:03,534
Well... if you put it that way...

282
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:07,548
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- That's better.

283
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,516
I'm sure you will.

284
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:23,097
It was about 4pm
when I returned to Police Squad.

285
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:27,812
I wanted to see what the lab had
come up with on Nordberg's jacket,

286
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:30,355
the one they'd found on the docks.

287
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:34,147
You can tell a lot from fibre
samples if they aren't too wet.

288
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:36,817
I was hoping we wouldn't
come up dry.

289
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,541
Hey, look out!

290
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,539
Police! Halt!

291
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:54,343
Anybody catch the licence plate?

292
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,851
Anybody get a look at the driver?

293
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:04,553
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

294
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:08,436
I've got to get... inside.

295
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,567
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fibre samples yet?

296
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:20,736
- We got some action here.
- What?

297
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,282
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.

298
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:25,243
We've got customers.

299
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:29,040
It reacts when
the spray hits the sensors.

300
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:34,541
You've done it again - mazel tov!

301
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:37,420
Good work.
What will you think of next?

302
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:39,549
Now that you mention it,

303
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:42,508
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

304
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,431
To the casual observer -
an ordinary shoe.

305
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:49,433
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.

306
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:52,771
And everything a cop would need.

307
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,937
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.

308
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:59,608
- Great. And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.

309
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,987
See these cufflinks I'm wearing?

310
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:06,740
They're not just cufflinks. Each one
fires a single pin-sized dart,

311
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:09,914
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes.

312
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:12,251
Let me demonstrate on Ed.

313
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,098
Ted! Why?

314
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:21,926
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

315
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,139
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, I could use another pair.

316
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:28,098
I think you'll like them.

317
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:30,935
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.

318
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,105
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

319
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,730
No, no. The other side.

320
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:41,528
As you requested, we took some
fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.

321
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:44,026
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

322
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,626
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

323
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:54,129
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

324
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,876
Yeah, I can see it now.

325
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,546
At first, it appears
to be the normal cotton fibres.

326
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,347
But we discovered
a fine white powder.

327
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:07,174
Pure heroin.

328
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,348
How well do you know Nordberg?

329
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:14,018
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

330
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,521
We can't allow personal feelings
to get in the way.

331
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:22,356
- Are you saying that Nordberg?
- The Queen arrives in two days.

332
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,986
If the press should pick this up,

333
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,158
it could be embarrassing
for the police and the city.

334
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:32,500
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

335
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:45,049
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

336
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:49,771
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

337
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,065
Is there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?

338
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,897
No, it's nothing.

339
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:06,235
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Have a seat.

340
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:09,446
I can carry out your request.

341
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,791
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.

342
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:19,207
But there is concern
on the part of those I represent,

343
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:25,087
that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.

344
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:27,549
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir,

345
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:33,223
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

346
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:38,812
I would think anyone who manages to
conceal his identity as an assassin.

347
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:43,865
Yes, but there is
even a more ideal assassin.

348
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:50,195
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.

349
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,951
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.

350
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:56,165
Dominique, service for two, please.

351
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:10,431
I must kill Pahpshmir.

352
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:22,194
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?

353
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,070
Cream only, please.

354
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:33,949
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it. It's all right.

355
00:30:34,054 --> 00:30:37,294
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.

356
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:43,791
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen
sensory-induced hypnosis?

357
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,919
I think I just have.

358
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:48,756
How will she get near the target?

359
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,796
Oh, I doubt whether it will be her.

360
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:56,592
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.

361
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:59,313
And it seems to me...

362
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:03,940
anyone... can be an assassin.

363
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:12,067
I had 24 hours to find
something to clear my friend's name.

364
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,112
I returned to the hospital
with Ludwig's records

365
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:17,696
to try to jog Nordberg's memory.

366
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:21,492
Doctor, I have the chart,
if you're ready to go over it.

367
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,705
I'll be with you
when I've finished with Mr Nordberg.

368
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,879
Yes, Doctor.

369
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:35,105
You'll be out of here
in a couple of...

370
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:44,932
- I'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.

371
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,356
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?

372
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,398
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?

373
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:58,113
I must kill Nordberg.
I must kill Nordberg.

374
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:01,461
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!

375
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,781
Medical emergency!

376
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:43,960
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!

377
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,953
The car! Follow that car!

378
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:51,665
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.

379
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,220
Now pull into traffic.

380
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:59,553
Try and ease off on the brake.

381
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:05,861
- Give it a little gas.
- I know a short cut. Turn left here!

382
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,571
- There he is!
- Easy!

383
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,411
Turn right! Follow him!

384
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:32,416
It's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65

385
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:35,598
down the wrong way
of a one-way street.

386
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,558
Apply the brakes.

387
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,348
Now put it in reverse.

388
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:52,266
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...

389
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,573
Gently extend your arm.

390
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:59,739
Extend your middle finger.

391
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,576
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!

392
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,126
Go for it, Stephanie!

393
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,204
Excuse me. Excuse me.

394
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:58,750
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!

395
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:01,296
Please disperse!

396
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,931
Nothing to see here. Please!

397
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:10,848
The attempt on Nordberg's
life left me shaken and disturbed.

398
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:13,807
The questions kept coming up
again and again,

399
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,981
like bubbles in a case of soda.

400
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,397
Who was this character
in the hospital?

401
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:23,318
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg... and for whom?

402
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:27,322
Did Ludwig lie to me?
I didn't have any proof,

403
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,988
but somehow,
I didn't entirely trust him.

404
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:33,867
Why was the "I Luv You"
not listed in Ludwig's records?

405
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:36,708
If it was, did he know about it?

406
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:39,040
If he didn't, who did?

407
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:41,345
And where the hell was I?

408
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,925
It was almost midnight
when I got home.

409
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:49,763
I just wanted
to slip under my blankets,

410
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:53,274
but my night was
just about to begin.

411
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:34,522
You're late.

412
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:38,353
That depends on what I'm late for.

413
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,522
You said we should
have dinner some time.

414
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:44,488
Tonight became "some time".

415
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,113
I'm boiling a roast.

416
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,862
How hot and wet do you like it?

417
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:58,175
Very hot and awfully wet.

418
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:02,041
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.

419
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:05,584
I'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.

420
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,003
That shirt looks familiar.

421
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:12,342
It's yours. I didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.

422
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:15,441
At least... not yet.

423
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:22,741
Do you mind if I slip
into something more comfortable?

424
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,572
There. That's better.

425
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,783
I hope you've brought your appetite.

426
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,745
I've brought everything.

427
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,462
Well, then, dig in.

428
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:50,799
Interesting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs I saw today.

429
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,259
I was young. I needed the work.

430
00:37:53,363 --> 00:37:56,469
No, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.

431
00:37:56,573 --> 00:38:00,807
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
It wasn't on Ludwig's records.

432
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,185
Probably an oversight.

433
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,616
How is your... meat?

434
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,739
You be the judge of that.

435
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,670
Mmm...

436
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,086
I've got nine more.

437
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,672
- Have you seen that ship?
- I don't know.

438
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:33,590
It doesn't look like ours,
but we deal with so many ships.

439
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:36,595
Has Officer Nordberg
told you anything?

440
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:40,724
No, there's been another attempt
on his life. He's in a coma.

441
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:45,103
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.

442
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,896
If it wasn't, I'd be out of a job,

443
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,701
but I'd give it up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.

444
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,955
That's beautiful.

445
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,006
This is all happening too fast.

446
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,424
- I've been hurt before.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,963
I'd known her for years.

448
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:16,422
We used to go to
all the police functions together.

449
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:19,718
How I loved her,
but she had her music.

450
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:22,596
I think she had her music.

451
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,473
She'd hang out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.

452
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:30,607
I don't recall her playing
an instrument or being able to sing.

453
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,649
Yet she was on the road
300 days of the year.

454
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:38,824
I bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.

455
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,701
It's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.

456
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,457
Boy loses girl. Girl finds boy.

457
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:49,626
Boy forgets girl. Boy remembers girl.

458
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,958
Girl dies in a blimp accident

459
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,920
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.

460
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:58,093
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.

461
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,931
Poor dear!

462
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,725
Now, now. I don't want to upset you.

463
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,813
Frank, it's not that.

464
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,315
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

465
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,653
- There's something I must tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.

466
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:21,657
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.

467
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,155
Maybe...

468
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,212
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.

469
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,390
Funny-face!

470
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:55,939
I want you to know...
I practise safe sex.

471
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,705
So do I.

472
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:36,174
I had a wonderful day, Frank. I can't
believe we just met yesterday.

473
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:40,128
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it,

474
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:42,670
because we exchanged bodily fluids?

475
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:46,130
No, I really mean it.
You're very special.

476
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:50,552
- Can I interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, I don't wear them.

477
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,970
Actually, I'm on stake-out tonight.

478
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:56,983
I'll be thinking about you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

479
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,283
OK.

480
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,330
Good night!

481
00:43:18,678 --> 00:43:21,753
The answer's up there
in Ludwig's office.

482
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:24,794
Call it what you will -
a hunch, women's intuition.

483
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:27,090
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.

484
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:31,177
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?

485
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:35,136
He's the only one except us
who knew Nordberg was still alive.

486
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,687
Next thing we know,
some thug tries to knock him off.

487
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:44,732
Maybe. But breaking into Ludwig's
office is taking a big chance.

488
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:48,275
I know. You take a chance
getting up in the morning,

489
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:51,488
crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.

490
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:53,625
There he is!

491
00:43:57,383 --> 00:44:00,580
Just trust me on this, Ed.
I know I'm right.

492
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:02,626
OK, but be careful.

493
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,806
Get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

494
00:44:57,526 --> 00:44:58,777
Bingo!

495
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,316
"20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,

496
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,617
"upon proof of Queen's death."

497
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:16,291
Destroying property, arson...

498
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:19,504
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?!

499
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,427
What the hell were you doing there?

500
00:48:22,531 --> 00:48:24,591
I'm sorry about that, Your Honour,

501
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:28,930
but we believe Ludwig is involved
in a plot to assassinate the Queen.

502
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:32,806
That's ridiculous!
Where is this "evidence"?

503
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,851
Well... it... burned in the f-fire.

504
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,605
Gentlemen,

505
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,071
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.

506
00:48:43,175 --> 00:48:47,905
If we're very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.

507
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,663
- Your Honour!
- Did I make myself clear?

508
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:53,378
Yes, Your Honour. Good day.

509
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,138
Drebin!

510
00:48:57,806 --> 00:49:04,088
I don't want any more trouble like
you had last year. That's my policy.

511
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:09,426
When I see five weirdos dressed
in togas stabbing a guy in a park,

512
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,601
I shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.

513
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:19,521
That was a Shakespeare in the Park
production of "Julius Caesar"!

514
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:24,275
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honour...

515
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:28,697
Your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight is not necessary.

516
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,743
Is that understood?

517
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:33,923
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.

518
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:59,521
The plane has taxied to a stop.

519
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,609
Any minute now
we expect the doors to open

520
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:05,273
and we'll get a glimpse
of the Queen,

521
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,407
as she begins her first visit
to Los Angeles in five years.

522
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:13,032
It's a balmy, beautiful evening too.

523
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,547
She's going from here
to a formal reception...

524
00:50:23,183 --> 00:50:25,010
- Jane!
- Frank!

525
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:30,220
I'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?

526
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:32,346
Maybe just a bite.

527
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,517
Ludwig wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.

528
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:40,183
There is something you should know.
I was in his place last night.

529
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:45,105
How nice! Did he show you his
Ming vases and rare oil paintings?

530
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:49,527
Jane, I think that he's involved
in a number of criminal activities.

531
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,656
Frank, stop it!

532
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,076
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.

533
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,413
- You don't know him like I do.
- How's that?

534
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:03,958
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm sorry. I'm worried about you.

535
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:08,174
I don't trust him and I don't want
you mixed up in anything dangerous.

536
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:11,509
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.

537
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:16,647
Gee, has it been that long? I don't
feel like Chinese tonight anyway.

538
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:23,059
It's sweet of you to be concerned,
but you're wrong about Vincent.

539
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:26,937
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.

540
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,068
He just wants to talk with you

541
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:32,405
to clear up any doubts
you might have.

542
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,571
- When?
- Tonight.

543
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,533
Meet him at the 7th Street
stockyards.

544
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,494
All right,
but promise you'll be careful.

545
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,211
Of course I will,
funny-face, for you.

546
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:48,252
I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

547
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:52,182
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

548
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:18,797
Ludwig?

549
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:22,748
- Drebin?
- Yeah, I'm Drebin.

550
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:26,592
I have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig.

551
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,548
I'm sorry, I can't hear you!

552
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:34,644
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking.

553
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:01,996
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!

554
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:38,448
Matthews, stake out that end,

555
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:42,616
and card-check for
anyone suspicious looking.

556
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,783
Frank, what are you doing here?

557
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,661
I've been trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.

558
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:52,457
They're planning
to do her tonight, here.

559
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:57,515
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.

560
00:53:59,355 --> 00:54:04,056
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax! Nothing will happen.

561
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,227
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah? What about this?

562
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:11,645
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?

563
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,313
I got rights!

564
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,652
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!

565
00:54:16,756 --> 00:54:17,999
Ethel!

566
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:23,035
All right,
anyone else here seeing his wife?

567
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:26,498
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

568
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,341
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

569
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:44,054
I'm so excited to be here.
I appreciate your inviting me.

570
00:54:44,158 --> 00:54:47,981
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...

571
00:54:50,197 --> 00:54:52,017
- Drebin!
- Frank!

572
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,229
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?

573
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,235
This is not the time
or place to talk.

574
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:00,899
It's way past the time we talked.

575
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:03,446
The gloves are off,
I'm playing hardball.

576
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:07,828
It's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

577
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:11,868
Mr Drebin!
If you have evidence, then use it.

578
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:15,914
If not, I am warning you -
get off my back!

579
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:18,054
Or it will cost you dearly.

580
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:25,012
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

581
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:28,802
A meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

582
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:32,143
set up by someone
who's been playing me like a violin.

583
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:35,019
Funny-face,
what are you talking about?

584
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:39,151
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?

585
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:42,403
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!

586
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,819
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!

587
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:47,659
Frank, it's the truth!

588
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:51,700
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

589
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:55,624
It'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

590
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:57,760
Too bad, sugar-puff.

591
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:01,924
We could have been something.

592
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,677
I only did what I was told to do!

593
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:07,097
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!

594
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:11,015
That makes things easier, Princess.

595
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,435
To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.

596
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,114
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?

597
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:24,415
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.

598
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,695
By the way...

599
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,752
I faked every orgasm.

600
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:32,753
Funny-face!

601
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,081
And to commemorate our friendship,

602
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:40,711
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family

603
00:56:40,816 --> 00:56:46,928
this Revolutionary War musket,
donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.

604
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:51,469
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,

605
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:54,402
Queen Elizabeth II!

606
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:34,306
It's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!

607
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,016
What is journalism coming to?

608
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,726
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you

609
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,402
and they call that news!

610
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:46,026
They can't kick you off the Force,
it's not fair.

611
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,985
I know. Life isn't always fair.

612
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:54,494
Just think, the next time I shoot
someone, I could be arrested.

613
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:56,703
Hey, look at that!

614
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:01,916
The missing evidence in the Kilner
case! My God, he WAS innocent!

615
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,292
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.

616
00:58:05,396 --> 00:58:08,754
Well... what's the use?

617
00:58:08,858 --> 00:58:11,928
What good are these damn awards
and citations?

618
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,638
Frank...

619
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:16,263
Frank, that's not your desk!

620
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,684
Frank! I've been
looking all over for you!

621
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,855
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?

622
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,525
I tried to call last night.
I went by your place. Where were you?

623
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:29,023
I was out walking. All night.

624
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:32,115
Listen to me!
I have important information.

625
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:35,950
There was never anything
between Vincent and me.

626
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,409
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?

627
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,662
I like cops.

628
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:45,628
- All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.

629
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:49,674
- What've you got?
- I overheard Ludwig.

630
00:58:49,778 --> 00:58:54,885
You were right. He is planning to
have someone assassinate the Queen!

631
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,345
- Where?
- At the baseball game.

632
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:00,850
The Queen will be there
as Ludwig's guest.

633
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:05,063
Is Ludwig going to shoot her
in front of 60,000 fans?

634
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,938
No, a player,
during the 7th inning stretch.

635
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:10,861
- It starts in 20 minutes.
- I'll go.

636
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,947
- I'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig

637
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,283
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!

638
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,161
Wait! Wait!

639
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:23,328
I've gotten you into enough trouble
already. I'll go alone.

640
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:28,337
No! This'll get you back on
the Force. We're right behind you.

641
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:35,424
Frank? I wanted you to know now,

642
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:39,806
I've loved you since the first day
I met you, and I'll never stop.

643
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,941
I'm a very lucky woman.

644
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:43,940
So am I.

645
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:56,778
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A,

646
00:59:56,883 --> 01:00:00,034
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners

647
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:04,453
in their showdown
for the Division League.

648
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:08,291
Hello! I'm Curt Gowdy,
along with Jim Palmer,

649
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:11,463
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,

650
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,755
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.

651
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:17,594
Join us for this
all-important ball game.

652
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,426
And a special game it is.

653
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,348
As we know, it is being attended
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

654
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,114
I'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.

655
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:29,268
We've got all the exits covered.

656
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:31,437
I ought to arrest Ludwig right now.

657
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:35,398
No, we've got to let him
make the first move.

658
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:39,194
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.

659
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:41,953
I've got to get that assassin.

660
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:44,200
It could be any of those players.

661
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:47,828
I've got to get down on that field
and search those players.

662
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:51,457
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and welcome

663
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,130
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II!

664
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:04,898
One moment.

665
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:09,899
Over there - these seats are taken.

666
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:28,994
My dear, is something bothering you?

667
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:30,791
No, why do you ask?

668
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:35,087
You haven't said a word.
You seem... nervous.

669
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:39,838
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.

670
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:43,511
Why he not here now?
I do not like to wait for him.

671
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:49,390
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes. Please wait.

672
01:01:49,494 --> 01:01:53,856
- He should be here now!
- I'll send him right over.

673
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,035
I do not wait for him!
He waits for me!

674
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:04,156
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?

675
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,953
I am the head usher.
I am here to... Excuse me.

676
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:17,083
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?

677
01:02:17,188 --> 01:02:21,173
- I am the head usher.
- One second.

678
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:22,757
Ladies and gentlemen,

679
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:27,178
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,

680
01:02:27,282 --> 01:02:29,678
on the occasion of the royal visit,

681
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:33,269
please welcome
internationally-renowned opera star,

682
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,773
Enrico Pallazzo!

683
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:42,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honour America,

684
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:48,246
as Mr Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.

685
01:04:09,877 --> 01:04:13,950
And now we'll wait
for the exchange of line-ups

686
01:04:14,055 --> 01:04:16,337
and the start of today's ball game.

687
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:29,554
Excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?

688
01:04:32,859 --> 01:04:36,433
The Queen's visit
has brought a sell-out crowd!

689
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:40,814
And the fans are being entertained
by the stadium's Angel Vision,

690
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,776
showing some unusual moments
in baseball over the years!

691
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:07,097
Sorry, fellas!

692
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,250
How about that?

693
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:40,789
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:45,427
now taking the field -
your California Angels!

695
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:55,345
For everybody's safety,

696
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:59,680
we ask that you do not throw
any objects on the field.

697
01:05:59,784 --> 01:06:02,269
We thank you for your co-operation.

698
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:09,484
As the Angels take the field, we're
ready for the first pitch ceremony

699
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:13,577
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.

700
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:21,076
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!

701
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:23,577
We're ready for the start,

702
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:26,624
as these lovely ladies would agree.

703
01:06:26,728 --> 01:06:30,256
Those are the players' wives,
here to enjoy the game.

704
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:41,390
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?

705
01:06:41,495 --> 01:06:43,102
Do what?

706
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:44,988
Play ball!

707
01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:51,072
Frank! Al, it's Frank!

708
01:06:56,043 --> 01:07:00,503
The game's under way. Dave Spiwack
ready to face Jay Johnstone!

709
01:07:19,899 --> 01:07:23,056
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.

710
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,598
If one of the players is the killer,
Frank'll find him,

711
01:07:26,702 --> 01:07:29,938
even if he has to search
every one of them.

712
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:33,397
...lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.

713
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:37,486
Hello, pal. Let's see
if that uniform's on straight.

714
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:42,451
Good here. Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.

715
01:07:42,555 --> 01:07:45,660
It's a little tight in the crotch.

716
01:07:45,764 --> 01:07:48,166
All right? All set?

717
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:53,003
OK, play ball!

718
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,004
Strike?

719
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:29,129
Yeah, strike!

720
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:44,984
Stee-rike two!

721
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:04,670
Stee-rike three!

722
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:58,256
You're clean!

723
01:11:48,999 --> 01:11:50,570
Have you found him yet?

724
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:53,237
No, and I've searched
almost everybody.

725
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:57,493
Yeah. There's only one more out
before the seventh inning stretch.

726
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:02,081
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.

727
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:03,430
Right.

728
01:12:05,432 --> 01:12:11,352
The Mariners' number four -
Armando Criscione! Criscione!

729
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,524
- Ball!
- Ball?

730
01:12:31,959 --> 01:12:33,002
Ball!

731
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:47,516
Get... get... what the? Get off!

732
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,640
Catch it! Catch it!

733
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:57,183
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!

734
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:04,061
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?

735
01:13:04,165 --> 01:13:06,281
I don't believe it!

736
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,197
Second base! On two!

737
01:13:11,373 --> 01:13:13,443
There's a throw by the catcher

738
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:16,950
and now they've got Criscione
hung up between 1st and 2nd!

739
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:19,160
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:20,307
What?

741
01:13:20,507 --> 01:13:25,291
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute! Stop that!

742
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:28,091
Put that back down! Give me the ball!

743
01:13:30,725 --> 01:13:32,340
I'll get you!

744
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:34,715
It's hard to believe,

745
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,513
but apparently the umpires
have got Criscione in a run-down!

746
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:42,973
- Safe!
- Safe?

747
01:13:43,077 --> 01:13:44,474
How about that?

748
01:13:44,578 --> 01:13:46,393
- Out!
- Safe!

749
01:13:46,497 --> 01:13:48,477
- Out!
- He was safe!

750
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:49,769
- Out!
- Safe!

751
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:52,360
There's a sight I've never seen!

752
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:56,071
- Safe!
- What are you doing?

753
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,699
Safe! Safe! Safe!

754
01:13:57,803 --> 01:14:00,574
- He was out!
- He was safe!

755
01:14:00,678 --> 01:14:03,451
You idiot! He was out!

756
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:05,913
All right, you're out of here!

757
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:09,085
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!

758
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:11,718
All right, YOU'RE out!

759
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:16,965
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!

760
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:20,387
And he's up in the mezzanine!

761
01:14:20,491 --> 01:14:21,894
It's the third out!

762
01:14:39,252 --> 01:14:42,372
I must kill... the Queen.

763
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:49,625
I must kill... the Queen.

764
01:14:52,348 --> 01:14:54,388
Frank, it's the right-fielder!

765
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:04,430
- You're the boss!
- It was safe.

766
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:07,100
Now, we're going to take a walk.

767
01:15:07,488 --> 01:15:10,352
How could you
do something so vicious?

768
01:15:10,456 --> 01:15:15,317
It was easy. Don't forget I spent
two years as a building contractor.

769
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:17,655
Now, let's go quietly.

770
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,246
Hey, look at that! Let's get him!

771
01:15:35,515 --> 01:15:37,722
Kick him in the balls!

772
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:13,718
I must kill... the Queen.

773
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:26,642
Look out!

774
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:35,978
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!

775
01:16:36,082 --> 01:16:38,116
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.

776
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:44,330
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!

777
01:16:55,304 --> 01:16:58,378
Frank! Frank, help!

778
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:01,474
Frank! Frank, help! Frank!

779
01:17:16,241 --> 01:17:18,144
Hold it, Ludwig!

780
01:17:18,248 --> 01:17:20,607
Stay where you are!

781
01:17:20,711 --> 01:17:23,151
- He's got a gun!
- I know.

782
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:26,944
You ruined my life.
Now I'm going to ruin yours.

783
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:30,035
- Leave the girl alone!
- I am. I'm going to kill you.

784
01:17:30,139 --> 01:17:31,381
I see.

785
01:17:35,593 --> 01:17:37,799
Two can play at that game!

786
01:17:44,352 --> 01:17:47,215
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.

787
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,270
He'll be all right.

788
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,114
Well...

789
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:26,016
Frank... it's horrible!

790
01:18:27,228 --> 01:18:31,356
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.

791
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:34,022
My father went the same way.

792
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:53,910
I must kill... Frank Drebin.

793
01:18:54,014 --> 01:18:57,089
I must kill... Frank Drebin.

794
01:18:58,175 --> 01:19:00,417
No, no, don't shoot!

795
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:04,515
Jane... it's me...

796
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:08,379
Funny-face.

797
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:12,301
I must kill Frank Drebin.

798
01:19:12,405 --> 01:19:15,178
You love Frank Drebin.

799
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:18,267
And Frank Drebin loves you.

800
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:22,269
Jane, if you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,

801
01:19:22,374 --> 01:19:28,149
because without you,
I wouldn't want to live anyway.

802
01:19:28,253 --> 01:19:31,693
I've finally found
someone I can love -

803
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:35,949
a good, clean love...
without utensils.

804
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:38,882
I must kill Frank Drebin.

805
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,413
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

806
01:19:42,518 --> 01:19:47,128
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

807
01:19:47,232 --> 01:19:50,758
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

808
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,804
Since I met you, I've noticed
things I never knew where there -

809
01:19:56,908 --> 01:20:00,640
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf,

810
01:20:00,744 --> 01:20:03,101
stop lights...

811
01:20:03,205 --> 01:20:04,851
I must kill...

812
01:20:04,956 --> 01:20:08,312
Jane, this morning...

813
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:12,612
I bought something for you.
It's not very much,

814
01:20:12,717 --> 01:20:17,824
but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

815
01:20:17,928 --> 01:20:19,869
It's an engagement ring.

816
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:21,996
I'd have given it to you earlier,

817
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,342
but I wanted to wait
until we were alone.

818
01:20:29,516 --> 01:20:32,517
- I...
- I love you, Jane.

819
01:20:37,941 --> 01:20:39,768
Oh, Frank!

820
01:20:52,205 --> 01:20:54,291
I'm sorry!

821
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:09,547
I'm sorry that I yelled at you
yesterday, I really am.

822
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:12,881
Drebin!

823
01:21:12,985 --> 01:21:15,635
I was wrong about you.

824
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:19,846
This city and the whole world
owes you a debt of gratitude.

825
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:21,134
Thank you.

826
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:24,558
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

827
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:28,645
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...

828
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:33,442
Don't thank me. There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

829
01:21:33,546 --> 01:21:35,902
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

830
01:21:36,006 --> 01:21:38,862
The doc says
I should be on my feet in a week!

831
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:42,875
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

832
01:21:44,215 --> 01:21:47,500
Frank! Everyone should have
a friend like you!
