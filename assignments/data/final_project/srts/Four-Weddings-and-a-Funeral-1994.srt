1
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:51,416
- Come here.
- What?

2
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:13,228
- Good morning, Mrs Staples.
- Good morning, madam.

3
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,365
Late! Late!

4
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,253
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

5
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,050
Fuck!

6
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:46,148
- Fuck! Right, we take yours.
- It only goes 40 miles an hour.

7
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,701
What turn-off?

8
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:03,039
- Better not be the B359.
- It's the B359.

9
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:05,208
Fuck it!

10
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,962
Fuck!

11
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:17,135
Fuck.

12
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,440
Fuck.

13
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,825
Fuck.

14
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,284
Fuckity fuck!

15
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,458
Bugger.

16
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,010
Hello, Charles.

17
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,819
There's a greatness to your lateness.

18
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,738
It's not achieved without real suffering.

19
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,366
I am so sorry.

20
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,120
I'll be killing myself after the service,
if that's any consolation.

21
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,541
- Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.
- Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.

22
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,709
Disastrous haircut.

23
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,799
- You haven't forgotten the rings?
- No.

24
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:05,612
Hate people being late. Hate it.

25
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,332
Here we go.

26
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,687
Oh, isn't she lovely!

27
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:46,316
Scarlett, you're blind.
She looks like a big meringue.

28
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:57,910
Dear friends, what a joy it is
to welcome you to our church...

29
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,164
...on this wonderful day
for Angus and Laura.

30
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:07,627
Before we start the service,
let us all join together in the first hymn.

31
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,646
Scarlett.

32
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:19,528
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God

33
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,905
...and in the face of this congregation...

34
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:26,159
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,...

35
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,789
...which is an honourable estate,
instituted in the time of man's innocency.

36
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,248
Back in a sec.

37
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,793
If any man can show
any just cause or impediment...

38
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,419
...why they may not be
lawfully joined together,...

39
00:08:37,503 --> 00:08:40,714
...let him speak now
or for ever hold his peace.

40
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,927
Do you promise to love her, comfort her,...

41
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,013
...honour and keep her,
in sickness and in health,...

42
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:52,058
...and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her...

43
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,144
...for as long as ye both shall live?
- I do.

44
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,480
To love and to cherish...

45
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:00,441
...till death us do part.
- till death us do part.

46
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,363
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.

47
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,116
Do you have the ring?

48
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:20,793
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

49
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:23,295
With my body, I thee worship.

50
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,841
With my body, I thee worship.

51
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,760
And with all my worldly goods
I do thee endow.

52
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:33,889
And with all my worldly goods
I thee endow.

53
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:44,274
"If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love,...

54
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:48,069
...I am become as sounding brass,
or a clanging cymbal."

55
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:49,320
Good point.

56
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,502
- Great hat.
- Thanks. I bought it specially.

57
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,674
There.

58
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:06,392
Right. Get in position, please.

59
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,019
Thank you. Smile.

60
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:13,982
- Splendid, I thought. What did you think?
- I thought splendid. What did you think?

61
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,442
Splendid, I thought.

62
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,028
Scarlotta, fabulous dress!

63
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,571
The ecclesiastical purple
and the pagan orange...

64
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,907
...symbolising the symbiosis in marriage...

65
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:25,576
...between the heathen
and Christian traditions?

66
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,578
That's right.

67
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,790
Lovely. And again.

68
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,877
- Any idea who the girl in the black hat is?
- Name's Carrie.

69
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,839
- She's pretty.
- American.

70
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,090
Interesting.

71
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:42,300
Slut.

72
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,428
Really?

73
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,222
Used to work at Vogue.
Lives in America now.

74
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,933
Only goes out with
very glamorous people.

75
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,518
Quite out of your league.

76
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,438
Well, that's a relief. Thanks.

77
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:59,817
- See you there.
- Off you go.

78
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,320
Right. Reception.

79
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,409
Bye!

80
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,460
Anyone else tread in a cowpat?

81
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,295
No, thought not. See you in a mo.

82
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,882
Do you think I'd hate him as much
if he wasn't my brother?

83
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:31,096
Don't want to blow my chances
for romance by smelling of dung.

84
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:38,853
I never know what to say
in these wretched line-ups.

85
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:43,024
It's a cinch. Just give a big, warm hug
and say the bride looks pregnant.

86
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:47,612
- Or go for "You must be very proud".
- Heaven preserve us.

87
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,405
- You must be very proud.
- Indeed.

88
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,116
- Hello.
- Hello.

89
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:54,493
Hello.

90
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,503
Hi. We've met. It's Richard Maples.

91
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,005
Bastard.

92
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,180
Hello, Bern.

93
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,640
Two, please.

94
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:20,892
- You have fun.
- Take care.

95
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:26,272
- Hello.
- Hi.

96
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,902
- Do you want one of these?
- Thank you.

97
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:32,862
- I...
- Hello, Charles.

98
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,948
Hello, dear John.
How are you? How are you?

99
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,909
- Good. This is...
- Carrie.

100
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,870
- Delighted. I'm John.
- Hi, John.

101
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:46,750
- How's your gorgeous girlfriend?
- She's no longer my girlfriend.

102
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,420
Ah, dear. I wouldn't get
too gloomy about it.

103
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:53,923
Rumour has it she never stopped bonking
Toby de Lisle in case you didn't work out.

104
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:57,260
She is now my wife.

105
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,013
Excellent. Congratulations.

106
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:02,265
Excuse me.

107
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,642
Any kids or anything, John?

108
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:09,396
Do we hear the patter of tiny feet?

109
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,149
No.

110
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,194
Well, there's plenty of time for that,
isn't there? No hurry.

111
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,872
Hi. How are you?

112
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:46,306
- My name's Fiona.
- I'm Gerald.

113
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:51,185
- What do you do?
- I'm training to be a priest.

114
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:53,312
Good Lord!

115
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:56,523
- Do you do weddings?
- No, not yet.

116
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:59,234
I will, of course. Jolly nerve-racking.

117
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:02,654
Yes, rather like the first time one has sex.

118
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,449
Well, I suppose so.

119
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:10,870
Though rather less messy, of course,
and far less call for condoms.

120
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:39,105
- Who's that boy over there in the grey?
- His name's David.

121
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,316
Something of a dish, isn't he?

122
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,652
Well, I've always thought so.

123
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,530
- Why are they...?
- The dish can't hear.

124
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:50,865
Gosh.

125
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,286
Yeah, silent but deadly attractive.

126
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,081
Bang, bang, bang. That's it.

127
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,959
Into the marquee, please.
Dinner is served.

128
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,589
- How do you do?
- Hello. Tom. Splendid to meet you.

129
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,842
Very exciting.

130
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,354
Hi.

131
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:29,360
My name's Scarlett. Don't let me
drink too much cos I'll get really flirty.

132
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:35,699
- How do you do? My name's Charles.
- Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:41,413
- Charles died 20 years ago.
- Must be a different Charles, I think.

134
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,041
Are you telling me
I don't know my own brother?

135
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,250
No.

136
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:05,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to drag you from your desserts.

137
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:09,731
There are just one or two little things
I feel I should say, as best man.

138
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:14,694
This is only the second time I've been
a best man. I hope I did OK that time.

139
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,198
The couple in question
are at least still talking to me.

140
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,702
Unfortunately, they're not
actually talking to each other.

141
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:27,289
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.

142
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:32,795
But I'm assured it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

143
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:38,549
Paula knew Piers had slept with her sister
before I mentioned it in the speech.

144
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:43,429
The fact that he'd slept with her mother
came as a surprise,...

145
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:51,186
...but I think was incidental to the
nightmare of recrimination and violence...

146
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,398
...that became their two-day marriage.

147
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,859
Anyway, enough of that.
My job today is to talk about Angus.

148
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,779
There are no skeletons in his cupboard.

149
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,532
Or so I thought.

150
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:08,452
I'll come on to that in a minute.
I would just like to say this.

151
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,541
I am,...

152
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:20,296
...as ever, in bewildered awe of anyone
who makes this kind of commitment...

153
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:23,717
...that Angus and Laura have made today.

154
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:27,345
I know I couldn't do it and...

155
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,473
...I think it's wonderful they can.

156
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,809
So, back to Angus and those sheep.

157
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,941
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses.

158
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,569
The adorable couple.

159
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,466
I remember the first time
I saw Gareth dancing.

160
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,968
I feared lives would be lost.

161
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,474
She's a pretty girl,
the one you can't take your eyes off.

162
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,394
Is it love at first sight?

163
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,688
Good Lord, no!
It's the bloke she's dancing with.

164
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:11,651
I played rugby with him at school.
I'm wondering what position he played.

165
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,822
Though, let's say,
for the sake of argument,...

166
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,199
...one did take a fancy
to someone at a wedding.

167
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:22,369
Do you think there really
are people who can say...

168
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:26,289
..."Hi, babe. My name's Charles.
This is your lucky night"?

169
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:30,585
- Well, if there are, they're not English.
- Quite.

170
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:35,673
Three weeks is about
my question-popping minimum.

171
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:40,386
You know I love you, Jean, don't you?
I love you. I love you.

172
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:46,434
And, Mike, I've never met you before,
but I love you very much. I really do.

173
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:51,146
Ignore her. She's drunk.

174
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:54,941
At least I hope she is.
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.

175
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:00,447
- How's it going, Lyds?
- Bloody awful.

176
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,574
Oh, dear! What's the prob?

177
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:06,869
I was promised sex. Everybody said it.

178
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:10,998
"You be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.
You'll be fighting them off."

179
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,793
But not so much as a tongue in sight.

180
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:19,964
Well, I mean, if you fancy anything,...

181
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,344
- I could always...
- Don't be ridiculous, Bernard.

182
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,847
- I'm not that desperate.
- No, right. Of course.

183
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:31,267
Fair enough. It's a good point.

184
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,408
Bye!

185
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:54,413
Have a lovely time! Bye!

186
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:28,153
Where are you staying tonight, Charles?

187
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,201
Scarlett and I are at some pub. The Lucky
Boat, something like that. Aren't we all?

188
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:38,413
No. Slight change of plan.

189
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:41,874
The others are coming back to my place.
Nansy's in residence.

190
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,503
Might knock us up a plate of eggs
and bake over a late-night Scrabble.

191
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:49,965
- I wondered if you'd like to join.
- Yeah! Thanks very much.

192
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,759
- Is there room for Scarlett?
- Absolutely.

193
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,928
137 rooms, actually.

194
00:22:56,471 --> 00:23:00,100
Right. Tommy, are you
the richest man in England?

195
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,269
No!

196
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:06,188
I believe we're about seventh.

197
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:13,321
The Queen, obviously, and that
Branson bloke's doing terribly well.

198
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:17,616
Well, excellent news.
I'll go and tell Scarlett.

199
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:18,950
Yeah.

200
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:22,454
That's unless you get lucky first.

201
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,963
Hi.

202
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:34,965
Hi. I thought you'd gone.

203
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:40,471
No, not yet. I was just wondering
where you were staying tonight.

204
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:42,389
Well...

205
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:45,851
I was staying at some pub
called The Lucky...

206
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:49,354
- The Boat or something like that.
- Boatman.

207
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,690
Right. But now I'm going to stay
at some friends' house...

208
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,318
...with some friends.

209
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:59,238
Well, I think "enormous castle"
is a more accurate description.

210
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,783
That's too bad,
because I'm at The Boatman.

211
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,455
Well, it was nice not quite meeting you.

212
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,584
- It was a great speech.
- Thanks.

213
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:23,844
- Well, I'm going now.
- No! No, no. Don't go. We can meet now.

214
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,307
- The evening's just getting going.
- We both know that's a big lie.

215
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:34,562
Fuck.

216
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,672
The castle beckons, Tom. Are you sober?

217
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,550
Absolutely. Orange juice all night.

218
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:09,220
Come on.

219
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:14,767
Bye, everybody!

220
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:17,145
All together now.

221
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,070
Bernard!

222
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,383
Tom, can you stop the car?

223
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,594
Stop the car.

224
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:58,266
Sorry. I just think
I might stay in that pub after all.

225
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,644
Why on earth...?

226
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:15,032
No, seriously. I'm doing some research
into pubs with the word "boat" in the title.

227
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,576
- Oh, well. Please yourself.
- It's a silly thing.

228
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,584
Right.

229
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,506
Odd decision.

230
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,839
Hello.

231
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,048
- Hi.
- Hi.

232
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:21,135
In the end there wasn't room for all of us.

233
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,345
You said it was a castle.

234
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:27,933
Yes, it is a castle.
It's just a very, very small one.

235
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:30,853
Tiny, in fact.
Just one up, one down, which is rare.

236
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:32,812
Drink, sir?

237
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:36,107
Yeah. I'd like a glass of whisky, please.

238
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:38,526
- Do you want...?
- Yeah, sounds good.

239
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:41,279
- Another for the lady.
- Doubles, sir?

240
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,448
Thanks.

241
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:46,784
You here, too? How are you?

242
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:51,622
- Hello. I'm fine.
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?

243
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:54,791
- Who?
- Carrie. American girl. Lovely legs.

244
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:58,045
Wedding guest. Nice smell.

245
00:27:58,253 --> 00:28:00,839
- No. Sorry.
- Damn!

246
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,799
Blast! I think I was in there.

247
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:09,055
If you do see her,
could you tell her I've gone to my room?

248
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,598
Yeah.

249
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,725
- Your whisky, sir.
- Thank you.

250
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:15,227
- And one for the...
- Road. Lovely.

251
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,938
I think I might have one of those.
Do you mind if I join you?

252
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:23,026
- No. It'd be lovely.
- Another glass of whisky and a cigar.

253
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:26,905
Hold on. Make that a bottle.
We might as well settle in, eh?

254
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:29,407
Let's see if we can push on till dawn.

255
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,534
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes.

256
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:35,746
I was at school with his brother Bufty.
Tremendous bloke.

257
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:38,707
He was head of my house.
Buggered me senseless.

258
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,085
Still, it taught me about life.

259
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,755
Where do you know him from?

260
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,840
- University.
- Splendid.

261
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,968
Splendid. Yep.

262
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:53,471
I didn't go myself. I couldn't see the point.

263
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:57,225
When you work in the money markets, what
use of the nobles of wordsworth gonna be?

264
00:28:57,684 --> 00:29:01,187
Excuse me, sir. Your wife says
could you come upstairs at once?

265
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,814
Room 12, in case you're so drunk
you can't remember.

266
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,233
- My wife?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,278
My wife!

268
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:12,656
God! You are drunk if you can't
remember you've got a wife.

269
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:14,700
Yeah...

270
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:19,370
- Do you mind if I...
- No, no. Off you go. Best of luck.

271
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:23,374
Lucky bachelor, me. I'll have another
search for that Katie creature.

272
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:26,711
- Carrie.
- That's the one. Damn fine filly.

273
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,714
I think I'm in there.

274
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:47,896
- Hi.
- Hello.

275
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:51,108
- Sorry about that.
- He was hard to get rid of.

276
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,360
Yeah.

277
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:54,570
So...

278
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:07,915
Maybe we could just skulk around here
for a bit and then go back down.

279
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:12,003
That's a thought. I don't usually skulk,...

280
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:15,965
...but I suppose I could skulk
if skulking were required.

281
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,634
Do you skulk regularly?

282
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:25,724
No. No, I don't normally think of myself
as a skulker but...

283
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:35,524
Well, why don't you come in
and skulk for a while and we'll see?

284
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:48,745
I noticed the bride and groom didn't kiss
in the church, which is kind of strange.

285
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,873
Where I come from, kissing is very big.

286
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:56,795
Is it? Well, I think you're right.
We are probably more reserved.

287
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:00,131
"You may kiss the bride" isn't
actually in the Book of Common Prayer.

288
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:04,093
I always worry I'll go too far
in the heat of the moment.

289
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,099
How far do you think too far would be?

290
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,601
I don't know.

291
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,771
Maybe...

292
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,149
...that would be all right.

293
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:24,821
- I think that would be fine.
- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.

294
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,491
Maybe this...

295
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,910
...might be better.

296
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:38,083
Yeah, I think it would be dangerous
to take it any further.

297
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:41,086
I mean...

298
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,891
That might be taking it a little far.

299
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:03,565
What about this?

300
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:08,528
Do you think the vicar would think things
had slipped a little out of his control?

301
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,409
I think he might. This kind of thing
is really better suited to the honeymoon...

302
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:17,119
...than to the service itself.

303
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:20,122
Why do you think
it's called a honeymoon?

304
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:26,503
I don't know. I suppose it's "honey"
cos it's sweet as honey...

305
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:30,841
...and "moon" because it was the first time...

306
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:35,762
...a husband got to see his wife's bottom.

307
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,093
What's happening?

308
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,680
I have to go.

309
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:25,934
- Where?
- America.

310
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:29,813
That is a tragedy.

311
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,274
Just before I go,...

312
00:33:33,357 --> 00:33:37,569
...when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?

313
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:42,658
Sorry. Whose engagement?

314
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:45,327
Ours.

315
00:33:45,494 --> 00:33:49,872
I assumed since we slept together
and everything, we'd be getting married.

316
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:52,583
What did you think?

317
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,672
I...

318
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:06,346
Gosh! You know, that takes a lot
of thinking about, that kind of thing.

319
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:09,141
Obviously, I'm... I...

320
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,645
You're joking.

321
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:20,234
God! For a moment there
I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.

322
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:25,114
You were Glenn Close and I was
gonna find my pet rabbit on the stove.

323
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,451
No.

324
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,872
But I think we both missed
a great opportunity here.

325
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,046
Bye.

326
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:08,863
Oh, fuck!

327
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:13,326
Fuck!

328
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,912
Fuckity fuck!

329
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,705
Fuck!

330
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:22,084
- Car or taxi?
- Taxi. We could never park.

331
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:33,094
Car seems a good idea.

332
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,264
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

333
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,942
Leave it. No one will notice.

334
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:15,925
Sorry, I'm late. Traffic.

335
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,431
Yeah... Who is it today?

336
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,921
One more, please.

337
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:53,934
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

338
00:37:54,268 --> 00:37:56,144
Amen.

339
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:58,939
Let us pray.

340
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:03,609
Father, you have made
the bond of marriage a holy mystery,...

341
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:08,072
...a symbol of Christ's love for his church.

342
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:16,830
Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia
through your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,...

343
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:21,001
...who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Goat...

344
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:23,670
Ghost.

345
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:27,007
One God, for ever and ever.

346
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:28,925
Amen.

347
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,594
It's his first time. He's a family friend.

348
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:34,847
Bernard and Lydia,...

349
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:39,685
...I shall now ask if you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage.

350
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,896
Bernard, repeat after me.

351
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:47,358
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

352
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,236
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

353
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,573
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

354
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:55,575
...why I, Lydia...

355
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,578
...why I, Bernard...

356
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:01,788
Sorry.

357
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:09,254
...why I, Bernard Godfrey
Saint John Delaney,...

358
00:39:09,504 --> 00:39:14,217
...why I, Bernard Geoffrey
St John Delaney,...

359
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:21,474
...may not be joined in matrimony
to Lydia John Hibbott.

360
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:27,146
...may not be joined in matrimony
to Lydia Jane Hibbott.

361
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,234
Lydia, repeat after me.

362
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:36,529
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

363
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:39,032
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

364
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:42,661
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

365
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,580
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

366
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,959
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

367
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,503
...may not be johned in matrimony...

368
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:56,382
...may not be joined in matrimony...

369
00:39:56,674 --> 00:40:02,262
...to Bernard Geoffrey
Sidd... Siddun... Delaney.

370
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:08,017
...to Bernard Geoffrey St John Delaney.

371
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,898
I call upon those persons
here present to witness...

372
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:19,236
I call upon those persons
here present to witness...

373
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:21,780
...that I, Bernard...

374
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:30,162
...Delaney,...

375
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,750
...that I, Bernard Delaney,...

376
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,503
...do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

377
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,965
...do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

378
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:44,175
...to be my awful wedded wife.

379
00:40:44,426 --> 00:40:47,345
...to be my lawful wedded wife.

380
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:49,556
That's ri... That's right.

381
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:52,183
May Almighty God bless you all.

382
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,021
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spigot... Spirit.

383
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:57,272
Amen.

384
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,440
Bravo!

385
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,003
Thanks.

386
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,172
Coming, Bernie!

387
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:25,924
Sorry.

388
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:28,551
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

389
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:30,510
That way?

390
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:33,180
Sorry. Could you two...? Sorry.

391
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:35,641
Sorry!

392
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:54,158
I've got a new theory about marriage.

393
00:41:54,909 --> 00:42:00,580
Two people are in love, they live together,
and one day they run out of conversation.

394
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:04,834
Totally. They can't think of a single thing
to say to each other.

395
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:07,087
That's it. Panic.

396
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:13,218
Then suddenly, it occurs to the chap
that there is a way out of the deadlock.

397
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,888
- Which is?
- He'll ask her to marry him.

398
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,057
Brilliant!

399
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:24,645
They've got something to talk about
for the rest of their lives.

400
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:28,566
So it's just a way out of
an embarrassing pause in conversation.

401
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:31,276
The definitive icebreaker.

402
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:35,572
- Tom! How's the speech coming along?
- It's pretty good, I think.

403
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:39,075
Something for everyone. Tears, laughter...

404
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:44,162
- Excellent.
- It's a very good theory, Gareth.

405
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:49,209
There is another argument, of course,
that it has something to do with true love.

406
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:51,545
Well, there's a thought.

407
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,802
- Can I help you, sir?
- Can I have three brandies, please?

408
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:01,470
Hi.

409
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,181
Hello!

410
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,851
- How are you?
- Fine!

411
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,105
Sorry. I'm overwhelmed to see you.

412
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,775
Look, don't go back to America. Please.

413
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,820
- I'll be back in two secs, OK?
- OK.

414
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:22,240
Hi, Fi.

415
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,035
Those are yours. See you in five hours.

416
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:29,204
- Something happened?
- It has. This is a bloody great wedding.

417
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:36,086
Hi.

418
00:43:36,253 --> 00:43:40,090
Well, you look perfect.
In fact, you probably are perfect.

419
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:43,052
- How are you?
- I'm really well.

420
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,596
Charles, I'd like you
to meet Hamish, my fiancé.

421
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:52,769
Excellent.

422
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:55,730
How do you do, Hamish?
Delighted to meet you.

423
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,149
Charming surprise
to find Carrie back in the country.

424
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:00,359
Took a lot of persuading, I can tell you.

425
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:02,945
Darling, I told James
I was going to get you.

426
00:44:03,153 --> 00:44:06,156
He'll think I've totally
lost control of you already.

427
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:08,575
I'll see you later.

428
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:19,919
How are you doing, Charles?

429
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:23,381
Not great, actually, suddenly.

430
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,510
I don't know...

431
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:33,640
I mean, what the hell’s going on here?

432
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:38,395
Why am I always at weddings
and never actually getting married, Matt?

433
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:41,606
It's probably because you're a bit scruffy.

434
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:46,819
Or it could also be because
you haven't met the right girl.

435
00:44:46,944 --> 00:44:49,280
Obviously, is that it?

436
00:44:49,446 --> 00:44:54,827
Maybe I have met the right girls.
Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.

437
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:57,288
- Maybe it's me.
- Nonsense.

438
00:44:57,454 --> 00:45:02,375
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

439
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,629
Come on. Odds on,
you meet your wife at dinner.

440
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:09,924
Yes.

441
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,227
Oh, my God!

442
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,357
Charles?

443
00:45:34,363 --> 00:45:36,574
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Alistair.

444
00:45:36,782 --> 00:45:37,783
Great.

445
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:41,120
- I believe you know Veronica.
- Yeah. Hi, Vee. Hi.

446
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,371
Nicki.

447
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:47,334
Great.

448
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:54,925
Tell me, are you married?

449
00:45:55,592 --> 00:45:56,760
No.

450
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:59,803
- Are you a lesbian?
- Good Lord!

451
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,307
What made you say that?

452
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:06,268
It's one of the possibilities
for unmarried girls.

453
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:11,106
It is a bit more interesting than saying
"oh dear, just never found the right chap".

454
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:15,401
- Quite right. Why be dull?
- Thank you.

455
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:24,160
The truth is, I have met the right person,
only he's not in love with me.

456
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:27,830
And until I stop loving him
no one else stands a chance.

457
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,499
- Bad luck.
- Yes, isn't it?

458
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:36,004
I was a lesbian once at school,
but only for 15 minutes.

459
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,423
I don't think it counts.

460
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,015
There are 400 different kinds of tea,...

461
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,727
...and that's not including
all these so-called fruit teas.

462
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:55,731
I took Veronica out to India at Christmas
to look at the plantations.

463
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,817
- You and her went there once.
- That's right.

464
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:03,280
Charles was vile. He insisted on
cracking jokes all the time I was ill.

465
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:06,783
- Trying to cheer you up.
- You're that Veronica!

466
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,619
Which Veronica? Charlie?

467
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,622
- Remember Bombay?
- When Charles and I were going out,...

468
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,500
...he told me he'd had this
interesting journey round India...

469
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,087
...with Vomiting Veronica.
I think that was it.

470
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,424
I don't remember ever mentioning it.
Maybe I did.

471
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,760
Come on, Charles. I don't think I've
ever been out with anyone less discreet.

472
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,931
- That's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it?
- It is not.

473
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:35,101
I remember you going on
about this girl Helena...

474
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:38,521
...whose mother made a pass at you.
- I remember this.

475
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:42,900
You couldn't work out whether it would
be impolite not to accept her advances.

476
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:46,195
That's right. Mrs Piggy.
Helena was Miss Piggy,...

477
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:48,864
...so her mother was Mrs Piggy!

478
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,575
I think perhaps it was a...

479
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:54,494
We've both lost a lot of weight since then.

480
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,794
Great! The speeches.

481
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:09,091
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
pray silence for the best man.

482
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,440
When Bernard told me
he was getting engaged to Lydia,...

483
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,611
...I congratulated him because all his other
girlfriends were such complete dogs.

484
00:48:33,405 --> 00:48:37,201
Although may I say how delighted we are
to have so many of them here today.

485
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:45,124
I'm particularly delighted to see Camilla,
who many of you will remember...

486
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:50,129
...as the first person
Bernard asked to marry him.

487
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:53,841
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off.

488
00:48:57,803 --> 00:48:59,721
And lucky for Lydia that she did.

489
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,396
It's very disappointing.

490
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:15,278
We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.

491
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,574
Apparently her fiancé's awfully grand
and he owns half of Scotland.

492
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,035
- How are you?
- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.

493
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,872
Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.

494
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,582
If I meet Henrietta,
the horror will be complete.

495
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,208
Hello, Charles.

496
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:33,086
Hello, Hen. How are you?

497
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:35,630
Hen...

498
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:39,342
Why can't you leave her alone?
Haven't you hurt her enough?

499
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:46,849
Excuse me. I think I'd better be
where other people are not.

500
00:49:54,732 --> 00:49:55,649
Hello.

501
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:05,881
Taxi!

502
00:51:13,888 --> 00:51:15,390
Good night, sir.

503
00:51:55,469 --> 00:51:58,889
It's all right. Oh, God! This is wonderful.

504
00:52:17,907 --> 00:52:21,827
Wait a minute. This is no fun.
I want to see my lovely husband...

505
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:50,646
...who's a very bad bridegroom indeed.

506
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:08,496
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.

507
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:12,165
- What's his name?
- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.

508
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:15,168
- What about you?
- No. Afraid not.

509
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,296
Why not?

510
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:20,674
Don't know.

511
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:26,429
Because most of the blokes I fancy
think I'm stupid and pointless,...

512
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,431
...so they just bonk me and then leave me,...

513
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:33,477
...and the kind of blokes that do fancy me,
I think are drips.

514
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:36,230
I can't even be bothered to bonk them,...

515
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:39,400
...which does sort of leave me
a bit nowhere.

516
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,569
What's bonking?

517
00:53:44,112 --> 00:53:50,034
Well, it's kind of like table tennis,
only with slightly smaller balls.

518
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,974
So good!

519
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,823
- I love my wife!
- And I love my husband!

520
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:39,372
- Do you think we'd better get back?
- We could just wait a few minutes...

521
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:41,540
...and have another go.

522
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,669
Naughty little rabbit!

523
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:53,594
Found it.

524
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:00,683
Charles! Charles, we must talk.

525
00:55:03,186 --> 00:55:04,604
Right.

526
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:08,775
The thing is, Charlie,
I've spoken to lots of people about you.

527
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:12,736
Everybody agrees
you're in real trouble, Charles.

528
00:55:12,986 --> 00:55:13,987
Am I?

529
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:18,325
You see, you're turning into
a kind of serial monogamist.

530
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:22,913
One girlfriend after another,
yet you never really let anyone near you.

531
00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:25,082
On the contrary...

532
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,292
...you're affectionate to them
and sweet to them.

533
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:30,920
Even to me,
although you thought I was an idiot.

534
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:33,130
- I did not.
- You did.

535
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:36,384
- I thought U2 was a type of submarine.
- In a way, you were right.

536
00:55:36,676 --> 00:55:39,971
- Their music has a naval quality.
- Be serious, Charles.

537
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:43,807
Give people a chance. You don't
have to think "I must get married",...

538
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:47,853
...but you mustn't start relationships
thinking "I mustn't get married".

539
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:52,107
Most of the time I don't think at all.
I just potter along.

540
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:53,692
Charlie!

541
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:57,236
Oh, God! The way you used to look at me!

542
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:59,780
I just misread it, that's all.

543
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,491
I thought you were going to propose...

544
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,202
...and you were just working out
how to leave.

545
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:09,248
- No. No, I wasn't.
- Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

546
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:12,625
Hen...

547
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:17,088
- Having a good night?
- Yes.

548
00:56:17,297 --> 00:56:22,218
It's right up there with my father's
funeral for sheer entertainment value.

549
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:26,221
- I thought you'd gone.
- No. Hamish took the Edinburgh sleeper.

550
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:28,891
I'm off now. Keep me company?

551
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,573
Here, please.

552
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:48,910
You want to come up for a nightcap?

553
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:54,373
- You sure?
- Well, yes. I think we can risk it.

554
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:58,376
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.
You're not that cute.

555
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,213
Sorry... Yeah, great.

556
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:18,243
Morning, Charles. Breakfast's up.

557
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,126
What are you up to today?

558
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:29,044
Oh, yeah...

559
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:34,633
I'm taking advantage of the fact that,
for the first time in my entire life,...

560
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:38,137
...it's Saturday
and I don't have a wedding to go to.

561
00:58:38,387 --> 00:58:40,680
All I have to do is not be late for David.

562
00:58:40,763 --> 00:58:42,765
I was going to go for a job.

563
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:47,687
This new shop called Spank wants
a sales assistant. I think I'd be great.

564
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:51,357
- They sell all this funny rubber stuff.
- No...

565
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:56,612
Another wedding invitation,
and a list. Lovely!

566
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:59,448
They say rubber's mainly for perverts.

567
00:58:59,656 --> 00:59:02,951
Don't know why.
I think it's very practical, actually.

568
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:05,871
You spill anything on it
and it just comes off.

569
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:08,707
That could be why the perverts like it.

570
00:59:08,957 --> 00:59:11,167
You all right?

571
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:14,295
Yeah.

572
00:59:15,004 --> 00:59:19,217
It's that girl Carrie.
You remember, the...

573
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:21,677
The American.

574
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:34,397
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

575
00:59:34,564 --> 00:59:37,692
- Do you have the wedding list for Banks?
- Certainly, sir.

576
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:41,445
Lots of beautiful things
for around about the Ł1,000 mark.

577
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:47,326
What about things around
the sort of Ł50 mark? Is there much?

578
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:51,956
Well, you could get
that Pygmy warrior over there.

579
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,834
This? Excellent!

580
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:58,628
If you could find someone
to chip in the other 3,950.

581
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:01,339
Or our carrier bags are Ł1.50 each.

582
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,883
Why don't you just get 33 of them?

583
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,847
Well, I think I'll probably leave it.

584
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:12,099
Thanks very much. You've been very...

585
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,978
- What did you get?
- Blimey!

586
01:00:16,186 --> 01:00:18,605
Well, I never!

587
01:00:18,814 --> 01:00:21,817
Nothing yet. I'm just, you know, deciding.

588
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:25,027
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

589
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:30,533
This present thing is great.
I should've gotten married years ago.

590
01:00:30,783 --> 01:00:33,661
- Anybody get the Pygmy?
- The young man thought about it...

591
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,455
No!

592
01:00:36,497 --> 01:00:39,083
Just get me an ashtray.

593
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,961
Are you free for about a half-hour?

594
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:44,588
Yeah.

595
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:47,841
I'm meeting my brother,
but I can be a bit late.

596
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:51,261
Oh, good. You have
an important decision to make.

597
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:55,055
- Now, you mustn't laugh.
- OK. Right.

598
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,399
What do you think?

599
01:01:07,193 --> 01:01:08,777
Divine.

600
01:01:08,944 --> 01:01:11,738
Bit of a meringue?

601
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:15,492
Don't worry. We've only just begun.

602
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,955
What do you think?

603
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:24,501
- You're kidding.
- But it would be wonderful.

604
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:27,169
Maybe next time.

605
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:31,340
What do you think?

606
01:01:35,427 --> 01:01:38,722
- I knew it.
- With a staff, you could look after sheep.

607
01:01:39,306 --> 01:01:40,807
Don't be rude.

608
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:43,893
It's a bit sexy, this.

609
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:47,104
Well...

610
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:50,399
If I were your husband,
I would die of pride.

611
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:52,568
You may be right. It is dangerous.

612
01:01:52,735 --> 01:01:56,530
There's nothing worse at a wedding
than a priest with an erection.

613
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:05,247
It's strange thinking
you'll never sleep with anyone else.

614
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,875
- You don't think you'll be unfaithful?
- No. Not once I'm married.

615
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:13,587
I told Hamish I'll kill him if he does,
so I'd better stick to that.

616
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,214
Quite right.

617
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:18,342
Anyway, I reckon I've had my fair run at it.

618
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,638
What is a fair run these days,
down your way?

619
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:25,265
I don't know.

620
01:02:25,473 --> 01:02:27,475
More than one.

621
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:29,853
Well, come on. Tell me.

622
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,815
I've seen the dress. We have no secrets.

623
01:02:38,027 --> 01:02:40,028
Well...

624
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:46,118
The first one - of course,
not easily forgotten - was kinda nice.

625
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:50,080
Two... hairy back.

626
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,253
Three, four, five... Six was
on my birthday in my parents' room.

627
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:00,006
- Which birthday?
- 17th.

628
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:03,092
- We've only reached 17?
- I grew up in the country...

629
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,803
...lots of rolling around in haystacks.

630
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:09,431
OK. Seven...

631
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:12,684
Eight, unfortunately, was quite a shock.

632
01:03:13,852 --> 01:03:17,564
Nine, against a fence.
Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.

633
01:03:17,814 --> 01:03:18,815
I won't.

634
01:03:18,982 --> 01:03:22,486
Ten was gorgeous. Just heaven, just...

635
01:03:23,987 --> 01:03:27,281
- He was wonderful.
- I hate him.

636
01:03:28,532 --> 01:03:31,535
11, obviously after 10, disappointing.

637
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:36,499
12 through 17, the university years.
Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.

638
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:39,501
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.

639
01:03:41,294 --> 01:03:43,588
18 broke my heart.

640
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:46,299
- Years of yearning.
- I'm sorry.

641
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:49,511
20... Oh, my God!
I can't believe I've reached 20.

642
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:53,473
21, elephant tongue.

643
01:03:55,182 --> 01:03:58,769
22 kept falling asleep.
That was my first year in England.

644
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:00,437
I do apologise.

645
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:03,440
- 23 and 24 together. That was something.
- Seriously?

646
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,901
27... That was a mistake.

647
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,905
- Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?
- Yes, he kept screaming.

648
01:04:11,197 --> 01:04:14,283
Very off-putting.
I nearly gave up on the whole thing.

649
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:17,119
But Spencer changed my mind. That's 28.

650
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,289
- His father, 29.
- With his father?

651
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,416
30.

652
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:25,502
31... Oh, my God.

653
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,548
32 was lovely.

654
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,553
And then my fiancé, that's 33.

655
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,098
Wow!

656
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:41,809
So I came after your fiancé?

657
01:04:42,351 --> 01:04:44,770
No, you were 32.

658
01:04:46,772 --> 01:04:48,566
So there you go.

659
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:52,361
Less than Madonna,
more than Princess Di - I hope.

660
01:04:53,028 --> 01:04:55,530
And how about you?
How many have you slept with?

661
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,741
Christ! Nothing like that many.
I don't know...

662
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:01,870
I don't know what the fuck
I've been doing with my time.

663
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:06,374
Work, probably. Yeah, work.
I have been working late a lot.

664
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:16,925
I wish I'd rung you.

665
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,180
But then you never rang me.

666
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:25,933
You ruthlessly slept with me twice
and never rang me.

667
01:05:30,771 --> 01:05:32,648
Bollocks!

668
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:35,067
Help me, please! Please!

669
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:50,665
Carrie, this is David, my brother.

670
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:55,503
Hi.

671
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:12,977
I was just telling him
about you marrying Hamish...

672
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:16,815
...and he said it couldn't have happened
to a nicer fellow.

673
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:22,904
- Where are you doing it?
- Scotland.

674
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:31,120
He says that's a beautiful place. Hilly.

675
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:34,456
You should come to the wedding, too.

676
01:06:34,665 --> 01:06:39,794
I want lots of friends to make up for
the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.

677
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:43,047
Well, you'd better go in.

678
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:44,549
Bye.

679
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:47,218
- Bye.
- Bye.

680
01:06:57,602 --> 01:06:59,604
Fuck it!

681
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:15,536
Look. Sorry.

682
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:19,165
I just... Well...
This is a really stupid question,...

683
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:22,209
...particularly in view
of our shopping excursion,...

684
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:25,837
...but I just wondered if by any chance...

685
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:31,259
Obviously not, because
I've only slept with nine people.

686
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,720
But I... I just wondered...

687
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:36,431
I really feel...

688
01:07:36,514 --> 01:07:40,809
In short, to recap
in a slightly clearer version,...

689
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:45,606
...in the words of David Cassidy,
while still with the Partridge Family,...

690
01:07:45,898 --> 01:07:48,901
...I think I love you. And...

691
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:53,946
...I just wondered whether
by any chance you wouldn't like to...

692
01:07:57,158 --> 01:08:00,161
No. No, of course not.

693
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:04,081
I'm an idiot. He's not.

694
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,250
Excellent. Fantastic.

695
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:09,628
Lovely to see you.
Sorry to disturb. Better get on.

696
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,298
- Fuck!
- That was very romantic.

697
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:20,847
Well, I thought it over a lot, you know.
I wanted to get it just right.

698
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,309
Important to have said it, I think.

699
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,853
Said what, exactly?

700
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:36,112
Said, you know, what I just said
about David Cassidy.

701
01:08:40,907 --> 01:08:43,743
You're lovely.

702
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:40,629
It was ordained for lifelong faithful
relationships and conjugal love.

703
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:43,591
It was ordained
for the welfare of human society,...

704
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:45,843
...which can be strong and happy...

705
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:49,013
...only when the marriage bond
is held in honour.

706
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:54,768
Into this holy estate
these two persons now desire to enter.

707
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:58,938
Wherefore, if anyone can show
any just cause...

708
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:02,567
...why they may not lawfully
be joined together in marriage,...

709
01:10:02,776 --> 01:10:04,778
...let him now declare it.

710
01:10:09,281 --> 01:10:10,949
Sorry.

711
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:13,035
Please rise.

712
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:20,834
Do you, Hamish, take this woman
Caroline to be your wedded wife...

713
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:25,046
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

714
01:10:25,338 --> 01:10:29,509
...promise and covenant to be to her
a loving and faithful husband...

715
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:32,595
...until God shall separate you by death?

716
01:10:32,845 --> 01:10:34,722
I do.

717
01:10:34,889 --> 01:10:39,184
Do you, Caroline, take this man Hamish
to be your wedded husband...

718
01:10:39,392 --> 01:10:43,188
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

719
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,983
...promise and covenant to be to him
a loving and faithful wife...

720
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:49,736
...until God shall separate you by death?

721
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:50,946
I do.

722
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:55,491
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

723
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:23,976
- How awfully nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

724
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:28,772
Hello.

725
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:33,068
You look beautiful.
Not a meringue in sight.

726
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:34,903
Thanks.

727
01:11:40,616 --> 01:11:42,618
Blimey!

728
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:46,539
It's Brigadoon! It's bloody Brigadoon!

729
01:11:57,507 --> 01:12:00,886
Dear old things, as you know,
I've always been proud...

730
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:04,473
...that there's not a wedding ring
between the lot of us.

731
01:12:04,723 --> 01:12:08,184
Over the passing of the years,
it's beginning to distress me.

732
01:12:08,434 --> 01:12:12,271
I'd like to go to the wedding
of someone I really loved for a change.

733
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,608
Don't blame me.
I've asked practically everyone I know.

734
01:12:15,858 --> 01:12:18,444
- You haven't asked me.
- Haven't I?

735
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:21,655
Oh, Scarlett... Would you like to?

736
01:12:21,906 --> 01:12:24,491
No, thank you.
It was very nice of you to ask.

737
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:26,493
Well... Any time.

738
01:12:26,618 --> 01:12:29,496
Quite right, Tom, quite right.
That's the spirit.

739
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:32,540
Tonight, these are your orders.

740
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:36,753
Go forth and conjugate.
Find husbands and wives.

741
01:12:37,003 --> 01:12:40,422
Excellent. What do you think, Fifi?
Spot a potential hubby?

742
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:42,966
- Bugger off, Tom.
- Quite right.

743
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,761
A toast before we go into battle.

744
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,139
True love.

745
01:12:49,306 --> 01:12:51,683
In whatever shape or form it may come.

746
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:56,896
May we all in our dotage be proud to say
"I was adored once, too."

747
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:00,858
- True love.
- True love!

748
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:12,369
Apparently, an enormous
number of people...

749
01:13:12,494 --> 01:13:15,789
...actually bump into
their future spouses at weddings,...

750
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,999
...which is interesting.

751
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,585
Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.

752
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:33,556
Good Lord, I seem to have finished
my drink. If you'll excuse me.

753
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:40,937
Hello. My name's Scarlett.

754
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:44,149
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.

755
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:47,318
- What's your name?
- My name's Rhett.

756
01:13:47,485 --> 01:13:48,903
No...

757
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,364
- Not really?
- No, not really.

758
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:54,450
- In fact, it's Chester.
- You kidder!

759
01:13:55,826 --> 01:13:59,037
I always imagine Americans
are gonna be dull as shit.

760
01:13:59,288 --> 01:14:01,290
Of course you're not, are you?

761
01:14:01,457 --> 01:14:04,042
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?

762
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,837
Yes, he is.

763
01:14:07,004 --> 01:14:09,005
You're lovely.

764
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:20,558
Hello, Charles.

765
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:23,268
Oh, Hen. Hi.

766
01:14:23,477 --> 01:14:25,979
Look, I couldn't really bear a scene today.

767
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:28,899
I know we've probably
got tons to talk about...

768
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,777
Did I behave that atrociously last time?

769
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:35,572
Well, you remember
the shower scene in Psycho?

770
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:38,199
Scarier.

771
01:14:39,116 --> 01:14:41,202
God, I'm depressed, Hen! How are you?

772
01:14:41,285 --> 01:14:46,499
I'm cheerful. I weigh almost nothing
and I've got a divine new boyfriend.

773
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:50,795
Perhaps we should've got married.

774
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:55,799
No! I'd have had to marry your friends,
and I'm not sure I could take Fiona.

775
01:14:56,132 --> 01:14:57,717
Fiona loves you.

776
01:14:57,801 --> 01:15:01,679
- Fiona calls me Duckface.
- Well, I never heard that.

777
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:05,225
Look, darling, come to lunch soon.
Give me a ring.

778
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:07,518
Still cute.

779
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,732
How's Duckface?

780
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:16,151
Good form, actually. Not too mad.

781
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:22,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom!

782
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:02,445
You like this girl, don't you?

783
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:07,031
Yes.

784
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:11,494
Yes, it's...

785
01:16:12,412 --> 01:16:15,415
It's a strange thing
when at last it happens.

786
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:20,170
And she's marrying someone else.

787
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:32,723
How about you, Fifi? Have you
identified a future partner for life yet?

788
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:35,809
No need, really.

789
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:39,479
The deed is done.

790
01:16:39,645 --> 01:16:42,732
I've been in love
with the same bloke for ages.

791
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:46,277
Have you? Who's that?

792
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:50,281
You, Charlie.

793
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:10,966
It's always been you.

794
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:16,305
Since first we met so many years ago.

795
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:20,726
I knew the first moment.

796
01:17:20,935 --> 01:17:23,853
Across a crowded room. A lawn, in fact.

797
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:31,861
Doesn't matter.

798
01:17:33,029 --> 01:17:36,657
Nothing either of us can do
on this one. Such is life.

799
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:44,706
Friends isn't bad, you know.

800
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:47,251
Friends is quite something.

801
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,213
Oh, Fi...

802
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:04,600
It's not all easy, is it?

803
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:07,436
No.

804
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:12,149
Just forget this business. Not to be.

805
01:18:15,819 --> 01:18:17,904
Matthew, darling.

806
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:21,323
- Where's Gareth?
- Torturing Americans.

807
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:24,326
How thoughtful of him.

808
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,458
Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?

809
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:33,502
Not personally, no.

810
01:18:34,003 --> 01:18:38,548
But I do know someone
who could get his fax number for you.

811
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,134
Shall we dance?

812
01:19:26,384 --> 01:19:28,970
Well? Any rings on fingers?

813
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:31,306
Gareth, you don't know
how lucky you are.

814
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:34,101
Finding someone to marry
is a tricky business.

815
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:38,854
It's hell out there. Matthew's trapped
with an evangelist from Minnesota.

816
01:19:39,105 --> 01:19:41,273
Sweet Jesus, cast out the devil!

817
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:47,029
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
please charge your glasses.

818
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:51,199
First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.

819
01:19:53,284 --> 01:19:55,703
Excellent. I love this girl.

820
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:58,540
Thank you.

821
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:03,503
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you
who've flown in from the States.

822
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:08,757
As for the rest of you, I'd have thought
that lots of frightful Americans flying in...

823
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:12,136
...was an excuse for staying away.
So I thank you, too.

824
01:20:16,223 --> 01:20:20,810
If my darling dad had been here today,
he would have been speaking now,...

825
01:20:20,977 --> 01:20:23,104
...and I know what he would have said:

826
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:29,110
"Great dress, babe, but why in the hell
are you marrying the stiff in the skirt?"

827
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:35,658
And I would have given him
the same answer that I give you:

828
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:37,951
"Because I love him."

829
01:20:38,118 --> 01:20:41,621
As John Lennon said,
who died the same year as my dad,...

830
01:20:41,872 --> 01:20:45,584
"Love is the answer,
and you know that for sure."

831
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:53,424
And one more thing.

832
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:57,928
Someone told me here that, if things with
Hamish didn't work out, he would step in.

833
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,515
I just wanted to say thanks,
and I'll keep you posted.

834
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:07,562
Bravo!

835
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:11,524
Now, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
Sir Hamish Banks.

836
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:20,866
Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years...

837
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:24,078
...has got used to being
upstaged by a woman.

838
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:28,624
I didn't expect it to happen to me
on my wedding day.

839
01:21:28,874 --> 01:21:32,669
However, I must also say
that I'm quite happy...

840
01:21:32,961 --> 01:21:36,547
...to be upstaged by this woman
for the rest of my life.

841
01:21:36,798 --> 01:21:41,135
Is that some barracking at the back?
We politicians are used to that.

842
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:44,305
- Shit! Find a doctor!
- Right. OK.

843
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,225
First of all,
my compliments to the bridesmaids.

844
01:21:47,475 --> 01:21:49,769
You did your duties superbly.

845
01:21:49,977 --> 01:21:54,272
And obviously I intend to use you
every time I get married from now on.

846
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:04,199
I want to thank
all those wonderful ladies of the parish...

847
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:06,534
...who did the flowers in the church.

848
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:10,830
The stern old building took on
a look of flushed youth today.

849
01:22:19,463 --> 01:22:22,966
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on Caroline.

850
01:22:23,216 --> 01:22:27,929
I thought to myself:
"If by any chance she's short-sighted,...

851
01:22:28,263 --> 01:22:31,558
...I might just be happy
for the rest of my life."

852
01:22:32,809 --> 01:22:35,602
I thought I could see my future
for the first time.

853
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:41,024
It was a joyful one,
for years and years to come.

854
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:16,823
Good morning, and a warm welcome
to you all on this cold day.

855
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:19,991
Our service will begin in a few minutes.

856
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,705
But first we have asked Matthew,
Gareth's closest friend,...

857
01:24:24,996 --> 01:24:27,582
...to say a few words.

858
01:24:36,048 --> 01:24:39,260
Gareth used to prefer funerals
to weddings.

859
01:24:39,427 --> 01:24:42,221
He said it was easier to get enthusiastic...

860
01:24:42,304 --> 01:24:47,226
...about a ceremony one had an outside
chance of eventually being involved in.

861
01:24:49,228 --> 01:24:52,272
In order to prepare this speech,
I rang a few people...

862
01:24:52,522 --> 01:24:57,110
...to get a general picture of how Gareth
was regarded by those who met him.

863
01:24:58,778 --> 01:25:02,574
"Fat" seems to have been a word
people most connected with him.

864
01:25:04,825 --> 01:25:07,828
"Terribly rude" also rang a lot of bells.

865
01:25:09,663 --> 01:25:15,461
So "very fat" and "very rude" seems
to have been the stranger's viewpoint.

866
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:19,381
But some of you have rung me
and let me know that you loved him,...

867
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:23,259
...which I know he would have been
thrilled to hear.

868
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:28,556
You remember his fabulous hospitality,
his strange experimental cooking.

869
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:35,896
The recipe for duck á la banana
fortunately goes with him to his grave.

870
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:42,569
Most of all, you tell me of
his enormous capacity for joy.

871
01:25:42,986 --> 01:25:48,075
And, when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness.

872
01:25:51,577 --> 01:25:54,747
I hope joyful is how
you will remember him.

873
01:25:56,957 --> 01:25:59,752
Not stuck in a box in a church.

874
01:26:03,005 --> 01:26:07,300
Pick your favourite of his waistcoats
and remember him that way.

875
01:26:07,592 --> 01:26:11,388
The most splendid, replete,...

876
01:26:12,722 --> 01:26:15,725
...big-hearted...

877
01:26:16,351 --> 01:26:18,978
...weak-hearted, as it turned out -...

878
01:26:19,145 --> 01:26:22,147
...and jolly bugger most of us ever met.

879
01:26:25,317 --> 01:26:28,445
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.

880
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:32,449
What I thought of him.

881
01:26:36,619 --> 01:26:39,580
Unfortunately, there I run out of words.

882
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:45,128
Forgive me
if I turn from my own feelings...

883
01:26:45,336 --> 01:26:50,549
...to the words of another
splendid bugger, W.H. Auden.

884
01:26:51,508 --> 01:26:54,010
This is actually what I want to say:

885
01:26:57,347 --> 01:27:00,726
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,

886
01:27:02,686 --> 01:27:05,896
Prevent the dog from barking
with a juicy bone,

887
01:27:08,107 --> 01:27:11,193
Silence the pianos
and with muffled drum

888
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:15,781
Bring out the coffin,
let the mourners come.

889
01:27:17,575 --> 01:27:20,285
Let the aeroplanes circle
moaning overhead

890
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:24,581
Scribbling on the sky the message
He Is Dead.

891
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,253
Put crepe bows round the white necks
of the public doves,

892
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:35,883
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.

893
01:27:37,676 --> 01:27:41,680
He was my North, my South,
my East and West.

894
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:46,518
My working week and my Sunday rest,

895
01:27:48,312 --> 01:27:52,315
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;

896
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:58,321
I thought that love would last for ever:

897
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:01,574
I was wrong.

898
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:07,079
The stars are not wanted now:

899
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,083
Put out every one;

900
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:15,337
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;

901
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,925
Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the wood.

902
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:26,138
For nothing now
can ever come to any good.

903
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:08,010
It was good of you to come. Must have
been the shortest honeymoon in history.

904
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,722
No, it's fine. We'll do it some other time.

905
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,021
You know, what you said in the street...

906
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:21,440
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
- No, I liked it.

907
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:24,359
I liked you saying it.

908
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,872
Charlie, I'll take Scarlett home, all right?

909
01:29:39,373 --> 01:29:41,375
Darling Fi.

910
01:29:49,799 --> 01:29:51,593
Walk, Charlie?

911
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:54,387
Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.

912
01:29:57,849 --> 01:30:01,436
Never felt like that.
I mean, something vaguely similar,...

913
01:30:01,686 --> 01:30:04,521
...for Jilly, when I was young.

914
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:06,523
Jilly?

915
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,692
Labrador.

916
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,404
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

917
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:15,115
All these years
we've been single and proud of it...

918
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:19,952
...and never noticed that two of us were,
in effect, married all this time.

919
01:30:20,244 --> 01:30:22,580
Traitors in our midst.

920
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:30,296
You know, I think death is hardest
for the parents, don't you?

921
01:30:30,588 --> 01:30:32,882
I hope I die before my children.

922
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:34,466
Tom...

923
01:30:34,549 --> 01:30:37,427
There's one thing I find really...

924
01:30:40,764 --> 01:30:44,476
Well... It's your total confidence
that you will get married.

925
01:30:44,726 --> 01:30:48,646
I mean, what if
you never find the right girl?

926
01:30:48,938 --> 01:30:49,939
Sorry?

927
01:30:50,064 --> 01:30:53,359
Surely, if that service shows anything,...

928
01:30:53,609 --> 01:30:56,821
...it shows that there is such a thing
as a perfect match.

929
01:30:57,029 --> 01:31:01,951
If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew,
then maybe we should just let it go.

930
01:31:02,993 --> 01:31:05,495
Some of us are not gonna get married.

931
01:31:05,704 --> 01:31:08,123
Well, I don't know, Charlie.

932
01:31:08,957 --> 01:31:13,545
The truth is, unlike you,
I never expected the thunderbolt.

933
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:18,383
I always just hoped that I'd meet
some nice, friendly girl,...

934
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:23,220
...like the look of her, hope the look of me
didn't make her physically sick,...

935
01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:28,058
...then pop the question
and settle down and be happy.

936
01:31:29,768 --> 01:31:33,397
It worked for my parents.
Well, apart from the divorce...

937
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,983
I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.

938
01:31:38,151 --> 01:31:40,570
Yeah, maybe you're right.

939
01:31:41,154 --> 01:31:47,660
Maybe all this waiting for
one true love stuff gets you nowhere.

940
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,012
What the fuck is going on?

941
01:32:11,515 --> 01:32:15,186
I thought we'd better make
absolutely sure we weren't late.

942
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:17,605
Excellent wedding hairstyle.

943
01:32:21,399 --> 01:32:24,861
Matthew.
The best-looking best man in the world.

944
01:32:25,695 --> 01:32:29,866
Listen. Thank you for doing this today.

945
01:32:30,033 --> 01:32:32,243
Of course.

946
01:32:34,661 --> 01:32:37,665
I wish Gareth was here.

947
01:32:37,748 --> 01:32:39,958
Bet he does, too.

948
01:32:42,586 --> 01:32:46,090
I'm sorry we're so late.
The others are just parking the car.

949
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,341
I thought we'd all go with Tom.

950
01:32:48,508 --> 01:32:52,220
- Late? So late?
- Yeah. It's 9.45.

951
01:32:52,428 --> 01:32:56,891
- 9.45?
- Yep. 45 minutes till "I do".

952
01:32:57,183 --> 01:33:00,561
Oh, bloody Tom!
I told him to set the alarm for eight!

953
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:02,772
Fuck it! Fuck!

954
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,861
- Scarlett.
- Hi!

955
01:33:10,112 --> 01:33:13,490
- You ready?
- Absolutely. Give me 20 seconds.

956
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:25,042
- Time.
- Honestly?

957
01:33:25,209 --> 01:33:26,335
Yes! Time!

958
01:33:26,502 --> 01:33:28,379
It's about ten to nine.

959
01:33:46,813 --> 01:33:48,814
Bastards.

960
01:33:51,066 --> 01:33:53,777
Jessica, stop jumping
up and down, please.

961
01:33:57,448 --> 01:34:00,075
One, two, three, smile!

962
01:34:03,286 --> 01:34:07,915
- This is splendid tuck.
- Yes, I think I might say a little word.

963
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:12,795
As you know, I've been a close observer
of Charles's love life for many years.

964
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:17,883
But recently I'd started to despair and fear
that really he was married to us,...

965
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:22,471
...except that we won't have his babies.
- I don't know about that.

966
01:34:22,637 --> 01:34:26,141
But it's all turned out splendidly.
The girl is sadly crazy,...

967
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:28,518
...but perhaps that's why he loves her.

968
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:33,522
I'd like to propose a toast to my Charlie
and his beautiful girl on this tragic day.

969
01:34:33,731 --> 01:34:37,360
- So, be happy and don't forget us.
- Thank you.

970
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:41,322
- To Charles and Duckface.
- Charles and Duckface!

971
01:34:47,703 --> 01:34:49,996
- What do you think?
- You look divine.

972
01:34:50,205 --> 01:34:52,582
It does work, doesn't it? Yes.

973
01:34:55,835 --> 01:34:59,839
I'd like to thank Fiona for those
charming words about my future wife.

974
01:35:00,006 --> 01:35:04,093
I'd like to take this opportunity
to read a message from her to you all.

975
01:35:04,385 --> 01:35:05,969
This is exciting.

976
01:35:06,136 --> 01:35:10,140
She says "Any of you come near
the house, I'll set the dogs on you."

977
01:35:10,432 --> 01:35:13,060
I think that's a nice touch.

978
01:35:13,268 --> 01:35:15,145
Sweet!

979
01:35:15,354 --> 01:35:17,772
"Set the dogs on you"!

980
01:35:19,148 --> 01:35:21,359
John, hi.

981
01:35:21,442 --> 01:35:23,444
- John, you made it.
- Yes.

982
01:35:23,653 --> 01:35:27,365
I hope me damn sister turns up.
Not much of a wedding without a bride.

983
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:29,117
Tom!

984
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,453
Bit of a poor show
you not having a stag night.

985
01:35:32,537 --> 01:35:37,749
We did! We did... We didn't think it was
a very good idea in this day and age.

986
01:35:38,041 --> 01:35:40,043
Really?

987
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,356
Fi, you do look lovely today.

988
01:36:02,564 --> 01:36:07,652
- I've abandoned my traditional black.
- Yes, so you have.

989
01:36:07,986 --> 01:36:10,780
From now on, I shall be
all the colours of the rainbow...

990
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:15,118
...and fall in love with someone
who fancies me for a change.

991
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:17,412
Darling Fi!

992
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:26,295
- Look.
- What?

993
01:36:26,337 --> 01:36:29,131
Lipstick everywhere. That won't do at all.

994
01:36:32,592 --> 01:36:34,594
- Hi.
- Hi.

995
01:36:50,942 --> 01:36:52,944
Good luck.

996
01:36:58,033 --> 01:37:00,535
Hello. Glad you could come.

997
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:04,288
Groom's on the right. Bride's on the left.

998
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:11,629
- Groom on the right. Bride on the left.
- Oh, my God!

999
01:37:16,092 --> 01:37:18,760
I thought you'd gone back to Texas.

1000
01:37:18,885 --> 01:37:20,970
Without you, never.

1001
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:27,560
Good luck.

1002
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:33,440
Bride or groom?

1003
01:37:35,693 --> 01:37:37,653
Bride or groom?

1004
01:37:37,945 --> 01:37:42,449
It should be perfectly obvious I'm neither.
Great God!

1005
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:46,328
- Bride or groom?
- Bride.

1006
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:58,631
Yes...

1007
01:37:58,715 --> 01:38:00,425
I'm fine.

1008
01:38:03,093 --> 01:38:05,512
I've a feeling we've met before.

1009
01:38:05,595 --> 01:38:08,515
We have. About 25 years ago.

1010
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:12,728
I'm second cousin Harold's
daughter Deirdre. You're Tom.

1011
01:38:12,978 --> 01:38:14,563
Good Lord!

1012
01:38:14,771 --> 01:38:17,064
- So, you're family.
- Yes.

1013
01:38:17,982 --> 01:38:21,986
- Only very distant.
- Well, yes, of course.

1014
01:38:23,738 --> 01:38:26,824
You said you were bride?

1015
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:28,409
Yes.

1016
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:30,536
Well, do sit.

1017
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:33,330
Do sit here, Deirdre.

1018
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,836
Golly!

1019
01:38:40,462 --> 01:38:42,255
Thunderbolt city.

1020
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,759
- Hello, Matthew.
- Nice to see you.

1021
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:48,844
- Hello, Charles.
- Bernard. How are you?

1022
01:38:48,969 --> 01:38:51,555
- Exhausted, actually.
- Oh, bunny!

1023
01:38:51,805 --> 01:38:53,807
- Charles.
- Hello, Lyd.

1024
01:38:59,605 --> 01:39:01,607
- Hi.
- Hi.

1025
01:39:03,358 --> 01:39:07,487
You look lovely. But then I always
did like you dressed for weddings.

1026
01:39:07,945 --> 01:39:11,532
- And on time.
- Yeah. Extraordinary thing, isn't it?

1027
01:39:11,908 --> 01:39:16,412
- How's Hamish?
- He's fine... I believe.

1028
01:39:16,704 --> 01:39:19,039
- You believe?
- Well, yes.

1029
01:39:19,206 --> 01:39:21,792
He wasn't the man for me after all.

1030
01:39:24,628 --> 01:39:27,422
- You left him?
- We left each other.

1031
01:39:30,467 --> 01:39:34,261
- When?
- A few months now.

1032
01:39:34,553 --> 01:39:38,057
March was hell. By April, it was sordid.

1033
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:42,186
That's the last time
I marry someone three times my age.

1034
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:45,106
Charles, time to travel.

1035
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:47,273
Yeah.

1036
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:51,361
Coming. Good.

1037
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:59,244
- So why didn't you get in touch, then?
- I did think about it.

1038
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,539
I wanted to, but I was in a state.

1039
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:08,002
So, anyway, I don't want to keep you.

1040
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:12,006
And I'll see you afterwards.

1041
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:14,008
Yeah. Fine.

1042
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:16,051
Wait.

1043
01:40:20,722 --> 01:40:22,724
I'll show you to your seat.

1044
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,020
Just showing her to her seat.

1045
01:40:39,573 --> 01:40:42,075
Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?

1046
01:40:42,326 --> 01:40:44,828
It's been bad, yes.

1047
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:47,121
It's been a disaster.

1048
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:51,917
It has, as you say,
been very bad indeed.

1049
01:40:56,797 --> 01:40:59,425
God, it's lovely to see you.

1050
01:41:01,801 --> 01:41:04,012
Well, good luck.

1051
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:09,309
It's pretty easy. Just say "I do"
whenever anyone asks you a question.

1052
01:41:18,484 --> 01:41:21,195
Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?

1053
01:41:21,403 --> 01:41:24,490
Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.

1054
01:41:43,841 --> 01:41:45,843
Dear Lord,..

1055
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:51,515
...forgive me for what I'm about to say...

1056
01:41:51,848 --> 01:41:56,269
...in this magnificent place of worship.

1057
01:41:56,561 --> 01:41:58,355
Bugger!

1058
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,691
Bugger!

1059
01:42:08,114 --> 01:42:10,324
Can I help at all?

1060
01:42:11,283 --> 01:42:13,452
No. Thanks.

1061
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:14,787
Sorry.

1062
01:42:16,122 --> 01:42:18,623
Vocal exercises. Big church.

1063
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:21,334
Excellent. Often do the same myself.

1064
01:42:21,584 --> 01:42:26,506
Not exactly the same vocab, obviously.
Rather more alleluias.

1065
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:28,883
I'll leave you.

1066
01:42:47,025 --> 01:42:49,152
- Bride's arriving.
- Fabulous!

1067
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,738
We seem to have lost the groom.

1068
01:42:52,322 --> 01:42:56,242
- Stall her and I'll see if I can find him.
- Roger. Wilco.

1069
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:05,792
Charles.

1070
01:43:07,252 --> 01:43:09,630
It's good to see you.

1071
01:43:11,923 --> 01:43:14,259
Yeah.

1072
01:43:16,093 --> 01:43:19,305
Matt, what do we think about marriage?

1073
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:23,476
Well... Gosh!

1074
01:43:23,643 --> 01:43:28,397
Well, I think it's really good,
if you love the person with all your heart.

1075
01:43:30,066 --> 01:43:33,276
Well, exactly. Quite.

1076
01:43:36,738 --> 01:43:40,659
All these weddings. All these years.

1077
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,372
All that blasted salmon and champagne.

1078
01:43:45,497 --> 01:43:51,543
Here I am on my own wedding day
and I'm still thinking.

1079
01:43:52,378 --> 01:43:54,588
Can I ask about what?

1080
01:43:57,633 --> 01:43:59,510
No.

1081
01:43:59,677 --> 01:44:01,678
No, I think best not.

1082
01:44:02,387 --> 01:44:05,598
I'm sorry, there's a delay.
A problem with the flowers.

1083
01:44:06,057 --> 01:44:07,141
Flowers?

1084
01:44:07,183 --> 01:44:11,062
There seems to be a staggeringly
high proportion of hay fever sufferers...

1085
01:44:11,396 --> 01:44:16,274
...and they're right next to the flowers,
so we're moving the congregation.

1086
01:44:16,608 --> 01:44:18,902
Don't want the vows
obliterated by sneezing.

1087
01:44:19,111 --> 01:44:23,282
Charles, would it be out of place
for me to say that time is ticking by?

1088
01:44:49,347 --> 01:44:51,141
I think I've fooled them so far.

1089
01:44:51,308 --> 01:44:54,394
When people think you're stupid,
they're less suspicious.

1090
01:45:17,915 --> 01:45:20,084
Hello.

1091
01:45:20,209 --> 01:45:21,794
Here you are!

1092
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:24,172
Ready to face the enemy?

1093
01:45:26,049 --> 01:45:28,051
Are we?

1094
01:45:31,553 --> 01:45:33,555
Yes.

1095
01:45:35,015 --> 01:45:37,017
Excellent.

1096
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:33,403
Not so tight, Dad.

1097
01:47:02,179 --> 01:47:06,559
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

1098
01:47:06,767 --> 01:47:09,353
...and in the face of this congregation...

1099
01:47:09,478 --> 01:47:12,857
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,...

1100
01:47:13,107 --> 01:47:18,612
...which is an honourable estate, instituted
of God in the time of man's innocence,...

1101
01:47:18,945 --> 01:47:24,242
...signifying unto us the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church...

1102
01:47:25,035 --> 01:47:27,996
...and therefore is not
by any to be enterprised...

1103
01:47:28,246 --> 01:47:31,832
...nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly,...

1104
01:47:32,082 --> 01:47:35,377
...but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,...

1105
01:47:35,628 --> 01:47:37,129
...soberly,...

1106
01:47:37,212 --> 01:47:39,214
...and in the fear of God.

1107
01:47:40,007 --> 01:47:42,593
Therefore, if any man
can show any just cause...

1108
01:47:42,843 --> 01:47:45,428
...why they may not
lawfully be joined together,...

1109
01:47:45,637 --> 01:47:49,933
...let him speak now or else hereafter
for ever hold his peace.

1110
01:47:55,146 --> 01:47:58,775
I'm sorry.
Does someone have something to say?

1111
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:06,990
Yes? What is it?

1112
01:48:09,117 --> 01:48:10,619
One second.

1113
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,220
He wants me to
translate what he's saying.

1114
01:48:29,428 --> 01:48:31,221
What is he saying?

1115
01:48:33,932 --> 01:48:37,143
He says "I suspect the groom
is having doubts."

1116
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,646
"I suspect the groom would like to delay."

1117
01:48:44,567 --> 01:48:46,360
"I suspect the groom..."

1118
01:48:58,539 --> 01:49:00,540
What's he saying?

1119
01:49:03,334 --> 01:49:05,628
He says...

1120
01:49:05,837 --> 01:49:09,841
...he suspects the groom
loves someone else.

1121
01:49:12,135 --> 01:49:13,595
Do you?

1122
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,513
Do you love someone else?
Do you, Charles?

1123
01:49:28,358 --> 01:49:30,026
I do.

1124
01:49:36,073 --> 01:49:38,075
Get out of my way! Let me kill him!

1125
01:49:48,376 --> 01:49:50,378
Blimey!

1126
01:49:52,005 --> 01:49:54,299
At least it's one we won't forget.

1127
01:49:54,424 --> 01:49:57,302
A lot of weddings just
blend into each other.

1128
01:49:57,552 --> 01:50:01,138
- For God's sake!
- This one will stick out in the memory.

1129
01:50:01,305 --> 01:50:04,099
For not actually including
a wedding service.

1130
01:50:04,308 --> 01:50:06,936
Poor girl. No, I mean it. Poor girl.

1131
01:50:07,144 --> 01:50:11,148
She's not my favourite person, but I think
what you did today was unforgivable.

1132
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,734
I can't bear to think about it.

1133
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:16,361
Poor Hen.

1134
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:19,948
- Though let's face facts.
- I'm sorry.

1135
01:50:20,198 --> 01:50:23,868
If you weren't sure you wanted
to marry her today of all days,...

1136
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:27,205
...i.e., your wedding day,...

1137
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:30,832
...then it must be the right decision,
mustn't it?

1138
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,751
Quite right.

1139
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:36,880
It was a lovely dress.
I'm sure she'll find it useful for parties.

1140
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:44,428
- What did he say, Charles?
- Says he blames himself.

1141
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:47,265
- Absolutely not.
- No, you mustn't, David.

1142
01:50:50,726 --> 01:50:54,146
- It's OK.
- No, no. If there's music to be faced,...

1143
01:50:54,397 --> 01:50:56,732
...I should be facing it.

1144
01:51:05,615 --> 01:51:07,534
Hello.

1145
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:10,745
- Hi! You're soaking. Come in.
- No, I'm fine.

1146
01:51:10,954 --> 01:51:13,039
Comes a point when you can't get wetter.

1147
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:16,041
- OK, I'll come out.
- No, please don't. I...

1148
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:18,877
I just wanted to check you're OK.

1149
01:51:19,086 --> 01:51:22,381
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but...

1150
01:51:24,133 --> 01:51:26,510
But you're fine, so...

1151
01:51:28,304 --> 01:51:31,973
I shouldn't have come
to the church this morning. I'm sorry.

1152
01:51:32,807 --> 01:51:34,809
No!

1153
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:39,856
Wait. It was all my fault.
I mean, I'm the bastard here.

1154
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:43,610
And it sorted out one thing.

1155
01:51:43,693 --> 01:51:47,863
Marriage and me were very clearly
not meant for one another.

1156
01:51:48,196 --> 01:51:50,198
It sorted out another big thing, too.

1157
01:51:50,365 --> 01:51:53,285
There I was,
standing there in the church,...

1158
01:51:53,493 --> 01:51:56,788
...and for the first time
in my whole life I realised I...

1159
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:00,374
...totally and utterly loved one person.

1160
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:03,002
And it wasn't the person
next to me in the veil.

1161
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:06,756
It's the person standing opposite me now...

1162
01:52:09,008 --> 01:52:10,426
...in the rain.

1163
01:52:10,593 --> 01:52:13,179
Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

1164
01:52:13,429 --> 01:52:18,016
The truth of it is, I've loved you
from the first second I met you.

1165
01:52:19,142 --> 01:52:24,940
- Not going away again, are you?
- No. I might drown. But otherwise, no.

1166
01:52:25,273 --> 01:52:27,776
OK. OK. We'll go in.

1167
01:52:30,945 --> 01:52:33,447
But first let me ask you one thing.

1168
01:52:35,658 --> 01:52:39,161
Do you think, after we've dried off,...

1169
01:52:39,703 --> 01:52:44,082
...after we've spent lots more
time together, you might agree...

1170
01:52:46,042 --> 01:52:48,336
...not to marry me?

1171
01:52:48,544 --> 01:52:51,172
And do you think...

1172
01:52:51,339 --> 01:52:56,261
...not being married to me might maybe
be something you could consider...

1173
01:52:56,552 --> 01:52:59,054
...doing for the rest of your life?

1174
01:53:03,976 --> 01:53:06,395
Do you?

1175
01:53:08,188 --> 01:53:10,399
I do.
