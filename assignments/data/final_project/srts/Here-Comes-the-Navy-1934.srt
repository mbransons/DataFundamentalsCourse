1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,803
That's my ship .. the Arizona.

3
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,722
It's in here for repairs.

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,273
We're building a machine shop
onboard. Would you like to see it?

5
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:42,257
Oh, love to.

6
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,256
Let's have a hot one.

7
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:53,257
Here it comes.

8
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,622
Oh, look at that sailor
catch that thing.

9
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,418
Ah, he's no sailor, lady.

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,647
He and those scaffold monkeys ..

11
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,613
Are just civilian help doing the work
the Navy personnel ought to be doing.

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,023
Why don't you write to
your Congressman, flatfoot.

13
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:10,413
Why you little ..

14
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,495
Let's have a hot one.

15
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,955
Hot iron. Coming up.

16
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:30,171
Will you watch it, you slob. Can't you
see the hole in the beam there for that?

17
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,720
The only hole I can see from
here is the one in your kisser.

18
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,923
You'd better shut it or
I'll drop my tongs in it.

19
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,081
Ah, you couldn't drop a
line home to your folks.

20
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:37,997
Oh no?

21
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,057
Coming down.

22
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,056
Save your strength. I'm coming up.

23
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:46,738
[ Hooter ]

24
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,543
A lucky day for you, sailor.

25
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,084
I'll postpone the licking I'm going
to give you until after lunch.

26
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,265
Ah, nuts to that.

27
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,150
When I get through with you, you
won't be able to eat for a month.

28
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,216
Mr Martin!

29
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:57,996
Don't fight, please.

30
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, lady.

31
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,367
Remember monkey, you
still got something coming.

32
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,043
Okay sucker, but I'm coming back.

33
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,350
When? Let's make it a date, sweetheart.

34
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,028
I'll be waiting for you.

35
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,648
Get a load of the 3-dollar a day Admiral
bringing in a new flock of suckers.

36
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:26,475
Ah, now don't start anything.

37
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,355
Alright, sailors. Come on.

38
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,232
Hustle along. Get going.

39
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,272
Hey.

40
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,766
That's the mug that put on the show
for those dames this morning.

41
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,914
Watch this.

42
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:40,633
Halt!

43
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,626
Alright. What wise-guy yelled that?

44
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,996
I did. What are you
going to do about it?

45
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,334
So it's you again, redhead, huh?

46
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,835
Nothing is going to happen now but
plenty when I get back from this detail.

47
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,550
Stick around. See what's going to pop.

48
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,843
Come on boy-scout. Get going before
someone takes your toy sailors from you.

49
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,076
Squad ..
- Halt!

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,443
Alright, wise-guy. But we'll meet again.

51
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,716
26 dollars too much.

52
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:33,001
Imagine how long some dope had to stay
down the hold to dig out all the silver.

53
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,316
If you ask me Chesty.
I think you're awful selfish.

54
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,517
What do you mean I'm selfish?
- Spending all that money on a tin mug.

55
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,456
Well.

56
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,038
You're like that are you.

57
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,941
I wish I could get this
thing to lay down.

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,076
It cuts my throat.

59
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:45,973
Say.

60
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,190
Where did you get that outfit?

61
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,689
You look like a head waiter at a casino.
- Waiter, nothing.

62
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:54,327
Waiters wear Tuxedos.
That's why I didn't rent one.

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,366
The crack still goes.

64
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,609
How much did you have to put up?

65
00:04:58,709 --> 00:04:59,916
Three bucks for tonight.

66
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,147
And forty bucks deposit in
case I bring it back damaged.

67
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,524
You must have been chump enough to tell
'em you were going to A Riveter's Ball.

68
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,307
Will you stop cracking at me.

69
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,870
And get your coat on.
- What's the hurry?

70
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,069
I must lead the grand march.
Come on, get going.

71
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,151
Hey.

72
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:25,974
What's the idea?

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,917
I want to get a pillow slip to
lug that thing up there in.

74
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,208
What's the matter with
the case it came in?

75
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,724
It looks too much like a casket.

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,835
I'll get arrested for grave robbing.
- Well.

77
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:36,325
I'm ready.

78
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,808
Hi, Chesty.
- Hiya, boy.

79
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,564
That's Chesty O'Connor, a swell guy.

80
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,444
Hi, chesty boy.
- Hiya, boy. What do you say?

81
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:40,252
That's Chesty O'Connor.
That guy ain't afraid of nothing.

82
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,978
Is that lady his dame?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,258
And she's nuts about him.

84
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,448
Nice going, baby.
- What do you mean?

85
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,941
Don't be a flirt.

86
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:01,835
Try to blow fiddle. You'll get more.

87
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,813
Don't be silly. Why are
you always so jealous?

88
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,414
I ain't jealous, baby. Just
want to see you get along.

89
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:08,487
Check your hat?

90
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,194
No, I don't think so.
I'm not going to stay long.

91
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,166
Excuse me.

92
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:25,293
Where you going?
- Must I tell everything?

93
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:26,864
See you in a few minutes.

94
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,511
Still want this?
- Oh.

95
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,303
Thanks.

96
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:51,038
Lemonade.
- Make it two.

97
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,282
2 lemonades.
- Right.

98
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:53,742
You with somebody?
- Uhuh.

99
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,643
My boyfriend.
- Gee, that's tough.

100
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,528
Oh .. excuse me, I got
this dance with him.

101
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:00,733
Yeah, well look.

102
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,106
It ain't against the law
for me to cut in, is it?

103
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,525
I wouldn't know.
I'm a stranger around here.

104
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,348
Yeah, you and me both.
- Here's your lemonades.

105
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,672
Drink it yourself.

106
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,367
I've changed my mind, sister.

107
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,720
Stow that away will you.

108
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:16,908
Thanks.

109
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,598
Sorry pal.
- Well, you ought to be.

110
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,995
Oh, so it's you.
- It ain't a marine.

111
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:50,087
Say, big boy. What would
it take to keep us apart?

112
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,667
A magician, baby. A magician.

113
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,918
Looks like the Navy has
landed and taken full control.

114
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,020
Not today.

115
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,235
Hey!

116
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,045
Sorry sailor, I'm cutting in.
- Yeah? Don't do it with a sledgehammer.

117
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,680
Drop it you two guys.
You want to break up the dance?

118
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,690
There's an alley outside
for this kind of stuff.

119
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,011
That's okay with me.
- And it goes double with me.

120
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:18,184
Well, come on.

121
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,699
Relax honey, I'll be right back.
This won't take long.

122
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,625
Give me your coat, chief.

123
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:49,085
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

124
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:51,733
It's a gentlemen's fight between
me and him. You guys stay out of it.

125
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,756
This is my fight.
- That goes for me too.

126
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,672
Nobody steps in and the best guy wins.

127
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:57,388
You want to take off your coat, Chesty?

128
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,101
Nah, I won't even work up sweat.
Come on, stand back everybody.

129
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,197
Get back. Give us plenty of room.

130
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,319
Give me a bugle.

131
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,105
Ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,912
The next dance will be a waltz
contest for the Chesty O'Connor Cup.

133
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,928
This contest will be run
strictly by elimination.

134
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,293
Alright ladies, get your partners.

135
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:40,870
Chesty.

136
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:42,127
Chesty!

137
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:43,641
Chesty!

138
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:45,766
The contest just started. Come on up.

139
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,511
That Cologne will fix
up your face, boss.

140
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:44,953
But it will take more than
that to fix up this coat.

141
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:58,744
Don't look bad.

142
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,748
No, sir. You don't look bad.

143
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,470
Ladies and gentlemen.
It gives me great honor.

144
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:34,116
To present the Chesty O'Connor mug
to the winners of the waltz contest.

145
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,426
Miss Gladys Hawkins and
her partner Mr Biff Martin.

146
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,531
Of the USS Arizona.

147
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,531
Hey!

148
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:53,802
What's this?
- A day and a half's pay.

149
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,694
I'm sorry Chesty but you was off two
days and I got my orders from the front.

150
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:57,858
You know how it is.

151
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:00,728
Alright Mike. Never mind the
song and dance. I'm fired, huh?

152
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:23,472
I phoned you this morning. They said
you'd checked out and gone to Frisco.

153
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:24,389
So what?

154
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,254
Well, you aren't making much headway.

155
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,605
I don't know. I'm doing alright.
- Oh, are you?

156
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,870
By the looks of your kisser,
his aim is awful bad.

157
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,644
Who is it?
- A gentleman.

158
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,861
And he's awful nice.
- Oh, I get it.

159
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:38,310
I don't happen to have a houseful on me.
So we're washed up, huh? Through?

160
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,169
Funny how quick you catch on.

161
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,421
Who was it? That guy Martin?
- Maybe.

162
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:45,771
Listen, I start now to catch up with
him. When I do it will be too bad.

163
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,853
Hey. You're pretty safe making cracks
like that with him on the water.

164
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,225
What water?

165
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,082
He just left on the
Arizona for San Pedro.

166
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:55,611
Well even so, I'm just signing up to
join the Navy to get even with him.

167
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,194
They only want <i>men</i> in the Navy.

168
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,516
Oh yeah? Well look here, Twist.
When I catch up with Martin ..

169
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,064
The Navy will know they made a
mistake in taking him in for a man.

170
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:04,784
Ha!

171
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,839
I, Chester O'Connor do solemnly swear
or affirm that I will bear true faith ..

172
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,811
And allegiance to the
United States of America.

173
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,656
And serve them honestly and faithfully
against all their enemies, whomsoever.

174
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,154
I will obey the orders of the
President of the United States.

175
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:26,708
And orders of officers appointed over
me, according to the rules of the Navy.

176
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,368
And I further swear that all statements
made by me in this record are correct.

177
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:32,942
I do.

178
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,021
Say Doc, now that I'm in the Navy ..

179
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,740
How about putting me on the Arizona?

180
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,118
From now on, when you address
an officer, you will say "Sir".

181
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,484
You are leaving tonight.

182
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,400
For a Naval training
station in San Diego ..

183
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,717
Where you'll spend ninety days
learning to become a sailor.

184
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,946
Ninety days?
- Ninety days.

185
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,171
I quit.
- No you won't.

186
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:50,827
You're in the Navy now. Sit down.

187
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:53,300
Roy Brent.

188
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,479
Raise your right hand.

189
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,288
Hey, where you going?

190
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,960
That's alright. We're the new sailors.

191
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,544
Are you in charge of this draft?
- I certainly am.

192
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,847
Have you any orders?
- Oh yeah. I got a note for you.

193
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,174
Fine. Let's have them.

194
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,763
Mack, take charge of this gang.

195
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,583
Alright. Fall in like two rows
of corn and follow me.

196
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,323
Corn?

197
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,439
He don't mean liquor.

198
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:56,446
Detail .. halt!

199
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:58,249
Face the flag.

200
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,000
Uncover.

201
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:02,084
Take off that hat.

202
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,178
Take off that hat.

203
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:06,150
For what?
- For Uncle Sam.

204
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:07,087
Oh.

205
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,176
For him I'll do it.

206
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,938
Alright, let's go.

207
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:42,587
Put on that hat.

208
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,257
You just told me to take it off.
- Well, put it on.

209
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,707
Have you ever tried making up your mind?

210
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:52,037
You know there is something about
this place that gives a guy a thrill.

211
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,332
What is it about it that
gives you a thrill?

212
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,834
Well, if you feel that way about
it what did you join up for?

213
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:59,313
With me it's strictly a matter
of personal business.

214
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:01,441
I owe a lug in this
outfit something and ..

215
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,262
I'm the type that goes to extremes, see.

216
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,515
Pipe down.

217
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,879
Oh. Pipe down, pipe up.
Pipe up, pipe down. What is this?

218
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:11,909
Seven.

219
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,543
What size shoe do you wear?
- Eight.

220
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,323
Ten.

221
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,926
I don't wear ten. I wear eight.

222
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,785
You wear ten now, son.
You are in the Navy.

223
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:27,178
What size shoe do you wear?

224
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,463
I guess ten.

225
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:31,468
Eight.

226
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:56,659
Daily report.

227
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,002
First squad present. Accounted for.
- Second squad present. Accounted for.

228
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,237
All present and accounted for, sir.
- Very well.

229
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,465
Attention!

230
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:05,851
Any man here can handle a car?

231
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,759
Take two paces forward.

232
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:13,694
Follow me.

233
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:25,373
Alright, here's your car.
Now push it down to the dump.

234
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:28,068
Come on, snap into it.

235
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,809
Come on, give it gas.

236
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:33,032
Can you hear me?

237
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,999
I don't see why we got to
keep sweeping these streets.

238
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,694
They look pretty clean to me.

239
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:49,293
I don't know what you're
complaining about.

240
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,820
I think it's swell. To be dumping
garbage and sweeping streets.

241
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,980
It's great training. Great training.

242
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,232
For what?
- Sweeping streets.

243
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,710
Henry Wood.

244
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,621
Yes, sir.
- James Butler.

245
00:19:58,977 --> 00:19:59,735
Yes, sir.

246
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,309
Assigned USS California.

247
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,680
Wilbur Mullins.

248
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,215
Here sir.
- Chester O'Connor?

249
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,073
Here sir.

250
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:06,673
Assigned USS Arizona.

251
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,909
The first break I've got in
this broom-pushing outfit.

252
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,334
The time you've spent here,
ninety days, have been short.

253
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,901
And the lessons, many.

254
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,731
We hope you remember them.

255
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,341
And we hope that you
bring credit to the station.

256
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:22,605
Now goodbye, good luck
and a pleasant cruise.

257
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,533
Take charge, sir.
- Aye-aye, sir.

258
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,808
There is a guy named
Martin on the Arizona.

259
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:30,590
And I'm going through all
this to catch up with him.

260
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,682
And here it is.

261
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,008
Attention!

262
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,130
Take up your bags.

263
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:41,477
Right and left.

264
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:42,670
Face.

265
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,001
Forward, march!

266
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,394
Ahoy!

267
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,190
Hello.
- Alongside.

268
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,939
Crew for Arizona reports for duty, sir.
- Very well.

269
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:17,213
Messenger.

270
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,615
Yes, sir?

271
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:22,045
Have the Master at Arms
take charge of this detail.

272
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,167
Take these records up to
the executive officer.

273
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:25,139
Aye-aye, sir.

274
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,006
Have them disembark.

275
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:28,002
Disembark!

276
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:00,699
Take these men to the Exec's
office for assignment.

277
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,370
Aye-aye, sir. Pick up your
bags and follow me.

278
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,934
He likes us already.
- I think he's cute too.

279
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,603
Say, you got a guy named
Martin on this ship?

280
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,273
You mean Chief Martin?
- Yeah.

281
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:15,379
He's ashore.

282
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,388
That's too bad.

283
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,655
Now I got to postpone my date with
him until tomorrow. Alright, thanks.

284
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:36,419
Have you got twenty bucks?

285
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:38,900
Yeah, sure.
- Would you lend it to me?

286
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:43,023
Is it for a dame?
- Well yes. In a way.

287
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,632
Well then, you don't get it.

288
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,712
I ain't going to work like no slave just
to have you spend it on some twister.

289
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:50,487
Yeah, I know. But this is different.

290
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:51,713
Different, my eye.

291
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:55,441
Look at me. Just because of a bone
and a hank of hair. Look where I am.

292
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,491
Will you wait a minute and
let me say something?

293
00:22:57,591 --> 00:22:59,094
Don't try to tell me nothing.

294
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:00,592
Dames is out of my life.

295
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:03,150
From now on every frail is
just going to be a straw ride.

296
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,364
Yeah, but this ain't no
dame. It's my mother.

297
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:08,700
Next week is her birthday and I want to
surprise her with a set of false teeth.

298
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,447
If I knew her size I could order
them here and send them to her.

299
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:13,306
But the doctor says
she's got to have them.

300
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,279
Because she got to eat meat.

301
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,003
Well, that's different.

302
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,461
I never knew you had a mother.

303
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,039
Well, everybody has got a mother.

304
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:21,306
Oh yeah?

305
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,409
Well here .. for Mama.

306
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:24,972
Thanks.

307
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,169
I wish they'd give us
ladders in the Navy.

308
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,273
No, no, no, no.

309
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,439
What do you think this is,
an excursion boat?

310
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,799
Come on! Heave out!

311
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:26,922
You, move.

312
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,076
What?

313
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,510
Well if it ain't you.

314
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:32,716
Well.

315
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:35,771
I've been waiting ninety days for this.

316
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,642
Come on, clear the decks for action
because I'm coming to get you.

317
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:42,014
Now wait a minute, sailor.
Wait a minute. Take it easy.

318
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:44,210
You overlook one thing.

319
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,386
When you came over that gangway aboard
this ship all private battles stopped.

320
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,222
When I'm ashore I'll gladly accommodate
you by taking off this coat ..

321
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:51,863
And settling our little fight.

322
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:55,011
But when you're aboard, remember you're
in the Navy and I'm your senior officer.

323
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:56,414
Now, rise and shine.

324
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,551
And after this, when you address me
treat me with respect. Now pick that up.

325
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,392
Find a handle to it and go on
up and manicure the deck.

326
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:07,362
And from now on .. call me "Mister".

327
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:35,203
Now I know why they had us sweeping
streets at the training station.

328
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,650
This ain't no broom but
it's the same motion.

329
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:40,186
Yeah .. they got us in
training to be janitors.

330
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,707
Anyway, I'm glad we've
got liberty tonight.

331
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,372
The first thing I got to do is send my
old lady the dough for her choppers.

332
00:25:57,386 --> 00:26:00,217
Is my brother on board?
- Yes, Miss. He's up on deck somewhere.

333
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,066
Messenger, locate Martin.
- Aye-aye, sir.

334
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,090
Thank you.

335
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,896
Holy smoke, look at the
trim lines on that destroyer.

336
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,553
Ain't that just my luck.

337
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,481
She would come aboard. And me
with the ugliest part of me nude.

338
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,825
Now when are you going
to stop being a sucker?

339
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:26,285
Why don't you profit by my experience
and lay off of them dames?

340
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,030
Why? Did one of them do you wrong?

341
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,360
Listen, fellah.

342
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:33,120
I had a piece of silk give me a joyride,
keep me flat broke, get me beat up ..

343
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:35,091
And then thrown out of
my job, in the bargain.

344
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:37,766
Boy, that's what I'd
certainly call a sad life.

345
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,566
And then to add insult to injury ..

346
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,048
She ties up with the guy that
put the lug on me: Biff Martin.

347
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,213
It's why I won't have anything
to do with them again.

348
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,846
I don't blame you for being sore
and only going for the pick-ups.

349
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:49,714
He couldn't have done it if that
dame hadn't distracted my attention.

350
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,205
Hit me when I wasn't looking.

351
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:52,893
Big game guy.

352
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:56,113
Hello Biff.
- Hello, Dot.

353
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,058
Well there is something
that will curl your hair.

354
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,269
Pipe that.

355
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:04,174
Hello kid. Gee, I'm glad to see you.
What are you doing aboard?

356
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:07,408
I had to go to work this afternoon.
I had to see you about something.

357
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,060
What's that guy got anyway?

358
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,291
Just what the doctor ordered as
far as the dames is concerned.

359
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,682
Ah, you're full of canal water.

360
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:19,274
You can pick up fleabags like her easier
than picking lint off a blue serge suit.

361
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:23,240
I'm telling you.
I knew a guy up in Seattle.

362
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,620
One of the swell-est guys
you ever saw in your life.

363
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,090
Excuse me a minute.

364
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,599
Alright, lay off the speakers table.
Bend down on those brushes.

365
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,401
He tells me he knows
a fellow in Seattle.

366
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,092
Yeah, I know. Come on, get going.

367
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,614
Oh yes.

368
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,071
Hey.

369
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,320
Did you say that dame was hard to get?

370
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,768
Why, she even looked at us
like we was a couple of boots.

371
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:50,961
Uhuh. Hey, sailor.

372
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:53,919
Tell me something. Where does
that dame hang out? That one there.

373
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,623
She works at the telegraph
office over in town.

374
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:57,453
Huh?

375
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:00,109
That's a break for you and
your old lady too.    - Why?

376
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,935
Because Mama gets her money for
her choppers wired to her tonight.

377
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:12,755
Awfully sorry to have kept you waiting.

378
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:14,597
Not too sorry.

379
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,472
Did you want to send a wire?
- Yeah.

380
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:20,073
How much would it cost to wire a
party in Walla Walla twenty bucks?

381
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,277
That's in Washington.
326 Summer Street. My mother.

382
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:31,254
That will be exactly 24 dollars
and 61 cents including tax.

383
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:34,203
Oh that's tough. We've got
only 22 bucks between us.

384
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:35,249
Well.

385
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:38,093
We'll have to mail the dough to your old
lady the next time we come ashore.

386
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:39,208
I'm awfully sorry.

387
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,825
Oh .. forget it.

388
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,263
Sure, forget it.

389
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,371
Say.

390
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,376
Wasn't you on our ship today?
- Hmm.

391
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:47,875
Don't you remember us?

392
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:49,271
Sure, you remember him.

393
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,514
That's the guy with the
quarter of three trilbies.

394
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:52,535
Like that.

395
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,483
I'm sorry, but I have to close up now.

396
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:57,019
That's the third time you've been sorry.

397
00:28:57,518 --> 00:28:58,877
Maybe you're sorry we came in?

398
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:00,103
Maybe I am.

399
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:01,282
Say.

400
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:04,759
Why don't you go and pick up
those botany books at the library.

401
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:06,095
Sure.

402
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:09,093
Well.

403
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,779
Suppose you weren't sorry? Then what?

404
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,731
Oh nothing. I suppose I'd
walk home just the same.

405
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,347
Alone?

406
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:17,999
I always walk home alone.

407
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,164
That's all I wanted to hear.

408
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:24,960
Now look.

409
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:26,893
This is just supposing, just supposing.

410
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:29,519
Supposing some nice guy was
to ask to walk you home?

411
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:30,820
What would you say?

412
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:32,370
I suppose I'd say ..

413
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:33,353
No.

414
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,821
Oh, like that, huh? Now wait, wait ..

415
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,327
Well, if you didn't let a
guy walk home with you ..

416
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:51,284
I don't hope you'd give
him your phone number?

417
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:52,558
I certainly wouldn't.

418
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,941
Well in case you did.
I mean this is just in case.

419
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,355
It wouldn't be San Pedro, say, 3142?

420
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:00,612
No, not if he wanted
to get me it wouldn't.

421
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:01,585
How come?

422
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:04,308
Because my phone number
is San Pedro 9697.

423
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,256
Aha. San Pedro 9697.

424
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:17,521
I don't suppose if a guy come over
on liberty tomorrow night he'd ..

425
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:19,427
He'd have any chance of calling you?

426
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,843
Well, where do you suppose he'd call?
At the office or at the house?

427
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:25,007
Because I'm not working tomorrow night.

428
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,091
I was just thinking that the Navy land
is so close to the telegraph office ..

429
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:30,443
I wouldn't have to use a phone.
I could just holler over.

430
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,375
Well, here is where I live.

431
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:34,574
Goodnight.

432
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:36,993
Now wait a minute, kid. Wait a minute.

433
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:38,111
Say.

434
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,125
What are the chances of stopping
in and picking up a pencil?

435
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:43,648
I'm sorry. I keep all
my pencils at the office.

436
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:46,272
Well, there wouldn't be any
harm in my stopping in and ..

437
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,789
Having a cup of coffee with your
old man would there?       - No.

438
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,335
No, there wouldn't be any harm in that.
- Well then, it's alright?

439
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,910
Not tonight.
- Why not?

440
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,701
You see, Papa doesn't live here anymore.

441
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,540
Oh, Miss. Hey!

442
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:12,872
[ Whistle ]

443
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,251
[ Whistle ]

444
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,085
[ Whistle ]

445
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:22,768
[ Whistle ]

446
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:25,093
Hey.

447
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,514
In case I want to call. Just in case.

448
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,115
What do I ask for?

449
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:31,232
If you want me, ask for Dorothy.

450
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,612
Alright, Dorothy.

451
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:34,702
Goodnight,
- Goodnight.

452
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,431
Did you ask her if she
had a girlfriend for me?

453
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,346
Girlfriend?

454
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:43,293
Just the one, just the one. All you got
to do is whistle. Whistle right there.

455
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,005
[ Whistle ]

456
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:49,200
[ Whistle ]

457
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,484
Oh, getting fussy, huh? Wait a minute.

458
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,769
Hello there. How are you?

459
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:34,830
Hiya, baby.

460
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,765
Me, I'm swell. Say ..

461
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,961
Where we going later?
- Let's not go out any place tonight.

462
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:41,488
I have dinner on the stove.

463
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,933
Wouldn't you like to come up for
a nice home-cooked meal?

464
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,342
Would I?

465
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,497
She asked will I go to
dinner there tonight.

466
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,844
Try and keep me away.
Will be there in a half hour.

467
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:50,985
Yeah. A half hour.

468
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,695
Alright, baby. Bye-bye.

469
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:59,238
What's doing?
- It's all over but the shouting.

470
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:01,669
Me and her is having dinner at
her place, and we're staying in.

471
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:03,553
Did you ask if she
had a girlfriend for me?

472
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,490
Oh .. I didn't think of it.

473
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,838
Ain't that funny.
You always forget to ask that.

474
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,599
Yeah, that's right. But I promise,
next time I will. I promise you that.

475
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:12,701
Say, listen, You got any
of that twenty bucks left?

476
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:13,626
Oh, sure.

477
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,431
Well, can you slip me ten of it?
- Uhuh.

478
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,578
Attaboy.
- My mother's choppers.

479
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:20,819
That's alright.

480
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,098
Write and tell her to stay on oatmeal
for another week. It's okay. Come on.

481
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,403
I hope I'm not keeping you waiting.

482
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,289
That's up to you, baby.

483
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,459
Me?
- Yeah.

484
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,051
Come on over here and I'll
tell you all about it. Now.

485
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:47,699
What?
- Come here.

486
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:52,034
I can't, Chesty. I have to watch dinner.
- Come on, sit down.

487
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,332
I'm sorry, Chesty. No.

488
00:33:58,157 --> 00:33:58,810
What?

489
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,061
I guess it's my fault.

490
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,256
What is this?

491
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,435
I suppose it looked like
just what you thought ..

492
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,594
When I invited you up here tonight.

493
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:10,691
You're kidding.

494
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,475
Chesty, I did want to like you but ..

495
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,525
I guess we both had the wrong idea.

496
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:25,887
You'd better be going.

497
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,050
Well.

498
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,306
If you're on the level
it's okay with me.

499
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,406
I can't shove off fast enough.

500
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,020
Goodnight.

501
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:39,745
Oh.

502
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,611
So you're trying to give me a fast exit?
- Well ..

503
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,647
You know, this is funny.

504
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,790
I don't usually go so
far wrong on a dame.

505
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,886
Don't you think you owe me an apology?

506
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:53,191
Yeah, sure. And if you ..

507
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:56,375
Show me how to make one and tell
me what to say, I'll be glad to do it.

508
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,270
I'm sorry.

509
00:34:58,737 --> 00:34:59,574
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:00,931
Dorothy.
- Dorothy.

511
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:01,760
Alright.

512
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,647
Now I'll say it again.

513
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:06,278
I'm sorry .. very sorry.

514
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:07,537
Dorothy.

515
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:08,920
Was that hard?
- No.

516
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:10,940
In fact it isn't enough.

517
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,523
You're one of the swell-est girls
I've met in my life. I'm a chump.

518
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:16,474
So from now on anything you want to ask
to even things up, you just name it.

519
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,319
Chesty, that's the sweetest
apology a girl ever got.

520
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,156
And it's all the nicer because
you made it yourself.

521
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,477
The potatoes.

522
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:48,761
Chesty!

523
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,515
Going bad?
- Not too badly.

524
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,403
[ Buzzer ]

525
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,120
There's the bell, Chesty.
Will you answer it please.

526
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,212
What do you want here?

527
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,546
Get up on your pins, sucker. Get up!

528
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:38,432
I'm up.

529
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,516
Biff. Chesty!

530
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:45,602
Keep out of this, Sis. Keep out of it.
- Let him alone. I invited him up here.

531
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,636
You invited him up here?
- What's this mug to you?

532
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,790
My brother. Now, will you
both try to be gentlemen.

533
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,618
You brother?
- Yes, her brother.

534
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:54,776
Let him alone.
I'm ashamed of both of you.

535
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:56,614
You might have a little respect for me.

536
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,074
Come on. We'll finish this downstairs.
- That's alright with me.

537
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:01,421
Biff, if you go out there I
will never speak to you again.

538
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:04,810
Well okay, quiet down.
I'll stay. But you get this.

539
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:07,435
I'm not going canary. I'm just
trying to give her a break.

540
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:10,138
If I catch you within eight blocks
of this place I'll go to work on you.

541
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:11,726
And I won't fool around about it.

542
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:12,858
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

543
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:15,264
Well I'll see Dorothy whenever
I like and as often as I like.

544
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:17,024
And nobody is going to stop me, see.

545
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,350
Sorry, kid.

546
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,138
Your company has spoiled my appetite.

547
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:32,336
Hard-headed little wharf-rat.

548
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:33,866
Biff, won't you listen to me.

549
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:36,969
Sure I'll listen if you can give me half
a reason why you invited him up here.

550
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:38,657
Because I enjoy his company.

551
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:41,254
Honest Biff, you'd get a great kick
out of him if you knew him.

552
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:42,273
Knew him?

553
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,056
I know him well enough to know
that he's not fit company for you.

554
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:48,103
What is it that you have against
him that makes you hate him so?

555
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,214
Well, plenty.

556
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,710
Met him in Seattle.

557
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,545
I scrapped with him in a cheap dance
hall where decent people shouldn't go.

558
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:54,889
What were you doing there?

559
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,957
Well, I was .. uh .. going to meet ..

560
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,486
How did I know what the place
was like until I got inside.

561
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:01,973
That's beside the point anyway.

562
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:04,320
Now look, Biff. Tomorrow onboard ship.

563
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:07,616
I want you to apologise to him
and invite him back to dinner.

564
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:08,992
I want you to be friends.

565
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,475
Sure. I'll send him a gold
watch and chain too.

566
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,273
Do I look that daffy?

567
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:14,843
Now listen, Dot.

568
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:17,840
I never tried to tell
you what to do did I?

569
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:20,452
You heard what I said at
the door and it still goes.

570
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,279
I don't want you to see him again.

571
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:23,825
I'll see him as much as I want.

572
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:25,389
No matter what you say or think.

573
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,899
I like him and I hope he likes me.

574
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:34,877
Well, I got to hand it to you.

575
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:37,341
Out of all the guys in the
Navy, you pick him out.

576
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:47,001
Hey O'Connor. Telegram.

577
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,676
Oh. Thanks.

578
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,652
What is it, a telegram?

579
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,452
Why, how do you like that?

580
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,383
You mean they didn't
spell "liberty" right?

581
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,309
It's from my girl you dope. She wants
to see me tonight. It's important.

582
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,713
How am I going to get off ship?
- A pass.

583
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,314
No, I had liberty last night.

584
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,023
Well, show them the telegram.

585
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,547
Hey, that's an idea.

586
00:39:23,647 --> 00:39:25,609
Just because it comes
from you, I don't like it.

587
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,641
I thought you was the guy that was
going to give dames the quick shuffle.

588
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,545
I can change my mind, can't I?

589
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,901
Or is that privilege going to
be taken from me too?

590
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,105
Oh, it's okay.

591
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:38,495
Only I let you give me the idea that we
was going to pick them up, play and run.

592
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,104
Yeah, you're just one of those
guys that would acquiesce.

593
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,903
"Acquiesce". Agree.

594
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,503
Become a partner to. Give it the nod.

595
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,352
You mean say yes?

596
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,964
Boy, here I am wasting time
at a moment like this.

597
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,638
I got another idea. Wait a minute.

598
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:01,150
Wait a minute!

599
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:02,663
Wait a minute, will you!

600
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:05,623
Wait a minute! Hey!

601
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:07,407
Wait a minute!

602
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:09,830
Hey, wait a minute!

603
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,178
I beg your pardon, sir.

604
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:17,523
I'd like special liberty tonight, sir.
It's very important.

605
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,609
You rate liberty?

606
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:20,917
No, but my girl needs me.
I just got this wire from her.

607
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,571
This doesn't seem very imperative.

608
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,190
But if you can get relief.

609
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:29,513
And the Master at Arms gives you a clean
ticket I've no objections to your going.

610
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:31,007
Aye-aye, sir.
- Martin.

611
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:37,619
This man wants special liberty.

612
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,836
He's got this telegram from
his girl. What about it?

613
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:47,093
Why this man is a liberty hound, sir.
I'd like to see him kept aboard.

614
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:50,142
Special liberty not granted.
- Aye-aye, sir.

615
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:01,966
O'Connor.

616
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:07,382
Listen, Cinderhead.

617
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,917
I thought I told you to keep
away from my sister, didn't I?

618
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:12,419
What do I have to slug you
with to make you savvy?

619
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,377
You and your whole Navy couldn't keep me
away from her. What you say to that?

620
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:16,891
You won't see her tonight.

621
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,886
No?             - No.
What makes you think so?

622
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:21,469
Because Romeo, I'm putting you
on the fo'c'sle watch from 8 to 12.

623
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:22,748
Oh yeah?

624
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,124
Well alright, puss.

625
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,823
And I'll be on your neck
from 12 o'clock on.

626
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:37,320
You look sore.

627
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,023
I almost think you didn't get it.
- Well, I didn't.

628
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,640
Besides, Martin put me
on watch for tonight.

629
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,480
Well, can't you do something?

630
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:45,557
Like ..?

631
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,081
Talk to the Admiral.

632
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,749
I'm going to do plenty.

633
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:51,070
Me and this man's Navy is
parting company for good.

634
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,191
I never want to see water again.

635
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:55,205
Before I'll see one of
these battle wagons.

636
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,579
You aren't hinting that you're
going to swim ashore, are you?

637
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,440
I'm going just the way I came.

638
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:00,753
In a liberty boat.

639
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:02,357
And if you don't believe me ..

640
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:03,743
Come and watch.

641
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:16,588
Hey, cookie.

642
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,249
You've got liberty tonight, ain't you?
- Sure have, sir.

643
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,203
Want to make some dough?
- How much?

644
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:22,969
Three bucks for your liberty card.

645
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:26,328
I would like to oblige you
Mr Chesty, but I've got a date.

646
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:27,579
I'll make it five.

647
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,545
It's a lot of dough for
one night's liberty.

648
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:31,757
Doggone, I almost come.

649
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:34,540
But I just can't disappoint my honey.

650
00:42:35,005 --> 00:42:36,279
She won't be disappointed.

651
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:37,914
Yes sir, she will.

652
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:40,939
Well look, I'll make it ten bucks.
Look, got ten bucks on you?

653
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,011
Got my hand right on it.
I knew what was coming.

654
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:46,030
Here you are, look. A nice new crisp ten
dollar bill all for you. What you say?

655
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:50,748
You know, this thing does things to me.

656
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,911
I guess you got me.

657
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,460
Listen Chesty, if my mother
don't get those china teeth ..

658
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,350
She'll lose her job as
well as her health.

659
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,237
What's her racket?
- She sings in a choir.

660
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,494
Can't she hum?
- Hum?

661
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,633
Yeah, hum.

662
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:06,103
Tell her to hum until we
play our next crap game.

663
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,574
Hum, hum, hum, hum. That's alright.

664
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,203
Hum, hum, him.

665
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,905
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum. I like it.

666
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,116
Hum, hum, hum.

667
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,940
Hum .. hum .. hum.

668
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:29,614
[ Whistle ]

669
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:32,445
[ Whistle ]

670
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:36,284
Now lay up .. all the liberty party.

671
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,187
Attention!

672
00:43:58,712 --> 00:43:59,654
Open ranks.

673
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:01,202
Forward.

674
00:44:02,628 --> 00:44:03,525
Front rank.

675
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:05,628
About face!

676
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,199
What have you got there?
- Shoes, sir.

677
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,998
Alright. Remember, men.

678
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,220
Liberty expires at midnight.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,229
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

680
00:44:50,936 --> 00:44:53,198
Liberty expires on the dock at midnight.

681
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,709
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

682
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,763
Nice work, Chesty.

683
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,243
Hello!

684
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:40,181
Hello, baby.

685
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,200
It's me, Chesty.

686
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,694
Oh my gracious, not even your
own mother would know you.

687
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,736
Yeah, I know. I had to smear this stuff
on my face so I could get ashore.

688
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:49,849
Come on, tell me. What's up?
- Well, it's Biff.

689
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:52,205
He is trying to make me promise
not to see you anymore.

690
00:45:52,513 --> 00:45:55,419
Oh yeah? Well look, let's go someplace
and I'll wash this stuff off my face.

691
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:57,020
We'll talk it all over. Come on.

692
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:09,850
Well, supposing I got a
job in some other place?

693
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:11,538
Would you come?

694
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,054
Are you going to be transferred?

695
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:15,037
No. I'm quitting the Navy tonight.

696
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,125
You're just fooling, Chesty.

697
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,612
I'm not kidding. I mean it.

698
00:46:18,712 --> 00:46:20,299
I know what's wrong with you.
- What?

699
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,430
You're just sore as you
can't get even with Biff.

700
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,974
You're taking it out on the Navy.

701
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,585
I'll admit that's part of it but I
don't like the rest of it either.

702
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,870
You can take the Navy and
put it right in your eye.

703
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,661
The only way to get me back into
it is to send me back in a box.

704
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:34,521
What's the matter?

705
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:35,735
Nothing.

706
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,641
Come on, tell me. What is it?

707
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:40,368
Chesty, I just can't like a deserter.

708
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,065
I never dreamed you were a quitter.

709
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:43,269
I ain't quitting.

710
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:44,713
I don't like the Navy.

711
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:46,318
Isn't that enough for you?

712
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,681
It is for me.

713
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,552
I'm tired. Let's go home.

714
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,097
Am I being a chump again?
- Not yet.

715
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:57,887
But you will be if you run away.

716
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:01,200
Alright, I quit.

717
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:04,890
I'll go back to the
ship and stick it out.

718
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:07,367
Oh honest? Will you promise, Chesty?

719
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:10,534
I'd promise you anything.

720
00:47:29,355 --> 00:47:30,199
Hey, mister.

721
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:33,270
Oh, go away will you. Go away.

722
00:47:33,593 --> 00:47:35,619
The two dollar bill you
gave me is all ridden out.

723
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:37,226
But the crowd out there.

724
00:47:41,352 --> 00:47:43,283
Are passing the hat to
keep you riding all night.

725
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,461
Is it okay?

726
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:52,917
And Biff.

727
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,434
I want you to know
if you'll shake hands ..

728
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,691
And Biff.

729
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:00,653
I want you to know
if you'll shake hands ..

730
00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:03,394
I'll forget the past
and try to be friends.

731
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:05,529
What's more, I'll try
to be a better sailor.

732
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,197
Now wait a minute. That last ..

733
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:09,604
Sounds kind of abracadabra.
You know, lah-di-dah.

734
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,894
It's out.
- Well ..

735
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:14,880
Then I'll watch myself and
try to be a credit to the ship.

736
00:48:15,136 --> 00:48:16,412
Alright. I'll say that.

737
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,261
Oh Chesty, I'm proud of you.

738
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:20,453
I want you to know.

739
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:23,143
I wouldn't do it for nobody else in
the world but you. Nobody but you.

740
00:48:23,243 --> 00:48:24,029
Oh, honey.

741
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,115
Wait.

742
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,733
Goodnight, baby.
- Now don't forget.

743
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:33,790
I won't.

744
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:37,085
Goodnight again.

745
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,091
Hey, skipper.

746
00:48:45,324 --> 00:48:48,015
I jumped ship. I must get back. Will
you take me out for a couple of bucks?

747
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:49,952
Sure, but it costs three.
- Right, let's go.

748
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,359
Alright, Bob. Shove off.

749
00:48:57,222 --> 00:48:59,296
How you going to get back on
board if you jumped ship?

750
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:04,004
You know it's much tougher getting
back on than it was getting off.

751
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,064
It's a tough rap.

752
00:49:07,392 --> 00:49:09,600
You're liable to get about
ten days in the brig for this.

753
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,062
Hey, do me a favor, will you.
- Yeah, sure.

754
00:49:17,594 --> 00:49:20,069
When we get close to the ship,
slow down and switch off your lights.

755
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:22,653
Will you do that?
- Yeah. Sure.

756
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:25,017
O'Connor.

757
00:49:26,437 --> 00:49:27,195
O'Connor!

758
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:28,916
Yes, sir.

759
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,230
Mullins, what are you doing here?

760
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,282
I'm on watch.

761
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:35,194
See, Chesty wasn't feeling very well.

762
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:38,007
As a matter of fact he was sick
and he said to me, he said ..

763
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,065
"Droopy", he said ..

764
00:49:41,424 --> 00:49:42,726
He wasn't feeling very well.

765
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:44,150
You feel fine, don't you?

766
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,369
You're not a very good liar, Droopy.
- Yes, sir.

767
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:47,226
No, sir.

768
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:49,200
I know where he is.
- What will I do?

769
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:52,032
Stay on watch until you're relieved.
I've got some watching to do myself.

770
00:49:55,084 --> 00:49:56,496
Alright, Bob. Slow down.

771
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:07,587
Help .. help!

772
00:50:08,278 --> 00:50:09,294
Man overboard!

773
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:10,637
Man overboard.

774
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:11,886
Man overboard!

775
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:16,721
Man overboard. Port side.

776
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:19,146
Man overboard, port side.

777
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,313
Help.

778
00:50:26,827 --> 00:50:27,628
Help!

779
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:28,922
Man overboard.

780
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,889
Lower away.

781
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,426
Together.

782
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:53,200
Is there anything I can do to help?
- Yes. Keep out of the way.

783
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:15,280
Who is it?

784
00:51:16,604 --> 00:51:17,930
I hope it's who I think.

785
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:22,310
Aha.

786
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:23,846
It is.

787
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,362
What happened?
- Why ..

788
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,140
I was leaning against the side when my
foot slipped and I fell into the water.

789
00:51:31,427 --> 00:51:33,384
Yeah. Your foot slipped
alright. Well, stupid ..

790
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:36,711
You brought this on yourself. You'll be
reported for being absent without leave.

791
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,302
Ahoy, Arizona!

792
00:51:38,816 --> 00:51:42,402
Did that dumb sailor who just jumped
off this speedboat get aboard alright?

793
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,983
Okay skipper, we got him.

794
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:44,976
Alright.

795
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,328
What's your name?
- Chesty O'Connor.

796
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,702
Seaman 2nd Class, sir.

797
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,172
The man is AWOL sir.

798
00:51:51,272 --> 00:51:54,061
Furthermore he jumped his watch tonight
and let another man substitute for him.

799
00:51:54,494 --> 00:51:56,424
O'Connor. That's a very serious offence.

800
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,097
You're restricted to this ship.

801
00:51:58,269 --> 00:52:00,000
Awaiting action of the
Commanding Officer.

802
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:01,590
Aye-aye, sir.

803
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,365
Martin.

804
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:10,395
You've been called here to testify
in the case of seaman O'Connor.

805
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:13,737
He's charged with leaving the ship with
no authority on the night of April 2nd.

806
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:18,318
Also, on the same night of leaving his
station and duty without any authority.

807
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:20,649
Tell the court what
you know of the case.

808
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,303
I was on duty on the
night in question, sir.

809
00:52:25,629 --> 00:52:28,876
And I had assigned seaman O'Connor
to the 8 to 12 fo'c'sle watch.

810
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,333
On inspection I found
that he'd gotten ..

811
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:34,491
Seaman Mullins to stand
his watch for him.

812
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,905
Well, I immediately
searched the ship and ..

813
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,949
Found O'Connor was not aboard.

814
00:52:40,472 --> 00:52:41,189
About.

815
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:42,987
One o'clock in the morning.

816
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:45,399
I was standing on the fo'c'sle deck.

817
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:49,007
When a shore boat came close in
to the bow and I heard a splash.

818
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:53,021
Shortly afterwards,
I heard a man yell ..

819
00:52:53,513 --> 00:52:54,489
"Man overboard".

820
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,337
We found the man to be .. O'Connor.

821
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,996
However sir, he did not fall over
from the fo'c'sle deck because ..

822
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,519
The only two on the
fo'c'sle deck were ..

823
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:07,832
Seaman Mullins and myself.

824
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:11,243
Does the accused desire
to make a statement?

825
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,218
Yes, sir.

826
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,396
Martin has had it in for
me for a long time.

827
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:18,031
He's just making this thing worse.

828
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,463
Just to make it tough for me.

829
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,014
Well go ahead and sentence me.

830
00:53:21,221 --> 00:53:22,380
And when it's all over.

831
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,040
I'm going to get off this wagon.
I don't like the sea and I never have.

832
00:53:25,454 --> 00:53:27,442
I want to go into some other
branch of the service.

833
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:29,341
And as for you, gumshoe ..
- Silence!

834
00:53:31,203 --> 00:53:33,649
O'Connor you're only making yourself
liable for further discipline.

835
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:35,277
Orderly.

836
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,448
Take charge of the prisoner.
- Aye-aye, sir.

837
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:03,782
Halt!

838
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:05,966
Left. Face.

839
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,935
I have the court-martial papers, sir.

840
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:12,650
Very well.

841
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:14,427
O'Connor.

842
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:15,939
Uncover.

843
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:19,274
O'Connor.

844
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,912
The court before which you
were tried has found you guilty.

845
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:24,167
And this is the sentence of the court.

846
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:27,600
To be confined to the limits of the
ship for a period of two months.

847
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:30,244
And to lose 24 dollars
per month of your pay.

848
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:31,947
For a period of three months.

849
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,144
A total loss of pay
amounting to 72 dollars.

850
00:54:36,262 --> 00:54:37,818
Signed by all members of the court.

851
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,349
Approved by the commanding officer.

852
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,653
And the immediate superior in command.

853
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:46,538
Master at Arms.

854
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,079
Take charge of O'Connor.

855
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:49,356
Aye-aye, sir.

856
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:51,294
Division. Dismissed.

857
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:53,689
Too bad, Chesty.

858
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:54,951
That's really too bad.

859
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,345
Hey listen, O'Connor.

860
00:54:57,553 --> 00:54:58,757
I'm sorry about that.

861
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:02,397
Now wait a minute, hothead.

862
00:55:03,528 --> 00:55:06,460
You've been in the Navy long enough to
know what I did was in the line of duty.

863
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:09,969
Any trouble between you and my sister
and me has got nothing to do with it.

864
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,026
Onboard ship I do my
duty just as I see it.

865
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,656
But you get this through your skull.

866
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,375
I'm no squealer.

867
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:18,188
Alright. Gangway.

868
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,962
No, he's no squealer.

869
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:23,871
So that's the way they
do it in the Navy, huh?

870
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:25,541
Shipmates.

871
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,745
If that's the way it is, I don't want
anything more to do with any of it.

872
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,921
And that goes for the whole
outfit and anybody in it.

873
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:32,758
You're nothing but a lot of whip-dogs ..

874
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:35,168
Boot-licking and kowtowing
to a flock of mugs in uniform.

875
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:37,330
Who push you around
like a lot of rag-dolls.

876
00:55:40,806 --> 00:55:41,831
A wrong guy.

877
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:50,580
Sure, sure.

878
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,948
You guys wouldn't laugh if you heard my
mother sing this song in Walla Walla.

879
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:57,663
I can see her now sitting in a rocking
chair waiting for me to come home.

880
00:55:57,968 --> 00:55:59,556
And as I step in the door she'd say ..

881
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:00,565
Drunk again.

882
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:02,654
Thanks, guys.

883
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,332
To show you how that song gets me.

884
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:19,446
Once I heard a mother singing it
to her kid while she was feeding it.

885
00:56:19,783 --> 00:56:21,485
You know what it made
me feel like doing?

886
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,671
Having a baby.

887
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,350
Why did those guys leave when I came in?

888
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:29,371
I've been trying to learn the words
to that song for eight years.

889
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:32,029
I know one mistake I've been making.
Instead of singing ..

890
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:35,107
"<i>The violets of early spring</i>".

891
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:36,490
I've been singing ..

892
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,303
"<i>Sweet peas on a pearly string</i>".

893
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:41,493
I asked you.

894
00:56:42,105 --> 00:56:44,093
Why did those guys get up
and leave when I came in?

895
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,622
You know what I think I will do?

896
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:48,155
I'm going to have it tattooed on me.
Then it will stay with me.

897
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:49,897
Answer me! Why did they leave?

898
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:54,216
I don't want to tell you, Chesty.
- Come on.

899
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,604
Well they got the thumbs down on you.

900
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,401
They think you're a wrong guy.

901
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,302
Because of that speech I gave them?

902
00:57:01,402 --> 00:57:02,168
Yeah.

903
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:03,888
They like the Navy.

904
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,959
Well if that's the way they feel
about it, it's alright with me.

905
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:09,178
The further they're away
from me, the better I like it.

906
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:10,237
And that goes.

907
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:25,615
"<i>Oh promise me that
someday you and </i>I .."

908
00:57:30,552 --> 00:57:31,281
Charlie.

909
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,754
Oh, wait a minute.

910
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:34,673
Hello.

911
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:36,657
Oh, my sweetheart.

912
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:21,386
"<i>Sweet violets of early spring</i>."

913
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:25,765
"<i>Oh promise me that
someday you and I</i> .."

914
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:39,053
Baby.

915
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,931
Not here. Biff will see us.

916
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,294
Boy, I'm glad to see you. It seems ages.

917
00:58:43,557 --> 00:58:44,548
Here, sit down.

918
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:45,661
Well?

919
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:48,387
What do you think of that big
brother of yours?       - What?

920
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,990
What he did to me when I took your
advice and came back to apologise.

921
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,940
I'm certainly not proud of you Chesty
for what you said after the summary.

922
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:56,160
Why did they want to give
me such a stiff jolt for?

923
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,250
Lots of guys go AWOL and get
extra duty for only one day.

924
00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,729
But you jumped your watch.

925
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:02,777
Well I do it because I want to see you.

926
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:06,397
I don't want you to neglect your duty
no matter how much I want to see you.

927
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:08,596
Well, whatever I did he
shouldn't have turned me in.

928
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,693
He had to do it, Chesty. It's his duty.

929
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,337
He's sick about it.

930
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,218
What are you always
sticking up for him for?

931
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:17,348
He is the only one I
have left in the world.

932
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:19,581
Naturally I defend him
because I love him.

933
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,320
Maybe you don't need nobody else?

934
00:59:31,845 --> 00:59:32,946
Don't talk like that.

935
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:36,028
Well, if he's such a big-shot with
you maybe I'm wasting your time.

936
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:38,513
Do you really feel that way?
- Yes, certainly.

937
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,614
If he's that man, I might as
well bow out of the picture.

938
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:43,784
Whatever made you think you were in it?

939
00:59:44,641 --> 00:59:45,285
Oh.

940
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:48,342
So it's one of those things, huh?

941
00:59:48,734 --> 00:59:52,138
Anyway, I wouldn't marry you. Not while
you were still a 2nd Class seaman.

942
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:53,688
Hmm. A snob.

943
00:59:54,288 --> 00:59:55,990
Why didn't you wait
until you were asked?

944
00:59:56,517 --> 00:59:57,933
What's the use of prolonging it?

945
00:59:58,138 --> 01:00:00,132
If this ends it, at least
let's talk as friends.

946
01:00:00,504 --> 01:00:01,469
Yeah, sure.

947
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:04,345
It's been nice.

948
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,343
You can't even be a good sport, can you.

949
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:09,645
Go on home, will you.

950
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,304
You've said your piece.
- Not all of it.

951
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:15,561
I'm going to tell you something
though you don't deserve it.

952
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,264
You've signed up for four years.

953
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:20,170
And you'll spend them either
on board ship or in naval prison.

954
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,273
But you will still
spend your four years.

955
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,982
Go on, blow will you. Blow.

956
01:00:25,352 --> 01:00:26,990
And how you spend them depends on you.

957
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:28,715
You certainly started out wrong.

958
01:00:28,976 --> 01:00:30,366
You can fool a CPO.

959
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:33,270
You can annoy a Captain.
You might even trouble an Admiral.

960
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,894
But there is one thing neither
you nor anybody else can do.

961
01:00:36,294 --> 01:00:37,514
And that's whip the Navy.

962
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:44,793
Everything alright?

963
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:47,533
That's fine.

964
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:04,883
All hands take stations
for getting under weigh.

965
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:13,192
Anchors aweigh.

966
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:14,565
Anchors aweigh, bridge.

967
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:31,023
I don't see why we
got to wash this thing.

968
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,026
It's coming right out of the water.

969
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:35,408
We got to wash the germs off it.
- For what?

970
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,643
They're going to use it in the
officer's mess to crack nuts.

971
01:02:20,014 --> 01:02:21,922
Bugler, sound general alert.

972
01:02:22,286 --> 01:02:23,158
Aye-aye, sir.

973
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:15,347
My range. 8-0, double O.

974
01:03:15,685 --> 01:03:17,806
My range, 178 double O.

975
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,216
Coming on the range.

976
01:03:20,638 --> 01:03:21,625
One minute to go.

977
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,368
Alright boys, remember we're
out for the fleet record. Let's go.

978
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:25,989
Stand by.

979
01:03:27,494 --> 01:03:28,208
Load.

980
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:38,710
One.

981
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:40,581
Two.

982
01:03:41,243 --> 01:03:41,915
Three.

983
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:44,588
Four.

984
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:51,995
Ready one.
- Ready two.

985
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,368
Ready three.

986
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,340
Three.

987
01:04:38,213 --> 01:04:38,991
Four.

988
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:40,977
That's five.

989
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:49,285
Ready.

990
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:56,161
Ready one.

991
01:05:06,554 --> 01:05:07,540
Watch it men.

992
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:29,865
Fire. Fire!

993
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,430
Control, control! Fire in gun
room number one turret!

994
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:52,720
Close those plugs.

995
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,439
Don't turn those on.

996
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:55,999
Get that powder out of here.

997
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,276
How do you feel, Chesty?
- Alright, kid.

998
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:25,710
You sure?
- Yeah.

999
01:06:27,051 --> 01:06:28,571
Well you certainly are a big-shot.

1000
01:06:28,978 --> 01:06:31,024
You ought to hear what the
guys are saying about you.

1001
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:32,383
Yeah?

1002
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:34,037
What did they say?

1003
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:35,754
Well, they think you're a swell fellow.

1004
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:39,683
And you must be a great guy to
risk your life to save all those men.

1005
01:06:40,258 --> 01:06:42,685
And you are an amazing character.

1006
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:45,073
You're going to be
recommended for a decoration.

1007
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,266
Ah, bull.

1008
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:49,273
I'm the same guy they gave
the goodbye to, ain't I?

1009
01:06:49,864 --> 01:06:52,596
Well they gave it to me once and I don't
want to have no truck with them now.

1010
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,107
I did it to save myself.

1011
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,965
And I want them to know that.

1012
01:06:56,065 --> 01:06:57,918
You oughtn't to feel that way, Chesty.

1013
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,007
You are going to get a
medal and everything.

1014
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:00,907
Times up.

1015
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,478
Take good care of yourself, Chesty.

1016
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:05,015
And do everything they tell you.

1017
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:08,076
Not much chance of doing anything else.

1018
01:07:15,654 --> 01:07:17,589
How about it? Is he convalescing?

1019
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,116
Not while I was in there.

1020
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:21,593
What did he say when you said
the boys were all for him?

1021
01:07:21,693 --> 01:07:23,260
It ain't fit to be repeated.

1022
01:07:24,819 --> 01:07:25,778
I get it.

1023
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:02,747
All hands aft, sir.

1024
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:07,987
Seaman 2nd Class C.J. O'Connor.

1025
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:09,462
Front and center.

1026
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:20,571
Sir, Seaman O'Connor is
present to be decorated.

1027
01:08:20,919 --> 01:08:21,935
Publish the order.

1028
01:08:24,459 --> 01:08:25,160
Salute.

1029
01:08:27,128 --> 01:08:27,751
Two.

1030
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,816
"<i>The Secretary of the
Navy, Washington, D.C</i>."

1031
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,532
"<i>25 August, 1934</i>."

1032
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:40,235
"<i>The President of The United States has
pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross</i>."

1033
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,747
"<i>To seaman 2nd Class,

1034
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,479
"<i>For gallant conduct upon
the occasion of the</i> .."

1035
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:49,446

ignited powder charges</i>."

1036
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:52,687

1037
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:57,191
"<i>During target practice

1038
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,089
"<i>Citation</i>."

1039
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:02,319
"<i>O'Connor by his complete

1040
01:09:02,795 --> 01:09:06,019
"<i>Succeeded in smothering the burning

1041
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,273
"<i>Of the turret's crew and the

1042

1043
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:14,511

1044
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:17,553
"<i>And upon the United States

1045
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:20,328

1046
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:21,816
"<i>Secretary of the Navy</i>."

1047
01:09:24,587 --> 01:09:25,831
Orders are published, sir.

1048
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:29,040
O'Connor.

1049
01:09:30,946 --> 01:09:32,219
It gives me great pleasure.

1050
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:36,845
To join with the Navy department in
commending your conspicuous courage.

1051
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:40,898
My congratulations and best wishes.

1052
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:42,625
Thank you, sir.

1053
01:09:44,954 --> 01:09:45,912
My pal.

1054
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:57,034
Station officers take charge.
Dismiss divisions.

1055
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:02,029
Divisions, dismissed!

1056
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,555
Chesty, let me congratulate you.

1057
01:10:06,804 --> 01:10:08,217
I'm glad I know you.

1058
01:10:08,686 --> 01:10:11,409
There ain't many guys got one of
them things. I'm not envious mind you.

1059
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:12,979
But I certainly wish I had one.

1060
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,905
Like it?
- Sure.     - Alright.

1061
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,792
It's all yours.

1062
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:21,021
Now.

1063
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,557
Feel like a hero?

1064
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,426
What are you crabbing about?

1065
01:10:24,764 --> 01:10:26,980
You ought to be tickled to death.
- Ah, what is it?

1066
01:10:27,295 --> 01:10:29,990
Nothing but a tin novelty you can buy
in any hock shop for a dime a dozen.

1067
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,521
What do I get out of it, for
getting my eyebrows singed?

1068
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:35,502
It's the two bucks a month that goes
with it that interests me. So here.

1069
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:37,966
Send that to your Mama
with my compliments.

1070
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,818
O'Connor is a good man but I guess
he needs a change of scenery.

1071
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,870
He's already asked for a transfer of
duty to lighter-than-air craft, sir.

1072
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:49,299
Oh.

1073
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,055
Well, I'll see if I can't help it along.

1074
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:53,768
You sent for me, sir?

1075
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:58,058
O'Connor, I have received orders
from the Bureau of Navigation.

1076
01:10:58,364 --> 01:10:59,694
Detaching you from this ship.

1077
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:02,074
You are ordered for duty
to lighter-than-air craft.

1078
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:04,654
I hate to see you go.

1079
01:11:04,754 --> 01:11:06,596
But you seem to be headed
wrong in this ship.

1080
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,794
The Navy tires to make
men, not break them.

1081
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:10,730
You've got the stuff.

1082
01:11:11,253 --> 01:11:12,945
I wish you a happy cruise at Sunnyvale.

1083
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:15,113
Thank you, sir.

1084
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:17,973
The first break I've had since
I've been in this man's navy.

1085
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,912
The next break you'll
get will be your neck.

1086
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:23,147
Don't you kid yourself. The neck
to be broken will be Biff Martin's.

1087
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:26,451
The first time I meet the guy ashore I'm
going to break every bone in his skull.

1088
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,166
I've heard that so many times
it's getting to be a monopole.

1089
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,027
A what?

1090
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,103
You know, one guy talking to himself.
- Oh.

1091
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,336
Look, Chesty.
- Yeah?

1092
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,513
Would you like to make a nice gesture?

1093
01:11:36,894 --> 01:11:38,058
How?
- Well ..

1094
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:40,250
My mother ain't got her false teeth yet.

1095
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,697
And like I was telling you, her
choir singing job ain't so secure.

1096
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:46,240
0kay, kid. Here.

1097
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,166
Here is ten ..

1098
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:50,005
Ten. Twenty bucks.

1099
01:11:51,204 --> 01:11:54,185
Buy your Ma a new set of porcelain fangs
and dedicate the upper plate to me.

1100
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,391
I wish I could be there for the opening.

1101
01:11:57,093 --> 01:11:57,904
Look.

1102
01:11:58,421 --> 01:11:59,109
I ..

1103
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:01,534
I got something for you.

1104
01:12:01,906 --> 01:12:02,961
0h yeah?
- Yeah.

1105
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:05,211
Well, you might not like it.

1106
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:08,264
I thînk you'll appreciate it.
Because it is nice.

1107
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:10,844
Ah.

1108
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,056
Now what did you want to
go to all that trouble for?

1109
01:12:14,156 --> 01:12:16,384
If you don't like it you can
make a calendar out of it.

1110
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:19,150
You know .. there's one nice thing
about it.                 - Yeah? What?

1111
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:21,411
There is no doubt in your
mind as to who it is from.

1112
01:12:22,181 --> 01:12:23,425
The boat is ready, Chesty.

1113
01:12:23,595 --> 01:12:25,669
I'll be right there, kid.
- I'll take the bag, Chesty.

1114
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:26,498
Alright.

1115
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:41,145
Well, there goes your hero.

1116
01:12:41,768 --> 01:12:43,928
If you want to say goodbye
to him you'd better do it now.

1117
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:46,181
He won't speak to me, Biff.

1118
01:12:51,896 --> 01:12:52,797
Give him this.

1119
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:58,742
Goodbye, old pal.

1120
01:12:59,223 --> 01:13:00,067
Bye, Droopy.

1121
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:02,305
The old ship ain't going to
be the same without you.

1122
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:03,620
It couldn't be any worse.

1123
01:13:04,073 --> 01:13:05,689
Say, what's the matter? You got a cold?

1124
01:13:05,921 --> 01:13:07,701
No, it's my voice.

1125
01:13:08,032 --> 01:13:09,260
I think it is changing.

1126
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,077
Oh.

1127
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:14,428
I certainly wish I was going with you.
- Oh, you'll be alright.

1128
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:16,547
Now look, don't forget
what I told you. Right?

1129
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:18,063
O'Connor.

1130
01:13:19,781 --> 01:13:22,589
I never had any man go over the side for
the lasts time without being friends.

1131
01:13:24,106 --> 01:13:25,334
Come on. What do you say?

1132
01:13:31,384 --> 01:13:33,501
Okay hothead, if that's
the way you feel about it.

1133
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:34,955
Here.

1134
01:13:35,509 --> 01:13:36,439
That's for you.

1135
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,389
So long, Chesty.
- So long, kid.

1136
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,200
Good luck, old boy.

1137
01:14:00,632 --> 01:14:01,419
How can ..

1138
01:14:02,248 --> 01:14:03,953
How can you figure a guy like that?

1139
01:14:10,139 --> 01:14:12,786
Woo, switch! What are you
two guys? A couple of violets?

1140
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:14,455
Ah, mind your own business.

1141
01:14:16,814 --> 01:14:18,008
Goodbye, Chesty!

1142
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:42,951
Here's a lug for your whiskers.

1143
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:46,062
I get a letter from a pal of mine. He
tells me about everything but the ship.

1144
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,213
What a mug.

1145
01:14:47,587 --> 01:14:50,414
What do you expect?
Those sailors are all dumb.

1146
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:51,776
Oh, is that so?

1147
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:54,992
Listen, I want you to know the boys on
the Arizona are the best in the world.

1148
01:14:55,735 --> 01:14:57,000
Well, all except one.

1149
01:15:22,878 --> 01:15:24,781
All present and accounted for, sir.
- Very good.

1150
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:28,559
"<i>United States Fleet</i>."

"<i>Leave quarters</i>."

1164
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:32,597
The Arizona has been detailed to provide
this ground crew for the Macon.

1165
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,962
Which lands at Mines Field today.

1166
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:37,563
Take charge.
- Aye-aye, sir.

1167
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:41,501
Right, face!

1168
01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:55,868
Light smoke bomb.

1169
01:18:03,086 --> 01:18:05,556
What did they do that for?
- To see which way the wind is blowing.

1170
01:18:06,614 --> 01:18:07,601
I always do this.

1171
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,821
Left rudder.
- Left rudder, sir.

1172
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:32,110
Steady.
- Steady, sir.

1173
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:42,070
The wind seems a bit gusty.
I think we can make it though.

1174
01:18:43,272 --> 01:18:45,432
This old bag is going to have
a tough time landing today.

1175
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:47,864
Better get the hatch ready
for dropping those trails.

1176
01:18:47,964 --> 01:18:49,001
Okay. Open up.

1177
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:53,142
You said it. That wind
is getting stronger.

1178
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:58,177
Those ground monkeys
better watch themselves.

1179
01:18:58,597 --> 01:18:59,956
We'll try it.
- Aye-aye, sir.

1180
01:19:00,599 --> 01:19:02,444
Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, sir.

1181
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:05,140
Come left.
- Come left, sir.

1182
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,457
Drop the trail.
- Drop the trail, sir.

1183
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:27,073
Trail is dropping.

1184
01:19:37,451 --> 01:19:39,537
We've got to make another approach.
- Aye-aye, sir.

1185
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:41,509
Full right rudder.
- Full right rudder, sir.

1186
01:19:42,606 --> 01:19:44,078
Stand clear!

1187
01:19:59,163 --> 01:20:00,465
Look at that monkey hang on.

1188
01:20:01,237 --> 01:20:02,757
Let go, you chump! Let go!

1189
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:10,652
There is a man on our
starboard trail, sir.

1190
01:20:10,752 --> 01:20:12,196
Up elevator.
- Up elevator, sir.

1191
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:14,026
We can't drag that man
through the trees.

1192
01:20:18,317 --> 01:20:19,448
Don't touch that rope.

1193
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:43,176
I don't know how long he's going
to be able to hang on, sir.

1194
01:20:45,242 --> 01:20:47,294
I'd like to go down that
rope and get that man, sir.

1195
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,577
I've only one man to worry about now.
If you go down I must worry about two.

1196
01:20:50,677 --> 01:20:52,945
It's nothing to worry about. It's easy.
- I can't risk it.

1197
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:55,011
Aye-aye, sir.

1198
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:58,744
Steady.

1199
01:21:07,361 --> 01:21:08,977
Hey O'Connor, what are you going to do?

1200
01:21:09,171 --> 01:21:10,355
I hope he can hang on.

1201
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:12,626
Gangway.
- Where you going?

1202
01:21:13,023 --> 01:21:15,612
To pick that guy off that rope.
- You chump. You'll break your neck.

1203
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:17,020
Well, I'll try it anyway.

1204
01:21:19,789 --> 01:21:21,639
Well good luck, kid.
- Happy landings.

1205
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,207
Can you hang on another minute?

1206
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:01,918
Well if it ain't flatfoot.

1207
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:03,688
I might have guessed it.

1208
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:06,413
The only guy in the Navy dumb enough
to hang on to the end of a rope.

1209
01:22:15,257 --> 01:22:15,986
Alright?

1210
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:17,454
Put both arms around me.

1211
01:22:18,256 --> 01:22:19,100
Both of 'em.

1212
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:20,345
Right?

1213
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:21,860
Alright. One.

1214
01:22:22,284 --> 01:22:24,244
Here we go. Two, three.

1215
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:40,119
We're going down too fast to suit me.
- Hope we make it, kid.

1216
01:22:41,693 --> 01:22:43,499
How are you? I'm bouncing.
- Awkward.

1217
01:22:59,853 --> 01:23:01,864
Well it looks like O'Connor
has joined the Navy.

1218
01:23:15,632 --> 01:23:16,515
Oh, Chesty.

1219
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:18,986
Get back. Get back.

1220
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,504
Alright Chesty, you stay right where you
are. Dorothy you get a little closer.

1221
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:39,345
Chaplain, you stand
on the port side here.

1222
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:40,233
Oh.

1223
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:41,847
Giving orders, huh?

1224
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,387
Who's running this thing?
I'm the lug that's getting married.

1225
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,511
Who's the guy that's giving
her away? I am, ain't I?

1226
01:23:46,611 --> 01:23:49,112
Go on being so stinking officious
and I won't even marry your sister.

1227
01:23:49,212 --> 01:23:51,176
You'll marry her or I'll
slug you with a crutch.

1228
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,084
That will be the best
day you ever lived.

1229
01:23:53,184 --> 01:23:55,290
Boys remember, this is our wedding day.

1230
01:23:55,685 --> 01:23:57,717
Come on, slow down sailor.
I'm still giving orders.

1231
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:58,714
Oh yeah?

1232
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:00,667
Droopy.

1233
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:03,103
Here.

1234
01:24:03,549 --> 01:24:05,967
Cast a loving glance at that and
see what it does to your dignity.

1235
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:10,402
"<i>The President of the

Bosun?

1240
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:22,039
To be obedient to his orders?

1241
01:24:22,652 --> 01:24:24,699
Hey, this warrant puts you above me.

1242
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:26,704
Well, I am a son of ..

1243
01:24:26,972 --> 01:24:27,896
Chesty.

1244
01:24:28,211 --> 01:24:29,451
Who is giving orders now?

1245
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,423
From now on, treat me with respect.

1246
01:24:31,763 --> 01:24:33,093
And whenever you speak to me.

1247
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:35,558
Call me "Mister".

1248
01:24:37,623 --> 01:24:38,392
Yes, sir.

1249
01:24:38,842 --> 01:24:41,065
If you boys will remain
quiet for just a minute.

1250
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:43,279
We are ready, Mullins.

1251
01:24:43,434 --> 01:24:44,793
You may have your mother sing.

1252
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,025
Alright, mum.

1253
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,686
Mr O'Connor, will you take the
hand of your beloved bride.

1254
01:24:49,008 --> 01:24:50,142
I'll stand for this.

1255
01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:51,057
Hey, Biffy.

1256
01:24:51,428 --> 01:24:54,132
Do you think you could part with one of
your good legs for just two minutes?

1257
01:24:56,027 --> 01:24:57,204
There you are, Admiral.

1258
01:24:57,304 --> 01:24:58,829
Can you play "0h Promise me"?

1259
01:24:59,218 --> 01:25:00,033
I think so.

1260
01:25:01,966 --> 01:25:04,495
Now I'm so nervous I've
forgotten the words.

1261
01:25:04,595 --> 01:25:06,260
Go ahead. Play it from memory.

1262
01:25:06,525 --> 01:25:08,099
Come on, Ma. Chirp.

1263
01:25:08,996 --> 01:25:15,642
"<i>Oh promise me that someday you and I</i>."

1264
01:25:17,519 --> 01:25:24,603
"<i>We'll take our love
together to some sky</i>."

1265
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:32,435
"<i>Where we can be alone
and faith renewed</i>."

1266
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:38,530
"<i>And find the hollows
where those flowers</i> .."

1267
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,900
"<i>Grew</i>."

1268
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:47,809
"<i>Oh promise me</i>."

1269
01:25:49,693 --> 01:25:51,714
"<i>Oh, prom </i> .."

1270
01:25:54,335 --> 01:25:55,792
"<i>Me</i>."

1271
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:28,565
T-G oö

1272
01:26:29,305 --> 01:27:29,176
