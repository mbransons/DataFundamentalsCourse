1
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,482
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,487
- That the joint?
- Yes, sir.

3
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,735
- Who runs it?
- I already told you.

4
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,866
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

5
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,073
That's very refreshing.
What's the password?

6
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,408
"I come to Grandma's funeral."

7
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,789
- Here's your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

8
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,649
Now, if you want a ringside table,
just tell 'em that you're one of the pallbearers.

9
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,040
- Okay, Charlie.
- We're all set. When's the kickoff?

10
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,627
Look, Chief, I better blow, 'cause if Colombo
sees me, it's gonna be good-bye, Charlie.

11
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,132
Good-bye, Charlie.

12
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,471
Give me five minutes.
Then hit 'em with everything you got.

13
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,268
You betcha.

14
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,362
Good evening, sir.
I'm Mr. Mozarella.

15
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,039
- What can I do for you?
- I come to the old lady's funeral.

16
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,617
I don't believe I've ever seen you
at our services before.

17
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,203
- That's because I've been on the wagon.
- Please!

18
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,818
Where they having the wake?
I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.

19
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,710
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

20
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,840
Yes, Mr. Mozarella. This way, sir.

21
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,861
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

22
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,442
Follow me, please.

23
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,715
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

24
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,464
- Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

25
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,262
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee.

26
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,091
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

27
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,846
Wait a minute.

28
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,144
Haven't you got another pew,
not so close to the band?

29
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,937
How about that one over there?

30
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,062
Sorry, sir, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

31
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,323
Oops.

32
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,458
Hey! Hey!
I want another cup of coffee!

33
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,336
I want another cup of coffee!

34
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,762
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

35
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,349
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people got no respect for the dead.

36
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,376
Say, Joe, tonight's the night, isn't it?

37
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,087
- I'll say.
- What? No, tonight's the night we get paid.

38
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,342
- That's good.
- Why?

39
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,344
I lost a filling in one of my back teeth.

40
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,954
- I gotta see a dentist tomorrow.
- Dentist?

41
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,706
We been out of work for four months, you want
to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

42
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,833
What? It's just a filling.
It doesn't have to be gold.

43
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,895
"It doesn't have to be gold."
How can you be so selfish?

44
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,229
We owe back rent.
We're in for $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

45
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,926
Three Chinese lawyers are suing us
because our check bounced at the laundry.

46
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,870
We've borrowed money
from every girl in the line.

47
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,638
- You're right.
- Well, of course I'm right.

48
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,974
First thing tomorrow, we'll pay everybody
a little somethin' on account.

49
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,239
- Oh, no, we don't.
- We don't?

50
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,201
First thing tomorrow we go out to the dog track
and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

51
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,536
Greased Lightning?
You're gonna bet my money on a dog?

52
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,233
He's a shoo-in.
I got it from Max the waiter.

53
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,276
His brother-in-law is the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

54
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,988
- What are you giving me with a rabbit!
- Look at the odds. He's ten-to-one.

55
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,595
- Tomorrow, we'll pay everybody.
- Suppose he loses.

56
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,159
What are you worried about?
This job is gonna last a long time.

57
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,640
Suppose it doesn't.

58
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,219
Jerry boy, why do you have to
paint everything so black?

59
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,144
- Oh!
- Suppose you got hit by a truck.

60
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,393
Suppose the stock market crashes.

61
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,772
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

62
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,728
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

63
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,944
- Joe.
- Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

64
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,617
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is under water.

65
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,379
Four...

66
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,755
three...

67
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,336
two...

68
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,591
one.

69
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,804
Oh! Oh!

70
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,896
All right, everybody! This is a raid.

71
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,106
I'm a federal agent!
You're all under arrest!

72
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,740
I want another cup of coffee!

73
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,958
All right, Spats. Services are over.

74
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,964
- Let's go.
- Go where?

75
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,512
A little country club
we run for retired bootleggers.

76
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,339
I'm puttin' your name up
for membership.

77
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,301
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

78
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,933
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats, striped.

79
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,438
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

80
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,736
Embalming people with coffee...

81
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,563
86 proof.

82
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,149
Me? I'm just a customer here.

83
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,200
Oh, come on, Spats.

84
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,575
We know you own the joint.
Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

85
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,201
Mozarella?

86
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,829
- Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

87
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,878
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?

88
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,877
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

89
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,380
Buttermilk.

90
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,593
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

91
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,470
Come on. On your feet.

92
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,723
You're just wastin' the taxpayers' money.

93
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,554
Call your lawyer if you wanna.

94
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,605
These are my lawyers.

95
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,183
All Harvard men.

96
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,560
Outside.

97
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,647
I want another cup of coffee!

98
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,196
I want another cup of coffee!

99
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,998
Get over there!

100
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,128
Get over there, will ya!

101
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,721
Get goin'. Come on!

102
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,074
Well, that solves one problem.

103
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,139
Now we don't have to worry about
who we're gonna pay first.

104
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,766
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- Of course the landlady's gonna lock us out.

105
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,328
Moe down at the delicatessen,
no more knockwurst on credit.

106
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,897
We can't borrow from the girls
because they're on the way to jail.

107
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,412
- Shut up.
- And we're...

108
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,464
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

109
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,041
Sam the bookie?

110
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,253
Nothing doing! You're not gonna put
my overcoat on a dog. Oh, you...

111
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,259
Look, Jerry, I told you it's a sure thing.

112
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,635
We will freeze.

113
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,933
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

114
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,979
Look, stupid, he's ten-to-one.
Tomorrow, we'll have 20 overcoats.

115
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,431
Joe...

116
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,944
Greased Lightning!

117
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,698
Oh, why do I listen to you?
I oughta have my head examined.

118
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,324
I thought you weren't talking to me.

119
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,827
Look at the bull fiddle!
It's dressed warmer than I am!

120
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,960
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

121
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,258
Thank you.

122
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,846
Anything today?

123
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,844
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

124
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,846
I can't go on, Joe.

125
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,770
I'm weak from hunger,
I'm running a fever, I got a hole in my shoe.

126
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,347
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

127
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,353
- Oh? How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

128
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,025
- His name is Galloping Ghost.
- Oh, no.

129
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,731
Oh, yes. He's 15-to-1, and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

130
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,111
What do you want from me,
my head on a plate?

131
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,930
No, just your bass. If we hocked that
and my sax, we could get at least...

132
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,538
Are you out of your mind? We're up the creek
and you want to hock the paddle.

133
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,241
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze!

134
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,418
Anything today?

135
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,995
Oh, it's you.

136
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,706
- Well, you got a lot of nerve.
- Thank you.

137
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,172
Joe! Come back here!

138
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,504
Mm-hmm.

139
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,808
Now, Nellie baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain everything.

140
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,135
What a heel.

141
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,519
I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled,
I buy me a brand-new negligee,

142
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,227
I bake him a great big pizza pie,
and where were you?

143
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,983
Where were you?

144
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,313
- With you.
- Me?

145
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,114
Don't you remember?
You had this bad tooth.

146
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,317
It was all impacted,
and his jaw was all swole out.

147
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,028
It was? Oh, yeah, was it ever.

148
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,081
I had to take him to the hospital
and give him a blood transfusion. Right?

149
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,580
- Right. We have the same type blood.
- Type "O."

150
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,910
- "O"?
- Oh?

151
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,537
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.

152
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,543
You're makin' it up
pretty good so far.

153
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,876
As soon as we get a job, I'm gonna take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

154
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,212
How about it, Nellie?

155
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,593
Has Poliakoff got anything for us?
We're desperate.

156
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,015
Well, it just so happens
he <i>is</i> looking for a bass.

157
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,061
And a sax.

158
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,605
Right?

159
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,148
Right.

160
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,317
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

161
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,520
- Florida!
- At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.

162
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,152
Transportation and expenses all paid.

163
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,198
Isn't she a bit of terrific?

164
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,387
- Come on. Let's see Poliakoff.
- Yeah.

165
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,097
Hold on.
He's got some people in there with him.

166
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,201
- You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

167
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,831
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

168
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,626
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

169
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,580
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

170
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,916
What do you mean, "Who is it?"
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for you.

171
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,464
Gladys, are you there?

172
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,590
Gladys!

173
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,006
Meshuggener.

174
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,262
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

175
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,265
- Now she's in bed with a nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

176
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,017
What about Cora Jackson?

177
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,691
The last I heard of her,
she was playing with a "Salivation" Army act.

178
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,439
Drexel-9044.

179
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,942
Oh, those idiot broads.

180
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,569
Here we are, already packed,
ready to leave for Miami.

181
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,241
And what happens?

182
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,410
The saxophone runs off
with a Bible salesman,

183
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,534
and the bass fiddle
gets herself pregnant.

184
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,707
Bienstock, I oughta fire you!

185
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,002
Me? I'm the manager of the band,
not the night watchman.

186
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,705
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

187
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,791
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

188
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,092
On the level?

189
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,676
Bessie let her hair grow.
Now she's playing with Stokowski.

190
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,176
Black Bottom Bessie?

191
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,759
<i>Spielt sich mit der Philharmonie!</i>

192
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,889
How about Rosemary Schultz?

193
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,937
She slashed her wrists
when Valentino died.

194
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,767
Well, we might as well all slash our wrists
unless we round up two dames by this evening.

195
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,773
Look, Sig, you know
the kind of girls we need.

196
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,299
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by eight o'clock.

197
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,235
Be nonchalant. Trust Poliakoff.

198
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,512
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a little jingle.

199
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,449
Bye, Sig. I wonder if I got room
for another ulcer.

200
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,326
Nellie, get me long distance.

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,992
- Look, Sig, we want to talk to you.
- What is it?

202
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,293
- It's about the Florida job.
- The Florida job?

203
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,774
- Mm-hmm. Nellie told us all about it.
- We're not too late, are we?

204
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,541
What are you, a couple of comedians?
Get outta here.

205
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,297
Long distance? Get me
the William Morris Agency in New York.

206
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,908
- Well, you need a bass and a sax, don't you?
- The instruments are right, but you're not.

207
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,732
- I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
- Wait a minute. What's wrong with us?

208
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,722
You're the wrong shape. Good-bye!

209
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,374
The wrong shape? What are you looking for,
hunchbacks or something?

210
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,311
- It's not the backs that worry me.
- What kind of a band is it anyway?

211
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,563
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

212
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,565
- You gotta be blonde.
- We could dye our hair.

213
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,966
- And you gotta be girls!
- We could...

214
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,481
No, we couldn't.

215
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,318
- Mr. William Morris.
- You mean this is a girl's band?

216
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,973
Yeah. That's what he means.
Good old Nellie. I could wring her neck.

217
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,284
- I'm holding on.
- Let's talk this thing over.

218
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,865
Why <i>couldn't</i> we do it, huh?

219
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,980
Last year when we worked in the Gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings, didn't we?

220
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,463
Remember when you booked us
with the Hawaiian band? We wore grass skirts.

221
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,838
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No. But he ain't been eatin' so good either.

222
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,968
He's got an empty stomach
and it's gone to his head.

223
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,221
Joe, this is three weeks in Florida.

224
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,285
We could borrow some clothes
from the girls in the chorus.

225
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,723
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking. <i>Now</i> he is talking!

226
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,458
We get a couple of secondhand wigs,
a little padding here and there,

227
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,065
we call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine!

228
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,858
- Josephine and Geraldine.
- Yeah.

229
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,311
- Come on!
- B-But...

230
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,112
Look, if you boys want to
pick up a little money tonight,

231
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,886
at the University of Illinois they're having,
you should pardon the expression,

232
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,276
a Saint Valentine's dance.

233
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,828
- We'll take it.
- You got it. Six dollars a man.

234
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,906
Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock.

235
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,833
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

236
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,128
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

237
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,673
Hello, Mr. Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

238
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,959
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a couple
of girl musicians available, would you?

239
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,344
A sax player and a bass?

240
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,342
Look, if William Morris
doesn't come through...

241
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,594
Come on, Geraldine.

242
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,554
It's a hundred miles, it's snowing outside.
Now, how are we gonna get there?

243
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,292
- I'll think of something.
- You'll think... Like what?

244
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,979
- Don't crowd me.
- "Don't crowd me. Don't crowd me."

245
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,651
How'd it go, girls?

246
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,820
Oh, you... I oughta wring your neck.

247
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,193
Please, Jerry!
That's no way to talk.

248
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,488
Nellie baby, what are you doing tonight?

249
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,195
Tonight? Why?

250
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,702
'Cause I've got some plans.

251
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,703
I'm not doing anything.

252
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,284
Really?

253
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:11,213
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

254
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,712
Then you'll be in all evening?

255
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,383
Yes, Joe.

256
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,506
Good!
Then you won't be needing your car.

257
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,964
My car? Why, you...

258
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,178
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

259
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,819
We could've had three weeks in Florida,
all expenses paid.

260
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,117
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish.

261
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,819
Knock it off, will ya?

262
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,785
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

263
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,000
- All right, drop 'em, you guys.
- Yeah? Well, drop what?

264
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,880
- We came for a car.
- Oh, yeah?

265
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,962
Yeah, Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

266
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,476
Musicians. Wise guys.

267
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,349
Okay, let's go. Aces bet.

268
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,266
It's a '25 Hupmobile.
Green coupe, sir.

269
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,568
- It's over here.
- Over here.

270
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,145
- Want some gas?
- Uh, yeah.

271
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,606
About, uh, 40 cents worth, please.

272
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,943
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Uh, yeah, why not?

273
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,619
And while you're at it, fill it up.

274
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,629
All right, everybody, hands up!

275
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,303
Face the wall!

276
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,759
You too, Toothpick.

277
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,059
Come on!

278
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,847
Come on.

279
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,576
Hey.

280
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,028
Join us.

281
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,716
Okay, boss.

282
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,436
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

283
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,643
What is it, Spats?
What are you doing here?

284
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,774
I just dropped in to pay my respects.

285
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,231
- You don't owe me no nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

286
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,053
You were nice enough to recommend
my mortuary to some of your friends.

287
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,471
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

288
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,034
Now I got all those coffins on my hands
and I hate to see 'em go to waste.

289
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,207
Honest, Spats.
I had nothing to do with it.

290
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,159
Oh, too bad, Charlie.

291
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,245
You would've had three eights.

292
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,628
Good-bye, Charlie.

293
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,757
No, Spats, no! No, Spats!
Please, no, n...

294
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,604
I think I'm gonna be sick.

295
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,690
All right, come on out of there.

296
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,734
Come on.

297
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,358
Come on!

298
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,444
We di... We didn't see anything.
Did we?

299
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,154
- What? No. Nothing. No.
- See?

300
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,728
Besides, it's none of our business if you guys
want to bump each other off. We don't...

301
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,621
Say, don't I know you two
from somewhere?

302
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,458
Oh, no. No.
We're just a couple of musicians.

303
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,760
W-We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

304
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,633
There's a dance tonight.

305
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,885
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

306
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,638
- Where do you think you're going?
- Urbana.

307
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,936
I-It's about a hundred miles from here,
so don't...

308
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,729
You're not goin' nowhere.

309
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,770
We're not?

310
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,444
- I don't like no witnesses.
- We won't breathe a word.

311
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,523
You won't breathe nothin'.

312
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,948
Not even air.

313
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,703
Wh...

314
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,519
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

315
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,706
I think they got me.
I think they got me.

316
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,162
They got the bull fiddle.

317
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,589
- No blood?
- If they catch us, there'll be blood all over.

318
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,382
Type "O." Come on.

319
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,419
- Joe, where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

320
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,363
That's not far enough.
You don't know those guys.

321
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,563
They know us.
Every hood in Chicago's gonna be after us, Joe.

322
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,897
- Quick, give me a nickel.
- What?

323
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,753
- Give me a nickel.
- All right.

324
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,166
Here... Oh.
You're gonna call the police, huh?

325
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,922
Police? We'd never live to testify.
Not against Spats Colombo.

326
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,344
Wabash 1098.

327
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,843
Joe, we gotta get out of town.
Maybe we should grow beards.

328
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,660
We are getting out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

329
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,550
Shave? At a time like this?

330
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,457
Those guys got machine guns ready
to blast our heads off, you want to shave.

331
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,939
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs? Wh...

332
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,500
Hello? Mr. Poliakoff?

333
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,481
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

334
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,195
Mm-hmm.

335
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,368
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

336
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,945
Mm-hmm.

337
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,969
Florida Limited <i>leaving
on track one for Washington, Charleston,</i>

338
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,468
<i>Savannah, Jacksonville, and Miami.</i>

339
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,470
<i>All aboard. All aboard.</i>

340
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,773
Ow!

341
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,603
- What's the matter now?
- How do they walk in these things? Huh?

342
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,217
- How do they keep their balance?
- Must be the way the weight is distributed.

343
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,527
Now, come on.

344
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,031
It is <i>so</i> drafty.

345
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,033
They must be catching cold
all the time.

346
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,101
Will you quit stalling.
We're gonna miss the train.

347
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,492
I feel naked.
I feel like everybody's staring at me.

348
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,043
With those legs? Are you crazy?
Now, come on.

349
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,215
Uh-oh.

350
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,761
It's no use.
We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.

351
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,390
The name is Josephine,
and this was your idea in the first place.

352
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,664
Look at that.

353
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,291
Look how she moves.

354
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,964
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

355
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,384
Must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

356
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,845
I tell you, it's a whole different sex!

357
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,719
What are you afraid of?
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

358
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,913
This is just to get us out of town. Once we
get to Florida, we'll blow this whole setup.

359
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,457
This time I am not gonna let you
talk me into something that...

360
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,850
Extra! Extra! Seven slaughtered
in north side garage!

361
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,401
Feared bloody aftermath!
Extra! Extra!

362
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,480
You talked me into it.
Let's go, Josephine.

363
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,314
Attagirl, Geraldine.

364
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,985
- Rosella?
- Fiddle.

365
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,036
- Move along, Dolores, will ya.
- Trombone.

366
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,863
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

367
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,667
Uh, well, here we are.

368
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,666
Are you two
from the Poliakoff Agency?

369
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,817
- Yes, we're the new girls.
- Brand-new.

370
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,629
- This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock.
- How do you do?

371
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,585
And I'm Sweet Sue.

372
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,217
My name is Josephine.

373
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,094
- I'm Daphne.
- Hmm?

374
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,139
Saxophone, bass.
Am I glad to see you girls.

375
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,313
- You saved our lives.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

376
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,849
Where did you girls play before?

377
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,402
Here, there and around and, uh...

378
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,981
We spent three years at
the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

379
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,613
- Hmm?
- All aboard!

380
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,989
You're in berths 7 and 7-A.

381
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,321
7 and 7-A.

382
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,155
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

383
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,786
Oh, the feeling's mutual.

384
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,170
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

385
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,836
Looks like Poliakoff came through
with a couple of real ladies.

386
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,126
You better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

387
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,144
Daphne?

388
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,521
Well, I never did like the name Geraldine.

389
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,280
Hi!

390
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,282
I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

391
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,704
- Hi!
- Hi!

392
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,283
- My name is Josephine. Sax.
- Hi!

393
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,097
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- Oh, thank you!

394
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,128
You'll be sorry!

395
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,628
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, well, I don't wear one myself.

396
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,256
- Don't you bulge?
- Huh? Bulge? Me?

397
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,088
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

398
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,799
- Well, my dear, she is so inexpensive.
- Come on, Daphne.

399
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,429
Oh, all right.

400
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,762
Say, kids, have you heard the one
about the girl tuba player

401
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,564
who was stranded on a desert island
with a one-legged jockey?

402
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,687
- No. How's it go?
- Cut it out, girls.

403
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,689
None of that rough talk.

404
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,941
They went to a conservatory.

405
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,240
"They went to a conservatory."

406
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,571
How about that talent, huh?

407
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,951
It's like fallin' into a tub of butter.

408
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,374
Watch it, Daphne.

409
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,372
When I was a kid, Joe,
I used to have a dream

410
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:37,581
where I was locked up overnight in a pastry shop,
and there was goodies all around.

411
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,791
There was jelly rolls and mocha éclairs

412
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,423
and sponge cake and Boston cream pie
and cherry tarts...

413
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,781
- Look, stupe. Listen to me.
- Huh?

414
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,138
No butter, no pastry. We're on a diet.

415
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,012
Oh, yeah. Well, sure, Joe.

416
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,644
Not there!
That's the emergency brake.

417
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,356
Now you've done it.
Now you have done it.

418
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,310
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

419
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,272
- Well, you better go get it fixed.
- Well, you better come help me.

420
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,957
This way, Daphne.

421
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,035
Now you tore the other one.

422
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,340
We're terribly sorry.

423
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,926
It's okay.
I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

424
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,603
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

425
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,309
Well, if they catch me once more,
they're gonna kick me out of the band.

426
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,274
You the replacement for the bass and sax?

427
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,105
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

428
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,486
Uh, this is, uh, uh, Jo... sephine.

429
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,533
Come here. Come here.

430
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,612
- I'm Sugar Cane.
- Hi.

431
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,288
- Sugar Cane?
- Yeah. I changed it.

432
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,661
- It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
- Polish?

433
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,585
Yes. I come from this musical family.

434
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,209
My mother is a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

435
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,463
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

436
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,133
Oh.

437
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,925
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.

438
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,552
Sings too!

439
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,931
Well, I don't have much of a voice,
but then this isn't much of a band either.

440
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,933
I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

441
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:20,063
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

442
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,690
- Here. You want some? It's bourbon.
- Oh.

443
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,317
I'll take a rain check.

444
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,669
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop anytime I want to.

445
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,829
Only I don't want to.
Especially when I'm blue.

446
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,826
- We understand.
- All the girls drink.

447
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,159
It's just that I'm the one that gets caught.
Story of my life.

448
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,246
I always get the fuzzy end
of the lollipop.

449
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,877
Are my seams straight?

450
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,428
I'll say.

451
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,180
- Well, see you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

452
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,353
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

453
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,555
- Down, Daphne.
- Whew!

454
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,560
How about the shape
of that liquor cabinet, huh?

455
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,393
Forget it. One false move,
and they'll toss us off the train.

456
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,571
Then there'll be the police, the papers,
and the mob in Chicago.

457
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,945
Mmm, boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

458
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,822
Look.

459
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,451
No pastry, no butter, and no Sugar.

460
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,623
Well, you tore 'em again.

461
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,656
Hey, Sheboygan! You too.

462
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,992
What was your last job,
playing square dances?

463
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,998
No. Funerals.

464
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,877
Well, would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

465
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,583
We'll try.

466
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,089
How did those holes get there?

467
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,216
Uh, those?

468
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,849
I don't know.

469
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,016
Mice?

470
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,665
All right, girls.
Let's take it from the top.

471
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,681
And put a little heat under it!

472
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,771
Yeah!

473
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,659

Bienstock!

490
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,792
Yes, Sue. What is it?

491
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,721
I thought I made it perfectly clear
that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

492
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,187
All right, girls.
Who does this belong to?

493
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,889
Come on now. Speak up.

494
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,191
Sugar, I warned you.

495
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,237
- Please, Mr. Bienstock.
- This is the last straw.

496
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,737
In Kansas City you were smuggling liquor
in a shampoo bottle.

497
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,801
Before that, I caught you
with a pint in your ukulele.

498
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,845
Excuse me. Mr. Bienstock,
could I have my flask, please?

499
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,952
- Sure.
- Pack your things. The next station we c...

500
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,075
- Your flask?
- Yes. Just a little bourbon.

501
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,248
Must've slipped through.

502
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,371
Give me that.

503
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,374
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

504
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,296
Oh, yes. For a whole year.

505
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,591
I thought you said three years.

506
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,885
We got time off for good behavior.

507
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,844
There are two things that I will not
put up with during working hours.

508
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,641
One is liquor,
and the other one is men.

509
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,059
Men?

510
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,057
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

511
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,389
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

512
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,601
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

513
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,938
And they... they all just want
one thing from a girl.

514
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,569
I beg your pardon, miss.

515
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,114
All right, girls.
From the top again.

516
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,034
- Hortense, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

517
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,908
- Maude, sweet dreams and pleasant thoughts.
- Good night, Daphne.

518
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,785
- Good night, Gloria.
- Good night, Daphne.

519
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,288
- Dolores, dear, you sleep tight.
- You hear?

520
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,044
Nighty-night, Emily.

521
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,871
Toodle-oo.

522
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,964
How about that "toodle-oo"?

523
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,511
Steady, boy.

524
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,093
Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

525
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,161
- I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
- You're a girl. You're a girl.

526
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,302
I'm a girl. I-I'm a girl.

527
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,221
I'm a girl. I'm a...

528
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,520
Hi.

529
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,773
Get a load of that rhythm section.

530
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,607
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

531
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,986
I'm a girl.

532
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,568
I'm a girl.

533
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,867
Good night, Sugar!

534
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,206
Good night, honey.

535
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,131
"Honey." Hey, she called me "honey."

536
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,584
Ooh, honey.

537
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,010
Hey, what are you doin'?

538
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,304
I just wanna make sure
that Honey stays in her hive.

539
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,007
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

540
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,014
Supposin' I got to go.
Like, for a drink of water or somethin'.

541
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,220
Fight it.

542
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,477
Well, suppose I lose.
Suppose it's an emergency.

543
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,728
Pull the emergency brake.

544
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,857
Hey, Bienstock.

545
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,030
There's somethin' funny
about those new girls.

546
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,357
Funny? In what way?

547
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,113
Well, I don't know,
but I can feel it right here.

548
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,867
That's one thing about an ulcer. It's like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

549
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,870
All right, Sue. You watch your ulcers.
I'll watch those two.

550
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,294
Okay. Everybody settle down
and go to bed. Good night, girls.

551
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,754
Good night, Daphne.

552
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,207
Good night, Josephine.

553
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,391
I'm a girl.

554
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,718
I'm a girl.

555
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,303
I wish I were dead.

556
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,389
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

557
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,690
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

558
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,769
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

559
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,359
Daphne.

560
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,196
Daphne.

561
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,830
Sugar!

562
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,457
I wanted to thank you
for covering up for me.

563
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,750
You're a real pal.

564
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,833
Oh, it's nothing.

565
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,462
I, uh... I-I just thought
that us girls should stick together.

566
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,385
If it wasn't for you,
they would have kicked me off the train.

567
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,839
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

568
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,884
Oh! It's freezing outside!

569
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,266
I mean, when I think about
you and your poor ukulele...

570
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,894
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

571
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,145
I can think of a million things.

572
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,280
- That's one of 'em.
- Shh.

573
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,323
- Huh?
- Sweet Sue.

574
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,409
Mm-hmm.

575
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,251
I don't want her to know
we're in cahoots.

576
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,253
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.

577
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,255
Not even Josephine.

578
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,962
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

579
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,594
You stay here as long as you like.

580
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,845
I'm not crowding you, am I?

581
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,057
No. It's nice and cozy.

582
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,858
When I was a little girl,
on cold nights like this,

583
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,937
I used to crawl into bed with my sister.

584
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,148
We'd cuddle up under the covers
and pretend we were lost in a dark cave

585
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,154
and were trying to find our way out.

586
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,531
That's very interesting.

587
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,869
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, no.

588
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,325
Not a thing.

589
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,496
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

590
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,206
That's ridiculous.

591
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,171
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

592
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,927
You've got cold feet.

593
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,223
- Isn't that ridiculous?
- Here. Let me warm them up a little.

594
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,308
There.

595
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,426
- Isn't that better?
- Yes.

596
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,399
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

597
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,471
- What'd you say?
- I'm a very sick girl.

598
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,477
Oh, I'd better go
before I catch something.

599
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,854
- I'm not that sick.
- I've got very low resistance.

600
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,814
Sugar, if you feel that you're
coming down with something, my dear,

601
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,992
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

602
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,034
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

603
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,613
Don't move. Shh.

604
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,290
- Hold on.
- Okay.

605
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,481
Up. Up. Now.

606
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,029
Are you all right?

607
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,448
- I'm fine.
- How's the bottle?

608
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,734
Half full.

609
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,738
- You better get some cups.
- Cups?

610
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:12,297
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

611
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,800
You better put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

612
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,553
No lights. We don't want them
to know we're having a party.

613
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,010
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

614
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:24,347
Spills, thrills, laughs, and games.

615
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,853
This may even turn out to be
a surprise party.

616
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,560
- What's the surprise?
- Uh-huh. Not yet.

617
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,522
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

618
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,198
- That'll put hair on your chest.
- No fair guessing.

619
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,839
This a private clambake,
or can anybody join?

620
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,871
Yes, it's private.
Please, go away.

621
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,325
Dolores, do you still have
that bottle of vermouth?

622
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,160
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

623
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,587
We've got bourbon.
We could make manhattans.

624
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,586
- Okay.
- Manhattans? At this time of night?

625
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,293
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar!

626
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,470
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

627
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,511
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in Upper 7.

628
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,513
A party?
I'll get some cheese and crackers.

629
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,890
- I'll get a cocktail shaker, you get a corkscrew.
- Okay.

630
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,223
- Hey, Rosella, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Yeah?

631
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,228
- You got a corkscrew?
- No. But Stella has.

632
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,401
- Well, go get some paper cups.
- Okay.

633
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,901
- Hey, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Party in Upper 7.

634
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,234
Party in Upper 7!

635
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,575
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

636
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,533
I brought some cheese and crackers
in case anybody gets hungry.

637
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,538
- What is this?
- Will ten cups be enough?

638
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,371
A party for two! Two!
Ten cups? What is...

639
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,629
Please, girls. Please stop this.

640
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,335
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?
- Southern Com... Shh!

641
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,013
Girls, you're gonna wake up
the neighbors downstairs... Josephine.

642
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,261
Watch that corkscrew!

643
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,809
- Here's a cracker.
- Will you... No crackers in bed!

644
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,310
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

645
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,140
Here's the cocktail shaker.

646
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,770
I wish we had some ice.

647
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,898
Hey, easy on the vermouth.

648
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,605
Thirteen girls in a berth. It's bad luck.

649
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,261
- Twelve of you will have to get out.
- Pass me the peanut butter.

650
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,698
- Anyone for salami?
- Mmm!

651
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,155
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

652
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,665
- Hey.
- Hmm?

653
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,080
- Have you got any maraschino cherries on you?
- Mmm?

654
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,661
Oh, never mind.

655
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,507
Maraschino cherries?

656
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,514
What's going on here?

657
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,065
Daphne.

658
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,268
Daphne, where are you? Daphne!

659
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,695
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.

660
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,068
Come on, girls. Break it up.

661
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,491
All right, you heard Josephine.

662
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,240
Girls. Everybody out.
Everybody out!

663
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,036
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm just going to get some ice.

664
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,118
Get out! Get out!

665
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,999
That's right, Sugar.
All right, now the rest of you. Out.

666
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,625
- Aw, don't be a flat tire.
- Shh!

667
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,332
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a manhattan.

668
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:01,090
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar, don't leave me here alone.

669
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,762
Come on, please.
Give up, will ya.

670
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,717
It's two o'clock.
You've had your fun. The party's over.

671
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,802
Everybody go home.

672
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,013
- What's this?
- Josephine. Over here, before it melts.

673
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,520
Sugar!

674
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,273
Put it here.

675
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,779
Sugar, you're gonna get yourself
into a lot of trouble.

676
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,328
- Yeah. You better keep a lookout.
- If Bienstock catches you again...

677
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,323
What's the matter with you anyway?

678
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,454
I'm not very bright, I guess.

679
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,785
I wouldn't say that.

680
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,791
- Careless, maybe.
- No, just dumb.

681
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:38,875
If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on
this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.

682
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,800
Well, why'd you take this job?

683
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,675
I use to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it anymore.

684
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,427
Have you ever been with a male band?

685
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,510
- Who? Me?
- That's what I'm running away from.

686
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:53,314
I worked with six different ones
in the last two years. Oh, brother.

687
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,186
- Rough?
- I'll say.

688
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:58,485
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

689
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,154
I have this thing about saxophone players.

690
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,482
Especially tenor sax.

691
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,783
Really?

692
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,704
I don't know what it is,
but they just curdle me.

693
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,203
All they have to do is play eight bars
of "Come to Me, My Melancholy Baby"

694
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,875
and my spine turns to custard.

695
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,374
I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

696
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,626
- That so?
- Every time.

697
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,585
You know, I play tenor sax.

698
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,421
- But you're a girl, thank goodness.
- Oh. Yeah.

699
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,597
That's why I joined this band.
Safety first.

700
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,050
Anything to get away from those bums.

701
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,260
Yeah.

702
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,674
You don't know what they're like.

703
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,346
You fall for 'em, you really love 'em.

704
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,774
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the <i>Graf Zeppelin.</i>

705
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,147
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

706
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,946
they're spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

707
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,648
You don't say.

708
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,281
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the saxophone's gone.

709
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:53,207
All that's left behind is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.

710
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,033
So you pull yourself together,

711
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,915
you go on to the next job,
the next saxophone player.

712
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,167
It's the same thing all over again.

713
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,999
You see what I mean?

714
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,085
Not very bright.

715
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,386
Brains aren't everything.

716
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:10,557
I can tell you one thing.
It's not gonna happen to me again, ever.

717
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,761
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

718
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,892
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

719
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,605
- How about a couple of drinks for us? Hmm?
- Sure.

720
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,189
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

721
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,117
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

722
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,194
- About what?
- About the future.

723
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,497
You know, like a husband.
That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

724
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,996
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

725
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,453
They all go south for the winter,
like birds.

726
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,459
Oh, you're gonna catch yourself
a rich bird?

727
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,292
I don't care how rich he is
as long as he has a yacht,

728
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,219
his own private railroad car
and his own toothpaste.

729
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,718
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

730
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,306
With money like Rockefeller
and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller.

731
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,388
- Oh, I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

732
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,350
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

733
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,185
Haven't you ever noticed it?

734
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,756
Now that you've mentioned it, mm-hmm.

735
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,692
They get those weak eyes from reading.

736
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:11,277
You know, those long, tiny little columns
in <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

737
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,739
That bass fiddle,
she sure knows how to throw a party.

738
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,620
Hot diggetty dog!

739
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,664
Well, happy days!

740
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,549
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

741
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,672
So the one-legged jockey said...

742
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,382
What did he say?

743
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:37,140
So the one-legged jockey said,
"Don't worry about me, baby.

744
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,970
I ride side-saddle."

745
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,562
Oh! Shh.

746
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,442
Terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

747
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,444
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

748
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,196
I think... I told you...

749
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,949
Oh! You dropped it! Oh, it's cold!

750
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,747
- Oh, no, please. Oh, don't do that!
- She's ticklish!

751
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,312
Don't! Oh, please, no! Not the chest!

752
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:06,715
Help! Help! Josephine!

753
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,464
Please stop that! Stop that!

754
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,260
Stop that!

755
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,023
- What's happened?
- Search me.

756
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,726
Uh, I mean... I mean, I'll see.

757
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,158
All right, what's goin' on around here?

758
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,865
Bienstock!

759
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,914

769
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,836
Sugar? Here.

770
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,464
- I'll carry the instruments.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.

771
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,422
Oh, thank you, Daphne.
Isn't she a sweetheart?

772
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,432
Good morning.

773
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,229
How do you do?

774
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,893
Zowie!

775
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,398
Well, there they are.

776
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,606
More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

777
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,656
I'll bet there isn't one under 75.

778
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,663
Seventy-five.
That's three-quarters of a century.

779
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,156
Makes a girl think.

780
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,158
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

781
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,615
Yes. Mm-hmm.

782
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,167
Oh, pardon me, miss.

783
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,255
- May I?
- Help yourself.

784
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,349
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

785
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,552
I'm Cinderella the second.

786
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,390
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

787
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,232
Me too. Bye-bye.

788
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,730
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

789
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,985
Aren't you a sweetheart?

790
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,619
Certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

791
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,950
Oh. Well, personally, I'm type "O."

792
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,536
You know, I've always been
fascinated by show business.

793
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,417
- Is that so?
- Yes.

794
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,545
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

795
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,967
Oh, you invest in shows?

796
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,715
Showgirls.

797
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,421
I've been married seven or eight times.

798
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,599
- You're not sure?
- Mama is keeping score.

799
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,597
Frankly, she's getting
rather annoyed with me.

800
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,973
I wouldn't wonder.

801
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,146
So, this year, when
the <i>George White Scandals</i> opened,

802
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,564
she packed me off to Florida.

803
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,393
Right now, she thinks I'm out there
on my yacht...

804
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,443
deep-sea fishing.

805
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,610
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding.

806
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,692
You're barking up the wrong fish.

807
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:24,200
Well, if I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner tonight?

808
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,156
I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.

809
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,582
Oh, of course.

810
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,081
- Which of these instruments do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

811
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,005
Fascinating.
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

812
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,292
Most of the time I slap it.

813
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,342
- You must be quite a girl.
- Wanna bet?

814
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,762
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.

815
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,764
- You know, a sort of a contortionist.
- Mmm.

816
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,517
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

817
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,689
Zowie!

818
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,188
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

819
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,270
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

820
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,906
Bye-bye, Mr. Fielding.

821
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,904
- Bye-bye?
- This is where I get off.

822
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,860
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

823
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,071
You don't get off that easy.

824
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,748
All right, driver.
Once around the park. Slowly.

825
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,826
And keep your eyes on the road.

826
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,546
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr. Fielding?

827
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,386
Oh, oh, please. Please.

828
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,184
- It won't happen again.
- I'll say!

829
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,637
- Please come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

830
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,438
Oh, please, miss, I...

831
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,352
Zowie!

832
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,733
All right, girls.
Here are your room assignments.

833
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,983
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

834
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,201
- Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.
- Excuse me.

835
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,142
And Mary Lou, will you keep your kimono buttoned
when you ring for room service.

836
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,165
Well!

837
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,250
- Josephine and Daphne are in 413.
- Thank you.

838
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,374
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

839
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,002
Well, what did you expect,
a one-legged jockey?

840
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,550
Rosella and Emily in 415.
Stella and...

841
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,219
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

842
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,639
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

843
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,976
414.

844
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,475
That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

845
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,897
my last time around with a male band.

846
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,690
What a heel he was.

847
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,484
- Saxophone player?
- What else?

848
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,357
Was I ever crazy about him.

849
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,611
2:00 in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

850
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,364
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

851
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,365
So he threw it right in my face.

852
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,412
Forget it, Sugar.
Forget saxophone players.

853
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:33,037
You're gonna meet a millionaire.
A young one.

854
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,291
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

855
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,255
- Oh, are these your bags?
- Mm-hmm.

856
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,093
- And that one too.
- Okay, doll.

857
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,308
I suppose you want a tip?

858
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,641
Ah, forget it, doll.
After all, you work here, and I work here.

859
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,103
And believe you me, it's nice to
have you with the organization.

860
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,108
- Bye-bye.
- Uh, listen, doll.

861
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,360
What time do you get off tonight?

862
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,487
Why?

863
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,497
Well, I'm workin' the night shift,
and I got a bottle of gin stashed away,

864
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,991
and when there's a lull...

865
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,539
Don't you think
you're a little young for that, sonny?

866
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,993
Oh, you wanna see
my, uh, driver's license?

867
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,496
Get lost, will ya.

868
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,674
That's the way I like 'em...
big and sassy.

869
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,089
Oh, and, uh, get rid of your roommate.

870
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,441
- Dirty old man!
- What happened?

871
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,442
I just got pinched in the elevator.

872
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,386
- Well, now you know how the other half lives.
- Look at that! I'm not even pretty.

873
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,618
They don't care,
just so long as you're wearing a skirt.

874
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,100
- It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.
- Really? Well, I'm sick of being the flag.

875
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,061
I want to be a bull again. What do you say?
Let's get outta here. Let's blow.

876
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,084
Blow where?

877
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,329
You promised me, Joe, that the minute
we hit Florida, we were gonna beat it.

878
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,588
- How can we? We're broke.
- We could find another band. A male band.

879
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,636
Look, stupid, right now
Spats Colombo and his chums

880
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,802
are looking for us
in every male band in the country.

881
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,037
- It's so humiliating, the whole...
- So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?

882
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,039
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

883
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,056
All right, all right. But how long
do you think we can keep this up?

884
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,481
What's the beef?

885
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,774
- We're sittin' pretty.
- Huh?

886
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,398
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week.

887
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,902
Look.
Look at the palm trees, the flying fish.

888
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,108
What are you giving me
with the flying fish?

889
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,785
I know why you want to stay here.
You're after Sugar.

890
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,112
Me? After Sugar?

891
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:38,075
I saw the both of you on that bus,
all lovey-dovey and whispering and giggling

892
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,955
and borrowing each other's lipstick!

893
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,412
- What are you talking about? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

894
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,122
We're just like sisters.

895
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:48,381
Well, I'm your fairy godmother,
and I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

896
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,588
Are you decent?

897
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,144
Come in.

898
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,432
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

899
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,813
- A what?
- My suitcase with all my resort clothes.

900
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,441
- No, we haven't.
- Can't understand it.

901
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,239
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

902
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,191
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

903
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,152
There must be a sneak thief
around here.

904
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,909
Oh! Here it is. Hi, Sug.

905
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,394
A bunch of us girls are gonna go for a swim.
You want to come along?

906
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,081
- A swim? Oh, you betcha.
- Just a minute, Daphne.

907
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,584
- You haven't got a bathing suit.
- She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.

908
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,586
Ah! See?
She doesn't have one either.

909
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,596
- You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

910
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,465
- How about you, Josephine?
- No, thanks.

911
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,467
I think I'll stay in
and soak in a hot tub.

912
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,470
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak.

913
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,846
Come on.

914
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,552
Don't get burned, Daphne.

915
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,638
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.
- Well, see?

916
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,850
She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
and we'll rub it on each other.

917
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,434
Bye-bye.

Daphne, cut it out!

925
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:54,552
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

926
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,348
Whoo, look out!
Here comes a big one!

927
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,299
Whee!

928
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,252
Daphne, I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

929
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,176
Oh, Sugar, you should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

930
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,924
I mean, your shoulders
and your arms.

931
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,848
Oh, well, that's from carrying
that bull fiddle around all day.

932
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,300
- Oh, there's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

933
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,010
You're so flat-chested.

934
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,979
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

935
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,227
Watch out, Daphne!

936
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,360
- Sugar, come on! Let's play ball!
- Okay!

937
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,239
- Let's go, Junior. Time for your nap.
- No. I wanna play.

938
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,360
You heard your mother, Junior.
Scram.

939
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,242
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us. Get outta here.

940
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,664
Mommy! Mommy!

941
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,208
Now, here we go.

942
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,253
I like coffee, I like tea!

943
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:14,423
How many boys are stuck on me?

944
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,627
One! Two! Three!

945
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,134
Four! Five! Six!

946
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,833
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- My fault.

947
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,334
- You're not hurt, are you?
- I don't think so.

948
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,315
- I wish you'd make sure.
- Why?

949
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,359
Because usually
when people find out who I am,

950
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,483
they get themselves a wheelchair,
a shyster lawyer,

951
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,940
and sue me for
three-quarters of a million dollars.

952
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,076
Don't worry. I won't sue you,
no matter who you are.

953
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,369
Thank you.

954
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,705
Who are you?

955
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,033
Now, really!

956
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,457
Sugar!

957
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,712
Come on!

958
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,085
Honestly.

959
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,633
Cheerio.

960
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:06,218
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

961
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,428
- You staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

962
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,896
Your face is familiar.

963
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,315
Possible you've seen it
in the newspapers or magazines.

964
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,017
Um, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

965
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,944
That must be it.

966
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,398
Would you mind moving just a little, please?
You're blocking my view.

967
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:21,733
Your view? Of what?

968
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,286
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht
when it's time for cocktails.

969
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,697
You own a yacht?

970
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,956
Which one is it?

971
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,410
- The big one?
- Certainly not.

972
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,995
With all the unrest in the world,

973
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,729
I don't think anybody should have
a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

974
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,674
I quite agree.

975
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,969
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

976
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,092
- Your wife?
- No. My flag steward.

977
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,471
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

978
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,303
No, my cocktail steward.

979
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,980
Look, if you're interested
in whether I am married or not...

980
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,728
Oh, I'm not interested at all.

981
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,899
Well, I'm not.

982
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,186
That's very interesting.

983
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,658
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

984
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,557
I'll bet, while we were talking,
you made, like, a hundred thousand dollars?

985
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,664
Could be. Uh, you play the market?

986
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,832
No. The ukulele. And I sing too.

987
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,250
For your own amusement?

988
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:17,171
A bunch of us girls are appearing at the hotel.
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

989
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,964
Oh, you're society girls.

990
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,043
Oh, yes. Quite.
You know, Bryn Mawr, Vassar.

991
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,254
We're just doing this for a lark.

992
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,633
Syncopators.

993
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:29,013
Does that mean you play
that very fast music... uh, jazz?

994
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,810
Yeah! Real hot.

995
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,516
Oh, well, I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

996
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,233
Oh, I do too. As a matter of fact,

997
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,609
I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

998
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,194
Good school.

999
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,526
And your family
doesn't object to your career?

1000
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,829
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

1001
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,907
But I don't care.
It was such a bore, you know.

1002
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,037
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

1003
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,494
- Opening of the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

1004
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,501
And always the same Four Hundred.

1005
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,550
You know, it's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

1006
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,595
I'm sure I would have remembered
anybody as attractive as you are.

1007
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,796
- You're very kind.
- Hmm.

1008
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,633
I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless.

1009
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,137
I beg your pardon.

1010
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,641
You see, I have this theory
about men who wear glasses.

1011
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,814
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I get to know you better.

1012
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,607
What are you doing tonight?

1013
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,979
Uh, tonight?

1014
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,483
I thought maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

1015
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,440
Uh, I would like to,
but that would be rather difficult.

1016
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,533
Why?

1017
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:29,031
I only come ashore twice a day,
when the tide goes out.

1018
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,362
- Oh.
- It's on account of these shells.

1019
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,947
That's my hobby.

1020
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,282
- You collect shells?
- Yes.

1021
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:38,416
So did my father and my grandfather.
You might say we had a passion for shells.

1022
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,997
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

1023
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,878
Shell Oil?

1024
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,835
Please, no names.

1025
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,340
Just call me Junior.

1026
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,969
Sugar! Sugar! Come on, dear.
It's time to change for dinner.

1027
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,221
Run along, Daphne, dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

1028
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,802
Oh. Okay.

1029
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,193
- No!
- What is it, young lady?

1030
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,651
What are you staring at?
This happens to me all the time in public.

1031
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,236
I recognized him too.
His picture was in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

1032
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,118
<i>- Vanity Fair</i>?
- Would you mind moving along, please?

1033
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,497
Yes, you're in his way.
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

1034
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,461
His yacht?

1035
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,669
It sleeps 12.
This is my friend, Daphne.

1036
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,296
- She's a Vassar girl.
- I'm a what?

1037
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,298
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

1038
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:33,891
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

1039
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,684
She squealed on her roommate,

1040
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,137
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

1041
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:43,564
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate, hmm?

1042
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,145
Well, I think I better be going.

1043
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,697
It was delightful meeting you both.

1044
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,696
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

1045
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,403
Oh, do come. Don't disappoint us.
It'll be such fun.

1046
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,205
- And bring your yacht!
- Come on, Daphne.

1047
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,042
How about that guy?

1048
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,716
Now look, Daphne.
Hands off. I saw him first.

1049
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,488
Sugar, let me give you a little advice, dear.

1050
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,971
If I were a girl, and I am,
I'd watch my step.

1051
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,596
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

1052
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,517
I can't wait to tell Josephine.

1053
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,766
Yeah. Josephine.

1054
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,473
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

1055
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,150
Neither can I! Let's run up
to the room and tell her right now.

1056
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,853
- Oh, we don't have to run.
- Oh, yes, we do.

1057
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,366
Josephine! Yoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

1058
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,202
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny? Josie!

1059
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,252
I can't imagine where she'd be.

1060
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,296
- Well, I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

1061
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,591
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

1062
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,043
Believe it or not,
Josephine predicted the whole thing.

1063
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,129
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.

1064
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,931
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping! That's it.

1065
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,306
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

- Have a good time, girls?
- Oh, Josephine.

1076
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,798
- The most wonderful thing happened.
- What?

1077
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,342
- Guess.
- They repealed Prohibition?

1078
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,467
Oh, come now. You can do better than that.

1079
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,345
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

1080
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:42,349
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
he's got glasses, he's got a yacht.

1081
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,646
You don't say.

1082
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,144
He's not only got a yacht,
he's got a bicycle.

1083
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,021
Daphne.

1084
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,478
Go on, tell me all about him.

1085
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,610
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

1086
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,657
He's a real gentleman.

1087
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,326
You know, not one of these grabbers.

1088
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,996
Maybe you better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

1089
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,870
Well, I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute.

1090
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,874
- He collects shells.
- Shells? Hmm. Whatever for?

1091
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,048
Oh, you know. The old shell game.

1092
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,000
Daphne, you're bothering us.

1093
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,552
- Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
- I am?

1094
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,176
He said he's gonna come to hear us play,
maybe.

1095
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,509
What do you mean, maybe?
I saw the way he looked at you.

1096
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,061
- He'll be there for sure.
- I hope so.

1097
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:28,187
What do you think, Josephine?
What does it say in your crystal ball?

1098
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:31,064
Sugar! Hey, is Sugar in here?

1099
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,146
- Yes.
- Sugar, have you got the key?

1100
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,198
I'm locked out,
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

1101
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,571
See you on the bandstand, girls.

1102
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,958
What are you trying to do to that poor girl?
Puttin' on a millionaire act.

1103
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:50,288
And where did you get that phony accent?
Nobody talks like that.

1104
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,498
Oh, I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

1105
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,006
This is, without doubt,
the trickiest, lowest, and meanest...

1106
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,015
I'm not afraid of you.

1107
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,518
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

1108
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,897
Now, Joe, you're gonna get hurt
because when I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

1109
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,696
Why, Joe! Don't look at me like that,
when it was all a joke.

1110
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,648
When I didn't mean any harm.

1111
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,970
Well, I'm gonna press the suit myself.

1112
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,408
Telephone! Answer the tele... phone.

1113
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,501
Hello. Hello.

1114
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,462
Yes, this is 413.

1115
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,500
Ship-to-shore? All right, I'll take it.

1116
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,177
Hello, Daphne.
It's that naughty boy again.

1117
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,631
You know, Osgood. In the elevator?

1118
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,932
You slapped my face.

1119
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,470
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

1120
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,932
Daphne can't talk right now.
Is it anything urgent?

1121
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,438
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

1122
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:58,148
Tell her I'd like her to have a little supper
with me on my yacht, after the show tonight.

1123
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:01,655
Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show.
I'll tell her.

1124
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,452
- Your yacht?
<i>- The New Caledonia.</i>

1125
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,746
That's the name of it.

1126
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:10,167
<i>The Old Caledonia</i> went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

1127
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,792
But tell her not to worry.
This will be a quiet little midnight snack.

1128
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,544
Just the two of us.

1129
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:20,298
Just the two of you? What about the crew?

1130
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:23,881
Oh, that's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

1131
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,929
We'll have a little cold pheasant
and champagne.

1132
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,540
And I've checked with the Coast Guard.

1133
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:31,097
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

1134
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,810
Oh, and tell her I've got a new batch
of Rudy Vallee records.

1135
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:41,198
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

1136
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,116
Pushover for who?
Why... Who's on the...

1137
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,159
Shh! Yes, Mr. Fielding.

1138
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,580
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat.

1139
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,157
Good-bye.

1140
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,958
What's that you said?

1141
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,786
Oh. Zowie.

1142
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,293
- I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

1143
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,748
You got it made, kid.

1144
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,487
Fielding wants to have a little cold pheasant
with you on his yacht.

1145
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,379
- He does?
- Just the three of you on that great big boat.

1146
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,715
- You and him and Rudy Vallee.
- Well, fat chance.

1147
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,537
- Call him back and tell him I'm not going.
- Well, of course you're not.

1148
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,052
- Oh.
- I'm going.

1149
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,689
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

1150
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,314
No. I'm going to be on the boat with Sugar.

1151
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,237
- Well, where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

1152
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,814
- With me?
- That's right.

1153
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,867
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

You can both go take a flyin' jump.

so smile.

Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

1173
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:08,045
Why do I let you
talk me into these things? Why?

1174
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,007
Because we're pals, buddies.
The two musketeers.

1175
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,183
Don't give me with the musketeers.

1176
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,010
How am I gonna keep the guy ashore?

1177
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,938
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht.
Uh, play miniature golf with him.

1178
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,517
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

1179
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,533
Hi! Which of you dolls is Daphne?

1180
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,201
Bull fiddle.

1181
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,779
It's from satchel mouth at table seven.

1182
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,541
This is from me to you, doll.

1183
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,838
Beat it, buster.

1184
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,258

Do you suppose he forgot?

1196
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,713
Well, you know how those millionaires are.

1197
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,844
These came for you.

1198
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,425
For me?

1199
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,478

- No!

Yes!

1201

He wants me to have supper with him
on his yacht.

1202
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,315
- He's going to pick me up at the pier.
- No!

1203
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,488
- Yes!
- You heard her. Yes.

1204
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,190
Oh, Josephine, just imagine.

1205
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,368
Me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio,

1206
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,445
on a millionaire's yacht.

1207
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,327
If my mother could only see me now.

1208
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,994
I hope my mother never finds out.

1209
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,750
Well, that's it for tonight, folks.

1210
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,753
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

1211
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,256
reminding all you daddies out there

1212
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,463
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso,

1213
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,049
and I intend to keep it that way.

1214
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,932
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1215
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,442
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

1216
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,823
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

1217
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,016
There's a little roadhouse down the coast.
If we could...

1218
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,248
Well, I'll be.

1219
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,580
- He does have a bicycle.
- Who?

1220
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,882
Hmm? About the roadhouse...

1221
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:17,257
Oh.
They have a Cuban band that's the berries.

1222
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:21,215
Let's go there.
Blindfold the orchestra and tango till dawn.

1223
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,095
You know something, Mr. Fielding?

1224
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,801
- What?
- You're dynamite.

1225
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,430
You're a pretty hot little firecracker
yourself.

1226
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,401
Ahoy there.

1227
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,287
Ahoy!

1228
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,248
Been waiting long?

1229
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,755
It's not how long you wait.
It's who you're waiting for.

1230
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,302
Thank you. And thank you for the flowers.

1231
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,508
I wanted them to fly some orchids
from our greenhouse,

1232
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,512
but unfortunately,
all of Long Island is fogged in.

1233
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,639
It's the thought that counts.

1234
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:49,936
Ah...

1235
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,527
Hmm. I seem to be out of gas.

1236
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:01,197
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everything.

1237
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,570
Mm-hmm. Oops. There.

1238
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,374
Uh... It seems to be stuck
in, uh... in reverse.

1239
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:16,251
Uh, I ju... I just got this motorboat.
It's an experimental model.

1240
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,502
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

1241
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,551
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

1242
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,129
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

1243
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,714
Hmm. Yes.

1244
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,166
It looked so small from the beach,
but when you're on it,

1245
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,586
it's more like a cruiser or a destroyer.

1246
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,380
It's just regulation size.
We have three like this.

1247
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:01,674
- Three?
- Yes. Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

1248
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,969
Daddy's got his in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

1249
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,593
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

1250
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,094
Hmm.

1251
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,222
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

1252
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,553
Well, that depends.

1253
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,558
That depends on whether
you're coming or going.

1254
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:18,062
I mean, normally... normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

1255
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,814
Th... And that's the bridge.

1256
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,318
So that you can get from one side
of the boat to the other.

1257
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,865
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it.

1258
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,442
Which way?

1259
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,662
Oh! You have an upstairs and a downstairs.

1260
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,741
Yes. That's the hurricane cellar.

1261
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:39,287
And another nice thing about this yacht...
lots of closet space.

1262
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:44,296
Now, let me see. Where do you suppose
the steward set it up?

1263
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:48,922
In here!

1264
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,551
Oh, yes, of course. How silly of me.

1265
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,558
On Thursdays,
they always serve me in the small salon.

1266
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,398
It's exquisite.

1267
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,154
Like a floating mansion.

1268
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,531
Well, it's all right for a bachelor.

1269
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,946
What a beautiful fish!

1270
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,906
I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

1271
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,117
What is it?

1272
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,835
It's a member of the herring family.

1273
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,005
A herring?

1274
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:28,546
Isn't it amazing how they get
those big fish into those little glass jars?

1275
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,756
They shrink when they're marinated.

1276
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,966
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

1277
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,803
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1278
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,512
Bon voyage.

1279
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:44,778
- Look at all that silverware!
- Uh, trophies.

1280
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:48,573
You know, skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1281
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,026
- Water polo? Isn't that terribly dangerous?
- I'll say.

1282
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,487
I had two ponies drowned under me.

1283
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,572
- Where's your shell collection?
- Mmm.

1284
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,079
Yes, of course.
Now, where could they have put it?

1285
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,706
You see, on Thursdays,
I'm sort of lost around here.

1286
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,163
- What's on Thursday?
- It's the crew's night off.

1287
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,086
You mean, we're alone on the boat?

1288
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,508
Completely.

1289
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,052
You know, I've never been
completely alone with a man before,

1290
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,472
in the middle of the night,
in the middle of the ocean.

1291
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,175
Oh, it's perfectly safe.
We're well-anchored.

1292
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,010
Ship's in shipshape shape.

1293
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,024
And the Coast Guard promised to call me
if there were any icebergs around.

1294
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,939
It's not the icebergs.

1295
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:25,485
But there are certain men who would try
to take advantage of a situation like this.

1296
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,403
You're flattering me.

1297
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,110
Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1298
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,989
Oh, it's not that.
It's, uh, just that I'm, um, harmless.

1299
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,741
Harmless? How?

1300
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,869
Well, I don't know how to put it,
but I've got this thing about girls.

1301
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,575
What thing?

1302
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,956
They just sort of leave me cold.

1303
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,209
You mean, like frigid?

1304
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,837
Well, it's more like, um, a mental block.

1305
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,634
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1306
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,380
- Have you tried?
- Have I?

1307
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,466
I'm trying all the time.

1308
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,691
See? Nothing.

1309
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,860
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1310
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,778
That makes me feel just awful.

1311
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,401
Oh, my dear, it's not your fault.

1312
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,429
It's just that every now and then,
Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.

1313
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,740
Something goes wrong inside.

1314
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,743
- You mean, you can't fall in love?
- Not anymore.

1315
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,576
I was in love once,
but I would rather not talk about it.

1316
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,535
Would you like a little cold pheasant?

1317
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,121
What happened?

1318
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,379
- I don't want to bore you.
- Oh, you couldn't possibly.

1319
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:34,008
Well, it was my freshman year
at Princeton.

1320
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,215
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1321
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,016
Her father was the vice president
of Hupmobile.

1322
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,095
She wore glasses too.

1323
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,477
That summer we spent our vacation
at the Grand Canyon.

1324
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,354
We were standing on the highest ledge,
watching the sunset,

1325
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,061
when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss.

1326
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:53,694
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1327
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:57,277
I took a step toward her.
She took a step towards me.

1328
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:58,953
Oh, no!

1329
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,405
Yes.

1330
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,583
Eight hours later,
they brought her up by mule.

1331
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,583
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood. Type "O."

1332
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,289
But it was too late.

1333
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,629
Talk about sad.

1334
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,802
Ever since then...

1335
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,507
numb, no feelings,
like my heart was shot full of novocaine.

1336
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,967
You poor, poor boy.

1337
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,974
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1338
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,896
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1339
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:29,935
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1340
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,860
What else is there for me?

1341
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,486
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

1342
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:38,444
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1343
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,780
Got a special tutor to read me all those books
that were banned in Boston.

1344
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,911
Imported a whole troupe
of Balinese dancers.

1345
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:47,620
You know, with those bells on their ankles
and those long fingernails.

1346
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,421
What a waste of money.

1347
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,500
- Have you ever tried American girls?
- Why?

1348
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,092
Was that anything?

1349
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,554
Thanks just the same.

1350
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,398
You should see a doctor, a good doctor.

1351
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,816
I have.

1352
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:13,521
I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1353
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,064
Then there were the Mayo Brothers...

1354
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:19,276
injections, hypnosis, uh, mineral baths.

1355
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,736
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1356
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,407
Don't say that!

1357
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,914
There must be some girl someplace
that could...

1358
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:32,293
If I ever found the girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1359
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,338
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

1360
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:40,263
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1361
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:43,262
but... could I take another crack at it?

1362
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,806
All right. If you insist.

1363
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:02,369
- Anything this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1364
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,075
Terribly sorry.

1365
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,578
Would you like some more champagne?

1366
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,996
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1367
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:18,126
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1368
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,758
I think the light switch is over there.

1369
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,307
That's the radio.

1370
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:32,016
It's like taking someone to a concert
when he's tone deaf.

1371
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,936
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1372
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,810
Don't fight it.

1373
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,984
Relax.

1374
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,208
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1375
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,035
So inhale.

1376
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,567
- Daphne.
- Hmm?

1377
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,021
- You're leading again.
- Sorry.

1378
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,995
Well?

1379
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,965
I'm not quite sure.

1380
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,259
Would you try it again?

1381
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,314
I got a funny sensation in my toes...

1382
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:41,060
like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1383
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,689
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1384
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,872
I think you're on the right track.

1385
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,539
I must be.
Your glasses are beginning to steam up.

1386
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,657
I never knew it could be like this.

1387
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,986
Thank you.

1388
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,619
They told me I was kaput, finished,
all washed up.

1389
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:39,077
And here you are making a chump
out of all those experts.

1390
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,340
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1391
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:47,043
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1392
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,631
I use to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1393
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:04,394
Tomorrow, remind me to send a check
for a hundred thousand dollars

1394
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:06,480
to the Milk Fund.

1395
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,350
<i>¡Olé!</i>

1396
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:13,675
Whoops. Oh.

1397
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,207
Good night.

1398
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:43,626
Good morning.

1399
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,920
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1400
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,498
$850,000.

1401
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,005
Let's make it an even million.

1402
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:14,194
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1403
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,866
<i>- ¡Olé!</i>
- Hi, Jerry.

1404
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:00,070
- Everything under control?
- Have I got things to tell you.

1405
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,864
What happened?

1406
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,699
I'm engaged.

1407
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,785
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1408
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,415
I am.

1409
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,043
What?

1410
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,880
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1411
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:25,102
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1412
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:27,930
You think he's too old for me?

1413
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,562
- Jerry, you can't be serious.
- Why not?

1414
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:34,020
He keeps marrying girls all the time.

1415
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,197
But... But you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1416
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:38,490
And why would a guy want to marry a guy?

1417
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:41,193
Security.

1418
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,658
Jerry, you better lie down.
You're not well.

1419
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,956
Will you stop treating me like a child?
I'm not stupid.

1420
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,329
- I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1421
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,332
His mother. We need her approval.

1422
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,914
But I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1423
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:59,595
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1424
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:02,014
Like, what are you gonna do
on your honeymoon?

1425
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,716
We've been discussing that.

1426
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:07,099
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kind of lean towards Niagara Falls.

1427
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,940
Jerry, you're out of your mind!
How are you gonna get away with this?

1428
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,272
I don't expect it to last, Joe.

1429
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,635
- I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
- Like when?

1430
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,742
- Like, right after the ceremony.
- Oh.

1431
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:25,196
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me,

1432
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:28,783
and I keep gettin'
those alimony checks every month.

1433
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,124
- Je... Jerry.
<i>- ¡Olé!</i>

1434
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,214
- Jerry. Jerry, listen to me. Listen to me.
- What?

1435
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,884
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not being done.

1436
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,589
Shh! Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1437
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:43,682
- Jerry.
- Huh?

1438
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:46,760
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1439
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:49,095
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1440
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,725
You're a boy.

1441
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,649
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1442
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:56,273
Oh, I'm a boy. I'm... I'm a boy.

1443
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:59,275
I'm... I wish I were dead. I'm a boy.

1444
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,448
I'm a boy. Oh, boy, am I a boy.

1445
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,821
Now, what am I gonna do
about my engagement present?

1446
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,620
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1447
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:11,705
- Hey, these are real diamonds.
- Of course they're real.

1448
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,835
What do you think, my fiancé is a bum?
Now I guess I'll have to give it back to him.

1449
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,335
- Wait a minute, Jerry.
- Huh?

1450
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,884
Let's not be hasty. After all, we don't
want to hurt Osgood's feelings, do we?

1451
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,257
Huh?

1452
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:27,842
- Just a minute.
- It's me, Sugar.

1453
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,145
Come in.

1454
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:38,898
I thought I heard voices.

1455
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:42,026
I had to talk to somebody.
I don't feel like going to sleep.

1456
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,824
I know what you need. A slug of bourbon.

1457
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,902
Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1458
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:49,071
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1459
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,326
It was suicidally beautiful.

1460
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,285
- Did he get fresh?
- Of course not.

1461
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,123
As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1462
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,754
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1463
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:03,678
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1464
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:07,222
Candlelight, mint sauce, and cranberries.

1465
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,595
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1466
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,803
I'm going to see him again tonight
and every night.

1467
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:16,015
I think he's going to propose to me,
soon as he gets up his nerve.

1468
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,475
That's some nerve.

1469
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,777
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1470
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,984
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1471
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:24,781
Oh, that's wonderful!

1472
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,076
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1473
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,279
Well, Daphne has a beau. I have a beau.

1474
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,864
If we could only find somebody for you.

1475
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,543
Here I am, doll.

1476
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,268
Hey!

1477
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,237
Friends of Italian opera.

1478
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,156
That's us.

1479
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,234
Register over there.

1480
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:20,746
Spats Colombo.
Delegate from Chicago, south side chapter.

1481
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:23,833
Thanks.

1482
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:25,338
Hiya, Spats.

1483
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,920
We was laying eight-to-one
you wouldn't show.

1484
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,095
Why wouldn't I?

1485
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,925
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1486
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,226
- Well, we all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah.

1487
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,554
You never know who's gonna be next.

1488
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:39,015
Okay, Spats.
Uh, report to the sergeant-at-arms.

1489
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:40,394
What for?

1490
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,647
Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1491
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:50,367
- All right, Spats. Get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1492
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,786
Little Bonaparte
don't want no hardware around.

1493
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:56,123
All right, you're clean.

1494
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:57,700
You're not.

1495
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:09,962
It ain't loaded.

1496
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,059
Next.

1497
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,729
- What's in here?
- My golf clubs.

1498
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:25,903
Putter, niblick, number three iron.

1499
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,481
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1500
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,613
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1501
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,075
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1502
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:41,911
Come on, boys.

1503
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,044
Well, Spats Colombo if I ever saw one.

1504
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,171
Hello, copper.
What brings you down to Florida?

1505
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:50,461
Oh, I heard you opera lovers
were havin' a little rally,

1506
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:53,722
so I thought I'd better be around
in case anybody decided to sing.

1507
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:54,889
Big joke.

1508
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:57,621
Say, maestro, where were you
at three o'clock on Saint Valentine's Day?

1509
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,136
Me? I was at <i>Rigoletto.</i>

1510
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,959
- What's his first name? Where's he live?
- That's an opera, you ignoramus.

1511
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,350
Where did they play it,
in a garage on Clark Street?

1512
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,231
Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1513
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:09,314
Did you ever hear of the DeLuxe
French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?

1514
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,407
Why?

1515
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,678
Because the day after the shooting,
you sent in a pair of spats.

1516
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:15,160
- They had blood on 'em.
- I cut myself while shaving.

1517
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,659
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1518
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,035
Why don't you stop kiddin'?

1519
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,725
You did that vulcanizing job
on Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1520
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,789
You and who else?

1521
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:26,919
Me and those two witnesses your lawyers
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1522
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:29,921
Boys, do you know anything
about any garage or any witnesses?

1523
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:32,719
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1524
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,637
Honest!

1525
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,217
Don't worry, Spats.

1526
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,803
One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1527
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:43,731
That's what you'll have to do. Dig 'em up.

1528
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,988
I feel like such a tramp.

1529
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,616
Takin' jewelry from a man
under false pretenses.

1530
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,867
Get it while you're young.
You better fix your lips.

1531
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:01,677
You want to look nice for Osgood,
don't you?

1532
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,188
It is just gonna break his heart
when he finds out I can't marry him.

1533
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,982
So? It's gonna break Sugar's heart
when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1534
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:09,840
That's life. You can't make an omelet
without breakin' an egg.

1535
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:12,418
- What are you givin' me with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1536
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:16,222
Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet.
You got Osgood, I've got Sugar.

1537
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,139
We're really cookin'.

1538
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,303
- Joe.
- What?

1539
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:28,233
Something tells me
the omelet is about to hit the fan.

1540
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:32,820
- Come on, Daphne.
- Mm-hmm.

1541
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:39,202
- Going up!
- Hold it.

1542
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,212
Three, please.

1543
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:01,888
I don't mean to be forward,

1544
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,142
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meeting you two broads before?

1545
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:08,349
- Oh, no.
- You must be thinking of two other broads.

1546
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,560
You ever been in Chicago?

1547
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:13,942
Us? We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1548
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,311
Third floor.

1549
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,278
What floor are you on, sweetie?

1550
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,576
Never you mind.

1551
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,654
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1552
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:24,160
Well, don't call us. We'll call you.

1553
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,879
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1554
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,216
They're gonna line us up against the wall
and...

1555
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,267
And then the cops
are gonna find two dead dames,

1556
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,039
and they're gonna take us
to the ladies' morgue,

1557
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:48,542
and when they undress us, I tell you, Joe.
I'm gonna die of shame.

1558
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,400
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Joe.

1559
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:53,603
- Not that, you idiot!
- Well, they're from Osgood.

1560
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,733
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1561
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:02,907
I tell you, I will never find another man
who's so good to me.

1562
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,559
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive,
you know what we're gonna do?

1563
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,686
We're gonna sell this bracelet,
and we're gonna take the money,

1564
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,480
and we're gonna grab a boat down
to South America,

1565
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,106
and hide out
in one of the banana republics.

1566
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:14,026
Because I figure that if we eat nothin'
but bananas, we could live there for 50 years.

1567
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,111
Maybe a hundred years.
If we get out of the hotel alive.

1568
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,797
Now, did we forget anything?

1569
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,687
- Yeah, there's the shaving stuff.
- Oh, yeah.

1570
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:22,135
- And there's also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1571
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:24,203
- Give me room 414.
- Now wait a minute. What are you doin'?

1572
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,787
- Makin' a telephone call.
- A telephone...

1573
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:27,177
Who has time for a telephone call?

1574
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,479
We can't just walk out on her
without saying good-bye.

1575
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:32,628
Since when? You usually walk out and
leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.

1576
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:35,645
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1577
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:39,197
Well, mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be up here any minute.

1578
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:42,367
Hello, Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1579
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,160
Ship-to-shore?

1580
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:46,660
Hey, Sugar, it's for you, from the yacht.

1581
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:49,751
Hello?

1582
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:55,205
Hello, my dearest darling.
So good to hear your voice again.

1583
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:56,915
I may throw up!

1584
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:03,639
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1585
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,513
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1586
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,141
I was still on the yacht,
and the anchor broke loose.

1587
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,769
We drifted for days and days.

1588
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,020
You were the captain, and I was the crew.

1589
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,023
I kept a lookout for icebergs.

1590
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,776
I sorted your shells
and mixed your cocktails.

1591
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:22,699
And I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1592
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:26,870
And when I woke up,
I wanted to swim right back to you.

1593
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,699
Yes.

1594
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,000
Now, about our date for tonight. Uh...

1595
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,954
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1596
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,381
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1597
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,253
Not tomorrow either.
You see, I have to leave.

1598
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:46,306
Something unexpected came up.
Uh, I'm sailing right away.

1599
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,597
Where to?

1600
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,679
South America?

1601
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:55,265
Oh. That is unexpected.

1602
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,773
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1603
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,820
I just got a cable from Dad.

1604
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:03,193
The board of directors
have decided on a merger.

1605
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:06,243
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1606
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:10,163
Quite a while.

1607
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,491
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1608
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,205
You're not?

1609
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,377
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1610
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:22,631
It just so happens, the president
of the Venezuelan oil syndicate

1611
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,302
has a daughter, and, uh...

1612
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:27,096
Oh. That kind of merger.

1613
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:29,599
What is she like?

1614
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:32,393
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1615
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,597
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1616
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:38,183
You know, a man in my position has
a certain responsibility to the stockholders.

1617
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:41,236
You know, all those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1618
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,481
Oh, of course. I understand.

1619
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,066
At least I think I do.

1620
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,571
I knew you would.

1621
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:52,123
I only wish there was something
I could... I could do for you.

1622
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,699
But you have.

1623
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:55,830
You've given me all that inside information.

1624
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,720
First thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna call my broker

1625
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:01,248
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1626
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:03,584
Smart move.

1627
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:06,466
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1628
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:08,922
You know,
those orchids from my greenhouse?

1629
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:13,181
The fog finally lifted over Long Island,
and they flew them down this morning.

1630
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:15,227
That's strange.

1631
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,306
I sent them to your room.

1632
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,192
They should have been delivered by now.

1633
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:28,363
Hey, Dolores?
Will you see if there's any flowers outside?

1634
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,626
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1635
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,705
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1636
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,082
What's this?

1637
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:47,085
What's what?

1638
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:49,887
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1639
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:53,391
Real diamonds.

1640
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,844
They must be worth their weight in gold.

1641
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:58,271
Are you always this generous?

1642
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:01,144
Not always.

1643
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:04,399
But I wanted you to know how very grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1644
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:07,822
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

1645
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:13,412
Oh, the navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1646
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:17,116
Well, anchors aweigh
and have a bon voyage.

1647
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:19,201
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1648
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:21,582
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1649
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,164
- Good-bye, my darling.
- Phew.

1650
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,547
I don't know about the captain,
but the navigator's gettin' his tail out of here.

1651
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:30,003
- Yeah. Let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1652
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,266
What happened to my bracelet?

1653
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,389
What do you mean, <i>your</i> bracelet?
It's our bracelet.

1654
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,346
All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1655
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,127
- Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
- Well, what did we do?

1656
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:44,143
Joe, you're not pulling
one of your old tricks!

1657
01:44:44,236 --> 01:44:46,319
No tricks, no mirrors.
Nothing up my sleeve.

1658
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,067
- It's on the level this time.
- You...

1659
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,323
Where's that bourbon?

1660
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,668
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know.

1661
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:08,045
All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

1662
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:11,044
How did you get that bracelet?

1663
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,970
- You like it?
- I always did.

1664
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,844
Junior gave it to me.

1665
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:17,893
He's going to South America
to marry another girl.

1666
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:21,062
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1667
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,732
Sugar, if I were you, I would take that bracelet
and throw it right back in his face.

1668
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:25,855
Daphne.

1669
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:28,107
He's the first nice guy
I ever met in my life.

1670
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:31,531
- The only one that ever gave me anything.
- You'll forget him, Sugar.

1671
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,693
How can I?

1672
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:38,497
No matter where I go, there'll always be
a Shell station on every corner.

1673
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:40,949
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1674
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,412
Are you crazy or somethin'?

1675
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:48,374
The place is crawlin' with mobsters.
Gangrene is settin' in.

1676
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:50,424
And you,
you're makin' like Diamond Jim Brady.

1677
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,719
How are we gonna get out of here?
How are we gonna eat?

1678
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,546
We'll walk.
And if we have to, we'll starve.

1679
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,802
Yeah. There you go with that "we" again.

1680
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,976
Not that way. We don't want
to run into Spats and his chums.

1681
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,553
Where... Oh.

1682
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,396
Your hands clean?

1683
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:14,107
Over. Okay. Button my spats.

1684
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:20,113
You sure dress nice, boss.

1685
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:23,496
Say, boss, I been talking
with some of the other delegates.

1686
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:25,546
And the word is
that Little Bonaparte is real sore

1687
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,871
about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1688
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:30,207
Him and Charlie,
they used to be choirboys together.

1689
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,883
Stop, or I'll bust out cryin'.

1690
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:34,364
He even got Charlie's last toothpick,
the one from the garage.

1691
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:35,629
He had it gold-plated.

1692
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:39,558
Like I was tellin' you, fellas,
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.

1693
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:43,387
Hasn't got it here anymore.
Used to be like a rock.

1694
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,563
Oh, it's too bad.

1695
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,641
I think it's about time he should retire.

1696
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:50,603
- Second the motion.
- How are we gonna retire him?

1697
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:52,562
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1698
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:54,898
One of these days,
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie

1699
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:57,075
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1700
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:03,123
But this time,
we'll make sure there are no witnesses.

1701
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:07,786
Look!

1702
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,167
The two broads from the elevator.

1703
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:14,463
Hey! Join us.

1704
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,721
What's the matter with those dames?

1705
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,799
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1706
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,354
Same faces. Same instruments.

1707
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:33,528
- And here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1708
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:37,574
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here.

1709
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,151
Come on.

1710
01:47:57,513 --> 01:47:59,129
All right. So what do we do now?

1711
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:01,761
First thing we gotta do
is get out of these clothes.

1712
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:12,104
Yoo-hoo.

1713
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:36,027
Huh?

1714
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:41,947
What happened?

1715
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:45,573
Me and Tiny, we had 'em cornered,
but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

1716
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,996
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1717
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:51,450
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- That's all right, boss.

1718
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:54,536
We'll get 'em after the banquet.
They can't be too far away.

1719
01:50:14,566 --> 01:50:16,683
Thank you.

1720
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:18,769
Thank you, fellow opera lovers.

1721
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:24,149
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organization.

1722
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:27,486
And if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1723
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:31,869
Let's look at the record.

1724
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:37,205
In the last fiscal year,
we made $112 million before taxes.

1725
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,831
Only we ain't pay no taxes.

1726
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:46,888
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1727
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:50,809
Uh, let us now rise and observe
one minute of silence

1728
01:50:50,894 --> 01:50:55,685
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, north side chapter,

1729
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:59,142
who are unable to be here with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1730
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:07,863
You too, Spats. Up!

1731
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,459
Easy, now.

1732
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:22,165
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah.

1733
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:23,875
Second time they sing...

1734
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:28,088
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

1735
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:29,673
Okay.

1736
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:36,058
And don't mess up the cake.

1737
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:39,391
I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1738
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:52,620
Now, fellow delegates, there comes a time
in the life of every business executive

1739
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,665
when he starts thinking about retirement.

1740
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:59,836
No! No!

1741
01:51:59,922 --> 01:52:03,632
In lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes,

1742
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:06,585
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1743
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:10,467
For instance,
there's a certain party from Chicago,

1744
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,298
south side chapter.

1745
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:19,431
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats!

1746
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:23,894
But I say, he's a man who'll go far.

1747
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:28,027
Some people say he's gone too far!

1748
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:31,951
But I say, you can't keep a good man down.

1749
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,121
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1750
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:37,950
That big noise he made
on Saint Valentine's Day,

1751
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:41,457
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1752
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:46,132
And lettin' them two witnesses get away,
that sure was careless.

1753
01:52:47,552 --> 01:52:50,590
Don't worry about those two guys.
They're as good as dead.

1754
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:52,764
I almost caught up with them today.

1755
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:57,093
You mean, you let 'em get away twice?

1756
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,271
Some people would say that's real sloppy.

1757
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:04,647
But I say, to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1758
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:07,103
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1759
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:09,735
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday,

1760
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:11,908
so we baked you a little cake.

1761
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:14,610
My birthday?

1762
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:16,571
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1763
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:21,410
So we're a little early.
So what's a few months between friends?

1764
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,711
All right, boys. Now, all together.

1765
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,380

1775
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:08,957
Big joke.

1776
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:18,592
Let's get out of here.

1777
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:23,600
Get those two guys!

1778
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:28,560
Get the light, will you?

1779
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:32,856
What happened here?

1780
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:36,033
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1781
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:40,241
My compliments to the chef.

1782
01:54:40,332 --> 01:54:42,665
Nobody leaves this room
till I get the recipe.

1783
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,038
You want to make a federal case of it?

1784
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:51,423
Yeah.

1785
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,848
- They slipped through our hands.
- Don't worry.

1786
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:24,081
We got our guys watchin' the railroad station,
the roads, and the airport.

1787
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:26,079
- They can't get away.
- Did you hear that?

1788
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:29,458
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts.
Come on. You're gonna call Osgood.

1789
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:31,505
I'm gonna call...
What am I gonna tell him?

1790
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:34,129
- Tell him you're gonna elope with him.
- Elope?

1791
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:36,836
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1792
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,924
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:56,434
No guy is worth it.

1821
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:00,174
What's goin' on?

1822
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:03,157
- Grab her.
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

1823
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:05,656
What are you trying to do here?
What's going on?

1824
01:58:05,745 --> 01:58:07,236
Josephine?

1825
01:58:12,877 --> 01:58:14,709
It's all set.
Osgood's meeting us at the pier.

1826
01:58:14,796 --> 01:58:16,753
We're not on the pier yet.

1827
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,472
Hi.

1828
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,595
My friend Josephine.
Gonna be a bridesmaid.

1829
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,393
- Well, pleased to meet you.
- Come on!

1830
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,312
She's so eager.

1831
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:31,700
Wait! Wait for Sugar!

1832
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:38,998
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl!

1833
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:42,503
- Sugar, what do you think you're doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1834
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,083
Let's go!

1835
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:50,799
You don't want me, Sugar.
I'm a liar and a phony.

1836
01:59:50,892 --> 01:59:52,178
A saxophone player.

1837
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:54,476
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1838
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,053
I know. Every time.

1839
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:59,436
Sugar, do yourself a favor.
Go back to where the millionaires are.

1840
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:01,062
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1841
02:00:01,152 --> 02:00:04,987
not the coleslaw in the face, the old socks,
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1842
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:07,907
That's right. Pour it on.
Talk me out of it.

1843
02:00:13,123 --> 02:00:15,706
I called Mama. She was so happy she cried.

1844
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:18,330
She wants you to have her wedding gown.
It's white lace.

1845
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:21,208
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1846
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:26,459
She and I, we are not built the same way.

1847
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:28,761
- We can have it altered.
- Oh, no, you don't.

1848
02:00:30,598 --> 02:00:33,887
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1849
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:35,468
Why not?

1850
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:38,896
Well, in the first place,
I'm not a natural blonde.

1851
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:41,440
Doesn't matter.

1852
02:00:41,526 --> 02:00:43,813
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

1853
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:45,394
I don't care.

1854
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:46,979
I have a terrible past.

1855
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:49,907
For three years now,
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1856
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:51,484
I forgive you.

1857
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,788
I can never have children.

1858
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:58,123
We can adopt some.

1859
02:00:58,209 --> 02:01:00,542
Well, you don't understand, Osgood.

1860
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:03,496
Ah! I'm a man.

1861
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,673
Well, nobody's perfect.
