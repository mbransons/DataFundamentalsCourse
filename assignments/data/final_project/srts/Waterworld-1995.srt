a thousand G’s of go-juice ?

Yeah, if he knows
he’s been spotted,

he’ll expect us to expect him
to change course,

which is exactly why
he’ll keep his heading.

The important question is,
where’s he heading ?

And does he know
how precious his cargo is ?

- The numbers ? Yes, I think I do.

859
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,680

of geographic location:
latitude, longitude.

860

to be backwards or something.

to find Dryland.

[ Screaming ]

1085
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,760
Get ’em up now.

- [ Enola Grunting ]
- [ Gregor Laughing ]

1087
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:37,720
- [ Gregor ] Of course !
North is south.
- What ?

1088
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:41,040
- South is north.
- I was swimming.

1089
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,240
- I saw.
- [ Gregor ] My friends.

1090
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,320
My friends, look.

1091
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:50,000
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the coordinates on Enola’s back,

1092
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,040
then Dryland is that way !

1093

- [ Helen Laughing ]
- It’s fresh !

1095
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,000
All of this !

01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:12,400
[ Helen ]
Whoo ! Whoo !

1100
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,680
I found something !

1101
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,280
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

1102
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,200
I think it was their way.

1103
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,240
[ Gregor ] They must have known
they were dying.

1104
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,160

[ Winding Key ]

1106
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,480
I’m home.

1107
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,400
- Where’s the Mariner ?
- He was outside.

1108
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,080
Wait. Wait !
I want to show you this.

1109

[ Birds Twittering, Chirping ]

1113
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:40,160
First time in your life
you got nothin’ to say ?

1114
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,880
Enola, I have to go now.

1115
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,800
But you came back for me.

1116
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,640
I like you.

1117
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,480
Why are you leaving ?

1118
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:15,680
- I don’t belong here.
I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1119
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,640
It’s too strange here.
It doesn’t move right.

1120
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:24,400
Helen said that
it’s only land sickness.

1121
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,000
We’re all feeling it.
It’ll go away soon.

1122
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,920
It’s more than that.
