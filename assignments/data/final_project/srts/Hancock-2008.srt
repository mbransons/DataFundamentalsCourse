<i>All units, all units.</i>
<i>Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.</i>

00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,939
<i>White SUV heading east</i>
<i>on Alameda service road.</i>

3
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,441
<i>Suspects: three Asian males.</i>

4
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,019
<i>Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.</i>

5
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:41,217
<i>Cheryl, can you see how many</i>
<i>suspects are in this car?</i>

6
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,639
<i>As far as I can see at this point,</i>
<i>there are three sus...</i>

7
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,424
<i>Oh, this is just coming in.</i>

8
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,660
Hancock!

9
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,616
What, boy?

10
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:01,859
Bad guys.

11
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,388
<i>- trying to cut them off.</i>
<i>You can see them there.</i>

12
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,621
<i>They have their hands</i>
<i>outside the white SUV...</i>

13
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:10,237
<i>... shooting randomly on the freeway.</i>

14
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,315
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

15
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,388
Asshole.

16
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,273
- What?
- You heard me.

17
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,466
<i>Please, stay off the freeway.</i>

18
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,107
<i>I understand that there are</i>
<i>three suspects in the white SUV...</i>

19
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:31,835
Asshole.

20
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,770
Watch out!

21
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,109
Damn!

22
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,572
Damn it!

23
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,308
Hancock!?!

24
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,221
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '

25
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,328
<i>Hancock is in the car...</i>

26
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,893
<i>... and he appears to be</i>
<i>negotiating with the gunmen.</i>

27
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,319
He smells like a bar!

28
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,684
You pay for new roof!

29
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:58,521
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

30
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:02,261
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

31
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,868
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

32
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,337
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

33
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,763
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

34
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:16,217
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

35
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,747
...because your head
is going up my ass.

36
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:21,749
Shoot this asshole!

37
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,600
Stop!

38
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,815
What the F% Å˜#K?

39
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,523
<i>The department is on their way.</i>
<i>There's just chaos here on the 105.</i>

40
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,596
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

41
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,774
Put us down!

42
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:05,078
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

43
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,198
You broke my glasses.

44
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:20,528
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

45
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,691
- Put us down!
- You want down?

46
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,236
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!

47
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:28,726
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

48
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,163
All right? All right.

49
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,372
<i>This, Hancock's latest act</i>
<i>of so-called heroics...</i>

50
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:41,515
<i>... took a hefty financial toll.</i>

51
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,775
<i>Initial damage estimates</i>
<i>are said to top $9 million...</i>

52
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:47,085
<i>... which, if accurate...</i>

53
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,331
<i>... represents a personal record...</i>

54
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:52,558
<i>... for the notoriously publicity-shy</i>
<i>Hancock...</i>

55
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:56,433
<i>... who, as usual,</i>
<i>can't be reached for comment.</i>

56
00:05:56,628 --> 00:06:01,232
<i>With all the cracks to the concrete,</i>
<i>all the bullets, water damage, fires...</i>

57
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,882
<i>... L.A. would be better off</i>
<i>if this guy would leave...</i>

58
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,644
<i>... and let us get on with our jobs.</i>

59
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:08,811
<i>He has never asked me for a badge</i>
<i>and has never worked with us...</i>

60

<i>... in any capacity whatsoever. Zero.</i>

61
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,978
<i>Just do it somewhere else.</i>
<i>New York, maybe.</i>

62
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,073
<i>Let them suffer for a while.</i>
<i>What the hell's the crane doing there?</i>

63
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,769
<i>Move the...</i>
<i>The crane's not gonna help!</i>

64
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,004
<i>How are we supposed</i>
<i>to get down?</i>

65
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:24,366
I will break my foot off in your ass,
woman.

66
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,624
<i>This Hancock guy is surely</i>
<i>on some kind of mission.</i>

67
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:32,911
<i>And he's using our city to beat himself</i>
<i>up for reasons known only to him.</i>

68
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,927
<i>We'll have shots later</i>
<i>from Chopper 1...</i>

69
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,936
<i>... for the removal of the SUV</i>
<i>from the landmark needle.</i>

70
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,434
Sir? Ray Embrey.

71
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:44,876
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

72
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,328
- So...
- Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

73
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,422
Well, actually I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

74
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,185
Well, let's see it.

75
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,644
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,189
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

77
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,469
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

78
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,313
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

79
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,405
...and you get an armband, or a ribbon
or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.

80
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:15,209
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

81
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,293
...the AllHeart symbol.

82
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:22,819
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

83
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,244
...to bear this logo on your product.

84
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,333
And what this would say
to the public...

85
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,313
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

86
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,665
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

87
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,683
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

88
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,586
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

89
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:43,747
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

90
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,804
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

91
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,676
Only to those who need it.

92
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,104
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

93
00:07:56,363 --> 00:08:00,072
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

94
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,634
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.

95
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:05,543
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.

96
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:08,040
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

97
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:12,357
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

98
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,764
The brand...

99
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,375
...that everyone is talking about.

100
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,399
Who is "everyone"?

101
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,081
We do already have
a sports franchise.

102
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:25,149
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

103
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,622
MLS? Which team?

104
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,718
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

105
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:33,250
It's my son's team.

106
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,313
Anyway, we can save the world.

107
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:40,675
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

108
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:43,198
What do you say?

109
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,236
Are you a crackpot?

110
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,427
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store.
I am on my way.

111
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,794
I think I made a connection.

112
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,059
Not really.

113
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,596
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and I... Damn it.

114
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,894
And I want some meatballs, okay?

115
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:12,639
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

116
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:16,186
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

117
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,785
Idiot.

118
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,994
Hey.

119
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:25,821
Hey. Hey!

120
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,059
Move it. There's a train coming.

121
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,398
Do you not hear that horn?

122
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,962
Let's go! I got a train!

123
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,814
Move it!

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,139
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

125
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,746
Son of a bitch!

126
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,676
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

127
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:50,520
Get out!

128
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:57,975
Get off the track! Move!

129
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,541
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

130
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,809
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

131
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:13,593
Please, that guy's still in there.

132
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:16,151
You sure?

133
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:18,872
Get him out of there!

134
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,622
Will you look at that?

135
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:51,257
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

136
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,664
All of you people...

137
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,891
...blocking the intersection...

138
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,627
...you're all idiots.

139
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,789
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

140
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:04,185
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

141
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,970
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

142
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:11,026
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.

143
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,944
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

144
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,377
You're an asshole.

145
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,776
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

146
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:21,970
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

147
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,816
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

148
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:29,942
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

149
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,740
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

150
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,106
Shut up!

151
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,768
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

152
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,450
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

153
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,463
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

154
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:49,367
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...

155
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,630
No. Thank you.

156
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,726
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

157
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,067
Thank you, Hancock.

158
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,531
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

159
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,484
Throw the ball!

160
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:14,391
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

161
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,622
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

162
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:20,303
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

163
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,923
Great. Thank you.

164
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,547
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...

165
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:28,466
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

166
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,117
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

167
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,559
I want you to meet somebody.

168
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,986
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

169
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:38,483
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

170
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:40,816
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

171
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,533
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.

172
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,321
You would not have believed it.

173
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,326
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...

174
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,558
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

175
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,414
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.

176
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:56,652
Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

177
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:59,241
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

178
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,003
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.

179
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:05,328
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.

180
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:10,856
Hang on a... One second.

181
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,288
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.

182
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,726
- You like meatballs?
- No.

183
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,831
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...

184
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:18,982
I love meatballs.

185
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,943
Who's so busy
they can't have a meal?

186
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:22,545
And it's on us. Please.

187
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:26,032
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

188
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,623
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

189
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,404
Do you like eagles?

190
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:57,670
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

191
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,726
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

192
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,253
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

193
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,166
No? All right.

194
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:09,102
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

195
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:12,807
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

196
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:14,151
- Ever.
- Yeah.

197
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,489
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:19,533
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.

199
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:20,965
Aaron.

200
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,954
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?

201
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,352
No. His name is Aaron.

202
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,514
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.

203
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,269
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

204
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,632
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.

205
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:37,250
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...

206
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,650
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.

207
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,883
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

208
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,637
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

209
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:49,348
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.

210
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:52,774
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

211
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,247
Never let them punk you.

212
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,969
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.

213
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,494
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

214
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,439
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

215
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,870
You don't have to do that,
honey, okay? Seriously.

216
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,048
It's a good idea.

217
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,967
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

218
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:12,129
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

219
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,670
Okay, please, just stop.

220
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:15,524
Michel is not a man, okay?

221
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,412
He's a little boy. And his parents...

222
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,958
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

223
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,404
Maybe you don't know this...

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,568
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

225
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,677
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

226
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,484
...scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

227
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,988
She watches so much news...

228
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,637
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

229
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,131
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

230
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,027
Are...?

231
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,853
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?

232
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,453
Do you want him to kill us all?

233
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,529
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

234
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:56,766
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?

235
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:59,137
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.

236
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:03,236
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

237
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,818
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...

238
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,362
He got it. She didn't get it.

239
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:09,826
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

240
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,963
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.

241
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:14,717
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

242
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,364
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

243
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:21,760
We change the way people see
products, companies, people, that stuff.

244
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,804
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

245
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:28,312
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

246
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,457
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.

247
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,804
But hear me out.

248
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:35,483
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

249
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:38,365
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

250
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,871
You know, you're a superhero.

251
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,977
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

252
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:43,902
People should cheer you
on the streets.

253
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:45,887
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

254
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,806
No, no, they're not... It's all right.

255
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,825
They're not pricks, they're just people.

256
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,345
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

257
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:56,058
That's all I ask. Okay?

258
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,980
You use...

259
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,128
Put it under here?

260
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,556
Put it right there. Perfect.

261
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,470
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

262
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,006
I want you to think about it.

263
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,589
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

264
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,800
You get back to me?

265
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,785
I'll be right here. All right.

266
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:18,238
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

267
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,984
What about AllHeart?

268
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:28,315
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

269
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:31,511
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

270
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,191
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

271
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,012
You really hate him.

272
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:40,213
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

273
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:44,220
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

274
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:47,828
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

275
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,388
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

276
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,428
Even sometimes when it's not there.

277
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:59,481
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

278
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,822
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

279
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:01,897
My bad. Everybody all right?

280
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,587
I'll go and get my mommy.

281
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,023
He is an asshole.

282
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,136
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.

283
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,655
Do you know Aaron?

284
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:27,942
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

285
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,381
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

286
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,170
Why, asshole?

287
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,797
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

288
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:41,830
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

289
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,044
Call me a asshole...

290
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,516
...one more time.

291
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,018
Asshole.

292
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,942
How about you, thickness?

293
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,540
Goggles?

294
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,476
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

295
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:06,987
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

296
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,321
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

297
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:12,103
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

298
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:13,708
I'll meet you in the house.

299
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:16,771
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.

300
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:22,217
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

301
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,172
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

302
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,984
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

303
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:34,252
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

304
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:37,378
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

305
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,197
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

306
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:43,493
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

307
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,730
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

308
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,686
We'll make those problems
of the past.

309
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:50,272
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

310
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,474
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

311
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:55,528
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

312
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:59,814
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

313
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,220
What is this?

314
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:04,003
That's me trying to change the world.

315
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:06,024
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

316
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,038
Come on. Let's get to you.

317
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,562
This stuff was on YouTube.

318
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:13,925
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

319
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:17,728
<i>Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.</i>
<i>Back up, back up.</i>

320
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:22,080
<i>Mom! Mom! Mom!</i>

321
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:23,965
Those are children.

322
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:28,866
<i>- We've been waiting a long time...</i>
<i>- Get that camera out of my face.</i>

323
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,258
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

324
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:35,837
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

325
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,100
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.

326
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:42,913
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

327
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,093
Along comes Hancock.

328
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,289
<i>Hancock!</i>

329
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,867
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:03,035
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

331
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,438
This gets redundant after a while...

332
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:08,604
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...

333
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,365
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

334
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:11,803
You're an asshole.

335
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,177
I know. I call it like I see it though.

336
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:17,219
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

337
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,299
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

338
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,052
Be careful.

339
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,318
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

340
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:27,003
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

341
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:30,335
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

342
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:32,832
...when you see this?

343
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:35,640
Homo.

344
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:39,321
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

345
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,572
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

346
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,933
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

347
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,083
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

348
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:56,031
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

349
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,612
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

350
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,711
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

351
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:05,595
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

352
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,482
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

353
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,390
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

354
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:13,719
- Almost.
- And then he kicked it in.

355
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,774
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

356
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:19,066
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

357
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:20,604
Hey, sweetheart.

358
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,445
Have you been watching the news?

359
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,265
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

360
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:28,501
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

361
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,965
<i>The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,</i>
<i>and you are not above it.</i>

362
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:35,286
<i>Felony destruction of property...</i>

363
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:39,065
<i>... amounting to tens of millions</i>
<i>of dollars, theft, and now this.</i>

364
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:43,517
<i>From where I sit,</i>
<i>I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...</i>

365
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:47,833
<i>... with a lot of muscle, but no regard</i>
<i>for anyone but yourself.</i>

366
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,232
<i>Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.</i>

367
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,079
<i>You are not above the law.</i>

368
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:57,945
<i>You have failed to show</i>
<i>at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.</i>

369
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:01,619
<i>Anybody else would be held</i>
<i>in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.</i>

370
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:04,786
<i>You may be a superhero,</i>
<i>but let me tell you this:</i>

371
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:08,664
<i>You're not nearly as strong</i>
<i>as the U.S. Constitution.</i>

372
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,267
<i>Bank on it, buddy.</i>

373
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,086
<i>We do not condone the t...</i>

374
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,161
Genius.

375
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:17,776
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

376
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,825
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

377
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:23,505
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

378
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,400
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

379
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,593
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.

380
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,663
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.

381
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,458
When they do, we'll be ready.

382
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:41,138
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

383
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,472
What do you got to lose?

384
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:04,082
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.

385
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,628
My behavior has been improper
and I accept the consequences.

386
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,355
<i>I ask my fellow Angelenos...</i>

387
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,406
<i>... for their patience</i>
<i>and understanding. "

388
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:14,987
You're an asshole, Hancock!

389
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,172
Asshole!

390
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:21,235
"Life here can be difficult for me.

391
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,437
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

392
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,476
<i>During my incarceration,</i>
<i>I will be participating...</i>

393
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,808
<i>... in alcohol-</i>
<i>and anger-management treatment. "

394
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:37,580
You're a drunk bum!

395
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:40,747
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

396
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:42,704
All right.

397
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,583
Give me the hand, playboy.

398
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,593
I see you, punk!

399
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,140
Oh, I get it.

400
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:35,597
I put some... Most of you in here.

401
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,680
Yes, you did.

402
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:44,233
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

403
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,839
What?

404
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:50,957
So I'm gonna do me,
and I'm gonna let you do you.

405
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:53,192
I don't want no trouble.

406
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,592
All right?

407
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,678
I just wanna go to my cell.

408
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,554
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

409
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,925
Excuse me.

410
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:07,496
Excuse me, please.

411
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,716
Deadly.

412
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:16,931
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

413
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,562
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

414
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:29,385
Choo, choo, asshole.

415
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,175
Get him out! Get him out!

416
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,324
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

417
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:05,221
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.

418
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,608
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

419
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,776
It's a big number,
but not something we didn't anticipate.

420
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:13,919
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?

421
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,055
Hey, hey, hey!

422
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:26,210
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

423
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,927
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.

424
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:33,062
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

425
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:35,743
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

426
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:39,685
...the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

427
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,366
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

428
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:45,053
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

429
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:46,366
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

430
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:47,995
- Hancock!
- Get back!

431
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:49,660
You're being a coward!

432
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,292
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

433
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:56,195
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.

434
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,683
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

435
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:02,528
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

436
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:06,848
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

437
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,659
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

438
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:14,364
How we gonna do that, Ray?

439
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:18,362
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

440
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,386
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

441
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:25,473
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

442
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,192
Good for you.

443
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:31,965
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.

444
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:37,343
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

445
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:41,181
...and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.

446
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,450
Why do you always laugh?

447
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:46,878
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

448
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:50,717
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

449
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:52,319
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

450
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,847
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

451
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,218
No, no, no.

452
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,359
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

453
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:00,316
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

454
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:03,383
Pass.

455
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,996
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

456
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,359
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

457
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,862
And don't land on
a $ 100,000 Mercedes. All right?

People have to be happy

Mr. Hancock, your share.

460
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:19,768
Pass.

461
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,553
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

462
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,117
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

463
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,449
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

464
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:29,272
...so tell him he's done a good job.

465
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,252
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

466
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:43,797

00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:13,011
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.

495
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,954
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

496
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,685
Where's...? Where's Ray?

497
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:20,240
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

498
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,324
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

499
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:25,551
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

500
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:28,051
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...

- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

503
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:39,917
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

504
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:47,184
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.

- Yeah. Sweetheart...

I love you guys, man.

518
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:55,400
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.

519
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:43,683
For when they call.

520
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,618
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.

521
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,411
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.

522
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,754
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

523
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:56,612
You think you're not, but you are.

524
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,479
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

525
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,221
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

526
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:08,865
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

527
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,584
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

528
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:14,174
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

529
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,637
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

530
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:21,026
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

531
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:49,242
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

532
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:52,060
Asshole!

533
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,109
You're still a fake-ass punk.

534
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,787

- Come on, John.

539
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:28,124
I don't have nothing.

540
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:30,743
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

541
00:37:30,946 --> 00:37:32,124
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.

542
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:33,499
- Come on.
- Do it.

543
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:34,942
First time for everything.

544
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:38,171
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

545
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,665
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

546
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:47,935
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

547
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:52,254
All right. Thanks for sharing.

548
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:55,126
- Okay.
- Thank you.

549
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:56,853
- All right.
- That's awesome.

550
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:59,925
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

551
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:17,018
Hey, Hancock.

552
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,003
Come on, get up.

553
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,100
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

554
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,374
It's the chief of police.

555
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:26,876
He says he needs your help.

556
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,480
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

557
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:56,407
...who was killed last year in Iraq...

558
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,898
<i>... leaving her two small children.</i>
<i>We are waiting for the latest news...</i>

559
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,512

<i>there are three suspects and...</i>

560
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:03,892
What's going on?

561
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:06,770
I'm out!

562
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:09,938
Stay down! Stay down!

563
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:11,731
Stay down!

564
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,392
- Get out!
- Get down!

565
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:14,674
Get it down!

566
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:22,483
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

567
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:24,852
Back! Move!

568
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:40,558
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

569
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,483
The west side is open.

570
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,262
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

571
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,670
What?

572
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,559
It's a little tight. What you got?

573
00:40:08,758 --> 00:40:12,554
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

574
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:14,798
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

575
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,772
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...

576
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:22,194
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.

577
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,901
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.

578
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,390
Good job.

579
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,682
Good job.

580
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,899
Really, good job.

581
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:47,498
Get down!

582
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,675
It's Hancock!

583
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:25,960
Take him out!

584
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:32,074
Good job!

585
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:34,311
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

586
00:41:34,512 --> 00:41:35,973
Yes!

587
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:39,367
It's not sexual.

588
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,919
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

589
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:46,085
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the hell out of here!

590
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,902
He's on the move!

591
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:08,547
He's moving, he's moving!

592
00:42:17,965 --> 00:42:18,947
Good job.

593
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:20,522
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

594
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:22,144
- Hancock!
- Good job.

595
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:24,584
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

596
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:34,402
Check the flanks.

597
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:37,698
Secure the perimeter.

598
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:42,944
Spread out!

599
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,088
They're gonna
come around the back.

600
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:58,653
What happened to him?

601
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:03,358
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

602
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,686
What is happening?

603
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:28,482
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

604
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,199
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.

605
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:33,596
Do you know what this is?

606
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:40,865
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

607
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:44,258
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

608
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:46,428
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

609
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:48,156
If my thumb comes off it:

610
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,400
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

611
00:43:54,596 --> 00:43:58,557
...between the police showing up and
you sucking out all of my associates...

612
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:00,796
...I want you to break into the vault.

613
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:04,058
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

614
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:05,761
Thirty million dollars.

615
00:44:06,788 --> 00:44:08,544
And you're gonna carry it for me.

616
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:12,536
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

617
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,862
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

618
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:21,663
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

619
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:26,562
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

620
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,308
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

621
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:34,557
I really don't like that word.

622
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:36,576
I will blow them sky-high...

623
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:39,355
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

624
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:44,792
Do you hear me, asshole?

625
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:55,519
Call me a asshole...

626
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,311
...one more time.

627
00:45:00,128 --> 00:45:01,884
Ass...

628
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,631
Keep your hand on that trigger.

629
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,659
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.

630
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,819
- Thank you.
- Good job.

631
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:24,731
Hancock!

632
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:19,704
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

633
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:21,902
Here we go. This way.

634
00:46:22,105 --> 00:46:25,487
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.

635
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:27,379
Smile.

636
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:28,623
Good job, Hancock!

637
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:33,006
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here,
huh?

638
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:36,983
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

639
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:38,582
Gigantic fans. Insane!

640
00:46:38,775 --> 00:46:40,881
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

641
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,324
You never call, man.

642
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:46,381
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.

643
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,141
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

644
00:46:54,006 --> 00:46:55,633
How'd you two meet?

645
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:58,924
I was married once before.

646
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:01,101
First wife...

647
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,882
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

648
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:09,585
It's another dinner. But... But...

649
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:12,203
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

650
00:47:12,406 --> 00:47:14,096
I don't know what the hell to do.

651
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:16,397
And I was in the supermarket...

652
00:47:17,141 --> 00:47:18,930
...and I'm in the baby aisle...

653
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,580
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

654
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,522
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

655
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,885
An angel...

656
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:31,275
...sees me.

657
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:35,727
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

658
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:42,057
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

659
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,169
...was throwing me a little rope.

660
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:45,929
You know?

661
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,927
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

662
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:54,865
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

663
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:01,415
What about you, buddy?

664
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:03,440
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

665
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:05,678
No, man, I'm from Miami.

666
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:08,142
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?

667
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:10,758
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

668
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:14,758
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...

669
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,567
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

670
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,997
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.

671
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:25,639
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

672
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,898
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...

673
00:48:30,096 --> 00:48:33,161
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.

674
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:36,774
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

675
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:39,113
...and it just broke against my skin.

676
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:42,855
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

677
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,437
The doctors were astounded...

678
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,250
...and they wanted to know my story.

679
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:53,991
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

680
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,715
Amnesia.

681
00:48:57,165 --> 00:49:00,645
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

682
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:04,362
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

683
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,169
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

684
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,219
...bubble gum...

685
00:49:10,412 --> 00:49:12,386
...two movie tickets.

686
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:16,036
Boris Karloff, <i>Frankenstein.</i>

687
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:19,337
But no ID, nothing.

688
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:24,005
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

689
00:49:25,803 --> 00:49:27,493
I actually thought that's who I was.

690
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,295
How come I didn't hear any of this,
didn't read about it in any newspapers?

691
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:35,719
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

692
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,673
Eighty years ago?

693
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:40,003
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

694
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:42,918
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:

695
00:49:45,226 --> 00:49:48,324
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

696
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:53,954
...that nobody was there to claim me?

697
00:49:58,344 --> 00:50:02,272
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

698
00:50:02,473 --> 00:50:04,741
...so I've been told, but...

699
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,644
...nobody?

700
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:14,050
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

701
00:50:14,247 --> 00:50:16,223
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.

702
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:19,205
Could've just flown me upstairs.

703
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,919
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

704
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,316
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

705
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,041
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

706
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:34,206
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

707
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:41,243
Listen. This is important because
I believe in you, you know, and...

708
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,562
You're gonna do great.

709
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:49,728
You're gonna fix everything.

710
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:57,408
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

711
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:00,515
Hancock tucking me in.

712
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:08,798
All right, he's asleep.

713
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,714
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

714
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:26,397
You have a bruise on your hand.

715
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:30,588
You...

716
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,765
You should go.

717
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,054
Getting late.

718
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,886
If Ray finds out about me...

719
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,947
...you're dead.

720
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:58,551
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

721
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:02,229
Hi, honey.

722
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:04,314
Breakfast?

723
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:07,215
Hancock sneezed, huh?

724
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,385
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

725
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:13,268
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

726
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,757
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...

727
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:19,890
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

728
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,462
I just said him being around...

729
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,729
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

730
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,262
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.

731
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,594
But you don't worry about anything.

732
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:31,956
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.

733
00:53:32,152 --> 00:53:33,526
Everything is taken care of.

734
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:35,824
You just...

735
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,764
...enjoy that breakfast.

736
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:44,145
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

737
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:45,488
Just the three of us.

738
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:47,028
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

739
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:48,629
- Tonight?
- Let's go somewhere.

740
00:53:48,822 --> 00:53:50,545
Knock, knock.

741
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:53,779
Gesundheit.

742
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:58,763
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

743
00:53:58,998 --> 00:54:02,380
...because I don't think our house
could take much more...

744
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:04,010
...of your sneezing.

745
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:13,866
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

746
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:18,283
...or if I get really surprised.

747
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:22,474
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

748
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:25,586
Mike? How you doing?

749
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,593
It was great to see you too.

750
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:31,818
Yep. Well...

751
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:34,288
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

752
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:38,353
Okay. I got a pen right here.

753
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,228
Right. No, I know.

754
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:48,139
It's right here in my hand.

755
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,320
I am warning you.

756
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:58,698
All right, go ahead.

757
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:03,176
Okay, good.

758
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:08,488
Now... And that's still in 310, right?

759
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:09,769
Hang on one second.

760
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:11,819
Do me a favor?

761
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,819
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

762
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:17,773
We're gonna talk.

763
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:20,750
Go away.

764
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:24,652
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

765
00:55:35,663 --> 00:55:38,532
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

766
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:42,253
I... I suppose...

767
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:44,649
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.

768
00:55:44,877 --> 00:55:49,482
And when we're done talking, you go
away and you leave my family alone.

769
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:53,540
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

770
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,739
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

771
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:00,835
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

772
00:56:01,036 --> 00:56:03,938
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

773
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,890
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

774
00:56:07,212 --> 00:56:09,546
Hon, is it hot in here?

775
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,962
He hurt you, didn't he?

776
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:36,319
Come on, use your words.

777
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:38,910
How did it make you feel?

778
00:56:41,705 --> 00:56:42,818
Sore.

779
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,544
Bad.

780
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:46,559
Bad.

781
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:50,787
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

782
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:56,454
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

783
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:58,656
You understand me?

784
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,118
We're gonna go find Hancock...

785
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:05,925
...and get your power back.

786
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,750
Ask.

787
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:50,237
- You and I.
- "You and I" what?

788
00:57:50,436 --> 00:57:53,054
- We're the same.
- No.

789
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:55,299
I'm stronger.

790
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,408
Really?

791
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,754
Oh, yeah.

792
00:58:02,915 --> 00:58:04,508
Who are we?

793
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:09,245
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

794
00:58:09,443 --> 00:58:12,312
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

795
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:15,962
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

796
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:17,402
They all died.

797
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:21,401
It's just the two of us.

798
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,128
What is this?

799
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:36,503
Who are we to each other?

800
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,552
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

801
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:42,650
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

802
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:44,441
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

803
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:47,607
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

804
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:49,052
You're lying, deal's off.

805
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:51,222
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

806
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:53,430
Get your ass back here!

807
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,453
I'm telling!

808
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:02,876
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

809
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,989
...as a symbol...

810
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:09,851
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

811
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,347
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

812
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,713
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

813
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:17,211
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

814
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:29,751
You stay away
from me and my family.

815
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:32,249
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

816
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:35,314
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

817
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:37,370
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!

818
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:40,881
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

819
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:43,450
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

820
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:45,301
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

821
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,083
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

822
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,072
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?

823
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:53,397
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally, I am happy!

824
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:57,042
- You are not gonna mess with that!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

825
00:59:57,242 --> 00:59:59,609
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

826
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,240
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

827
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,318
Call me crazy...

828
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:14,550
...one more time.

829
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:16,085
Cuckoo.

830
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:26,423
All right, hold it. All right.

831
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,651
You better not hit me with that truck.

832
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,938
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

833
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:35,663
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

834
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:37,718
They're committed
to bettering the world.

835
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,245
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

836
01:01:21,172 --> 01:01:23,921
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

837
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:25,938
I've mocked up
these examples here...

838
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:28,018
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

839
01:01:39,315 --> 01:01:40,940
Oh, no.

840
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,377
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...

841
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:44,551
Is it snowing?

842
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,328
Get off!

843
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:01,707
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

844
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:04,239
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

845
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:11,883
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.

846
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,704
I'm sorry.

847
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,295
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

848
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,072
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.

849
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,652
And I'm very strong as well.

850
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:01,282
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

851
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:04,418
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

852
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,369
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

853
01:03:07,595 --> 01:03:10,050
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

854
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:11,593
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.

855
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,406
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.

856
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:16,938
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.

857
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:18,692
Technically speaking...

858
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:21,602
...he's my husband.

859
01:03:22,762 --> 01:03:25,097
Holy shit.

860
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:28,164
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.

861
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:31,176
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

862
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:34,337
But you can, right? You knew?

863
01:03:34,538 --> 01:03:36,904
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

864
01:03:37,098 --> 01:03:40,229
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

865
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:42,694
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

866
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:45,190
Whatever we are,
we were built in twos, okay?

867
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:46,629
We're drawn to each other.

868
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,061
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

869
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:50,783
He finds me. It's physics.

870
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:53,537
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

871
01:03:53,736 --> 01:03:56,518
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

872
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:58,529
And the one thing I learned...

873
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:01,378
...fate doesn't decide everything.

874
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:03,269
People get to choose.

875
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,602
And you chose...

876
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:08,995
...to let me think I was here alone.

877
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:20,572
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

878
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:24,353
Great. Now what?

879
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:31,650
I didn't plan for this.

880
01:04:53,603 --> 01:04:55,010
<i>Prison authorities confirmed...</i>

881
01:04:55,203 --> 01:04:58,717
<i>... that the prisoner uprising was led</i>
<i>by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...</i>

882
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:02,077
<i>... who was also the leader of last</i>
<i>week's Spring Street bank robbery.</i>

883
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:04,478
<i>At least eight prisoners</i>
<i>are not accounted for.</i>

884
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:06,845
<i>More information</i>
<i>on the prison riot in Norwalk.</i>

885
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:10,140
<i>Construction workers at the prison</i>
<i>were knocked unconscious.</i>

886
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:12,248
<i>The prisoners stole</i>
<i>the workers' clothes...</i>

887
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,003
<i>... and it's feared at least</i>
<i>some of them have escaped.</i>

888
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:17,340
<i>Parker is considered</i>
<i>a criminal mastermind.</i>

889
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,091
<i>He is very effective at</i>
<i>using psychological persuasion...</i>

890
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,656
<i>... to organize criminals</i>
<i>from different backgrounds.</i>

891
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:25,663
<i>He is a former psychology professor</i>
<i>from Stanford University.</i>

892
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:28,410
<i>While there, he organized</i>
<i>a notorious criminal network...</i>

893
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:30,845
<i>... comprised of graduate students</i>
<i>from diverse...</i>

894
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,015
Ninety-one ten.

895
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:35,420
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

896
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:37,213
Ninety-one ten.

897
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:39,709
Highway robbery.

898
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,892
- What?
- I'm taking the money.

899
01:06:11,549 --> 01:06:12,596
I can relate to that.

900
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:17,657
You know? If you want something...

901
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,459
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

902
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:24,629
...you just take it, right?

903
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,055
I like that.

904
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:30,325
But can you take it?

905
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:36,122
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

906
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,279
Sorry about your window.

907
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:31,443
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

908
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,046
I need Room 1020.

909
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:40,142
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...

910
01:07:40,343 --> 01:07:41,804
Where's his IV line?

911
01:07:42,198 --> 01:07:44,205
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

912
01:07:45,621 --> 01:07:46,996
What's happening?

913
01:07:49,814 --> 01:07:52,628
<i>This just in.</i>
<i>John Hancock has been rushed...</i>

914
01:07:52,821 --> 01:07:54,480
<i>... to Los Angeles General Hospital.</i>

915
01:07:54,678 --> 01:07:57,711
<i>Hancock is in serious condition</i>
<i>with multiple gunshot wounds.</i>

916
01:07:57,909 --> 01:07:59,949
<i>No story yet as to</i>
<i>how this happened to him...</i>

917
01:08:00,149 --> 01:08:03,946
<i>... but we will continue to cover this</i>
<i>story live. Reporting live from L. A...</i>

918
01:08:10,037 --> 01:08:12,786
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

919
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,776
- Just a couple of questions, sir, please.
- Can you describe how it happened?

920
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:20,209
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

921
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:23,818
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

922
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:25,098
Not that I'm aware of.

923
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:27,600
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

924
01:08:27,795 --> 01:08:30,380
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

925
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:33,578
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

926
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:39,118
Here are the lab results for 209.

927
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:07,468
You're becoming mortal.

928
01:09:09,072 --> 01:09:10,828
It's us...

929
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:13,384
...being close to each other.

930
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,159
It's never happened this fast before.

931
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:20,972
You have to leave.

932
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:24,905
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

933
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,590
You'll start getting
your powers back...

934
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:30,506
...and be flying and breaking things...

935
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:33,190
...and saving people
before you know it.

936
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:51,179
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

937
01:09:51,372 --> 01:09:56,106
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

938
01:09:58,252 --> 01:10:02,594
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.

939
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:05,508
Love, connect...

940
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:10,442
...grow old, die.

941
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:14,151
What happened to us?

942
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:20,193
Summer of 4 B.C.

943
01:10:21,098 --> 01:10:24,098
We were becoming mortal, like now.

944
01:10:24,618 --> 01:10:26,722
They came after me with swords.

945
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:31,935
But you saved me.

946
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,702
1850.

947
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:39,975
They set our house on fire.

948
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:43,878
You pulled me out of the flames.

949
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:48,100
Eighty years ago.

950
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:51,071
What happened then?

951
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:54,144
We were living in Miami...

952
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:57,893
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

953
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,102
<i>Frankenstein.</i>

954
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:04,285
And after...

955
01:11:04,775 --> 01:11:06,498
...we walked down Flagler Street...

956
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:10,470
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

957
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:19,460
And they attacked us in an alley.

958
01:11:22,982 --> 01:11:27,072
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

959
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:31,298
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

960
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:36,800
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

961
01:11:40,741 --> 01:11:42,202
But you didn't know me.

962
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,749
So I left.

963
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,526
Every time we're together...

964
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:53,377
...they come after you through me.

965
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:10,491
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

966
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,472
That's who you are. You're a hero.

967
01:12:15,009 --> 01:12:17,595
The insurance policy of the gods.

968
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:21,179
Keep one alive. You.

969
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:24,507
To protect this world.

970
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:40,532
Mary!

971
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,212
Mom!

972
01:12:44,415 --> 01:12:45,724
- Mary!
- Stay down!

973
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:48,216
Okay.

974
01:12:58,238 --> 01:12:59,416
Mary?

975
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:13,752
Stop.

976
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:18,293
Oh, no! No! Please!

977
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,298
Stay down.

978
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:42,294
Hey! Mary!

979
01:13:42,491 --> 01:13:43,920
Let's go, get her up!

980
01:13:44,923 --> 01:13:47,443
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

981
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,118
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!

982
01:13:57,401 --> 01:13:58,929
Hold her down. Hold her down.

983
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:03,789
Hold her down.

984
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,211
Hold her down.

985
01:14:20,215 --> 01:14:22,288
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

986
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,819
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

987
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:16,746
Upon us all, Hancock.

988
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:18,801
You're no different.

989
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:26,479
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

990
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:28,813
It's been a nice run.

991
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:59,855
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

992
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:03,471
But it is time for you to move on.

993
01:16:07,183 --> 01:16:10,086
And maybe to a happier place.

994
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:14,414
You can thank me if you want to...

995
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,094
...superhero.

996
01:16:27,086 --> 01:16:28,613
You didn't!

997
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:35,748
Aaron!

998
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:43,061
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

999
01:19:43,263 --> 01:19:44,244
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

1000
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:47,097
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1001
01:19:47,295 --> 01:19:50,774
- Needy.
- J.F. K? What about him?

1002
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,692
Oh, yeah.

1003
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:56,956
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1004
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:59,735
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1005
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:00,949
Yeah, hang on.

1006
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:05,047
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Ray.

1007
01:20:05,245 --> 01:20:07,100
<i>Hey, I've been trying to call you.</i>

1008
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:09,911
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

1009
01:20:10,749 --> 01:20:14,261
- Are you outside?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1010
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:17,756
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.

1011
01:20:18,364 --> 01:20:20,219
I'm looking up.

1012
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,120
- Baby?
- What?

1013
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:37,298
You're gonna change the world.

1014
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,728
<i>- Good job, Ray.</i>
- Oh, my God, Ray.

1015
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:44,304
Hey. Look up.

1016
01:20:45,018 --> 01:20:46,392
Hancock.

1017
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:52,468
I'm proud of you.

1018
01:20:52,665 --> 01:20:54,388
Thanks.

1019
01:20:56,474 --> 01:20:58,775
Will I get in trouble for that?

1020
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:14,095
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1021
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:16,331
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!

1022
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:17,839
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1023
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:20,401
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

1024
01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:22,122
Get back! I'm not playing.

1025
01:22:22,579 --> 01:22:25,229
Get back. Get back!

1026
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,822
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1027
01:22:28,019 --> 01:22:30,058
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1028
01:22:30,258 --> 01:22:32,462
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1029
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,762
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.

1030
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:36,686
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1031
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:41,005
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1032
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,007
Now let's make it happen,
asshole.

1033
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:32,376
