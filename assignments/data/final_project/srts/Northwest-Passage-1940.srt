for their rights,

with his heart
on his sleeve.

lost his chance

his feelings.

their feelings
on all occasions.

Well, tha콘s
a clergyman's
privilege.

84

Artists should show
their feelings, too.

And if he's going
to be a painter,

86
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,652
he's got
to feel about things.

87
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,060
Yes. If he felt
that way,

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,409
he felt that way.

89
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:38,235
We'll have to make
the best of our
disappointments.

elizabeth's fault.

165
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:15,558
I콘s that pompous
old... parson.

166
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,960
I've learned not
to argue with him.

167
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,369
I can't afford to

168
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,282
if i expect to marry
one of his daughters.

169
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:25,164
If you're trying
to drink yourself
out of lovesickness,

170
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:26,574
we've got some rum

171
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:30,449
that will burn the knots
out of a pine plank.

172
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,858
Bring it in.

173
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,810
I wouldn't
drink any more.

174
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,252
Why shouldn't i drink?

175
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,301
Browne said all painters
are drunkards.

176
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,094
The old hypocrite
wouldn't care

177
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,015
if he thought
they'd be rich.

178
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,417
Money and power...
tha콘s all he
cares about,

179
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,858
hobnobbing
with rich scoundrels

180
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,259
that put poor woodsmen
like hunk in jail.

181
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,180
Hunk got himself
in jail

182
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,070
for talking against
wiseman clagett.

183
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,504
It was hunk's own fault
for talking.

184
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,386
It was clage콘s fault
for deserving to be
talked against.

185
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,507
Oh, claptrap.

186
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,787
Claptrap?

187
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:01,510
Wiseman clage콘s
the biggest thief
in this province.

188
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,950
Shh. Not so loud.

189
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, i mustn't talk,
or i'll get put
in jail?

190
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,241
I wouldn't
be surprised.

191
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,315
Clagett can steal
100,000 acres of land
from this province,

192
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,556
but nobody
must talk about it.

193
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,439
And he's hand-in-glove
with that indian agent,
sir william johnson.

194
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:18,161
They let men like hunk
clear the land

195
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,082
and risk being scalped
by indians,

196
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,836
then take it away
from them.

197
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,277
Be quiet, langdon.

198
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:27,062
They'd steal the pennies
off a dead man's eyes,

199
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,984
but elizabeth's father
wouldn't care.

200
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,873
Well, gentlemen...

201
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:36,638
to what are we indebted
for this pleasure,
mr. Clagett?

202
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,790
Mr. Livermore,

203
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,512
i find you
in dangerous company.

204
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:41,921
You may withdraw.

205
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,875
Langdon towne
is my guest.

206
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,315
If you're here to say
something to him,

207
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,236
say it to me also.

208
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,678
You wish
to defend libels

209
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,086
against his majesty's
representatives?

210
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,239
Certainly not.

211
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:53,160
Then you've
no business here.

212
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:55,081
I bid you
good evening.

213
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,490
Packer, open the door

214
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,373
and give mr. Livermore
any necessary
assistance.

215
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:00,782
Get out!

216
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,970
Now, sir, do you wish
to make a statement?

217
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:08,018
Why should i make
any statement?

218
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,804
You've made yourself liable
to very dangerous charges.

219
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,246
You've slandered me,

220
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,615
libeled that good man
sir william johnson,

221
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,376
repeated shameful rumors,
lies, calumnies.

222
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,681
I'd never
repeat calumnies
about innocent men.

223
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,155
Wha콘s that you said?

224
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,012
I don't believe
they're lies.

225
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,197
Langdon, no.

226
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,606
He's dangerously
intoxicated,

227
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,488
a threat to the safety
of the community.

228
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,890
Take him aboard
the battleship
in the harbor.

229
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,363
You can't
shanghai me!

230
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,212
I demand that
word be taken
to my family.

231
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,486
Raving from
the effects of drink.

232
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:37,606
Raving.

233
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:40,008
Who's the one raving,
packer or clagett?

234
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,449
Take them both!

235
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,371
Langdon, you're
in bad company...

236
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,676
the lowest scoundrels
in portsmouth.

237
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:50,896
Why, you...

238
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,780
[hunk marriner]
Out the window,
langdon!

239
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,071
Take to the woods
and keep going.

240
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:03,544
Oh, your excellency!

241
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,074
They went that way!
That way!

242
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,984
췄 some talk

췄 there's none

248
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,095
see any redcoats?

249
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,465
No, but there's
a fella inside

250
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,457
in some
green outfit.

251
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,859
54's a lot of miles
without no rum.

252
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,332
Shall we risk it?

253
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,285
췄 and such great names
as these 췄

254

259
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,827
Wha콘s the matter?

260
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,813
We ain't busted
no laws.

261
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,478
You can sing,
can't you?

262
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,952
We haven't
got time.

263
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,873
No? Why'd you
come in here?

264
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,834
Rum.

265
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,242
Where you headed for?

266
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,395
West.

267
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,277
Makes no difference
when a man gets west.

268
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,998
Help me get this indian
on his feet,

269
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,408
i'll buy you rum.

270
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,880
This indian
wants to sing.

271
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,801
We can't seem
to suit him,

272
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,243
so he's dissatisfied.

273
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,651
Whenever
he's dissatisfied,

274
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,765
he won't drink
anything but rum.

275
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,647
Unless we get him
to drink beer
so he'll get sick,

276
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:15,498
he won't be fit to travel,
and he's got to travel.

277
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,971
We'll sing some beer
into him.

278
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:19,661
All right.
Give us the pitch.

279
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:23,214

Your sweet what?

297
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,006
Your his sweet brother.

298
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,377
Don't worry.
He won't kiss you.

299
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:27,482
These indians haven't
learned that yet.

300
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:31,293
He's climbing
a mountain now.

301
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,694
When he gets
to the top,

302
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,288
he'll fall off
the other side.

303
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,348
There he goes,
into the valley.

304
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,821
When he comes to,

305
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,742
he'll be sober enough
to travel.

306
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,183
Gentlemen, i'm obliged.

307
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,624
I need that indian.

308
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:48,745
What for?

309
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,346
Bring some hot water,

310
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,786
rum, sugar, and butter.

311
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,067
Tout suite.

312
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,757
I owe these gentlemen
something special
and permanent.

313
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,710
Where'd you say
you're going?

314
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,151
I didn't say,

315
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,041
but we're going
to albany.

316
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,995
You're taking
a roundabout way.

317
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,877
Aren't you afraid
of getting lost
in the woods?

318
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:08,117
Not with the maps
he makes.

319
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,527
You make maps?

320
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,960
You can go anyplace
with his maps.

321
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,298
I've always been
interested in maps.

322
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,179
Ever since i've been
a little boy, i...

323
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,005
"langdon towne.
Harvard college."

324
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,143
Hmm. Quite an eye
for detail.

325
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,033
Ah. Thank you,
flint.

326
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,434
Cold rum is just
a temporary drink.

327
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,316
I콘ll wear off
in a day or two,

328
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:31,718
but hot rum
will last you

329
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,080
as long
as a coonskin cap.

330
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:38,058
Wha콘s, uh,
wha콘s this map?

331
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,779
Oh, tha콘s
the northwest passage.

332
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:43,917
What do you know about
the northwest passage?

333
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:44,687
All they know
at harvard.

334
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:46,320
All they know
at harvard.

335
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,081
Where'd you
hear about it?

336
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,490
Oh, tall tales,

337
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,347
trappers' stories.

338
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,543
Wha콘s a harvard fella
like you aim to do
in albany?

339
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:58,424
We aim to join
dutch traders
and go west.

340
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,609
What for?

341
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,050
Well, paint indians.

342
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:02,011
Indians?

343
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:03,099
Paint indians?

344
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:06,012
As long as we got...
long as we're going,

345
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,247
i could paint them
as they really are.

346
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:12,802
Smart fella like you...
can make maps,
drink rum.

347
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,652
I'm surprised
you're not in the army.

348
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:18,694
I'd be
more surprised if i was.

349
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,063
Well, you never
can tell nowadays

350
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,824
wha콘ll
surprise a man next.

351
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,482
We've got enough sense
not to join the army.

352
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,364
We don't aim to dig ditches
and chop down trees

353
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,087
and get shot at
in a red coat

354
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,969
that stands out
like a house on fire.

355
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,370
Might as well
be back in jail.

356
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,811
Well, maybe
you're right.

357
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,252
Maybe what
you're saying

358
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,141
is just plain
common sense.

359
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,575
Anyway, i wouldn't
recommend the british.

360
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,944
Maybe those dutch
up in albany

361
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,345
might just suit you.

362
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:50,010
Here's to them.

363
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,103
[Gasp]

364
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,473
Makes me want
to shoot a panther.

365
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:59,426
Two or three
drinks of this,

366
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,828
you won't have to
shoot the panther.

367
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,709
Just walk up to him,
kiss him once,

368
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,455
and put him
in your bag,
all limp.

369

[Snoring]

[Fife and drums
playing]

371
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,551
What the heck
was that?

372
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,185
On your feet.

373
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,138
Come on,
on your feet.

374
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:49,283
John, take
that shirt off.

375
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,436
We're military.

376
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,877
Where are we?

377
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:52,997
Crown point.

378
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,335
Get over
with the scouts.

379
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,161
Kankaba sick indian.

380
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,331
Kankaba so, so sick.

381
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,804
Of course you're sick.

382
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,725
I've never
seen an indian

383
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,544
need a coat of paint
worse than you do.

384
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,824
Where are my maps?

385
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,545
Major rogers took care
of them for you.

386
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,826
Major rogers?

387
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,940
The indian fighter?

388
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,509
Say,

389
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,359
is he the fella that mixed
that panther juice?

390
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:21,306
He brought you here
with that indian scout.

391
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,188
That indian got drunk
and went over the hill.

392
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,557
If you let
one indian get away,

393
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:27,998
they'll all get away.

394
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:31,008
So major rogers went
after that indian
hisself.

395
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,481
The smartest
indian alive

396
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,203
can't think half as much
like an indian

397
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,611
as major rogers can.

398
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:39,365
We're going to albany,
and i want those maps.

399
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,581
All right.

400
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,810
Come along, and we'll
get them for you.

401
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,979
Rogers thinks
we're drunk enough

402
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,932
to join those redcoats,
he's crazy.

403
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,822
You mean
them clay dolls?

404
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:54,256
No. Major rogers
ain't no redcoat.

405
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:56,625
Haven't you heard
of rogers' rangers?

406
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,027
They fight indians mostly,
don't they?

407
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,179
Indians? Hah!

408
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,620
They do everything
mostly.

409
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,702
Look over there.

410
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,592
Mcneil, where
do you think

411
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,545
major rogers
will take us?

412
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,843
One man's guess is as
good as another's.

413
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,636
Well, here we are.

414
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:19,681
Wait outside,
sergeant.

415
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,025
Yes, sir.

416
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,515
Good morning, gentlemen.

417
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,591
Anything more i can
do for you, command me.

418
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,440
You can return my maps
and sketchbook

419
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,490
and explain
why we're here.

420
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,955
I owed you both
a good turn.

421
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:38,381
I콘s no good turn
i can make out.

422
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,609
Don't you know
we're fighting a war?

423
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:44,497
The woods
are full of indians

424
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,291
who'd enjoy
using your hair

425
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,693
to make their girls
look up to them.

426
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,575
I see you've left
a girl at home.

427
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,425
It wouldn't be right
for you to go home
without your hair.

428
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,659
There are no hostile indians
between here and albany.

429
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,068
Well,
suppose there aren't.

430
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,437
I need a man
who can make maps.

431
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:02,878
I need him bad.

432
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,800
If you'd join
my rangers

433
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,745
and make a map for me
now and then,

434
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,564
i'd show you
all the indians
you could paint.

435
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,413
Of course, my rangers
are a pretty rough lot,

436
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,815
maybe too rough
for an educated man.

437
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,288
He ain't that educated,

438
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,689
and we can take care
of ourselves.

439
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,579
Then you'll take
to my rangers

440
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,372
like a duck
to water.

441
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:24,813
They wear
fancy uniforms

442
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,734
and eat like
major generals.

443
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,135
Sometimes there's
quite a spell
between meals,

444
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,378
but that only
whets your appetite.

445
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:34,260
Now and then
they have to kill
an indian or two.

446
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,661
I want to paint
live indians.

447
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,063
All right. When you
see an indian,

448
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:41,913
you paint him alive
as long as you
feel safe.

449
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,866
When he gets
too close,

450
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,275
let him have it

451
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,677
and then finish him
with a hatchet.

452
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,078
Well, tha콘s just
plain common sense.

453
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,551
We're going out
tonight

454
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,991
and in whaleboats.

455
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,874
You won't even
have to walk
to start with,

456
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:58,660
just a pleasure boat
ride on the lake.

457
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,094
You can come along
as mapmaker

458
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,496
in boat number one
with me.

459
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,904
How about it?

460
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,305
Good. We'll endeavor
to teach you things

461
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:08,970
that harvard college
overlooked.

462
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,382
Your orders, major.

463
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,265
I presume
you've planned
your movement.

464
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,684
We go up the lake
far as we can
with the boats.

465
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,989
The enemy will be
watching the lake,

466
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,871
but we'll row by night
and hide by day.

467
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,721
When we leave the boats,
we'll take our chances.

468
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,354
If we move fast

469
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,755
we can do wha콘s
got to be done.

470
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,197
Sir william johnson

471
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,599
thinks you ought
to wait until spring.

472
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,520
General amherst, they
expect me next spring.

473
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,889
Tha콘s why i want
to move now.

474
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:44,291
As his majesty's
superintendent
of indian affairs,

475
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:46,117
i speak
with some authority.

476
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,670
In my opinion,
you haven't a chance now.

477
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:50,887
General amherst,

478
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:53,769
speaking for my men
and for myself,

479
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,107
those red hellions
up there

480
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:59,662
have come down and hacked
and murdered us,

481
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,063
burned our homes,
stolen women,

482
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,536
brained babies,
scalped stragglers,

483
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:08,308
and roasted officers
over slow fires
for five years.

484
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:10,517
If you were
in our place,

485
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,958
what would you do?

486
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,359
By jove, i'd go
after them.

487
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,768
Thank you, sir.

488
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,401
Well, then,
inspection.

489
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:22,526
I've made it appear
the usual thing

490
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,600
in case enemy spies
are watching the fort.

491
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,132
Prepare
for inspection!

492
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:34,373
Present your firearms!

493
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,496
Your scouts seem
anxious enough

494
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:42,090
to hit the trail.

495
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,100
Where did these mohawks
come from, sir?

496
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,341
Sir william's
offered them as scouts.

497
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:12,255
Are they scouting for me
or for sir william?

498
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,657
Do you imply
my mohawks
aren't loyal?

499
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,097
They're loyal to you,

500
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,467
and you and i
have never agreed

501
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,869
upon the best way
to deal with indians.

502
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,430
I콘s crown policy.
Take them along.

503
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:24,775
Yes, sir.

504
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,266
Mr. Ritchie, my compliments
to the command.

505
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:29,803
Dismissed.

506
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,877
Dismiss the battalion.

507
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,279
Colors,
right wheel!

508
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,776
Shoulder
your firearms!

509
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,835
To the right,
face!

510
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,781
Forward harch!

511
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,223
Number three company,

512
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,015
to the left, face!

513
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,634
My compliments
to your men, major.

514
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,755
Dismissed.

515
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,061
I shall be sorry
to lose them.

516
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,950
We'll be back
in october.

517
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,423
When do you start?

518
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,825
When the last glow
of the sun

519
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,938
has left
the western sky.

520
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,310
Rangers.

521
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,592
Number six boat.

522
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,289
Number four boat.

523
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:27,602
Number six.

524
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,563
Number seven.

525
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,651
Number seven.

526
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:30,868
Come on,
number seven.

527
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,276
Where we going?

528
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:34,711
Think the major tells
before starting out?

529
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:36,088
He ain't a fool.

530
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,530
We're in
number one boat.

531
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,643
There it is.
Get in.

532
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,598
Take your places, men.

533
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,512
Number 13
filled and ready.

534
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:50,433
Number 16
filled and ready.

535
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,323
Number 14
filled and ready.

536
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:54,244
Number 12
filled and ready.

537
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,198
Number 10
filled and ready.

538
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,087
Number one
filled and ready.

539
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,040
Anybody dead
in number 17?

540
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:01,482
Maybe they
aren't going.

541
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,370
Number 17
filled and ready.

542
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,324
All right.
Send them off.

543
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:07,085
Push off, men.

544
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,686
Up oars, men.

545
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:20,407
Buttonmould bay.

546
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:53,004
Turn in here.

547
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:56,814
Captain, you'll
post sentries
on the ridge.

548
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,255
Four to watch

549
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,177
and two to sleep
by turn.

550
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,547
No fires, no cooking,
no smoking.

551
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,820
Have the men
get some sleep.

552
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,773
We won't move
till dark.

553
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,490
Does anyone know
where we're going?

554
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,963
Hard to say, son.

555
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,243
Suogataw.

556
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,652
Where's that?

557
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:44,142
I콘s as good a name
for nowheres as any.

558
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,063
Webster got a letter
yesterday.

559
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:47,506
His wife died.

560
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:50,388
He's not feeling
very good.

561
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,789
Oh, tha콘s too bad.

562
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:55,670
Yes, i suppose a man
does get attached
to a woman

563
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:58,745
after he's lived with her
a few years.

564
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:01,723
Where'd you come from?

565
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,259
Portsmouth.

566
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,718
I콘s funny i never
seen you before.

567
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:08,961
I was born
in portsmouth.

568
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,849
I been away
to harvard college.

569
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:11,874
Harvard?

570
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,275
No wonder
you don't
sound right.

571
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,838
How'd you
come to join
the rangers?

572
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:17,990
Wiseman clagett.

573
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,495
Who?

574
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,897
That skunk clagett,
you know him?

575
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,515
He tried to put me
in jail.

576
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,468
Then when you go home,

577
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,870
some of us better
go with you.

578
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,279
If clagett says anything,

579
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,457
we'll take his jail
to pieces,

580
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:35,378
just to give him
the idea.

581
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:36,851
Yeah.
You say when.

582
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,309
These fellas aren't
so bad, after all.

583
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,624
Towne. Major wants you.

584
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,444
Got buzzards bay there?

585
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,239
We'll make it tonight.

586
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,281
That isn't
very far, sir.

587
00:27:57,346 --> 00:28:00,291
Better to take your time
going 10 miles
and make it

588
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:02,660
than it is
trying to go 30

589
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:05,062
is such a hurry
that you don't.

590
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:08,104
These frenchmen pop out
of the water like frogs.

591
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:15,181
Want to paint
some indians?

592
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:17,583
I don't see
any indians, major.

593
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:19,280
Then you'd better
keep looking.

594
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:22,129
If they see you first,
you'll lay where
they leave you.

595
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,211
We don't stop
for funerals.

596
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:35,322
Just what did they
teach you at harvard

597
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,756
about
a northwest passage?

598
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,646
Why, how
the early explorers

599
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:42,047
looked for
a shortcut by water

600
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,520
through america
to japan,

601
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,961
but they all failed.

602
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,458
Of course. There
is no shortcut.

603
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:50,373
The only true route
to the western ocean

604
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,870
will be found by men
who break trails

605
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,183
and fight indians.

606
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:56,969
Tha콘s my aim when
all this is over.

607
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,858
There.
Now you can see

608
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:01,197
what the enemy
looks like.

609
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,392
Are those frenchmen?

610
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,986
They look like
toy soldiers.

611
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,996
They see our boats,
you'll find out
different.

612
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,058
Get down, men.

613
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:35,459
Keep your fingers
on your triggers.

614
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,925
Don't fire unless
they see us.

615
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:04,278
Ah-ah-ah...

616
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:06,905
[muffled sneeze]

617
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,528
Better get some sleep.

618
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:19,970
Yes, sir.

619
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:24,325
Don't you
ever sleep?

620
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,469
Uh-huh, sometimes.

621
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,259
On your feet.

622
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:35,116
Come on, men.
Come on.

623
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,037
We're moving out.

624
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,927
Muffle your oars
and oarlocks.

625
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,552
Come on, towne,
get up.

626
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:43,025
On your feet.

627
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,466
Muffle oars
and oarlocks.

628
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,387
Muffle that oar
tight, jesse,

629
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,277
so the leather
doesn't slip.

630
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,166
Can't have
any squeaks
tonight.

631
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:52,600
We're slipping
by the french,
eh, major?

632
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:54,041
They're camped
ahead somewheres.

633
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,450
The lake's as narrow

634
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,884
as the neck
of a gin bottle.

635
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:00,765
We've got to sneak by
without the rattle
of a button.

636
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:03,006
We mustn't even
hear ourselves breathe.

637
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:05,408
Put some grease
on that leather.

638
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:06,529
Yes, major.

639
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,970
Wrap wool around that.

640
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,603
Leather against leather
squeaks.

641
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,248
We can
breathe easy now.

642

we passed last night.

There must be more frenchmen
ahead of us.

get around him

and you were going to need
your boats again bad,

694
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:24,359
what would you do?

695

the boats with me

as great warriors.

They've come
a long journey

714
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,976
from their homes
in the mohawk valley,

thought they had come
to raise their hatchets

We trusted them to find
the french's hiding place.

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,255
They returned saying
they'd seen nothing,

00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:32,688
yet three french war boats
were in the way,

721
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:34,130
enough to kill us all.

understand
there is time
make war

and time
not make war.

make war.

Ohh.

00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,284
Well, now we understand
why sir william johnson

732
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,686
sent our brothers
the mohawks to join us.

733
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,087
He sent them
to drink our rum,

734
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,560
eat our food,
and do nothing.

735
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:09,417
Since they won't
obey orders,

736
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,338
they must return
to crown point.

If they tell the real reason
they came back,

738
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,045
general amherst
might have them shot,

739
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:17,999
so they'll say
they became sick.

740
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,401
It may seem remarkable
that all of the mohawks

741
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:21,682
became sick.

742
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:24,084
They may be called old women
for doing so.

743
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,036
Better to be called
old women

744
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,094
than to be shot.

745
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,527
They will return at once
by land.

746

half as good
as a weasel,

discipline's gone,
everything's gone.

you're going back.

789
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,738
Report to general amherst
that you got sick, too.

790
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:11,100
You're sick,
and so is every man
with a powder burn

791
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:13,342
who goes back
with you.

792

i'm putting you in charge
of all these sick men.

You'll start
back at once.

795
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:26,470
Major, i'd like
to say a word.

796
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:27,430
Say it.

797
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,840
Counting the mohawks,

798
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,794
you're sending back
40 men.

to lose that many,

Couldn't you...

802
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,487
reconsider
those orders?

803
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:40,368
I can still see
out of one eye.

804
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,809

you're going back

00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,722
because you're in
no condition to go on,

806
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:47,124
but most of you
are going back

807
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,014
because you can't
maintain discipline.

808
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:51,416
I'd make this expedition
with 50 men.

809
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:52,889
Yes, with 10 men.

810
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:54,810
I'd do more
with those 10

811
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:57,660
than i could with 200
who didn't obey orders.

812
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,061
All the men
in this detachment
are rangers.

813
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,535
Do you understand?

814
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,416
They're not englishmen
or highlanders or irishmen.

815
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,377
They're rangers.

816
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,715
And if i find
two men leading together

817
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,123
as americans or englishmen,

818
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:11,076
by heavens,
i'll send them back

819
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:13,479
if we're within 20 feet
of where we're going.

820
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:14,407
Dismissed.

821
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,880
Injured men
fall in there.

822
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:18,282
The rest of us
will push on.

823
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:21,164
We can't risk
being bottled up
in a little stream.

824
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:22,125
Fall in!

825
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,238
Follow me to the boats!

826
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,568
Any orders, sir?

827
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:04,490
Have them
cover the boats well.

828
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:05,610
Yes, sir.

829
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:08,172
Well, captain,

830
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:11,534
this is as far as we can go
with the boats.

831
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,935
Have every man
fill his meal bag.

832
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,817
Assemble all ranks
at the base of split rock

833
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:18,259
in full marching kit.

834
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:19,379
Very good, sir.

835
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:20,533
Captain jacobs, kankaba.

836
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,006
Men, you've followed me
faithfully

837
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,447
and without questions,

838
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:37,887
and i appreciate it.

839
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,809
Now the time has come

840
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,212
for you to know
where we're going,

841
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:45,285
although some of you
probably have already guessed.

842
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:48,680
Here's general amherst

843
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,633
and our forces
at crown point.

844
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,035
Here's lake champlain
and missisquoi bay

845
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,443
where we are now.

846
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,325
Up here is
the st. Lawrence river

847
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,286
and canada.

848
00:43:58,351 --> 00:43:59,694
And right there

849
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,064
is the spot
we're headed for...

850
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:04,050
the abanochi indians
at st. Francis.

851
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:06,964
Tha콘s where
we wanted to go, major.

852
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,846
I don't have to tell you
who the abanochis are.

853
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:12,215
Most of you have lost
folks and friends

854
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,136
in indian raids
since '57.

855
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:16,570
You'll find their scalps
at st. Francis.

856
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:18,972
Some of you men
fought in the battle

857
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:20,348
on snowshoes last year.

858
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:21,789
Ask joe turner.

859
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:23,711
He was there.
He'll tell you.

860
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:25,600
They captured lieutenants
crofton and phillips

861
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:27,073
and 20 other rangers.

862
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:28,483
Lieutenant crofton's
brother is here.

863
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,365
He can tell you
what happened to them.

864
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:32,357
Yes, major.

865
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:34,054
I can tell you.

866
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,416
Phillips had
a strip of skin

867
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:38,857
torn upward
from his stomach.

868
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:41,643
They hung him
from a tree
while still alive.

869
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,045
They chopped his men up
with hatchets

870
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,798
and threw the pieces
into the pine.

871
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:49,201
They tore
my brother's arms
out of him.

872
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:52,563
They chopped
the ends of his ribs
away from his backbone

873
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:56,565
and pried them
out through his skin
one by one.

874
00:44:56,631 --> 00:44:58,935
Tha콘s what happened
to crofton and phillips.

875
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,476
But they were soldiers.
Tey had to take their chances.

876
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,201
But your folks
on the border farms,

877
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,512
they weren't
fighting anybody.

878
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,399
They were clearing woods
and plowing

879
00:45:07,464 --> 00:45:08,870
and raising children,

880
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:11,236
trying to make
a home of it.

881
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:12,707
And then one night,

882
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,297
abanochi tomahawks
at the door.

883
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:18,334
If it was over quick,
they were lucky.

884
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,053
Now, if there's
any man here

885
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,971
who doesn't want
to follow me

886
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:24,378
against these indians,

887
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:26,488
he can step out now.

888
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,165
Destroy that map.

889
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:33,012
We'll leave provisions here
for our return.

890
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,442
Take two indians
and watch the boats.

891
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:38,320
If the french find them,
notify me quickly.

892
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,717
Well, men, you won't have
any boats to row,

893
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:43,116
and you won't have any time
to sit down.

894
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,035
You won't be bothered
with blisters

895
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,953
where you got them now.

896
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:48,392
We're going
through the swamps

897
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,758
so we won't leave
any tracks.

898
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:51,750
Number one squad!

899
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:53,635
Till we're out
of the bog,

900
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:55,042
we'll march three abreast.

901
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:56,929
Straighten that line!

902
00:45:56,994 --> 00:45:59,359
We'll stop every hour
to save straggling.

903
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,245
We can't afford
to lose anybody

904
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:02,716
on this trip.

905
00:46:02,782 --> 00:46:03,644
All set?

906
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:04,635
Yeah!
Yeah!

907
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,787
Forward!

908
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:41,087
We'll go north
all afternoon.

909
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,436
Should strike some
shallow water by evening.

910
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,372
Mosquitoes
don't bite you,
do they?

911
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:57,332
Nope.

912
00:46:57,396 --> 00:47:00,209
You put something on
to keep them off?

913
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:01,616
Rancid bear's grease.

914
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,717
They hate the stink
worse than i do.

915
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:09,930
Thanks.

916
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,561
I'll keep
the mosquitoes.

917
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,522
Get off that dry land.

918
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:31,737
No tracks.

919
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,984
Where does he get
that energy?

920
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:46,894
Don't you wish
you were like him?

921
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:47,853
Heck no.

922
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,963
I'd rather
be like me.

923
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,092
Captain ogden?

924
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:33,290
Captain ogden.

925
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,726
Travel north
by northeast today.

926
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,970
I don't see any reason to
dillydally here any longer.

927
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:45,409
Very good, sir.

928
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:48,863
Tell the men
we'll eat breakfast
on the move.

929
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:51,229
Come on.

930
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:52,667
Hit the trail.

931
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,234
We'll eat
on the march.

932
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,897
Come on, men.

933
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,647
Ohh.

934
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,731
I've slept in
a lot of worse places,

935
00:49:03,796 --> 00:49:05,171
but right now,

936
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,207
i can't recall
just where they was.

937
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,443
All right, men!
On your feet!

938
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:16,585
Get that column formed!

939
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:42,102
Come on.
Keep moving, men.

940
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,916
Too bad this bog
isn't rum and eggnog.

941
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,986
We'd all be mellow
as horse apples.

942
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:53,230
Here.
Save that stuff, man.

943
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,628
Learn to keep going
on a mouthful a day.

944
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,034
Yes, sir, major.

945
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,218
Keep going.

946
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:05,349
Break your leg,
webster?

947
00:50:05,413 --> 00:50:07,171
Yeah, in two places.

948
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,081
Rest here a while?

949
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:11,488
Thought i would.

950
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:13,854
Well, you'll want
some tobacco.

951
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,308
Won't need all that,
major.

952
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,226
Oh, you better
keep it, anyway.

953
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,697
Good luck, webster.

954
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:23,095
Get a redskin for me,
won't you?

955
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,534
Better than that, major.

956
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:26,453
I've got her loaded
with buckshot.

957
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,051
That's the spirit,
webster.

958
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,068
You can't
leave a man behind
like this.

959
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:39,946
Webster knew
what would happen

960
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,417
if he couldn't
keep up.

961
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:44,230
And he understands
that you'd like
to help him, too,

962
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:45,670
that we all would.

963
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:48,548
He understands the same
as i would myself.

964
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,507
Keep going.

965
00:50:49,572 --> 00:50:51,138
Keep going, men.

966
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,866
We'll rest here
a while.

967
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:23,976
I've sent jacobs
on ahead.

968
00:51:25,288 --> 00:51:28,613
Should be near
the st. Francis river.

969
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:30,691
Have the men fall out.

970
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:32,131
Fall out, men!

971
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:33,761
Fall out!
Fall out!

972
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:52,051
Ain't you sick of
sausage and cornmeal?

973
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:53,618
No, can't say i am,

974
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:55,569
seeing this is
all we got.

975
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:58,447
Now, if i had been led
to expect roast turkey,

976
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:00,845
i'd be sick of
sausage and cornmeal,

977
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,083
but not otherwise.

978
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:04,010
[Splash]

979
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:04,969
Major!

980
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,504
Major rogers!

981
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,135
Kankaba!

982
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:13,155
Major!

983
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,114
The boats!

984
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,074
The boats!

985
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,513
What about the boats?

986
00:52:16,577 --> 00:52:18,111
The french
found our boats!

987
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:20,350
Quiet.

988
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:21,757
Captain ogden,
wait a minute.

989
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,228
This concerns
all of us.

990
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:24,666
When did
it happen?

991
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,106
Sundown,
three suns ago.

992
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,024
How many french
and indians?

993
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:28,984
Maybe 500.

994
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,614
500? 500?
500? 500?

995
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,837
Well, men, the french think
they've trapped us.

996
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:43,788
They think
they've cut us off

997
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:46,186
and that this is the end
of rogers' rangers.

998
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,064
They've been trying
for five years
to wipe us out.

999
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,462
Now they think
they'll have our scalps.

1000
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:52,869
They're probably
counting the money.

1001
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,299
1,000 pounds
for my head alone.

1002
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:57,985
They want us pretty bad,
the french do.

1003
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,895
Want to know how i feel,
i'll tell you.

1004
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,293
We've always done things
they thought were impossible,

1005
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,171
and i don't propose
to stop now.

1006
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:07,259
No!
No!

1007
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:08,729
They think they've got us.

1008
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,127
They think
we're as good as dead.

1009
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:13,525
They haven't got me,
and they haven't got you.

1010
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,964
Not yet, they haven't.

1011
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:16,883
I don't think
they ever will,

1012
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:21,167
if we continue to fight
as we have in the past.

1013
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:22,638
Get out your maps.

1014
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:23,598
Yes, sir.

1015
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:24,749
Lieutenant mcmullen...

1016
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,013
that's a bad knee,
lieutenant.

1017
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,452
You'll never make it.

1018
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,850
There's
nothing the matter
with my knee.

1019
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,289
Good.

1020
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:43,039
I'm sending you
back to crown point
with a message.

1021
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:45,533
Remember this map
is a big inverted "v."

1022
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,484
We're going up
to st. Francis.

1023
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:49,626
Then we'll start down
past lake memphremagog.

1024
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:52,280
Tell general amherst
to send food for 150 men

1025
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:53,751
to old fort wentworth

1026
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,117
or where it was
if it's fallen down.

1027
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:57,556
Circle around the french,

1028
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,913
even if you have to make
a 50-mile detour.

1029
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:02,320
They'll be following us.

1030
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:04,270
Take keely and wilson
with you.

1031
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:06,189
They're too sick
to go on.

1032
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:09,067
Don't tell them the message
unless you have to.

1033
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:10,985
If the french take you,

1034
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:13,863
don't let them know
how we plan to get back

1035
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:15,303
no matter what they do.

1036
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:16,709
You've got to get through.

1037
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,619
Provisions for 150 men
at fort wentworth.

1038
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:21,506
You're coming back
the eastern leg

1039
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:22,977
past lake memphremagog.

1040
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,903
That's right.

1041
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,855
That's how
we'll come back

1042
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,709
if we come back.

1043
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:29,596
Good luck.

1044
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,587
Goodbye, major.

1045
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:32,505
Keely! Wilson!

1046
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,615
We're moving!

1047
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,822
Big river.

1048
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:38,741
That'll be
the st. Francis.

1049
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,619
Tell captain ogden
to have the men fall in.

1050
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:43,057
We'll cross at once.

1051
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:44,177
Yes, sir.

1052
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:48,813
Forward, men!

1053
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:50,348
Forward!

1054
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:22,387
We ought to be about
15 miles above town.

1055
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,722
How many rafts
shall we make, sir?

1056
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:26,640
We got no time
for rafts.

1057
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:28,559
Have the men
plug their muskets.

1058
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:29,966
We'll wade it.

1059
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:31,916
How can we wade that?

1060
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:32,843
Well...

1061
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,314
you could,
couldn't you,

1062
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,712
if you had
a good stout chain

1063
00:55:36,777 --> 00:55:38,631
stretched across
to hang on to?

1064
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,061
Sure, major,
but we ain't got
no chain.

1065
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,468
Well,
we'll make one.

1066
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:45,346
We'll make
a human chain,
man by man.

1067
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,223
I don't know
that it's ever
been done before,

1068
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:51,101
but that's no reason
why it can't be.

1069
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,020
I'll see
what it's like.

1070
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:54,938
Now, ain't he a caution?

1071
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,857
We ferry boats
over a hill

1072
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,265
where a panther
couldn't crawl.

1073
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:00,662
Now we make a chain
across a river

1074
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:02,677
where a fish
couldn't swim.

1075
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:16,042
All right.

1076
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,961
Take your indians
downstream.

1077
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:20,328
If anybody drowns,
get them.

1078
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:21,798
Can't have any bodies

1079
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:24,804
floating down
the st. Francis
to give warning.

1080
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,327
Ogden!
Yes, sir!

1081
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:32,894
Pick your best men.

1082
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:40,313
Come on, men!

1083
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:42,038
Grab a hand!

1084
00:56:56,749 --> 00:57:00,137
Take a good hold, men.
Now, don't let go.

1085
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:02,202
How about you, towne?

1086
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:05,272
Do you feel husky enough
to be the first man over?

1087
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:06,903
Yes, sir.

1088
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,434
When you get
on the other side,

1089
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:14,864
get out your notebook
and keep count.

1090
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:30,340
Yes, sir.

1091
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:33,986
Keep your feet, men!

1092
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:27,609
Get that man!

1093
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:45,259
Fill it in, men!
Fill in that break!

1094
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:02,303
Come on.
We got to keep moving.

1095
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:03,741
It's boyle. He's sick.

1096
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:05,532
I'll go and get him.

1097
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:07,259
Stay where you are.

1098
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:09,178
We'll have to leave him.

1099
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:11,288
Boyle, keep traveling east,

1100
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:13,941
try to keep out of
the way of the french.

1101
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,404
They'll be following us.

1102
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:17,459
Good luck!

1103
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:19,345
Come on, avery.

1104
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,072
We've got to keep moving.

1105
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:28,971
When you get across,

1106
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:31,560
tell the men
to pull us over.

1107
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,183
Well done, major.

1108
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:26,463
Well done, major.

1109
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:27,901
Nice work,
major.

1110
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:29,820
Shall we bury
the dead, sir?

1111
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:32,698
No time for funerals.
Hide them in the bushes.

1112
01:01:32,763 --> 01:01:33,657
Yes, sir.

1113
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:35,575
What do you make of it?

1114
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,494
142... 5 are
without muskets.

1115
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,902
Not bad.
Could be worse.

1116
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:41,811
I could take quebec
with 142 men like these.

1117
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:44,689
Now draw your loads
and reload with buckshot.

1118
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:46,607
We're heading
for st. Francis.

the hymnbook in church.

is in our favor.

Even the dogs
can't smell us.

1160

Lucky thing
for the dogs.

1161
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:26,166
We're to
wipe out this town,

1162

and kill them dead.

Don't kill
our own indians
or the white captives.

1165
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:38,509
Our indians will have
white crosses on their backs.

if we expect
to stay alive.

1170

All of it.

going to do.

I'll advance
with 50 men and torches.

1177

We'll fire the village, then
move to the river's edge

01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,072
and hold the beach.

if they try
to escape this way.

01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:15,057
I'm to barricade
the river road
above the village.

1183
01:05:15,122 --> 01:05:16,944
I'll block
the downstream end.

that tortured my brother.

was so well-trained

that it kept
firing and reloading
all by itself.

and never pulled the trigger.

01:17:10,035 --> 01:17:11,888
Tell them
i'm letting them go

1287
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:14,287
so they can
give a message
to their people.

1288
01:17:14,351 --> 01:17:17,164
Say that
i destroyed their town
as a lesson.

1289
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:19,562
Tell them if they ever
send their warriors

1290
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:21,481
to take the scalps
of our people,

1291
01:17:21,546 --> 01:17:23,176
i'll have no mercy
next time.

1292
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,798
[Speaking mohawk]

1293
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:27,172
We attacked at 5:17.

1294
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:29,571
It's 6:10 now,
and we're still here.

1295
01:17:29,636 --> 01:17:31,968
Assemble the men.
We've got to get moving.

1296
01:17:32,034 --> 01:17:33,887
Where's towne?
Have you seen towne?

1297
01:17:33,952 --> 01:17:35,806
Langdon towne!

1298
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,204
Take two men
and burn the fort.

1299
01:17:38,269 --> 01:17:39,643
Slim!

1300
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:41,561
You can't use
all those moccasins.

1301
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:43,704
I'll keep them
for you.

1302
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:45,462
Langdon!

1303
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:47,125
Langdon!

1304
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:51,347
Crofton, have you
seen langdon towne?

1305
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:52,753
No!

1306
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,994
Langdon!

1307
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:03,977
Langdon!

1308
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:12,962
Langdon.

1309
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:15,616
I let him
see me first.

1310
01:18:15,681 --> 01:18:17,982
How does it feel, son?

1311
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,381
Well, sort of like...

1312
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:23,610
i spilled
hot soup on myself.

1313
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:28,981
We got to travel.

1314
01:18:29,047 --> 01:18:30,484
Come on.

1315
01:18:30,549 --> 01:18:32,787
Ow!

1316
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,205
Put your weight
on me now.

1317
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:47,879
We won't say
nothing to the major
about this.

1318
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,333
Come in here!

1319
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:54,594
All right!
Get them in the boats!

1320
01:18:58,848 --> 01:19:01,117
We're ready
to go, major.

1321
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:03,515
Don't any of
these red hellions

1322
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,955
have man-sized feet?

1323
01:19:05,019 --> 01:19:06,393
Lieutenant avery!

1324
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,832
Captain ogden!

1325
01:19:07,897 --> 01:19:10,486
All right.
Shove off.

1326
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,425
When we get
on the other side,

1327
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,823
i'll build
a stretcher for you.

1328
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,989
Be careful of him.
He's pretty bad wounded.

1329
01:19:24,077 --> 01:19:26,666
I'll be
right behind you,
langdon.

1330
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:44,220
Assemble all the men
over here.

1331
01:19:44,286 --> 01:19:45,627
Line them up,
sergeant.

1332
01:19:45,692 --> 01:19:47,098
Here we go.

1333
01:19:47,163 --> 01:19:48,026
Line up!

1334
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,017
Captain's orders!

1335
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:49,976
Over here!

1336
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:53,110
[Shouting]

1337
01:19:53,175 --> 01:19:55,444
Get out of the water!
Out of those canoes!

1338
01:19:55,508 --> 01:19:56,403
Out! Out!

1339
01:19:56,468 --> 01:19:58,002
Out of those canoes!

1340
01:20:06,828 --> 01:20:08,171
Hurry up, men.

1341
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:10,121
Join your companies
and report at once.

1342
01:20:10,186 --> 01:20:11,656
Assemble over here.

1343
01:20:20,674 --> 01:20:22,527
How many men missing?

1344
01:20:22,592 --> 01:20:23,486
Seven, sir.

1345
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:25,117
Two.

1346
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:26,108
Three, sir.

1347
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:27,068
Four.

1348
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,283
16.

1349
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:29,722
It might be worse.

1350
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:31,321
Towne's wounded.

1351
01:20:31,386 --> 01:20:34,038
He's lying there, sir.

1352
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:41,233
Now pay attention.

1353
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:44,111
Pretty soon
there'll be 500 frenchmen
and indians back here

1354
01:20:44,176 --> 01:20:46,925
looking for
their silverware
and sunday britches.

1355
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,427
[Laughter]

1356
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,314
We've got to
keep ahead of them,

1357
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,745
and we've got
to get to food.

1358
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,622
How do you aim
to get us back, major?

1359
01:20:55,688 --> 01:20:57,541
Go any way
but that swamp again.

1360
01:20:57,606 --> 01:20:59,939
Then we'll strike out
for lake memphremagog.

1361
01:21:00,004 --> 01:21:01,986
Then we'll go
to old fort wentworth
and food.

1362
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,863
Did you say food?
How far is it, major?

1363
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:08,572
We ought to be able
to step into the lake
in 10 days.

1364
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:11,418
You can
rest your stomachs
all the way.

1365
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:15,287
When we get there,
maybe we can stop
to hunt and fish.

1366
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:17,142
Salmon, trout,
and deer steaks.

1367
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,061
Will that suit everybody?

1368
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,020
Oh, yeah.

1369
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,939
All right.
Before we start,

1370
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,336
every man eat
a handful of corn.

1371
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:25,776
That's a banquet.

1372
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,357
What do you think
the french will eat
at st. Francis?

1373
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:32,170
Nothing but roast indians.

1374
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:34,409
All right, ogden!
Start them south!

1375
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,328
Right...

1376
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,766
face!

1377
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,205
Right face!

1378
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,644
Right face!

1379
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:41,572
Right face!

1380
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:42,883
Forward!

1381
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:43,809
Forward!

1382
01:21:43,874 --> 01:21:44,801
Forward!

1383
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:45,760
Forward!

1384
01:21:45,825 --> 01:21:46,943
March!

1385
01:21:48,223 --> 01:21:49,597
Didn't you
hear assembly?

1386
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:51,036
Join your company,
marriner.

1387
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:51,995
Langdon's wounded.

1388
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,434
I'll look after him.

1389
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:55,033
I ain't going
to leave him.

1390
01:21:55,098 --> 01:21:57,911
Another word
and i'll have you shot.

1391
01:21:57,976 --> 01:21:59,542
Join your company.

1392
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:04,690
Yes, sir.

1393
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:08,271
Don't give up, son.

1394
01:22:14,284 --> 01:22:16,329
Are you hurt bad?

1395
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:21,893
That's the first thing
i've had in my stomach
in days.

1396
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:23,971
Oh!

1397
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,320
Can you walk?

1398
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:31,006
You know my orders.

1399
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,884
I can't let the men
carry extra burdens.

1400
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:36,473
Have you tried to walk?

1401
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:42,006
How do you know
you can't walk
unless you've tried?

1402
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,436
You know,
when people want to
badly enough,

1403
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,354
they do
all sorts of things

1404
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,273
they didn't know
they could do.

1405
01:22:48,337 --> 01:22:50,159
What's a little piece
of lead

1406
01:22:50,224 --> 01:22:53,037
to a great big
husky fellow like you?

1407
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:54,988
Say...

1408
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:57,866
you've got
a sweetheart at home,
ain't you?

1409
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,743
Well, now,
what are you
going to do,

1410
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:02,182
lie here and rot

1411
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:04,100
and let
some other fellow

1412
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,540
take her away from you?

1413
01:23:05,604 --> 01:23:06,467
Hmm?

1414
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:09,377
Where's that book
of yours?

1415
01:23:09,441 --> 01:23:10,815
Let's see.

1416
01:23:10,881 --> 01:23:14,109
Didn't i see the picture
of a pretty girl in here?

1417
01:23:14,174 --> 01:23:17,083
Why, sure i did.

1418
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,358
My, my, my.

1419
01:23:24,054 --> 01:23:27,027
Do you think i'd lie here
like a newborn calf

1420
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:29,425
if i had
a girl like that?

1421
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:31,568
Not me.

1422
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,172
Is she really
as pretty as that?

1423
01:23:36,237 --> 01:23:38,283
Prettier.

1424
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:41,225
Come on.

1425
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:43,047
Come on!

1426
01:23:46,757 --> 01:23:50,081
Now, i'll
help you this far
but no farther.

1427
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:53,951
A ranger puts
his left foot forward.

1428
01:23:55,423 --> 01:23:57,915
Now your right.

1429
01:23:57,981 --> 01:23:59,674
That's the spirit.

1430
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:01,081
Left!

1431
01:24:01,146 --> 01:24:02,999
Right!

1432
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:04,855
Left!

1433
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,261
Right!

1434
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:08,052
Left!

1435
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:09,075
Here, you!

1436
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,601
Whatever your name is,
come over here!

1437
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,520
Bring that
little indian boy.

1438
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:14,447
Right!

1439
01:24:14,512 --> 01:24:15,438
Left!

1440
01:24:15,503 --> 01:24:16,397
Right!

1441
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:18,796
Your name is billy.
Get over here.

1442
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,682
Give this soldier
a little support

1443
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:22,153
until that blood
stops running.

1444
01:24:22,218 --> 01:24:23,593
That's it. Left!

1445
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:24,552
Right!

1446
01:24:24,616 --> 01:24:25,959
In a few days,

1447
01:24:26,023 --> 01:24:28,389
you'll lick any man
in the outfit.

1448
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:29,827
Left! Right!

1449
01:24:29,892 --> 01:24:32,226
I'll see you
at sundown, harvard.

1450
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,185
Left!

1451
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:34,432
Right!

1452
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:54,257
Keep on your feet,
turner.

1453
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,728
They're all you've got

1454
01:24:55,793 --> 01:24:57,838
between you and bread
and molasses.

1455
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,442
I'm glad
you can't see yourself
in those beads, mcneal.

1456
01:25:02,508 --> 01:25:04,809
Ha ha ha!

1457
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:09,093
What have you got in
that knapsack, crofton?

1458
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:10,533
Souvenir.

1459
01:25:10,598 --> 01:25:12,930
You better throw it away
if it's heavy.

1460
01:25:12,995 --> 01:25:14,817
It's not heavy.
It's light.

1461
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:16,448
Ha ha ha!

1462
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:27,767
Rangers...

1463
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:29,110
fall out!

1464
01:25:29,176 --> 01:25:30,677
Make camp!

1465
01:25:30,742 --> 01:25:32,819
Marriner! Beacham!

1466
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:37,584
Yes, sir.

1467
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:48,808
Come on, son.

1468
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:50,342
How are you feeling?

1469
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:52,260
I'm all right.

1470
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:53,220
Ah!

1471
01:25:53,285 --> 01:25:54,659
I'm first-rate.

1472
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:56,162
That's good.

1473
01:25:56,227 --> 01:25:58,848
Don't you think
you better sit down?

1474
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:01,566
No, i better not.

1475
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:03,260
If i sat down,

1476
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:07,065
it might be pretty hard
to get up again.

1477
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:09,623
No, i'd better not.

1478
01:26:12,406 --> 01:26:16,179
You sure ought to be glad
that hole isn't in you.

1479
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:17,905
I guess you're right.

1480
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:20,495
But that's as nice
a place for a hole

1481
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,341
as i could think of
if i thought all day...

1482
01:26:23,406 --> 01:26:25,739
if you have to
have a hole.

1483
01:26:25,804 --> 01:26:27,690
How far have we come?

1484
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:31,047
Oh, about 15 miles,
as near as i can figure.

1485
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:32,966
It's almost sundown,
isn't it?

1486
01:26:33,031 --> 01:26:33,925
Yeah.

1487
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,803
Jesse and me will
take you into camp.

1488
01:26:36,868 --> 01:26:39,201
You go with the women
where you belong.

1489
01:26:39,266 --> 01:26:40,640
I'm fixing his bandage.

1490
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:42,079
I'll tend to that.

1491
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,080
Go on!
Do like i tell you.

1492
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:46,481
Go on! Get out of here!
No! Leave me alone!

1493
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,179
Here, you mink.

1494
01:26:53,244 --> 01:26:55,421
Don't you start
raising cain with these men

1495
01:26:55,485 --> 01:26:57,790
or i'll turn you loose
in the woods.

1496
01:26:57,854 --> 01:26:58,782
Soldier.

1497
01:26:58,848 --> 01:27:00,704
Go ahead.
Turn me loose.

1498
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:02,817
I didn't ask
to come, did i?

1499
01:27:02,882 --> 01:27:05,315
Turn me loose,
why don't you?

1500
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,215
Some of us
could carry him, sir.

1501
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,128
Got a couple of poles i can
fasten a blanket between.

1502
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:14,570
Like a hammock.

1503
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:15,979
I won't do it.

1504
01:27:16,044 --> 01:27:17,900
I'm all right,
i tell you.

1505
01:27:17,965 --> 01:27:20,782
As long as i can
stay on my feet.

1506
01:27:20,848 --> 01:27:22,735
He's right.
If we carried him,

1507
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:24,657
he'd be like
a baby for weeks.

1508
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:27,539
If you can go
15 miles today
with that hole in you,

1509
01:27:27,604 --> 01:27:28,980
you can go anywhere.

1510
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:31,381
How far is it
to lake memphremagog?

1511
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,790
It's about...
ask her.

1512
01:27:32,856 --> 01:27:36,377
It looks like
she's going to
take care of you.

1513
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,796
Harvard,
i'm proud of you.

1514
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,729
You've been eating
too much.

1515
01:27:58,794 --> 01:28:02,027
How much of that corn
have you eaten today?

1516
01:28:02,093 --> 01:28:03,469
I had two handsful.

1517
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:04,910
I got pretty hungry.

1518
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:07,151
Guess i must be
feeling better.

1519
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:09,073
Well, you can't have it.

1520
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:12,371
You'll walk 10 days
on 1 handful a day.

1521
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:14,773
You're not going
to get more now.

1522
01:28:14,838 --> 01:28:17,527
Are we almost
to memphremagog?

1523
01:28:17,591 --> 01:28:20,505
Ask that big moose
up ahead.

1524
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:23,515
There's the lake,
boys!

1525
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,557
Memphremagog,
plenty of fish there!

1526
01:28:26,622 --> 01:28:28,254
We're going to eat!

1527
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:29,408
Food!

1528
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:33,090
There's the lake.

1529
01:28:33,155 --> 01:28:34,115
This way!

1530
01:28:34,179 --> 01:28:36,485
Wait. Where do you
think you're going?

1531
01:28:36,549 --> 01:28:38,054
A mess of trout
for supper.

1532
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:39,527
A mess of french lead

1533
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:41,384
and hatchets for supper,
more likely.

1534
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,049
What's the matter
with you men?

1535
01:28:43,114 --> 01:28:46,411
But, major,
you said when we
reached the lake,

1536
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:49,261
we could stop
to hunt and fish.

1537
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:51,118
Sure you did.
Yeah.

1538
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:52,560
Put yourselves
in the shoes

1539
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,930
of that french commander
that found our boats.

1540
01:28:54,995 --> 01:28:58,580
If he's guessed
we came to memphremagog,
he came here, too.

1541
01:28:58,645 --> 01:29:00,982
I'm going down
with the indians to look.

1542
01:29:01,047 --> 01:29:03,544
The rest of you,
stay here

1543
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:04,889
until i get back.

1544
01:29:04,954 --> 01:29:06,618
Major, my men are
mighty hungry.

1545
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:08,667
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

1546
01:29:08,732 --> 01:29:10,109
They've got corn,
haven't they?

1547
01:29:10,173 --> 01:29:12,510
Captain jacobs,
kankaba.

1548
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:25,992
If you fellas
were smart,

1549
01:29:26,056 --> 01:29:28,105
you wouldn't
have to eat corn.

1550
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:37,584
Hey, there.
Hey, there.

1551
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:39,057
Don't take the red one.

1552
01:29:39,122 --> 01:29:40,690
I'm saving that
for dessert.

1553
01:29:43,157 --> 01:29:44,725
Where's the food?

1554
01:29:46,904 --> 01:29:49,560
Didn't we make it?

1555
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:52,923
Langdon, you're just
in time for a little corn

1556
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:55,453
with the rest
of us roosters.

1557
01:30:16,045 --> 01:30:19,022
See the patch
in that moccasin?

1558
01:30:19,087 --> 01:30:20,943
That moccasin
belonged to webster,

1559
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:23,536
the man we left
in the swamp.

1560
01:30:23,602 --> 01:30:25,426
Same french indian
who killed webster.

1561
01:30:25,491 --> 01:30:27,251
They come here, too.

1562
01:30:27,317 --> 01:30:28,885
Mmm.

1563
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:32,375
You can't expect
the men to keep going

1564
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,745
day in and day out
without food.

1565
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:36,218
A few grains of corn

1566
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:38,107
won't keep their bodies
in condition.

1567
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,477
You said when we got
to lake memphremagog,

1568
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:41,886
we could hunt and fish.

1569
01:30:41,951 --> 01:30:43,327
We've been talking
things over.

1570
01:30:43,392 --> 01:30:45,152
If we can't hunt here,

1571
01:30:45,218 --> 01:30:47,522
we think we should hold
an officers' council

1572
01:30:47,587 --> 01:30:51,269
and take a vote on what's
the best thing to do.

1573
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:54,086
That's regulations,
if you want to do it
that way.

1574
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:57,577
I vote to get to wentworth
as soon as we can.

1575
01:30:57,642 --> 01:30:59,755
But, major, my men
are starving.

1576
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,157
If we don't find
something to eat,

1577
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,566
we won't go
anyplace.

1578
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:04,558
That's right.

1579
01:31:04,623 --> 01:31:06,479
What do you want to do?

1580
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,882
Stay here and fish
and get roasted alive?

1581
01:31:08,946 --> 01:31:12,243
No, sir,
but the men feel
they'll be all right

1582
01:31:12,309 --> 01:31:15,030
if they
could split up
into hunting parties

1583
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,503
and look for game.

1584
01:31:16,568 --> 01:31:17,943
That's what
my detachment thinks.

1585
01:31:18,009 --> 01:31:20,345
We could hunt,
then join up together again

1586
01:31:20,411 --> 01:31:22,203
and meet
anyplace you say.

1587
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,900
[Major rogers]
Your men grumbling, too?

1588
01:31:23,965 --> 01:31:26,782
Not grumbling,
they just want
a little food.

1589
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:28,704
Game's as scarce
as hen's teeth.

1590
01:31:28,768 --> 01:31:31,586
Gone out
of the woods,
i guess.

1591
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,507
A big party
like this

1592
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,300
will drive away
what's left.

1593
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:37,638
Captain ogden,
what's your idea?

1594
01:31:37,703 --> 01:31:41,000
Well, sir, it's pretty hard
to drive hungry men,

1595
01:31:41,065 --> 01:31:45,035
but i think
we'd be better off
if we stick together.

1596
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,540
[Men jeer]

1597
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:47,949
Now, wait a minute.

1598
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:49,775
I agree with ogden.

1599
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,215
We're all pretty hungry,

1600
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,097
but a hungry man
can go on

1601
01:31:54,162 --> 01:31:56,499
a lot longer
than he thinks he can

1602
01:31:56,565 --> 01:31:57,940
if he keeps his courage.

1603
01:31:58,005 --> 01:31:59,830
You know,
i'm pretty hungry myself,

1604
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:01,783
but it's better
to be hungry

1605
01:32:01,848 --> 01:32:04,185
than to be cut up alive
with hatchets.

1606
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,586
We'll be safe when we get
to wentworth.

1607
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:09,724
That's only 100 miles
from here,
as the crow flies.

1608
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,479
But, major,
we ain't crows.

1609
01:32:12,544 --> 01:32:13,919
Wait a minute.

1610
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,290
You know,
this is tricky country.

1611
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:19,364
It would be
a mighty easy place

1612
01:32:19,428 --> 01:32:21,894
for a small party
to get ambushed in.

1613
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:23,334
We'd better vote,
major.

1614
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1615
01:32:24,744 --> 01:32:27,369
All right, we'll vote.

1616
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:29,931
Aye.
Aye.

1617
01:32:29,996 --> 01:32:30,892
Aye.
Aye.

1618
01:32:30,956 --> 01:32:32,910
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

1619
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:40,403
Well, that settles it.

1620
01:32:43,318 --> 01:32:45,847
We'll split up
into four parties.

1621
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:49,625
All detachments
will meet here

1622
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,315
at eagle mountain.

1623
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,197
I'll have maps for you
before you leave.

1624
01:32:55,263 --> 01:32:58,079
And don't miss me
at eagle mountain

1625
01:32:58,145 --> 01:33:01,057
because you'll
never find wentworth
by yourselves.

1626
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:03,460
All right,
get ready to go.

1627
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:05,733
Number one company,
form over here.

1628
01:33:05,797 --> 01:33:07,655
Number two company,
form over here.

1629
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:09,063
Number three company,
over here.

1630
01:33:09,129 --> 01:33:10,216
Sergeant mcnott.

1631
01:33:10,281 --> 01:33:11,177
Yes, sir.

1632
01:33:11,242 --> 01:33:12,617
Send the white women

1633
01:33:12,683 --> 01:33:14,059
with captain jacobs,
sergeant clark,

1634
01:33:14,124 --> 01:33:15,980
and half
of our scouts

1635
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:18,029
straight
across to crown point.

1636
01:33:18,094 --> 01:33:18,958
Sergeant clark.

1637
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:20,303
Yes, sir.

1638
01:33:22,866 --> 01:33:24,242
If them french
and injuns

1639
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,644
would lend me
a boat and bait,

1640
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:28,533
i'd go catch me a trout.

1641
01:33:28,598 --> 01:33:29,910
You ain't hungry,
are you?

1642
01:33:29,975 --> 01:33:31,479
I'd rather not
discuss it.

1643
01:33:31,544 --> 01:33:32,920
You won't starve.

1644
01:33:32,986 --> 01:33:34,938
I'll see to that.

1645
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:37,948
Say, if you got food,
fetch it out.

1646
01:33:38,013 --> 01:33:40,189
No. You ain't
hungry enough yet.

1647
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:48,099
Ha ha ha.

1648
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:53,095
What's the matter
with crofton?

1649
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,728
I don't know, sir.

1650
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:06,352
Crofton!

1651
01:34:08,563 --> 01:34:09,939
No, no, no, no!

1652
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:11,860
That's mine!
That's mine!

1653
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:17,368
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you,

1654
01:34:17,433 --> 01:34:19,450
and i'll eat
your head, too.

1655
01:34:25,471 --> 01:34:26,335
Crofton.

1656
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,192
No, no, no, rogers!

1657
01:34:28,257 --> 01:34:30,818
No, no, no!

1658
01:34:33,157 --> 01:34:34,821
Aah!

1659
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,777
What did he have
in that sack?

1660
01:35:02,842 --> 01:35:05,371
The head of
an abanochi indian.

1661
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:15,201
I'm sending you
with farrington.

1662
01:35:15,267 --> 01:35:16,450
Why, sir?

1663
01:35:16,515 --> 01:35:18,788
Because you've
got an education
and farrington hasn't.

1664
01:35:18,853 --> 01:35:20,261
A man with an education

1665
01:35:20,326 --> 01:35:22,503
isn't apt to get discouraged
and quit

1666
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:23,943
as quickly as one without.

1667
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,865
Don't worry.
You've got one advantage

1668
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,459
over the rest.
They just want to
stay alive,

1669
01:35:28,524 --> 01:35:31,085
but you want to stay alive
and paint pictures.

1670
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,486
It's pretty hard
to destroy a man

1671
01:35:33,551 --> 01:35:35,664
who's got
a real incentive to live.

1672
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:36,624
Yes, sir.

1673
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,546
Give one of those maps

1674
01:35:38,611 --> 01:35:40,916
to each
of the detachment commanders

1675
01:35:40,981 --> 01:35:42,741
and tell them, above all,

1676
01:35:42,806 --> 01:35:44,118
to watch out
for ambush.

1677
01:35:44,183 --> 01:35:45,783
I'll tell them, sir.

1678
01:35:48,538 --> 01:35:51,515
We'll make a ranger
out of you yet.

1679
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:18,062
Major.

1680
01:36:18,128 --> 01:36:19,151
Well?

1681
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:22,193
I'd like to go
and look after
langdon towne.

1682
01:36:22,258 --> 01:36:23,602
You can
help towne more

1683
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:25,075
by fighting off
the french

1684
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,773
than by trying
to look after him

1685
01:36:26,837 --> 01:36:28,470
when he can look
after himself.

1686
01:36:28,535 --> 01:36:29,430
You're right.

1687
01:36:29,496 --> 01:36:31,479
But i'd hate
to be a man

1688
01:36:31,545 --> 01:36:33,561
and always be
as right as you are.

1689
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:35,003
I'm not a man now.

1690
01:36:35,068 --> 01:36:36,828
I'm a soldier
in command of men.

1691
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:40,126
If you ever meet me
when i'm just a man,

1692
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:42,624
you may have to use
a little charity.

1693
01:36:42,689 --> 01:36:44,257
I'm sorry, major.

1694
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:46,658
We'll meet towne
and everybody
at eagle mountain.

1695
01:36:46,724 --> 01:36:47,908
Thank you.

1696
01:37:02,928 --> 01:37:04,496
Let's get
those lizards.

1697
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:18,778
Water's hot, major.

1698
01:37:18,843 --> 01:37:20,443
Good.

1699
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:24,990
What have you got
to put in it?

1700
01:37:25,055 --> 01:37:26,015
Four hawks,

1701
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,360
five squirrels,

1702
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:28,705
eight frogs,

1703
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:29,697
three
partridges,

1704
01:37:29,763 --> 01:37:31,491
a wood sparrow,

1705
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,413
a blue gingky,
27 lizards,

1706
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:35,366
and a hat full
of minnows.

1707
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:37,703
Well, it won't taste
like roast goose,

1708
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,105
but it will take
the hunger cramps away.

1709
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:42,539
Ogden, we're ready
for that rock tripe.

1710
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:44,876
It will kill the taste
of the lizards.

1711
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,061
Yes, sir.

1712
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,928
Come on,
dump them in, men.

1713
01:38:12,994 --> 01:38:15,842
There's more
hungry rangers
on the way.

1714
01:38:15,907 --> 01:38:18,788
Jesse, you can
have my share
of the stew.

1715
01:38:18,854 --> 01:38:20,934
Ain't you
feeling well, son?

1716
01:38:20,999 --> 01:38:23,144
I don't want it.

1717
01:38:23,209 --> 01:38:24,840
I'm going home.

1718
01:38:25,802 --> 01:38:28,139
Home? What are you
talking about?

1719
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:31,310
I'm going home
for supper...

1720
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:32,302
in concord.

1721
01:38:32,368 --> 01:38:35,345
Where do you
think concord is?

1722
01:38:36,467 --> 01:38:38,963
Right over there.

1723
01:38:39,028 --> 01:38:39,988
Look, avery.

1724
01:38:40,053 --> 01:38:41,013
Right over there!

1725
01:38:41,077 --> 01:38:41,974
Avery!

1726
01:38:42,038 --> 01:38:43,606
Let him go.

1727
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,129
You can't catch him,

1728
01:38:47,193 --> 01:38:48,858
and i
won't shoot him.

1729
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:54,494
Where do you
think he'll land?

1730
01:38:54,559 --> 01:38:56,896
Right in the middle
of those hills.

1731
01:38:56,961 --> 01:38:59,714
Maybe next summer,
somebody will find
a leather hair ribbon

1732
01:38:59,779 --> 01:39:01,155
and be christian
enough

1733
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,717
to bury whatever
they find with it.

1734
01:39:04,998 --> 01:39:06,855
Don't swallow
those bones, men.

1735
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,264
If you're stomach's
empty,

1736
01:39:08,329 --> 01:39:10,217
they'll cut
right through you.

1737
01:39:10,283 --> 01:39:12,620
Be at fort wentworth
before long.

1738
01:39:12,684 --> 01:39:14,541
We'll get some real food.

1739
01:39:14,605 --> 01:39:16,173
Be careful, now, men.

1740
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:23,187
Just a little bit.

1741
01:39:24,757 --> 01:39:27,093
I know it's
not chicken broth,

1742
01:39:27,158 --> 01:39:29,975
but get it down
and keep it down.

1743
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,794
Whatever it tastes like,
boys, it's food.

1744
01:39:32,858 --> 01:39:34,235
Hold your nose, son.

1745
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,597
Your stomach will never
know the difference.

1746
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:40,159
It will get you
to wentworth.

1747
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,241
Yo, rangers!

1748
01:39:42,305 --> 01:39:45,090
Yo, rangers!

1749
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:54,953
Grant's detachment, sir.

1750
01:39:55,018 --> 01:39:56,362
Where are the rest?

1751
01:39:56,427 --> 01:39:57,803
Captured.
We shot a moose.

1752
01:39:57,869 --> 01:40:00,109
We were hungry enough
to eat it raw,

1753
01:40:00,174 --> 01:40:02,543
but mcneal started
yelling about stopping
to cook it.

1754
01:40:02,608 --> 01:40:05,393
I guess the french
heard our shot.

1755
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,275
They made us carry it
back to camp.

1756
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,196
Then they tied us up

1757
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:11,926
until they
started killing...

1758
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:15,032
[major rogers]
Go on.

1759
01:40:15,097 --> 01:40:18,874
Well, they gave us
a bone apiece to gnaw on,

1760
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:22,909
but mcneal here
sawed his thongs
in two in the night,

1761
01:40:22,974 --> 01:40:24,830
and he let me loose, too.

1762
01:40:24,896 --> 01:40:26,272
Good work,
mcneal.

1763
01:40:26,337 --> 01:40:27,329
Yes, sir.

1764
01:40:27,394 --> 01:40:28,289
Skunk!

1765
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:29,506
Aah!

1766
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,907
If you'd eaten
that moose raw,

1767
01:40:31,973 --> 01:40:33,413
we'd have something
inside us!

1768
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:34,854
Come on!
Stop that!

1769
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:36,775
Rangers don't
act like that!

1770
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,088
Get up!

1771
01:40:38,153 --> 01:40:39,209
Get up!

1772
01:40:39,274 --> 01:40:41,675
Beats all how
many people there are

1773
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,877
that don't know enough
to thank god
they're still alive!

1774
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:50,481
See anything
of dunbar's men

1775
01:40:50,546 --> 01:40:52,627
or farrington
or towne?

1776
01:40:52,691 --> 01:40:54,740
No, sir,
not a thing.

1777
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:59,191
Eat some of that stew.
You'll feel better.

1778
01:40:59,257 --> 01:41:00,888
Yes, sir.
Come on.

1779
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:08,157
I wonder what
kind of food

1780
01:41:08,222 --> 01:41:10,143
amherst
has sent to
fort wentworth.

1781
01:41:10,208 --> 01:41:14,466
I don't know, but i wished
he sent old cap huff

1782
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:16,676
from studely's tavern
back in portsmouth.

1783
01:41:16,741 --> 01:41:19,526
He's a friend of mine
and langdon towne's.

1784
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:21,448
He'd bring
them big sausages

1785
01:41:21,512 --> 01:41:23,401
and hams
cured almost black,

1786
01:41:23,466 --> 01:41:25,290
chocolate cakes
and ripe cheeses

1787
01:41:25,355 --> 01:41:27,756
and cigars
from the sugar islands.

1788
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:28,781
Yeah.

1789
01:41:28,845 --> 01:41:32,143
That pale brown rum
that makes a man feel

1790
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:35,025
like he was half moose,
half panther

1791
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:36,658
in a touch
of an earthquake.

1792
01:41:36,724 --> 01:41:40,020
You know what we used
to call them minnows

1793
01:41:40,085 --> 01:41:42,902
like we threw
in the stew last night?

1794
01:41:42,968 --> 01:41:45,657
Little stinkpins.

1795
01:41:45,722 --> 01:41:47,514
Aw...

1796
01:41:47,579 --> 01:41:49,916
you always spoil
everything.

1797
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,508
Rogers' rangers!

1798
01:42:07,432 --> 01:42:09,032
Farrington's
detachment, sir.

1799
01:42:09,097 --> 01:42:11,176
Glad to see you,
captain.

1800
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:15,883
Carry on,
men.

1801
01:42:15,948 --> 01:42:17,100
Carry on.

1802
01:42:18,446 --> 01:42:19,533
Where's
towne?

1803
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:22,383
He went back
to see that dunbar
didn't get lost.

1804
01:42:22,448 --> 01:42:23,792
Didn't you wait
for him?

1805
01:42:23,857 --> 01:42:26,321
We waited 12 hours.
Had these men
to think of.

1806
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:27,313
Yeah, but...

1807
01:42:27,378 --> 01:42:29,555
that's quite right.
Give him some food.

1808
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:31,699
Yes, sir.
Come along, captain.

1809
01:42:35,895 --> 01:42:36,822
Marriner.

1810
01:42:36,888 --> 01:42:39,224
You want to look
for towne,

1811
01:42:39,288 --> 01:42:40,729
your duty's
done here.

1812
01:42:40,794 --> 01:42:43,482
Thank you, sir.
I'll get my musket.

1813
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,940
Major rogers!

1814
01:42:47,005 --> 01:42:49,309
Ranger towne!

1815
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:51,038
Langdon!

1816
01:42:51,103 --> 01:42:54,368
How are you, son?

1817
01:42:54,433 --> 01:42:56,001
I was worried
about you.

1818
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:11,434
Glad to see you,
my boy.

1819
01:43:11,498 --> 01:43:13,610
Where's dunbar?

1820
01:43:13,675 --> 01:43:15,531
Ambushed.

1821
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:16,972
I saw what happened,

1822
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:19,341
but i couldn't help him.

1823
01:43:19,407 --> 01:43:21,231
When they cut up dunbar,

1824
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:23,920
he was still alive
and screaming.

1825
01:43:23,985 --> 01:43:25,713
Any of them
get away?

1826
01:43:25,778 --> 01:43:26,673
No.

1827
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,690
They killed them all.

1828
01:43:30,452 --> 01:43:32,340
They were playing ball...

1829
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:33,813
with their heads.

1830
01:43:33,879 --> 01:43:35,926
Playing ball
with their heads?

1831
01:43:40,346 --> 01:43:42,714
You men better dry
your blankets.

1832
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:44,155
If the weather
changes,

1833
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,620
we might have
a little trouble.

1834
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:49,757
We might have
a little trouble.

1835
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,832
<i>We might have
a little trouble.</i>

1836
01:43:52,896 --> 01:43:55,713
I don't know
but what is right.

1837
01:43:55,778 --> 01:43:57,346
Come on, son.

1838
01:44:00,036 --> 01:44:03,333
Towne, you can take over
the orderly book again.

1839
01:44:03,398 --> 01:44:05,734
When did you
make these pictures?

1840
01:44:05,799 --> 01:44:08,136
On the way
to st. Francis...

1841
01:44:08,201 --> 01:44:09,993
about 100 years ago.

1842
01:44:11,275 --> 01:44:12,938
Mcnott.

1843
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:14,668
Kankaba.

1844
01:44:14,732 --> 01:44:17,133
Mmm. I can smell him.

1845
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:19,150
Major robert rogers.

1846
01:44:19,215 --> 01:44:20,494
No flattery either.

1847
01:44:20,559 --> 01:44:22,927
My boy,
you're quite an artist.

1848
01:44:22,993 --> 01:44:25,777
Oh, here's the lady again.
Who is she anyway?

1849
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:28,082
She lives
in portsmouth.

1850
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:29,491
By jove,
she is beautiful.

1851
01:44:29,556 --> 01:44:31,924
Make a man
swallow his tobacco

1852
01:44:31,989 --> 01:44:33,365
just to look at her.

1853
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:34,774
She's proud, though.
Ambitious.

1854
01:44:34,839 --> 01:44:36,247
She knows
what she wants,

1855
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,360
and she's
going to get it.

1856
01:44:46,301 --> 01:44:49,086
Well, men,
we've come all this way,

1857
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:51,519
and there's still 50
of us left.

1858
01:44:51,584 --> 01:44:54,241
That's 50 more than
general amherst expects.

1859
01:44:54,306 --> 01:44:57,122
Now on we go
to fort wentworth.

1860
01:44:57,187 --> 01:44:58,563
Only three days away,

1861
01:44:58,628 --> 01:45:01,444
then all the things
we've dreamed about...

1862
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:02,405
roasted beef,

1863
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:03,846
ham, bacon,

1864
01:45:03,911 --> 01:45:05,350
chocolate, coffee,

1865
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:08,168
and plenty
of hot buttered rum.

1866
01:45:08,233 --> 01:45:09,097
Does that sound good?

1867
01:45:09,162 --> 01:45:10,665
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1868
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:11,818
Then form ranks.

1869
01:45:11,883 --> 01:45:14,027
Number one company,
on your feet.

1870
01:45:14,092 --> 01:45:15,948
Number two company,
fall in.

1871
01:45:16,013 --> 01:45:17,069
Fall in.

1872
01:45:17,134 --> 01:45:18,990
Hurry it along.

1873
01:45:20,207 --> 01:45:21,487
Forward!

1874
01:45:29,717 --> 01:45:31,349
Right, left.

1875
01:45:31,414 --> 01:45:32,918
Right, left.

1876
01:45:32,983 --> 01:45:34,326
Right, left.

1877
01:45:34,391 --> 01:45:35,831
Right, left.

1878
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,464
Right, left.

1879
01:45:37,529 --> 01:45:39,225
Right, left.

1880
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,921
Right, left.

1881
01:45:40,987 --> 01:45:42,971
Right, left.

1882
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,667
Right...

1883
01:45:44,733 --> 01:45:45,692
left.

1884
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:46,813
Right.

1885
01:45:46,878 --> 01:45:48,382
We'll get...

1886
01:45:48,447 --> 01:45:50,367
army rations...

1887
01:45:50,431 --> 01:45:51,616
coffee, sugar...

1888
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:53,568
come on, men, keep moving.

1889
01:45:53,634 --> 01:45:55,650
Stay on your feet, men.

1890
01:45:55,715 --> 01:45:58,787
Come on, men, come on.
Keep moving, men.

1891
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,965
Stay on your feet, men.

1892
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:03,558
Come on, keep moving.
Keep moving.

1893
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:05,383
Keep moving.
We're almost there.

1894
01:46:05,448 --> 01:46:07,111
Right, left.

1895
01:46:07,177 --> 01:46:08,776
Right, right.

1896
01:46:08,842 --> 01:46:10,442
Left, right, left.

1897
01:46:10,506 --> 01:46:12,074
Shut up!

1898
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:14,156
Left, right.

1899
01:46:14,221 --> 01:46:16,205
Left, right.

1900
01:46:17,519 --> 01:46:18,990
1, 2.

1901
01:46:19,055 --> 01:46:20,527
1, 2.

1902
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:21,968
1, 2.

1903
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:23,440
We're almost there.

1904
01:46:23,506 --> 01:46:25,042
1, 2.

1905
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:26,226
1, 2.

1906
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:27,186
Wentworth!

1907
01:46:27,252 --> 01:46:28,499
Fort wentworth!

1908
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,689
There she is, men,

1909
01:46:37,753 --> 01:46:39,737
just as i told you.

1910
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:42,939
Only two miles more,
then food.

1911
01:46:43,004 --> 01:46:45,949
Come on, now.
Quick on your feet.

1912
01:46:46,014 --> 01:46:47,678
No falling behind,
men.

1913
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,808
[Bang]

1914
01:46:54,275 --> 01:46:55,650
[Bang]

1915
01:46:55,715 --> 01:46:57,507
Fort, it's rogers!

1916
01:46:57,572 --> 01:47:00,613
Put it on the table.
We're all ready.

1917
01:47:00,678 --> 01:47:04,871
Come on, redcoats,
bring out the roast beef!

1918
01:47:06,825 --> 01:47:07,913
[Cough]

1919
01:47:09,002 --> 01:47:10,410
[Bang]

1920
01:47:14,605 --> 01:47:17,294
It's rogers!

1921
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:19,502
Fort wentworth,
it's rogers!

1922
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:21,488
Rogers' rangers!

1923
01:47:22,674 --> 01:47:24,113
Fort wentworth...

1924
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,340
fort, it's rogers.

1925
01:47:29,429 --> 01:47:32,182
Rogers' rangers,
back from st. Francis!

01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,568
Where is everyone?

1927
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:40,186
Fort... fort,
it's rogers!

1928
01:47:40,251 --> 01:47:42,555
Rogers' rangers from...

1929
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:44,765
hey, we're back.

1930
01:48:14,605 --> 01:48:16,014
Almost there.

1931
01:48:16,078 --> 01:48:19,183
I never thought
we would eat again.

1932
01:48:19,248 --> 01:48:21,584
Hope there will be
some steak.

1933
01:48:21,649 --> 01:48:23,921
I'll take gravy.

1934
01:48:35,993 --> 01:48:38,041
Rangers...

1935
01:48:38,107 --> 01:48:39,482
attention.

1936
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:44,188
Come on, men, fall in.

1937
01:48:44,254 --> 01:48:47,070
Press it up,
press it up here.

1938
01:48:47,135 --> 01:48:48,607
Listen up.

1939
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:50,143
Forward.

1940
01:48:50,209 --> 01:48:51,360
March.

1941
01:48:57,380 --> 01:48:59,204
Steady, men.

1942
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,390
Take care.

1943
01:49:01,895 --> 01:49:03,015
Steady.

1944
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,024
Take care, men.

1945
01:49:09,227 --> 01:49:12,172
Rangers...

1946
01:49:12,236 --> 01:49:13,964
halt.

1947

Left face.

1948
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:20,048
Quarter arms.

1949
01:49:20,113 --> 01:49:21,969
The first thing
we've got to do

1950
01:49:22,034 --> 01:49:23,890
is get this fort in shape

1951
01:49:23,955 --> 01:49:25,299
for amherst and his men

1952
01:49:25,364 --> 01:49:26,899
when they arrive
with the food.

1953
01:49:26,964 --> 01:49:29,076
Farrington's men
will clean up the grounds.

1954
01:49:29,142 --> 01:49:31,222
Rogers' men will look
for roots and fish.

1955
01:49:31,287 --> 01:49:33,975
Lots of roots here.
Good to eat, too.

1956
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,761
Marriner, take some men
and burn this litter.

1957
01:49:36,826 --> 01:49:38,875
Fall out
and get to work.

1958
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:42,972
You heard the order,
men.

1959
01:49:43,037 --> 01:49:44,509
Get to work.

1960
01:49:44,574 --> 01:49:46,911
Major, in the name of god,
let them rest.

1961
01:49:46,975 --> 01:49:48,319
Let them die!

1962
01:49:48,384 --> 01:49:50,785
We've lived on your promises
long enough!

1963
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:53,122
We can't stand
anymore!

1964
01:49:54,532 --> 01:49:55,908
They're right, major.

1965
01:49:55,972 --> 01:49:57,764
We won't do it.

1966
01:49:58,982 --> 01:49:59,877
Get up.

1967
01:49:59,943 --> 01:50:02,279
Get up
and start your fires.

1968
01:50:02,343 --> 01:50:05,128
Fires and warm shelter,
that's something, isn't it?

1969
01:50:05,193 --> 01:50:07,305
Get up.
Stand on your feet

1970
01:50:07,371 --> 01:50:09,226
and do what's to be done.

1971
01:50:09,292 --> 01:50:10,635
You're going
to act like rangers.

1972
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,589
They'll be here
with the food.

1973
01:50:12,653 --> 01:50:14,989
I've never promised
you anything
that you didn't get.

1974
01:50:15,055 --> 01:50:19,376
Until they get here,
you've got to make
this place fit to live in.

1975
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:23,218
Why? Because you're not fit
to go on any farther,

1976
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:24,659
and when that happens,

1977
01:50:24,724 --> 01:50:28,501
you've got to stop
and live here where you are.

1978
01:50:28,566 --> 01:50:32,087
You know, you could be
a lot worse off.

1979
01:50:32,152 --> 01:50:34,392
Towne...
towne's an educated man.

1980
01:50:34,457 --> 01:50:36,825
Wasn't there somebody
in the bible

1981
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:39,707
who went without
any food for 40 days?

1982
01:50:39,772 --> 01:50:41,276
40 days?

1983
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:44,125
I think there was
someone in the bible

1984
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:46,078
who fasted for 40 days.

1985
01:50:46,143 --> 01:50:48,032
Uh, moses, i think.

1986
01:50:48,096 --> 01:50:50,849
There. Do you hear
what towne says?

1987
01:50:50,914 --> 01:50:54,723
Moses went without
the slightest taste
of food for 40 days.

1988
01:50:54,788 --> 01:50:57,125
He didn't have
any good cooked roots.

1989
01:50:57,189 --> 01:51:00,102
He didn't have
a single bite,
did he, towne?

1990
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:02,695
No, not a thing.
No food, no water.

1991
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,649
There. Do you hear that?

1992
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:06,570
No food and no water.

1993
01:51:06,635 --> 01:51:09,195
Look at the water
we've got.

1994
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,635
Good, clean, fresh water.

1995
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:13,485
What do you suppose moses
would have given

1996
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,958
for a mug of it,

1997
01:51:15,023 --> 01:51:17,359
let alone buckets-full
like we've got?

1998
01:51:17,424 --> 01:51:18,800
Instead of lying here,

1999
01:51:18,865 --> 01:51:20,240
doing nothing, giving up,

2000
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:23,155
we should be giving thanks
for what we've got.

2001

2002

i'm not much
of a hand at prayer,

2003
01:51:27,062 --> 01:51:30,358
but maybe i can remember
a few bible verses

2004
01:51:30,423 --> 01:51:32,279
that i've
always believe in

2005

01:57:26,615 --> 01:57:30,425
You're going
to see the red men
of the shining mountains

2087
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:32,825
and those men along
the mighty river oregon...

2088
01:57:32,891 --> 01:57:35,227
red men white men
have never seen before.

2089
01:57:35,292 --> 01:57:37,116
Because we're
going to end up

2090
01:57:37,181 --> 01:57:39,357
by the great
western ocean itself.

2091
01:57:39,422 --> 01:57:42,623
You're going to find a way
across this continent,

2092
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:44,064
a northwest passage.

2093
01:57:44,129 --> 01:57:46,753
You'll see hardwood groves
like cathedrals,

2094
01:57:46,819 --> 01:57:49,859
corn stalks
as tall as elms,

2095
01:57:49,924 --> 01:57:51,780
rivers packed
with salmon trout,

2096
01:57:51,845 --> 01:57:53,221
and grass so high

2097
01:57:53,286 --> 01:57:56,102
the cows stand
knee-deep in it

2098
01:57:56,168 --> 01:57:57,767
and give nothing
but cream.

2099
01:58:00,137 --> 01:58:02,026
Just think
of all the lands

2100
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:04,427
and the peoples
you're going to see,

2101
01:58:04,492 --> 01:58:06,348
and all
at the king's expense.

2102
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:07,789
Just think of it.

2103
01:58:07,853 --> 01:58:10,670
A trip any man would give
his soul to make,

2104
01:58:10,735 --> 01:58:13,071
and you're going
to get it all free.

2105
01:58:13,136 --> 01:58:14,961
Oh, i forgot to tell you,

2106
01:58:15,026 --> 01:58:17,298
you won't have any boats
to row.

2107
01:58:17,362 --> 01:58:19,891
All you have to do
is just walk along

2108
01:58:19,956 --> 01:58:20,947
through ottawas,

2109
01:58:21,013 --> 01:58:22,453
chipewyans, wyandots,

2110
01:58:22,517 --> 01:58:24,214
miamis, sauks,

2111
01:58:24,279 --> 01:58:26,903
shawnees, sioux.

2112
01:58:26,968 --> 01:58:29,304
Well, i'll sort them
all out to you

2113
01:58:29,369 --> 01:58:30,905
when we get to them.

2114
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,890
Rangers, attention!

2115
01:58:32,955 --> 01:58:35,963
Left step, march.

2116
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:38,813
Forward, march.

2117
01:58:38,879 --> 01:58:40,959
[Band plays]

2118
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,763
Ain't you going?

2119
01:58:51,621 --> 01:58:52,837
I've been.

2120
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:56,967
All your life, langdon,

2121
01:58:57,032 --> 01:59:00,009
are you going to be sorry
you didn't go?

2122
01:59:00,073 --> 01:59:01,930
No. I've made
my choice,

2123
01:59:01,994 --> 01:59:03,370
but before i'm done,

2124
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,068
his face
will look down

2125
01:59:05,132 --> 01:59:07,469
from
the art galleries
of the world

2126
01:59:07,534 --> 01:59:09,390
on the history
he's made...

2127
01:59:09,455 --> 01:59:11,471
the history
he's going to make.

2128
01:59:13,553 --> 01:59:15,601
Eyes left!

2129
01:59:23,158 --> 01:59:24,502
Too bad
your sweetheart

2130
01:59:24,567 --> 01:59:26,871
won't let you
out of her sight.

2131
01:59:26,936 --> 01:59:28,248
She's not holding
me back.

2132
01:59:28,313 --> 01:59:30,202
Yes, she is.
She wants you

2133
01:59:30,266 --> 01:59:32,827
to stay at home.
Isn't that right?

2134
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:35,292
No. I don't want him
to stay at home.

2135
01:59:35,357 --> 01:59:36,732
We're going to london.

2136
01:59:36,798 --> 01:59:37,693
London?

2137
01:59:37,758 --> 01:59:40,382
Yes. I want him
to be a great painter.

2138
01:59:40,448 --> 01:59:43,200
There you are. I told you
she was ambitious.

2139
01:59:43,265 --> 01:59:45,537
You'll never end up
an amateur mapmaker

2140
01:59:45,602 --> 01:59:48,899
who gets himself shot
every time he looks
at an indian.

2141
01:59:48,964 --> 01:59:51,781
This passage you hope
to find, major.

2142
01:59:51,845 --> 01:59:53,254
Is there such a thing?

2143
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:56,135
There's bound to be.
Before i'm done,
i'll load a canoe

2144
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,536
with the goods
of japan and end

2145
01:59:58,602 --> 02:00:01,193
by coming down
the hudson river
to new york.

2146
02:00:06,926 --> 02:00:09,006
I'll see you at sundown,
harvard.

2147
02:00:26,905 --> 02:00:28,633
Is there, langdon?

2148
02:00:28,697 --> 02:00:31,386
Is there
a northwest passage?

2149
02:00:31,451 --> 02:00:32,667
Who knows?

2150
02:00:32,732 --> 02:00:34,140
It's every man's dream

2151
02:00:34,204 --> 02:00:37,501
to find a short route
to his heart's desire.

2152
02:00:37,566 --> 02:00:40,863
If the major
dreams long enough,
he'll find it.

2153
02:00:40,928 --> 02:00:42,688
Will we hear
from him?

2154
02:00:42,753 --> 02:00:44,097
Hear from him?

2155
02:00:44,162 --> 02:00:46,979
Every time we look
across a river,

2156
02:00:47,044 --> 02:00:48,452
we'll hear his voice,

2157
02:00:48,516 --> 02:00:50,725
calling us
through the wind.

2158
02:00:50,789 --> 02:00:53,158
But he'll be within us,
elizabeth,

2159
02:00:53,223 --> 02:00:56,776
no matter where we are
or he may be...

2160
02:00:56,841 --> 02:00:59,369
for that man
will never die.

2161
02:01:00,305 --> 02:02:00,252
