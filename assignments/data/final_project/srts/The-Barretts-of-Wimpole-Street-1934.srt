1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,621
Almighty Father giver of all good gifts...

3
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:48,144
... who of thy divine providence
has provided thy unworthy servants...

4
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:52,370
... with all things necessary to their bodily sustenance,

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,632
Grant, we beseech thee, spiritual grace...

6
00:01:55,633 --> 00:02:00,744
... that we may enjoy it in
quietness of spirit as proof of Thy bounty...

7
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:06,028
... and render unto Thee
most humble and hearty thank. Amen

8
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:12,119
No, my dear. We doctors can't do everything.

9
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:19,175
Oh, my dear Dr. Chambers, you've done a great deal.

10
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:24,122
Yes, but now it's your turn.
You've got to help. You've got to want to get well.

11
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:29,088
Oh, if I could, I'd be downstairs now
having dinner with pa and the others.

12
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,652
But if you shut a person up
in one room for years on end...

13
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,645
... you can't very well expect
to find her bursting with life and vigor.

14
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:39,222
Tell me, Miss Elizabeth,
have you ventured on your feet at all lately ?

15
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:41,255
No, hardly at all.

16
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:44,462
Sometimes when I'm feeling venturesome,
my maid supports me across the room.

17
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:49,290
You know, the fact is a change
from these surroundings would do you a world of good.

18
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,588
Italy is the place for you.
Italy...

19
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,548
Oh, no, doctor. This is my Italy.
Rubbish ! That's just it.

20
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,197
You don't want to go anywhere,
you don't want to see anybody.

21
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,868
Confounded, my dear.
Isn't there something you want to do ?

22
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:06,610
Yes, and I'm doing it.
I'm writing poetry.

23
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,541
And there are those
who think it isn't such bad poetry.

24
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,921
Mr. Robert Browning has sent me several kind letters of approval.
Browning ?

25
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:16,319
Never heard of him.
Oh, you will, some day.

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,462
I daresay. Well, I'm glad at least
there is something you care about.

27
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:25,137
Eve if it's only poetry ?
Yes, only don't overtax yourself.

28
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:30,957
All right. One small verse to be written
an hour after each meal with a little water.

29
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:36,156
Oh, doctor, that reminds me.
Sit down a minute.

30
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:44,020
Do you remember papa suggesting to you
that a certain kind of beer called Porter might do me good ?

31
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,795
Yes, and an excellent suggestion, too.
Oh, forgive me. But it was nothing of the kind.

32
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:53,020
I've had to drink it twice a day
and in consequence my life has become one long misery.

33
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,266
Bless my soul.
I'm not exaggerating, one long misery.

34
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:59,406
You poor little lady.
It's no use my appealing to papa

35
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:04,196
But if you did, Dr. Chambers,
suggest to him that something else might be equally beneficial...

36
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:07,553
What would you say to
a couple of glasses of hot milk as a substitute ?

37
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:12,294
I hate milk, but I'll drink it all day long
if you'll only rescue me from Porter.

38
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:14,873
Come in.

39
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:18,810
Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth.
May I take the tray now ?

40
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,243
Yes, Wilson.

41
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:33,719
Well, goodbye, Miss Elizabeth.
Goodbye, doctor, and you won't forget...

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,643
Eh ?
P-O-R-T-E-R.

43
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,559
I'll speak to him about it now.
Oh, thank you, doctor, thank you.

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,658
Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, old man.
Good night.

45
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:50,488
Thank God, away with it !
What, miss ?

46
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,763
The Porter, Quick take it away
and never mention the word to me again.

47
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:55,304
Very good, miss.

48
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:59,162
Since you haven't had your Porter...
I told you never to mention the word to me again.

49
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,856
Now, take it away, please. Please.

50
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,952
Very good, Miss Ba.

51
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:06,332
Hello, dear. May we come in ?
Yes, come in.

52
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,160
How was dinner ? Was papa... ?
He was, and dinner was awful.

53
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:15,559
Awful awful, awful.

54
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,636
Oh, Ba, dear, I do hope for all our sakes
that Dr. Chambers' report of you isn't too good.

55
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:22,102
It won't be.
Oh, darling.

56
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:25,589
Forgive me, dearest.
You know I didn't mean it, don't you ?

57
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,655
But any good news seems to depress him so.
It isn't pa's fault, I suppose.

58
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,892
In his way he loves us all.
In his way...

59
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,273
8 o'clock ! Oh !

60
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,262
Captain Cook ? Is he nice ?

61
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:50,852
He seems quite nice.
I can't tell, of course. He isn't allowed to call.

62
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:54,660
Do you think it's serious ?
Oh, Ba, I hope not.

63
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,772
Do you remember when young Mr. Paul Frey
wanted to marry her two years ago ?

64
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,392
The dreadful scene with papa.

65
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,187
He's there.

66
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:17,315
Oh, Ba, I wish you could see him.
So drawn. So soldierly.

67
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:18,745
I can imagine.

68
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,632
It's so mean. He'll wait there for hours.

69
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,180
Just hoping that I can slip out for a moment.

70
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:28,349
And so I will.

71
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,963
But Henrietta. Papa ?
Oh, I know.

72
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:35,173
It's dreadfully imprudent, dear. And not very ladylike.
I don't care.

73
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,099
I don't care ! I...

74
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,758
Hello, Ba dear. I've just cccome to see
how you are and to wwwish you good night.

75
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,916
Come in.
Come in, Henry.

76
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,218
Ba, my dear, how are you ?

77
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,361
Better, thank you.

78
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:53,362
How's our dear tonight

79
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,917
How's our dear Ba tonight ?
Alfred.

80
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,999
How are you, Ba ?
I do think you're looking a little better.

81
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,542
Do you think so ?
What do you say, Charles ?

82
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:06,673
What ?
Looking better. More herself.

83
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:10,577
Well, Septimus.
How's Ba tonight ?

84
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,863
The doctor's just been here
and I'm afraid he wasn't too pleased with you.

85
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:16,064
No ?

86
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:18,167
Not looking quite so well, is she, Albert ?

87
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:22,535
On the contrary, I think she's looking considerably better.
So does Charles. don't you, Charles ?

88
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,501
What ?

89
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:27,196
Come in, George.
My dear.

90
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:30,393
How's the world's greatest poetess ?

91
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,253
The world's greatest poetess is much better, thank you.

92
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,854
Hello, Flush, old chum.

93
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,052
Come in.

94
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,984
A note for Mr. George.

95
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,917
I wonder what's in the note.

96
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,692
A note ?
From the master, sir.

97
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,378
Thank you.
When papa starts sending out notes from his study...

98
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,786
... the crowds must draw. Read it for us !
Hear ye. Hear ye ! Hear ye ! This is undoubtedly a royal decree.

99
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:04,895
Given at our study at 50 Wimpole Street on this
the 19th day of November, 1845. God save papa !

100
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,268
What is it, George ?

101
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:11,984
You'll all be interested to learn that papa
is going to Plymouth on business this weekend...

102
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:16,559
And what ? Go on !
And that he's not expected to return for at least a fortnight.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,485
George, will you Polk ?
Not a chance.
Well, I'll Polk.

104
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:25,930
Ha ha ha you and me
little brown jug don't I love thee

105
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:30,216
Ha ha ha you and me
little brown jug don't I love thee

106
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:34,322
My wife and I lived all alone in a little brown hut we called our own

107
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:38,582
She loves gin and I love rum
tell you what don't we have fun

108
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,855
Ha ha ha you and me
little brown jug don't I love thee

109
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:47,262
Ha ha ha you and me
little brown jug don't I love thee

110
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,370
Ha ha ha...

111
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,055
Good evening, papa.

112
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,406
I am most displeased.

113
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:34,076
I think I have told not once but several times
that in your sister's very precarious state of health...

114
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:38,291
... it is not advisable for more than three of you
to be in her room at the same time.

115
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,329
You all of you know that she must avoid every kind of excitement...

116
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,132
... and yet I find you rumping around her like a lot of disorderly children.

117
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,230
I am gravely displeased.

118
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:52,748
I am not aware that I have said anything amusing, Henrietta.

119
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:58,119
I beg your pardon, sir.
May I ask what you were doing as I came into the room ?

120
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,204
Showing Ba the polk.

121
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:03,828
How to...

122
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,449
to... dance the Polka.

123
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:07,997
I see.

124
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:12,894
Well, Ba, I think I'll say good night and...
I'd be grateful if you allowed me to finish speaking.

125
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:17,319
Sorry, sir. I thought you www... were done.
Are you being insolent, sir ?

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,939
No, indeed, sir. I assure you...
Very well.

127
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,363
Now...
Papa. I like nothing better than a little noise occasionally.

128
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:27,490
Perhaps you won't forgive my saying, Elizabeth,
but you're not the best judge of what is good or bad for you.

129
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:31,619
And that brings me to what I came here to speak to you about.
Dr. Chambers has just told me...

130
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,273
... that you have persuaded him
to allow you to discontinue drinking Porter.

131
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,275
It needed very little persuasion, papa.

132
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:41,924
I said I detested Porter
and he agreed at once that I should take milk instead.

133
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,458
I questioned him closely
as to the comparative strenght giving values of milk and Porter...

134
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,472
... and he was forced to admit that Porter came decidedly first.

135
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:53,230
That may be, but when you dislike a thing to loathing,
I don't see how it can do you any good.

136
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:56,305
Your likes and dislikes
are quite beside the point in a case like this.

137
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,201
But Dr. Chambers himself...
I have told you what Dr. Chambers said.

138
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:02,448
But, papa...
Did you drink your Porter at dinner ?

139
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:03,689
No.

140
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,291
Then I hope you'll will do so before you go to bed.

141
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,679
No, papa. That's really asking too much.

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,283
I can't drink the horrible stuff in cold blood.

143
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,616
Of course I have no means of cohersing you...

144
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:18,429
... but I intend to give
your better nature every chance of asserting itself.

145
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,148
A tankard of Porter
will be left at your bedside and I hope that by tomorrow...

146
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,474
... you will be able to tell me that you have obeyed your father.

147
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:28,265
Sorry, papa, but I shan't drink it.

148
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,718
Henrietta, go and fetch a tankard of Porter.

149
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,831
No.

150
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,977
I beg your pardon ?

151
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:39,379
It's sheer cruelty.
You know how Ba hates the stuff.

152
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,404
You're just torturing her because you like torturing.

153
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:46,261
I have told you to fetch a tankard of Porter.

154
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,432
I won't do it.
Must I ask you a third time ?

155
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,166
Obey me this instant !
Papa !

156
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,736
Go and fetch it, Henrietta. Go at once.
I can't stand this.

157
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,379
Oh, no, Ba...
Please.

158
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,103
You had all better say good night to your sister.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,690
Good night, darling.
Good night, Ba, dear.

160
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,677
Good night, darling.

161
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,851
Give it to me, please.

162
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:50,611
No. You may go.
Good night, darling.

163
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:52,770
You may go !

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,782
Elizabeth, why do you look at me like that, child ?

165
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,580
Are you frightened ?
No.

166
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,612
You're trembling. Why ?

167
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:24,032
I... don't know.
You're not frightened of me.

168
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:26,986
No, no.

169
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,372
Don't say it. I couldn't bear it.

170
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,808
You're everything in the world to me and you know that.

171
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,607
Without you I should be quite alone and you know that too.

172
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:38,709
If you love me
you can't be afraid of me, for love casts out fear.

173
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,114
You love me, my darling ? You love your father ?
Yes.

174
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:45,090
Then you will prove your love by doing as I wish.

175
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,820
But I don't understand. I was going to drink...
Yes, out of fear, not love.

176
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:53,999
Listen to me, my dear.
I shall never in any way reproach you.

177
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:56,853
You shalll never know by deed or word or hint of mine...

178
00:13:56,854 --> 00:14:01,888
... how much you have grieved and wounded your father
by refusing to do the little that he asked of you.

179
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,174
Oh, papa. Let us get this over with and forget it.

180
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:11,232
I can't forgive myself for having made
the whole house miserable over a tankard of Porter.

181
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,680
You're acting of your own free will and not...
Yes, papa, yes.

182
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,880
You're not feeling any worse tonight, my darling.

183
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:55,871
No, papa.
Just tired ?

184
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,996
Yes, just tired.
I'd better leave you now.

185
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:03,739
Shall I say a little prayer with you before I go ?

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,312
Please, papa.

187
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,815
Almighty and merciful God...

188
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:25,709
in thine inscrutable wisdom
thou hast seen fit to lay upon thy daughter Elizabeth...

189
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,875
... grievous and heavy afflictions.

190
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:32,209
For many years she hath languished in sickness...

191
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,600
... for many years, unless in thy mercy thou take her to thyself, she may languish on.

192
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,771
Give her to bear her sufferings in patience.

193
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:45,630
Give her to fix her heart and soul on thee.

194
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:51,515
And on that heavenly eternity
which may at any moment open out before her...

195
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:54,260
Amen.

196
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:57,860
Amen.

197
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,584
Good night.

198
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:07,554
Good night, papa.

199
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,930
Better see your bed now, Miss Ba.

200
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:31,031
Oh, what a pity.
These flowers are dead, just since this morning.

201
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,978
Why don't they live longer ?

202
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,134
Nothing lives in this room.

203
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,620
What was that, miss ?

204
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:43,240
Oh, Wilson, I'm so tired.
Tired, tired.

205
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,176
Will it never end ?
End, miss ?

206
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:51,362
This long, long gray death of life.
Oh, Miss Ba, you shouldn't say such things.

207
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,954
No, I suppose I shouldn't.

208
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:59,736
Is it a fine night outside ?
Yes, it cleared up nicely after the rain.

209
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,836
And there's such a lovely moon.

210
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:05,592
Moon ? Do you think I could see it from here ?
Mm, I don't know, I'm sure.

211
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:07,220
Pull back the curtains.

212
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:11,660
There you are.
The moon is right above the chimney.

213
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,638
Yes.

214
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:17,681
Please put out the lamps, Wilson,
and leave me for a little while.

215
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:22,658
I don't want to go to bed quite yet.
Very well, Miss Ba.

216
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,344
Be careful.

217
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,764
Don't talk to me.

218
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,316
The woman opposite is watching.

219
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:56,000
Listen. But don't look at me.

220
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,899
It was kind of you to come so far.

221
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,659
And in the snow.

222
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,662
I wish I could ask you in, but I daren't.

223
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:07,220
Aren't you freezing ?
Don't answer me !

224
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,221
You're so tall.

225
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,900
I wish I could see you in full uniform. Could I ?
Don't tell me !

226
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,491
I daren't stay any longer.
It looks so odd.

227
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:19,271
And in this weather.

228
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:22,059
I'll come again tomorrow.
You'll wait for me, won't you ?

229
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,700
Don't tell me.

230
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:26,604
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Miss Barrett.

231
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,540
Hush !
But I say, Miss Barrett...

232
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,622
If the thing were only in the proper footing...

233
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,100
If you'd permit me to call on your father...

234
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,568
You mustn't think of it.
You'd be ordered out of the house.

235
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:39,417
But if I made it quite clear ?
My intentions are perfectly honorable and all that.

236
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:43,071
But that would make it worse.
Ever distinctly fatal, don't you see ?

237
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:46,598
I can't say that I do.
Papa would never permit any of us to marry.

238
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,912
A marriage in the family ?
He just almost goes insanely angry if you talk of it.

239
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,446
Yes, but I mean...

240
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:59,516
Oh, I say !
I proposed and I thought it would be so difficult.

241
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,905
Oh, yes, Wilson, I'm quite ready for my lunch.

242
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:22,022
You've had your lunch, Miss Ba.
Oh, yes, of course. I enjoyed it very much.

243
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,780
Let's keep covered up.

244
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:29,455
These cold days are are that treacherous.

245
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:34,145
No, it's quite beyond me.
I give it up.

246
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:35,817
Beg your pardon ?

247
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,199
Wilson, have you noticed anything strange in me today ?

248
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,833
Strange, miss ?
Yes, strange. I mean stupid, thickheaded, idiotic.

249
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,691
Good gracious, no, miss.
Very well.

250
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,657
But now listen carefully and see what you can make of this.

251
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:57,606
And after, for pastime, if June be refulgent
with flowers in completeness.

252
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:01,837
All petals, no prickles, delicious as trickles of wine..

253
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,040
... poured at mass time

254
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,408
And choose one indulgent
To redness and sweetness.

255
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:09,386
Or if, with experience of man and of spider,

256
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:13,170
June use my June-lightning, the strong insect-ridder,

257
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,838
To stop the fresh film-work... why, June will consider.

258
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:22,617
I call that just lovely, Miss Ba.

259
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:24,276
Yes, but do you know what it means ?

260
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, no, miss.
Does it convey anything at all to your mind ?

261
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,403
Oh, no, Miss Ba.
Well, thank heavens for that.

262
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:34,673
But then, real poetry never does, miss.

263
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:37,516
Least ways not real poetry like what you make.

264
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:39,988
Oh, but I didn't write that.
It's by Mr. Browning.

265
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:42,553
Oh, he must be a clever gentleman.

266
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:46,750
Oh, Ba. Cousin Bella is here. May she come in ?
Yes, dear.

267
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:52,555
Oh. And Ba, just think. She's engaged.
She's going to be married.

268
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:56,344
Cousin Elizabeth !

269
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:59,469
Dear, dear cousin.
Bella, dear.

270
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,638
What's this I hear, engaged ?
Yes.

271
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,148
I just had to run right over and tell you.
Well, congratulations, dear.

272
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:09,868
Isn't it too thrilling ?
Harry couldn't come, but I'll bring him next time.

273
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,365
May I ? Oh, you'll love Harry.
I'm sure we shall. Harry who ?

274
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,639
Harry Bevan.
Oh, Henrietta, the very person !

275
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,642
I want want you to be one of my bridesmaids.

276
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:21,748
Bridesmaid ?
Yes, you simply must.

277
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:24,213
Cousin Bella's engaged. She's going to be married.

278
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:28,895
I want you te be a bridesmaid.
Oh, yes, it's your wedding. Thank you.

279
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:32,675
It's going to be a great big wedding.
Twelve bridesmaids.

280
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:37,473
You must help me to pick out the dresses.
And I'm going to wear mother's wedding veil.

281
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:41,848
Don't you just love weddings, Henrietta ?
Yes, I love weddings.

282
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:43,993
And we're going to Paris on our honeymoon.

283
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:49,411
And then to Rome.
And then we're going to take the dearest, sweetest little house.

284
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,718
It'll be just too thrilling for words.

285
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,249
And I'll be so happy to have you for a bridesmaid.
Thank you, Bella.

286
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:59,811
Of course, I'd love to if papa...
Oh, I don't see how he can possibly object.

287
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,133
Object ? Isn't she funny, Ba ?

288
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:05,028
You're only being asked to be a bridesmaid,
not a bride.

289
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,663
Yes, I know, Bella. Oh, it's so hard to explain.
What's the matter ?

290
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:13,137
You know what's the matter.
It's simply that nothing at all can happen without papa's assention.

291
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:17,018
We've got to obey his least will.
We can't move hand or foot without his permission.

292
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:19,899
We haven't got a soul of our own, not one of us.
Henrietta !

293
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,309
Or have we ? Have we, Ba ?

294
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,229
I tell you, Bella. He'll more than likely refuse
to let me be your bridesmaid...

295
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,090
... and just because he's in a beastly temper.

296
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:30,587
Oh, gracious, cousin Henrietta,
you mustn't say such things about uncle Edward.

297
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:34,232
And I'm afraid we're disturbing poor dear cousin Elizabeth.

298
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:39,759
Poor, Ba. So pale, so fragile, so wisteria.

299
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,225
One has only to see your dear face
to know how near you are to heaven.

300
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:48,661
I wouldn't quite say that, Bella.
Oh, yes, you always have a look in your eyes...

301
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:51,146
... as if you already saw the angels.

302
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,649
I really must be going.

303
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,008
Goodbye. I'll come again and bring Harry.
Yes, do.

304
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,182
Oh, you mustn't tell anybody about my getting married.

305
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:09,519
It's to be a big surprise.
And don't worry, cousin Henrietta. I'll manage uncle Edward.

306
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,326
Men are really so easy to manage.
If you just know how.

307
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,529
But, of course, you girls have had so little experience.

308
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,388
Goodbye, dear, dear cousins.

309
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:32,442
Well, why don't you say something ?

310
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,618
What do you want me to say ?

311
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,210
Nothing.

312
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:40,828
Oh, Ba, darling. Don't disown me.
I deserve it, I know.

313
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,563
But I couldn't help it.

314
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,909
I'm so miserable.
Miserable, dear ?

315
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,641
Yes, and so wildly happy.

316
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:51,309
Oh, Ba, darling. Do you mind if I tell you about it ?
I oughtn't to, I know...

317
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,260
... because if papa ever found out you knew about it
he'd spend half his anger on you for not warning him.

318
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,477
What are you talking about, dear ?
Surtees has just asked me to marry him.

319
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:02,199
Surtees ?
Captain Cook. I've told you about him.
The guardsman, you know.

320
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,509
Yes, I remember, dear.
And of course I expected him and said that I couldn't...

321
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,464
... and I had to tell him we must
never never see each other again so when we meet tomorrow...

322
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,729
You're not talking sense, child.
What really has happened ?

323
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,184
I don't know, Ba.
Except that we both love each other.

324
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:16,488
Terribly.

325
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,669
Oh, my darling.

326
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,107
But Henrietta, papa...
Do you think I haven't thought of that ?

327
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:24,455
He'll never consent. Never.
I know.

328
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:30,222
Ba, dear, is there anything at all
to be said for papa's attitude towards marriage ?

329
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:34,411
Can it possibly be wrong
to want a man's love desperately and...

330
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:37,980
long for babies of my own ?
Love and babies are something I don't know much about.

331
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:43,048
I know, dear, you're a woman apart.
But love and babies are natural to a normal girl like me.

332
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,615
And what's natural can't be wrong.
No...

333
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:50,355
And yet the holiest men and women renounce these things.
I daresay, Ba. But I'm not holy.

334
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,706
It's different for you. You're a great genius.

335
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:57,326
Oh, yes you are. You've got your work, your studies.
But do you know, Ba ?

336
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,573
Sometimes I wonder.

337
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:02,771
Are you completely satisfied ?

338
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,445
Is it enough just to correspond
with Mr. Browning, for instance ?

339
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:08,999
Don't you sometimes wish that you could see him ?

340
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:14,697
If I could see and not be seen.
Why ?

341
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,468
Because at heart I'm as vain as a peacock.

342
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:23,085
He thinks my verse is stately and beautiful.
Probably thinks me the same.

343
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,643
It would be so humiliating to disillusion him.

344
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:28,635
Oh, don't be silly, Ba. You're very interesting and picturesque.

345
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:31,316
Isn't that how the guidebooks usually describe a ruin ?

346
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:33,386
Oh, Ba, I didn't mean it.
Of course.

347
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:37,288
Tell me, is your friend very nice ?
Surtees ?

348
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,623
Yes.
Oh, yes.

349
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:42,090
Oh, Ba, what are we to do ?

350
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:47,997
Ba, do you think it would be wiser
if we were never to see each other again ?

351
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:52,642
I think it might be wiser, dear.
Oh...

352
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:56,783
But at your age one shouldn't be too wise.

353
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,485
Oh, Ba.

354
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:01,984
Come in.

355
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,814
A gentleman just brought this, dear.

356
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:08,807
A gentleman ?
Yes. And he said he would wait for an answer.

357
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,074
Really ?

358
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:16,972
Who is it from ?
Henrietta !

359
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,056
A moment, dear.

360
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,274
Oh !
Oh, Ba, dear, whatever is it ?

361
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,454
Oh, really !
Please tell us, darling.

362
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:32,736
Why, Ba, you're blushing.
No wonder ! Listen to this.

363
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:37,239
"Dear Miss Barrett,
I am unable to restrain my impatience to meet you...

364
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,104
... and have taken it upon myself to select February 15th"...
that's today... ..."for that important occasion.

365
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:47,707
And I am at this moment seated
in your front hall awaiting your permission to present myself."

366
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,360
Wait a moment, there's more.

367
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:56,428
"I might add that I shall continue to sit here until
you gratify the earnest desire that prompts my impertinent persistence.

368
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:59,304
Sincerely yours, Robert Browning."
Robert Browning !

369
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,792
Oh, Ba, I like this Mr. Browning. You must see him.

370
00:28:01,843 --> 00:28:06,209
No, I can't. At least not today.
But you should. It can't do you any harm.

371
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,853
Why not ?
I don't feel up to it. Really I don't. Another time.

372
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,278
I shall go and see him myself
and I'll send him up.

373
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:16,388
No, Henrietta ! Stay here.
I can't see him. I really don't
feel that I could see him now.

374
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:22,057
Arabel, tell Mr. Browning that I am very sorry
but I'm not well enought to see him.

375
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:26,077
But Ba, that's not true. You can't send him away.
But I'd much rather not see him.

376
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:28,952
Oh, fie. You're not a silly schoolgirl, I'll bring him up myself.

377
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:36,756
Is my hair tidy ?
Yes, dear. You look quite nice.

378
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,341
Arabel, fix the covers.
Yes.

379
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,064
Flush, get down dear.

380
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:43,849
Arabel...
Yes, dear ?

381
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,538
No... yes. No, never mind.

382
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:50,126
Yes, dear.
Thank you.

383
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,893
Arabel !

384
00:28:56,894 --> 00:29:00,227
Arabel, do I...
Yes, darling.

385
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,789
You do. Really.

386
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:18,982
Mr. Robert Browning.

387
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:26,039
Miss Barrett.

388
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,760
Dear Miss Barrett, at last.

389
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:35,020
At last !
How do you do, Mr. Browning ?

390
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:38,050
I've had to put off the pleasure
of meeting you much longer than I wished.

391
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:40,481
Yes, that is it.

392
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,899
I beg your pardon ?
That voice.

393
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,417
I've heard that voice a thousand times.

394
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:50,242
How strange.
I've not been at all well this winter and I...

395
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:53,831
Won't you take off your cape ?

396
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,957
Thank you.

397
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,457
Wonderful !

398
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,646
Wonderful !

399
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:08,139
You may think, Miss Barrett, that this is the first time that I've been here,
but you're quite wrong, you know.

400
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,096
But...
Oh, yes, quite wrong.

401
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:12,372
I've seen this room more times than I can remember.

402
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,759
It's as familiar to me
as my own little study at home.

403
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:17,780
Before I came in
I knew just how your books were arranged.

404
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:21,330
Just how that tendril of ivy slanted across the window pane.

405
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:25,228
And those portraits of Homer and Chaucer are quite old friends.

406
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:26,942
No, really.

407
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,755
You know, I could never make out
who those other fellas were on the top of the wardrobe.

408
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:37,491
Oh, come, Mr. Browning. I can't believe that one of my friends
has bored you with a description of my poor little room.

409
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:40,253
I have pestered them for all the details I could possibly get.

410
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,879
And my imagination supplied the rest.

411
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,511
Directly after I read your brave and lovely verses
I was greedy for anything and everything I could get about you.

412
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,209
Oh, what they must have told you !

413
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,184
Oh, nothing they told me about you personally
had the slightest interest for me.

414
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,906
Because I knew it already. And better than they.

415
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:59,836
Oh, Mr. Browning. Do my writings give me so hopelessly away ?

416
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:02,997
Hopelessly, utterly, entirely. To me.

417
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:05,241
Of course I can't speak for the rest of the world.

418
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,157
I'm afraid it will be quite useless...

419
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:10,211
... my ever trying to play act with you.
Quite useless.

420
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:14,000
I shall always have to be just myself ?
Always.

421
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,674
But you, you're never yourself in any of your poems.

422
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,890
It's always somebody else speaking through you.

423
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:22,712
Yes, and shall I tell you why ?
I'm a very modest man.

424
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,913
I am. really !

425
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:29,064
We didn't question that, Mr. Browning.

426
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:35,273
So modest, I fully realize that if I wrote about myself
my poems would be intolerably dull.

427
00:31:35,274 --> 00:31:37,501
Oh, but those poems.

428
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:40,552
With their glad and great-hearted acceptance of life.

429
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:42,599
You can't imagine what they mean to me.

430
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,449
Here I am shut in by these four walls and...

431
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,600
... and they troupe into my room,
those wonderful people of yours.

432
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,991
Out of every age and country and...

433
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,670
... and all so tingling with life.

434
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:59,071
No, you'll never begin to realize just...

435
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:01,793
... just how much I do owe you.
You really mean that ?

436
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,398
Of course you do, or you wouldn't say it.

437
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,518
You don't find me difficult, obscure ?

438
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,776
Many people do.
Surely not.

439
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:14,537
Yet, to me it's simple and easy as the rule of three.
And to you ?

440
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,453
No, not quite always.

441
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:21,602
Sometimes there are passages that...
I've marked one or two in your Sordello which rather puzzled me.

442
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:23,897
Ah, Sordello.

443
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,953
Somebody once called it a horror of great gothic.

444
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:29,363
I've done my best to forget it.

445
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,774
Here it is.
All right...

446
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:44,744
But then, a passage torn from its context...

447
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,166
All petals, no prickles...

448
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,546
No prickles like trickles...

449
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:14,568
Well ?
Well, Miss Barrett...

450
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,645
... when that passage was written,
only God and Robert Browning understood it.

451
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:20,165
Now, only God understands it.

452
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,654
What do you say ? Shall we lighten
this great darkness by pitching it on the fire ?

453
00:33:24,655 --> 00:33:27,800
No, indeed, we shall do nothing of the kind.
Please give me back the book.

454
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:32,360
I love Sordello.
You would.

455
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,880
Of curse you would. And shall I tell you why ?

456
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,905
Because it is a collossal failure

457
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,047
By a failure you mean an attempt.

458
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:43,865
Yes, you're right.
That's just why Sordello appeals to my very heart.

459
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,079
I too am always making collossal attempts.

460
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,301
And always failing.

461
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:52,373
But is not one such failure worth a hundred small successes ?

462
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:54,885
Oh, a thousand and more.
You think so too ?

463
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:57,328
But of course. I knew that.

464
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:02,756
Miss Barrett, you smiled when I told you
that your friends had no need to describe you because I knew you already.

465
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:07,908
But what you've just told me
about success and failure proves to me finally how right I was.

466
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:13,674
Tell me, did your fancy paint
my background with a very gloomy brush ?

467
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:19,268
The background possibly.
But the portrait of you I had painted with the true soul of you.

468
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:21,611
Ardent and lovely looking out of you.

469
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:25,633
Ardent and lovely.
Oh, Mr. Browning, you think you know me.

470
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,460
Too often impatient and rebelious.

471
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,895
Oh, what of it. I've no love for perfect patience under affliction.

472
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:34,954
My portrait is the portrait of a woman, not a saint.

473
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:37,378
I suppose people have told you that I...

474
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,394
... that I'm a dying woman.

475
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:41,757
We are all of us dying.

476
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:45,354
And you find me a very pitiful object ?

477
00:34:45,355 --> 00:34:48,939
I find you as I pictured you.
Full of courage and gaiety.

478
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,896
And yet I'm not at all sure that my colors were too somber.

479
00:34:52,897 --> 00:34:54,363
But...
No, no, listen to me.

480
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:57,668
Those colors are not yet dry.
They must be scraped off.

481
00:34:57,669 --> 00:34:59,720
The whole background must be repainted.

482
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:03,147
And if only you will allow it,
I must have a hand in that splendid work.

483
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:04,148
But this is...
No, listen.

484
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:08,096
I'll get my brush in the sunrise, the sunset and the rainbow.

485
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,578
You say my verses have helped you but they are nothing.

486
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,986
It's I, I who am going to help you now.

487
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:16,274
We've come together at last,
and I don't intend to let you go again.

488
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,619
Give me your hand.

489
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,481
I've more strength than is good for one man.

490
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:23,926
Up to now I've spent a little of that surplus energy
in creating imaginary men and women.

491
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:27,148
But there's still so much to give.
Mayn't I give it to you ?

492
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:31,315
Don't you feel in your life tingling and prickling
up your fingers and arms right into your heart and brain ?

493
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:32,012
Oh, please.

494
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,042
Mr. Browning, please let go of my hand.

495
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:43,609
Well ?
You're really rather an overwhelming person...

496
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,896
... and in sober truth I...

497
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:47,935
Don't tell me that you're afraid of me.
You're not.

498
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:50,574
It's life you're afraid of, and that shouldn't be.

499
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:52,105
Life ?
Yes.

500
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:56,782
When life becomes a series of electric shocks I...
Was it as bad as all that ?

501
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:57,890
Indeed yes.

502
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:01,333
Do you affect other people in that way ?
They've often told me so.

503
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,973
No wonder I hesitated
about meeting you, much as I wanted to.

504
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:09,562
You know, you'll laugh at me, Mr. Browning,
but when my sister told me you were downstairs...

505
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:14,501
... I was so panic stricken that I almost
sent a message down saying that I was too unwell to receive you.

506
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:16,798
I think I must have been quite
as nervous as you at that moment...

507
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,651
... and I'm anything but a nervous man as a rule.

508
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,740
But that moment was the climax of my life.

509
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:23,465
Up to now.

510
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:26,816
Miss Barrett, do you remember the first letter I ever wrote you ?

511
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,036
Yes, indeed. It was a wonderful letter.

512
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:32,377
You may have thought I dashed it off
in a fit white out right out enthusiasm over your poems...

513
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:35,485
... but I didn't.
I weighed every word of every sentence.

514
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,549
And of one sentence in particular.

515
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,194
This sentence: I love your books with all my heart.
And I love you, too.

516
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:48,098
Do you remember ?
Yes. I thought it was charmingly impulsive of you.

517
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:50,658
But there was nothing impulsive about it.

518
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:54,746
That sentence was as deeply felt
and anxiously thought over as any sentence I've ever written.

519
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,422
I hope I have many readers like you.

520
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:01,692
It's wonderful to think I may have good friends
all over the world whom I've never seen or heard of.

521
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,399
I'm not speaking of friendship but of love.

522
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,017
It's quite useless your trying to put aside the word with a smile and a jest.

523
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:12,057
I said love and I mean love.
Really, Mr. Browning, I must ask you to...

524
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,140
I'm insanely in love as any man alive.

525
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:18,706
In all these months
since I first read your poems I've been haunted by you.

526
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:22,906
And today you are the center of my life.
Mr. Browning...

527
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,203
If I were to take you seriously
it would have caused me the quick finish of a friendship which...

528
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,851
... promises to be very pleasant for both of us.

529
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:35,684
Why ?
You know very well that love
in the sense that you apparently use the word...

530
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:38,779
... has no place, and can have no place in my life.

531
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,614
Why ?
For many reasons, but let it suffice...

532
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:43,948
as I told you before...

533
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:48,412
... I am a dying woman.
I refuse to believe it.

534
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,611
If that were so, God would be cruel.
And I know that He's compassionate.

535
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,624
And life would be dark and evil, and I know that it's good.

536
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,349
You must never say such a thing again.

537
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,075
I forbid you to.

538
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,232
Forbid, Mr. Browning ?
Yes, forbid.

539
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:05,477
Isn't it only fair that if you forbid me to speak with you
as I fear and I accept your orders, as I must...

540
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:07,566
... that I should be allowed a little forbidding as well ?

541
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,054
Yes, but...

542
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:12,808
Dear Miss Barrett, what a splendid beginning to our friendship.

543
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,943
We've known each other a bare half hour
and yet we talk infinitely of art, and life, and death, and love.

544
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:20,964
We've oredered each other about and we've almost quarrelled.

545
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,276
Could anything be happier or more promising ?

546
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:26,937
With your permission, I'm going now.

547
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:33,073
I promised myself to make my first visit as short as possible.

548
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:36,052
Strangers are undoubtedly tiring.

549
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:38,739
Not that I am a stranger.

550
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,959
Still I could see that you're tired.
When may I call again ?

551
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,920
I don't quite know. Will next Wednesday suit you ?

552
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:50,440
Yes, I think so, but perhaps it would be better...
Next Wednesday.

553
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,867
At half past three again ?
yes, but I...

554
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,754
Au revoir, then.

555
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:56,095
Goodbye.

556
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:58,143
Au revoir.

557
00:38:58,144 --> 00:39:00,902
Au revoir.
Thank you.

558
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:44,461
Splendid, splendid.

559
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:46,793
Really remarkable.

560
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,831
Once more, dear.

561
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,226
My dear Miss Barrett I congratulate you.

562
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:10,989
Now sit down.

563
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,445
You've done wonders, doctor.
The real healer is no one but Miss Barrett herself.

564
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:27,886
The will to live is better than a dozen physicians.

565
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:31,328
The will to live.
Mm. Yes.

566
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,366
Well now, Miss Barrett, about the future.

567
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:39,560
I fully agree with Dr. Chambers
that another winter in London must be avoided.

568
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:44,135
I see no reason against
your travelling South by October, say ?

569
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:48,288
Travelling South.
The Riviera, or better still, to Italy.

570
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,370
Italy ? Oh, Doctor, do you really mean it ?
Why not ?

571
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:59,202
I've taken the liberty to tell the doctor of the only real difficulty,
and he's quite prepared to deal with... him.

572
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:03,189
Quite, and drastically.
Oh, but I don't think it will be necessary.

573
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,391
Papa may not raise any objection at all.

574
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:08,437
It all depends on how he's feeling at the time.
Oh, fiddlesticks, my dear young lady...

575
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:11,109
... Mr. Barrett's feelings are neither here not there.

576
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,040
What matters is his daughter's health and happiness.

577
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:17,260
And I intend to make it clear to him, quite clear.

578
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,181
What a beautiful day it is... I must be going, Miss Barrett.
Don't get up, don't get up.

579
00:42:22,182 --> 00:42:24,803
I'm delighted with your improvement.

580
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:26,505
Delighted.

581
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:29,718
I'll put a little talk with your father.

582
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,597
Goodbye, Miss Barrett.
Goodbye, doctor.

583
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,456
Italy ! Italy ! Italy !

584
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:45,916
And you are coming too, Flush.
We'll see Rome together.

585
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:49,984
Rome, Venice and Naples.
See Naples and die...

586
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,432
Only I'm not going to die.

587
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:55,130
I'm not going to die.

588
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:57,879
Yes ?

589
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,281
Mr. Browning is here, Miss Ba.
You may ask him to come up.

590
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:03,398
Very good, miss.
No, wait.

591
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,618
Don't trouble, I'll go down.

592
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:12,059
Oh, Miss Ba. You won't think of it.

593
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,433
I shall not only think of it, but do it.

594
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:16,861
What's more, I shall do it alone.

595
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:22,402
You must let me help you. It's not safe.
You've not walked downstairs for years.

596
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:25,093
Let me alone, Wilson. I shall be quite all right.

597
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:27,397
I can do anything.

598
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,480
You see ?
Oh, Miss Ba.

599
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:18,824
Mr. Browning.

600
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:21,344
It is you !

601
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:23,274
Why this is magnificent.

602
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,794
Magnificent.

603
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:28,482
I... well I...

604
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:32,640
And I did it all alone.
I walked down those stairs alone. A hundred of them.

605
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:34,882
A hundred ?
Well, fifty.

606
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:40,032
This is only the first step.
In a little while you'll be able to drive, to walk in the park.

607
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,761
In the sun and fresh air.

608
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,558
Come, come sit down.

609
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:49,011
Oh, wonderful

610
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:50,588
Wonderful.

611
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:53,349
Here. Sit here in the sunlight.

612
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,946
Careful.

613
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,978
There we are.

614
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:12,446
There. Now, that's the setting I've dreamed for you.

615
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:14,197
The setting I'm going to keep you in.

616
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:17,968
Now tell me. Tell me quickly.
I've been in suspense all day.

617
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:19,722
You've seen the doctors. What did they say ?

618
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:23,871
Dr. Ford-Waterlow was quite taken out
of his grumpy self with astonishment over my improval.

619
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:26,048
Say that again.
Oh, must I, the whole sentence ?

620
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:29,520
I should like to see it in letters of fire
burning at me from each of these four walls.

621
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:33,364
This is the best moment I've had
since the day I gave myself permission to call on you.

622
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:35,965
How many years ago was that ?
Three months.

623
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:41,049
So... we've always been friends.
I've known you a lifetime, you know.

624
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,191
So he was almost taken out
of his grumpy self with delight, was he ?

625
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:47,981
Splendid. Of course I never once doubted
that you'd turn the corner some day.

626
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:50,238
I've told you so a hundred times.

627
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,487
And Italy ? Both doctors agreed about your wintering there ?
Yes.

628
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:56,409
This is wonderful. I'm quite off my head with excitement.

629
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,796
Unless, of course, papa should withhold his consent and...
Oh, that I just refuse to anticipate

630
00:46:01,797 --> 00:46:04,608
When do they think you'll be fit for travel ?
The middle of October.

631
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:06,565
Unless there is a relapse.

632
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:08,769
Relapse ? Why, there isn't such a word.

633
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,425
October ?
That's extraordinary.

634
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:14,522
You know, October suits my own plans to perfection.

635
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:18,429
Your plans ?
Don't you remember my telling you
that had thought of wintering in Italy myself ?

636
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:21,421
Well, now I'm quite decided.

637
00:46:35,722 --> 00:46:38,824
Oh, papa, isn't it wonderful ?

638
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:41,446
I walked downstairs.

639
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:43,537
So I observe.

640
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:46,404
A miracle, sir.
Nothing more or less than a miracle.

641
00:46:56,005 --> 00:46:59,662
Did your doctors authorize this amazing imprudence ?
No, papa.

642
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:03,047
I should not have been surprised if they had.
Aren't you proud of me, papa ?

643
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:05,572
I thought there should be dancing in the streets.
A general holiday.

644
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:10,709
Mr. Browning, my daughter's health
has been my main concern for many years...

645
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:15,489
You'll permit me to remind you that
I'm much better informed on the subject than an outsider ?

646
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:18,160
I shall carry you to your room.

647
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:19,398
Oh, no, papa.

648
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:21,629
I don't need you, really.
Surely, Mr. Barrett...

649
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,586
Mr. Browning, I must say goodbye.

650
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:25,399
Thank you for calling.

651
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,527
Elizabeth.

652
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:52,192
Elizabeth.

653
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:01,297
You can't do it.

654
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:11,978
Elizabeth.

655
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:54,868
There, my child.
I'm all right, papa.

656
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:58,840
I could have done this.
You ought to rest to regain your strength.

657
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:02,091
All this talk and activity is most harmful.

658
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:04,444
I'd appreciate it if you tried to get a little sleep.

659
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,609
Papa.
Well ?

660
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,519
I'm all right, really I am.

661
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:17,162
Dr. Ford-Waterlow said I was. Didn't he tell you ?

662
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,093
Dr. Ford-Waterlow talked,
if I may say so, a great deal of nonsense.

663
00:49:20,094 --> 00:49:24,085
But papa...
I'm naturally more than gratified at your improvement,

664
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,731
I'm delighted, of course, my poor child,
but it's unlikely you'll ever be a normal woman.

665
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,754
But I do feel so much better.

666
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:32,137
Perhaps it's the wonderful weather we've been having.

667
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:36,811
I always thrive in warmth, sunshine...
Rubbish ! Last time it was sweltering
and you've never been worse than then.

668
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:40,134
No, to my mind there is
only one whom we have to thank...

669
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:43,189
... though this doctor whatsisname
would probably sneer if I mentioned him.

670
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,175
Him ?
I mean Almighty God.

671
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:48,301
That's all I have to say at present.

672
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:53,333
Papa.
What is it ?

673
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:56,710
Didn't he tell you that I should avoid spending next winter in England ?

674
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,260
Well...

675
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:02,834
And that he thinks
I should be able to travel to Italy in October ?

676
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:06,479
If you...
So !

677
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,432
... it's out at last.

678
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:12,368
And how long has this precious plot been hatching, may I ask ?

679
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:15,998
You've discussed your plans
with all your friends and relatives, I suppose...

680
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:20,548
... with this Browning fellow too.
And I, I alone am left out of my favorite daughter's confidence.

681
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:22,760
Treated like a cypher, insultant.

682
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:29,030
Insultant ?
I'm cut to the heart that you,
the only one of my children whom I trusted implicitly...

683
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:33,663
... should be capable of such underhand conduct.
No, papa. No !

684
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:37,340
If returning health must bring
with it such a sad change of character,

685
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:41,792
I should be driven to wish
that you were once more lying helpless on this sofa.

686
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:45,983
There's nothing more to be said.
But there is more to be said.

687
00:50:45,984 --> 00:50:49,305
And I must beg you to listen, papa.

688
00:50:49,306 --> 00:50:51,736
How many years have I lain here ?

689
00:50:51,737 --> 00:50:54,449
Five, six ? It's hard to remember,
each year seemed like ten to me.

690
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,983
And all that time I've had nothing
to look forward to or hope for but death.

691
00:50:57,984 --> 00:51:00,000
Death ?
Yes, death !

692
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:04,028
I was born with a large capacity for happiness.
You remember me as a little girl.

693
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:08,879
And then when life brought me a little happiness
and much pain I was often impatient for the end.

694
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,208
Elizabeth !
Then this miracle happened.

695
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:17,742
Day by day I'm better able to take and enjoy
such good things that everyone has a right to.

696
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:22,837
Able to meet my friends, to breathe the open air,
to feel the sun and see the grass and flowers beneath the sky.

697
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:25,909
When Dr. Chambers first spoke to me about Italy...

698
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,256
I put the idea from me.
It seemed too impossibly wonderful

699
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:35,241
But as I grew stronger, it came over me as a revelation
that Italy wasn't an impossibility at all.

700
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:39,259
That nothing stood in my way of going.
That I really had a right to go.

701
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,276
Right ?
Yes, every right !

702
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:45,940
In my eagerness, I may have acted mistakenly, stupidly, tactlessly...

703
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:52,491
... but to call my conduct underhanded, deceitful is more than unkind.
It's unjust.

704
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:54,651
Cruel.

705
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:59,920
Self, self, self.

706
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:04,652
No thought, no consideration for anyone but yourself.
For anything but your pleasure.

707
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:07,733
Didn't it ever once occur to you
that all through the long dark months...

708
00:52:07,734 --> 00:52:11,753
that you propose to enjoy yourself in Italy
your father would be left here utterly alone ?

709
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,056
No.
Utterly alone.

710
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:18,052
Your brothers and sisters
might as well be shadows for all the companionship they afford me.

711
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:25,560
And you, oh my child, don't think that I haven't noticed
that you too are slowly drawing away from your father.

712
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:29,563
That's not true.
It is true. New life, new interests, new pleasures, new friends...

713
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:32,175
... and little by little I'm being pushed into the background.

714
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:35,422
I who used to be your whole world, I who loved you...

715
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:37,535
... who love you.
But papa...

716
00:52:37,536 --> 00:52:40,707
No, there's nothing more to be said.

717
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:47,824
You want my consent for this Italian trot.

718
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:50,102
I shall neither give it nor uphold it.

719
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:54,231
If you go I hope you will sometimes
spare a thought for your father.

720
00:52:54,232 --> 00:53:00,131
Think of him at night, stealing alone
in this empty room which once held all he loved.

721
00:53:00,132 --> 00:53:04,317
Think of him kneeling alone
by the empty sofa imploring the good Shepherd to have...

722
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,492
Who's that ?

723
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:26,287
I shall come to you again
when you've had time to consider the wisdom of my words.

724
00:53:46,288 --> 00:53:48,087
Well, Flush...

725
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:51,401
It seems we aren't going to Italy.

726
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:05,253
Cousin Elizabeth.
Hello, dear.

727
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:07,418
I brought Harry to see you.

728
00:54:07,419 --> 00:54:11,467
This is my fiancé, my dear, dear Harry.

729
00:54:11,468 --> 00:54:15,567
Mr. Bevan, Miss Elizabeth Barrett.
Delighted, Miss Barrett. Charmed.

730
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:17,777
No, no, Harry. You must take her hand.

731
00:54:17,778 --> 00:54:21,629
Such a little hand, so frail, so spiritual.

732
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:26,179
Yes. And a hand that pens so much that is noble and eloquent.
Oh, thank you.

733
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,875
I am honored, Miss Barrett.
So nice of you to come.

734
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:30,989
Thank you.
We'll only stay a minute.

735
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,713
I trust you're not too weary
of being congratulated upon the prize you've won.

736
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:41,176
Thank you, Miss Barrett. A prize indeed.

737
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:45,035
Dear Ba. And doesn't Henrietta look lovely ?

738
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:47,957
She'll be quite the prettiest of my bridesmaids.

739
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:53,112
Indeed I'm afraid she'll draw all eyes from the little bride.
At any rate, all the gentlemen's.

740
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:59,324
Oh, Bella, dear...
If I hadn't spoken to Uncle Edward myself
I should never have had her for a bridesmaid.

741
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:02,047
Yes, my dear, you certainly have a way with you.

742
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:06,528
Spoken to papa ? I like that.
While you sat on his knees and stroked his whiskers.

743
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:08,948
And why not ?
Isn't he my uncle ?

744
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,412
And besides that, I think he's most frightfully thrilling.

745
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:15,748
I adore that stern and gloomy type of gentlemen.

746
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:18,862
Oh, come, come, my pet.

747
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:25,326
And I must tell you, Ba, how much I adore your poems.
It's best when dear Harry reads them.

748
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:29,127
He reads so beautifully.
And he too adores your poems.

749
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:32,966
Which ought to please you, as he's dreadfully critical.
Not at all, not at all.

750
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,776
Dear Harry is so frightfully earnest.

751
00:55:35,777 --> 00:55:40,369
Yes ?
Excuse me, Miss Elizabeth. Mr. Browning is downstairs.

752
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,941
Oh...

753
00:55:43,642 --> 00:55:48,175
Ask him to wait, please.
Oh, no, dear cousin. Ask him to come right up.

754
00:55:48,176 --> 00:55:51,174
We have to go downstairs and have tea with Uncle Edward.

755
00:55:51,175 --> 00:55:54,689
And besides, we wouldn't dream of interrupting your tęte-ŕ-tęte.

756
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:00,651
Isn't it thrilling, Harry ? Mr. Browning, a poet.
And Elizabeth a poet. Isn't that a coincidence ?

757
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:02,229
So quaint, my pet, quaint.

758
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:04,321
Ask Mr. Browning to come up now, Wilson.

759
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:07,262
Yes, and I'm quite sure that the tea is ready.

760
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:09,685
Arivederci, dearest Ba.

761
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:12,897
May I come soon again ?
Yes. Come whenever you like, Bella dear.

762
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:15,258
Next time I shall want you all to myself.

763
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:18,127
Without Harry.
But why must I be excluded ?

764
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:25,366
Because I keep the lids to tell dear Ba
about a certain big, big man who might easily
grow convinced if he heard me.

765
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:30,069
Oh, come, come, my pet.
It has been a pleasure, Miss Barrett.

766
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:35,094
Nice of you to come and see me.
Not at all. I have long been looking forward
to the honor of meeting you.

767
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:36,864
Good day.

768
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:41,877
Au revoir, darling.
Auf wiedersehen.

769
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:44,678
Good day.

770
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,640
Oh, Mr. Browning. I'm so thrilled to see you.
It is Mr. Browning, isn't it ?

771
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:04,356
It must be because I've often heard
him called the handsomest poet in England.

772
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:06,683
Of course you don't know poor little me.

773
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:09,089
Nevertheless, madam, I thank you.

774
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,249
Isn't he wonderful ?
Isn't he divine ?

775
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,554
The loveliest little shivers are running right down my back.

776
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:25,131
Come, come, my pet.

777
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,673
I've been unable to think of anything else.

778
00:57:29,674 --> 00:57:32,021
What about Italy ? Have you asked him yet ?

779
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:37,063
I'm not to go to Italy.

780
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:44,065
In spite of the fact that both doctors...
The doctors may have proposed, but the decision lies elsewhere.

781
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:48,734
But didn't they make it clear to him
that this may mean all the difference between life and death ?

782
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:52,755
I believe Dr. Ford-Waterlow spoke very forcibly and...
In heaven's name...

783
00:57:52,756 --> 00:57:56,607
It's rather hard to explain to seomeone
who doesn't know all the circumstances.

784
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:59,304
Papa is very devoted to me...
Devoted ?

785
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:02,739
Very devoted to me.
He depends a great deal on my companionship.

786
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,791
My brothers and sisters, they don't...
Devoted !

787
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:15,476
Miss Barrett, may I speak plainly ?
Oh, do you think you'd better ?

788
00:58:15,477 --> 00:58:17,504
I know more or less how you feel but...
Very well.

789
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,525
I shall say nothing.

790
00:58:22,726 --> 00:58:24,734
You tell me he's devoted to you.

791
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,985
I don't understand.

792
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:30,577
I don't understand a devotion
that demands favors as if they were rights.

793
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,767
I don't understand a devotion
that spends itself in petty tyrannies and gross bullying.

794
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:38,857
I don't understand a devotion
that grudges you any ray of light and glimpse of happiness.

795
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:42,818
Doesn't even stop at risking
your life to gratify its collossal selfishness.

796
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,200
Devotion !

797
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:47,363
Give me good, sound,
honest hatred other than devotion like that.

798
00:58:47,364 --> 00:58:50,796
Mr. Browning, I must ask you...
Forgive me but I won't be silent any longer.

799
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:54,659
Even before I met you I knew
that sickness wasn't the only shadow on your life.

800
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:59,458
And all these months I felt
that other shadow deepen and I have stood by and looked on.

801
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:01,712
But I'm done with pretense from today on.

802
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:05,810
It's not just your comfort and happiness which are at stake now.
It's your very life.

803
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:07,538
And I forbid you to play with your life.

804
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:11,094
And I have the right to forbid you.
No, please don't say any more.

805
00:59:11,095 --> 00:59:14,769
The right. At our first meeting you forbade me to speak of love.

806
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:18,677
But I knew well enough, we both knew,
that I was to be much more than just your friend.

807
00:59:18,678 --> 00:59:21,312
Even before I passed that door I loved you.

808
00:59:21,313 --> 00:59:24,503
And I've gone on loving you.
And I shall love you to the end.

809
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:26,145
And beyond.

810
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,670
You know that.

811
00:59:27,671 --> 00:59:29,600
You've always known it.

812
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:31,032
Yes.

813
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,797
Yes, I've always known it.

814
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:42,207
And now, for pity's sake,
for pity's sake, leave me.

815
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:46,726
If my father had the least suspicion that you were more than a friend,
both our lives would be made unbearable.

816
00:59:49,427 --> 00:59:52,620
I love you and I shall never leave you.

817
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:58,466
And I love you, Robert.

818
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,672
And yet you ask me
to take my marching orders and go out of your life.

819
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:10,504
Yes, Robert. But what have I to give you ?

820
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:13,102
I have so little of all that love asks for.

821
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:16,127
I should have refused to see you again after our first meeting.

822
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:20,214
For I loved you then
though I would have denied it even to myself.

823
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,258
I love you.
Oh, Robert.

824
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:25,492
Do you know what you've done for me ?

825
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:30,162
I could have laughed when Dr. Chambers said
that I'd heal myself by wanting to live.

826
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:36,357
Oh, I wanted to live eagerly, desperately, passionately,
but only because life meant you.

827
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:42,916
You, the sight of your face,
the sound of your voice and the touch of your hand.

828
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,669
Oh, and so much more than that.

829
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:49,154
Because of you the air once more was sweet to breathe.

830
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,833
And all the world was good and green again.

831
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:56,949
And with those words singing in my ears,
I am to turn my back on you and go.

832
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,833
Yes, Robert. For how is it to end ?

833
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,776
What have we to look forward to and...
I love you.

834
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,315
And I want you for my wife.

835
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:10,069
Robert, I can't marry you.

836
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:14,816
How can I with...
Not today or tomorrow. Not this year perhaps, or next.

837
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:17,001
Perhaps not for years ro come.

838
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:18,957
I may never be able to marry you.

839
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:24,855
But what then ? If you remain to the last
beyond my reach, I shall die proud and happy...

840
01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:28,956
... in having spent a lifetime fighting
to gain the richest prize a man was ever offered...

841
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,327
No, no, no.

842
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,299
Robert, if we were to say goodbye today...

843
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,983
... we should have nothing but beautiful memories
of each other to last to the end of our lives.

844
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:48,446
Is it you who are speaking ?
What do you mean ?

845
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,938
Here's life.
Life offering us the best that life can give.

846
01:01:51,939 --> 01:01:55,005
And you dare not grasp at it
for fear that it will turn to dust in your hand.

847
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:58,502
I don't know you, I never thought you were a coward.
A coward ?

848
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:02,648
Yes, Robert, I'm a coward.
A coward through and through.

849
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:05,882
But it's not myself that am afraid.
I know that, my dear.

850
01:02:05,883 --> 01:02:09,932
What's another disaster, great or small,
to me who have known it would disaster all my life ?

851
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:14,299
But you're a fighter. You were born for victory and triumph.

852
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:20,373
Oh, what if disaster came to you through me ?
Yes. A fighter. But I'm sick of fighting alone.

853
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:25,308
I need a comrade in arms to fight beside me.
But not one already wounded in the battle.

854
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,530
Wounded but not defeated. Undaunted. Unbroken.

855
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:31,660
What finer comrade could a man ask for ?
But Robert...

856
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:34,342
No, no.
But Robert.

857
01:02:34,343 --> 01:02:35,762
No.

858
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:43,864
Dear Uncle Edward, don't you think
that your attitude about love and marriage...

859
01:02:43,865 --> 01:02:46,604
I repeat that I do not care to discuss that subject.

860
01:02:46,605 --> 01:02:51,062
Of course, dear Uncle Edward. Of course.
You aren't angry with me, are you ?

861
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:54,709
Certainly not, child.
Then why that gloomy frown ?

862
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,215
Sit down.

863
01:02:57,826 --> 01:02:59,430
There.

864
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:04,659
There. All gone.

865
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:09,437
Oh, come, come, my pet.
If my children were as bright and open and affectionate as you are...

866
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:14,084
I should be a much happier man.
You mustn't say such things or they'll hate me.

867
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,193
You're a very charming little person.

868
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:19,010
Anything wrong in that ?
I didn't say so.

869
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:22,043
What's that scent you've got on ?
Scent ? Me ?

870
01:03:22,044 --> 01:03:24,219
Don't you like it ?

871
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,689
I abominate scent as a rule, but yours is different.

872
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,937
Nice ?
It's delicate and subtle.

873
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,483
Still, I'd prefer you not to use it.
Why ?

874
01:03:31,484 --> 01:03:32,832
Never mind.

875
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:38,164
Oh, uncle, you're a darling.
You call me bright, and open, and affectionate...

876
01:03:38,165 --> 01:03:42,810
... charming, and fragrant. All within a few minutes.
You may kiss me.

877
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:56,385
You know who's upstairs, Uncle Edward ?
Mr. Robert Browning, the poet.

878
01:03:56,386 --> 01:04:00,106
Isn't that thrilling ?
I see nothing particularly thrilling in it.

879
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:04,162
Mr. Browning's respect for my daughter's intellect
seems to justify continuation of their friendship ?

880
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:08,961
Oh, yes. Such a nice intellectual friendship.
Two poets.

881
01:04:08,962 --> 01:04:15,222
My, my, wouldn't it be frightfully interesting
if only dear Flush could speak ?

882
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:17,044
Not as interesting as if you could keep silent.

883
01:04:17,045 --> 01:04:24,205
Oh, I'm just joking. And besides, I know that in his great big heart
Uncle Edward is really on the side of romance.

884
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:27,346
In the part of true love and all that.
What do you mean ?

885
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:34,425
If you could just have seen her face light up
when Mr. Browning's name was announced.
Bella, you...

886
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:10,216
Isn't it beautiful ?
Yes, miss, them wisteria is most certainly beautiful.
Isn't it though.

887
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:18,177
Oh, is that Mr. Browning over there ?

888
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:20,401
Shouldn't be at all surprised, miss.

889
01:06:30,202 --> 01:06:32,381
Miss Barrett, I believe.
How do you do, Mr. Browning ?

890
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:34,279
How do you do ?
How do you do, Flush ?

891
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,451
Wilson ?
Isn't this a coincidence ?

892
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,707
We were just enjoying the beautiful wisteria

893
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,419
But it's much more exquisite over there.

894
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,315
I'm afraid, however, you shall have to go on foot.

895
01:06:43,316 --> 01:06:46,977
Miss Ba, you mustn't.
Miss Wilson, I'm perfectly able to walk any distance.

896
01:06:46,978 --> 01:06:49,274
If you would care to go with me...
Yes, thank you.

897
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:52,334
Wilson, would you wait here ?
And you too, Flush, dear.

898
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:54,901
Miss Ba, what would the master say ?

899
01:06:54,902 --> 01:06:58,245
When my father returns to town
I shall be very pleased to tell him myself.

900
01:06:58,246 --> 01:07:00,605
Shall we ?
Greatest of pleasure.

901
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:03,644
You'll pardon us, Flush.

902
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:25,656
Oh, it's so beautiful.
I'm delighted that you like it.

903
01:07:25,657 --> 01:07:29,753
You can't imagine the difficulty I had
in getting that particular tree to grow that particular position.

904
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:34,553
And as for the sunlight, well, my dear, you won't believe the trouble I have with the sun.

905
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:37,352
It just won't stay still a minute.

906
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:42,952
So you got the sun to stay there just for me.
Oh, it was nothing at all, I assure you.

907
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:46,629
Wait until after we're married.
Please, Robert. Not today.

908
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,695
Let's just have today as a day of nonconsequential subjects.

909
01:07:49,696 --> 01:07:51,507
Agreed.

910
01:07:56,608 --> 01:08:00,929
Now, in here we have some very rare specimens.

911
01:08:01,073 --> 01:08:05,461
The choicest and most exotic beauties in the floral kingdom.

912
01:08:06,232 --> 01:08:07,834
For instance,

913
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:10,855
... here we have the Orchidaceae Stictophyllum.

914
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:13,879
How exquisite.

915
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:20,362
Here, by a curious coincidence, we have two chairs.
Also very rare.

916
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,574
And here, my dear, you have a man who loves you.

917
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:30,155
Also very rare.
Very.

918
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:35,770
Has it got any feathers ?
No !

919
01:08:35,971 --> 01:08:38,963
A tiger ?
No. No.

920
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:40,998
A dragon ?
No.

921
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:44,115
Think of something you're more afraid of
than anything else in the world.

922
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:46,742
Hm. Is is a gggg..girl.

923
01:08:48,643 --> 01:08:51,891
I know ! It's papa !
Yes !

924
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,943
Listen, Ba.

925
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:12,975
Do you remember that, Ba ?
Yes, dear.

926
01:09:12,976 --> 01:09:14,809
You wrote the words and I always loved it.

927
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,226
Yes, dear.
Let BBBBa play it.

928
01:09:23,252 --> 01:09:25,390
I haven't played it in years.

929
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:26,999
My arm, madame.

930
01:09:27,225 --> 01:09:29,196
Make way for the prima donna.

931
01:09:29,197 --> 01:09:31,859
I'll turn the pages for you.
Oh, you're making me nervous.

932
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,569
Henrietta, dear, you should really play this.
No, darling, you play it.

933
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:39,133
Oh, I don't think I seem to remember it.

934
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:58,287
Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...

935
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:05,636
... to lie along with thine ?

936
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:14,118
As a little stone in a running stream...

937
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:21,485
... it seems to lie and pine.

938
01:10:21,486 --> 01:10:27,821
Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear,

939
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:35,528
... unfit to plight with thine.

940
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:47,419
Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...

941
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:59,724
... to lie alone with thine ?

942
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:01,484
That's lovely, Ba.

943
01:11:01,485 --> 01:11:04,035
Look at Henrietta, she's cccrying.

944
01:11:04,036 --> 01:11:08,735
I just think it's so lovely seeing Ba sing again.

945
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:12,790
Bless you, dear.
Sing it again, Ba.
Yes, do.

946
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:14,660
I will if you all join me. Will you ?
Yes.

947
01:11:14,664 --> 01:11:23,350
Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...

948
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:29,533
... to lie along with thine ?

949
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:37,528
As a little stone in a running stream...

950
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:43,304
... it seems to lie and pine.

951
01:11:43,305 --> 01:11:50,305
Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear,

952
01:11:50,468 --> 01:11:56,718
... unfit to plight with thine.

953
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:04,796
Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...

954
01:12:04,797 --> 01:12:12,419
... to lie alone with thine ?

955
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,264
Good heavens, you'll be a success.
No...

956
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:20,318
Come on, let's have another game.
Its my turn to go out.

957
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:31,622
Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth.

958
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:38,718
This letter's just come. Special letter just brought.

959
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:42,468
It's from papa.

960
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:46,284
But he was to return tomorrow.
Perhaps he's been detained.

961
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:47,900
Do you think so ?

962
01:12:51,885 --> 01:12:55,316
Oh.
What is it ?

963
01:12:55,317 --> 01:12:58,982
"This is to let you know that
we shall be leaving London within a fortnight...

964
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:03,115
I've taken a furnished house at Bookham in Surrey,
six miles from the nearest railroad station...

965
01:13:03,116 --> 01:13:07,326
You will benefit by the country air
and complete seclusion of your new surroundings."

966
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,880
Hurry up, aren't you ready yet ?
Oh, poor Henrietta.

967
01:13:10,881 --> 01:13:13,374
We mustn't let her know.
Poor Surtees Cook.

968
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:18,445
"I have thought for some time now
that your present feverishly restless mode of living in London will, if continued...

969
01:13:18,446 --> 01:13:21,494
... affect you harmfully both physically and morally..."

970
01:13:21,495 --> 01:13:24,458
... my feverishly restless mode of living...

971
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:27,926
... no wonder he doesn't describe me as a recklessly dissipated woman..

972
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:34,179
"You will inform your brothers and sisters of my decision
and tell them that I decline absolutely to discuss it when I return home."

973
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,124
He doesn't say when.
Oh, Ba, you poor darling.

974
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:43,299
He made my going to Italy impossible
and now we are to be cut off from any little pleasures we find here.

975
01:13:47,413 --> 01:13:51,906
I see that he finishes up with the characteristic touch of humor.
Humor ?

976
01:13:52,404 --> 01:13:55,530
He signs himself "your loving papa".

977
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:59,061
You see what this means ?
Yes.

978
01:13:59,062 --> 01:14:02,785
Perhaps better than you do.
Oh, you're wrong. You don't know papa as I do.

979
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:07,419
He's growing jealous of my life here.
My pleasures and my friends...

980
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,191
and I'm slowly and surely to be parted from them.

981
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:13,612
Oh, Robert, it will soon be made impossible for me to see you at all.

982
01:14:15,013 --> 01:14:21,605
This precious letter of your father's
means a great deal more that you as yet haven't been able to grasp.

983
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:22,929
Great deal more ?

984
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,253
It means that you will be in Italy before the month is out.

985
01:14:25,254 --> 01:14:27,315
Italy ?
Yes. And with me.

986
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:29,672
Robert !
It means we must be married at once.

987
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:33,141
Do you know what you're saying ?
Yes, I know what I'm saying and I repeat it.

988
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:34,774
We must be married at once.

989
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:41,381
Oh, Robert. It's no use deceiving ourselves.

990
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,420
It's not only papa who stands between us.
It's I.

991
01:14:45,421 --> 01:14:47,049
It's I.

992
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:51,832
However stronger
I may become I shall always remain an invalid.

993
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:59,402
Oh, Robert, as your wife, dear,
I should be haunted day and night by...

994
01:14:59,403 --> 01:15:02,876
by thoughts of all the glorious things
you would have done but for me.

995
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:06,745
Freedom, adventure...

996
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:08,482
... and passionate love. I...

997
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:12,022
... I could never really satisfy.
No. No, listen.

998
01:15:12,023 --> 01:15:13,354
Oh, Robert.

999
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:17,901
I should be haunted by the ghosts of your unborn children.

1000
01:15:20,702 --> 01:15:23,798
When I read that letter my world seemed to fall to pieces.

1001
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:27,148
But now I thank God that it came while I was still free.

1002
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:32,192
I have the strength to shake hands and say goodbye.

1003
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:37,531
On the whole I think this will be our best plan of campaign.

1004
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:42,121
We'll meet at Marylebone Church on Saturday
and be married quietly some time in the morning.

1005
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:45,513
I'll see about the license at once and interview the vicar.
Robert !

1006
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:48,454
The packet leaves the Royal Pier on Saturdays at midnight.

1007
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:51,054
We must catch the 8 o'clock express at Vauxhall.

1008
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:53,655
It arrives at Southhampton at 11.

1009
01:15:54,974 --> 01:15:56,194
Dear.

1010
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:06,978
Come along, come along.

1011
01:16:08,879 --> 01:16:13,472
And I always thought that papa
was the most overbearing man in the world.

1012
01:16:14,173 --> 01:16:17,131
And yet you've known me for quite some time now.

1013
01:16:18,332 --> 01:16:21,972
I know, darling, but I mustn't give way.

1014
01:16:21,973 --> 01:16:25,012
I mustn't, I daren't.
There's one other thing, my darling.

1015
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,241
You can't possibly travel without a maid.

1016
01:16:27,242 --> 01:16:29,508
Do you think Wilson would be willing to come abroad with us ?

1017
01:16:29,509 --> 01:16:32,609
Robert...

1018
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:36,721
Have you ever thought that
my strenght may break down in the journey ?

1019
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,933
Yes.

1020
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:43,954
So as I were to die on your hands.

1021
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:47,942
Are you afraid, Ba ?
Afraid,

1022
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:54,716
You know I'd rather die with you beside me
than live a hundred lives without you.

1023
01:16:54,717 --> 01:16:58,354
But how would you feel if I were to die like that ?

1024
01:16:58,355 --> 01:17:01,050
And what would the world say of you ?

1025
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,376
I should be branded as a little better than a murderer.

1026
01:17:05,177 --> 01:17:10,243
What I should feel, I leave you to imagine.

1027
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:15,479
And yet you ask me to come with you ?
Yes.

1028
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,129
I'm prepared to risk your life and much more than mine.

1029
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,892
Get you out of that dreadful house
and into the sunshine, and to have you...

1030
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:24,223
... for my wife.

1031
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:29,177
You love me like that ?

1032
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,297
I love you like that.

1033
01:17:48,298 --> 01:17:50,599
Robert.
Yes, dear.

1034
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,437
Will you...

1035
01:17:53,438 --> 01:17:55,651
will you give me a little time ?

1036
01:17:55,652 --> 01:17:58,109
Time is short, my dear.
Yes, I know.

1037
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:01,738
Your father is expected back...
Not till next week

1038
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:04,657
You shall know before then.

1039
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:07,486
You promise me that ?

1040
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:10,409
I promise.

1041
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:30,785
Oh, Miss Ba, I was that worried about you.
Out in the rain and everything.

1042
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:34,592
Rain ? Oh, yes.
Quite a shower.

1043
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:39,268
The sun's shining and lovely now.
Contrary thing.

1044
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,596
Oh, is anything wrong, miss ?

1045
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,963
Wrong ?
No, no.

1046
01:18:49,597 --> 01:18:55,333
Ba ! Oh, Ba, you must see him at once, you simply must.
Him ?

1047
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:58,449
He's in full regimentals. He's just been to St James
to receive whatever you call it,

1048
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,634
... his adjunctancy or something, from Queen Victoria herself.

1049
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,215
Oh, he's wonderful, he's gorgeous.

1050
01:19:04,216 --> 01:19:07,473
I'm talking about Captain Cook, you know.
Yes, so I've gathered.

1051
01:19:07,474 --> 01:19:12,278
Darling, I'm swooning out now.
I've just been out and I'm quite tired.

1052
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:17,440
But some other time will do just as well.
No, no. I told you, he's in full uniform.

1053
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:20,838
Oh, he's just on the landing outside.
Please see him, Ba.

1054
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,539
All right darling, bring him in.

1055
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,486
Come up, Surtees.

1056
01:19:30,487 --> 01:19:32,662
Careful or you'll wreck yourself.

1057
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:37,275
There.

1058
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:39,199
Attention !

1059
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,565
March !

1060
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:47,635
Captain Surtees Cook, Ba.
My sister Elizabeth.

1061
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:49,040
Your servant, Miss Barrett.

1062
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:55,023
Captain Cook.
Twice honored in one day, you know.

1063
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,216
First by Her Majesty, then by you, Miss Bartett.

1064
01:19:57,217 --> 01:20:01,126
Really, I don't know what I've done to deserve it.
That's right, you've just come from the palace, haven't you ?

1065
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:03,340
I've never seen the Queen.
Tell me, what is she like ?

1066
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:06,351
Very little lady, mam.
But royal every inch of her.

1067
01:20:06,352 --> 01:20:09,903
Surtees, you haven't got your sword on.
Not etiquette, as I told you, to wear it indoors.

1068
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,930
Oh, bother. I shall get it. I want Ba to see you in full war paint.
Where did you leave it ?

1069
01:20:12,935 --> 01:20:14,595
Well, it's in the hall.
I'll fetch it.

1070
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:18,265
No, look here, Miss Barrett doesn't want to...
But indeed I do, Captain Cook.

1071
01:20:18,304 --> 01:20:21,136
I don't think I've ever seen
an officer in full war paint before.

1072
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:22,315
Indeed ?

1073
01:20:22,316 --> 01:20:23,864
Won't you sit down.

1074
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,385
Oh, yes, Wilson, I think you'd better take Flush out.

1075
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:34,931
He always gets so excited
when there are a few people in the room.

1076
01:20:34,932 --> 01:20:36,560
Oh, yes, of course.

1077
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,831
Miss Barrett...
Yes ?

1078
01:20:42,232 --> 01:20:45,686
Miss Barrett...
Yes, Captain Cook ?

1079
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:48,355
I say, Miss Barrett...

1080
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:53,390
You want to tell me something about Henrietta, don't you ?
Just so, Miss Barrtett, just so. Exactly.

1081
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:57,411
You know, Miss Barrett, you know...
Yes, Captain Cook, I know.

1082
01:20:57,412 --> 01:21:00,125
And believe me, you have my heartfelt sympathy.

1083
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:02,853
Thank you, oh, thank you, it's more than I deserve.

1084
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:07,472
Thank you, Miss Barrett.
Never was such a girl, you know. Henrietta, I mean.

1085
01:21:07,473 --> 01:21:10,237
I don't know what I've done to deserve it.

1086
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:15,348
Captain Cook...
Did he tell you something while I was out of the room ?

1087
01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:19,202
Don't tell me he really managed to get it out.
Well, perhaps not quite...

1088
01:21:19,203 --> 01:21:23,189
Well, still you know, like most ladies, quick in the uptake.
Yes, I understood.

1089
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:28,932
Listen, my dear. Don't ever let anything
keep you from doing what you think in your heart is right.

1090
01:21:29,102 --> 01:21:30,779
Remember that.

1091
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,923
Quite aware I'm not much of a match, Miss Barrett.
Poor man you know.

1092
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:37,179
Surtees, let me buckle on your sword.

1093
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:41,684
Oh, I say...
Ba thinks that poets are the flower of manhood,
a certain poet at any rate.

1094
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:45,126
I mean to show her that she's mistaken.
You've got it wrong, you know.

1095
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:47,634
I have ?
The sword hangs from the left hip, you know.

1096
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:51,309
Why ?
Well, it's sort of...

1097
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,989
Papa !

1098
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,419
You're back sooner than I expected, papa.

1099
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,945
I don't think I have the privilege of this gentleman's acquaintance.

1100
01:22:06,946 --> 01:22:12,245
Captain Cook, may I introduce my father.
Papa, Captain Surtees Cook.

1101
01:22:12,246 --> 01:22:14,450
Your servant, sir.

1102
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:19,089
Captain Cook is a great friend of George and Octavius.

1103
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:20,608
Indeed.

1104
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:23,703
My sons are very rarely at home at this hour of the day.

1105
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:26,761
The fact is, sir, I was just passing the house and...

1106
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:31,218
... I thought I'd look in, you know,
in the off chance of finding one of them in and all that.

1107
01:22:31,219 --> 01:22:34,454
I see.
Captain Cook has just come from Buckingham Palace.

1108
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:38,022
And Henrietta thought I should like
to see him in all the splendor of his regimentals.

1109
01:22:38,023 --> 01:22:39,531
Indeed.

1110
01:22:40,332 --> 01:22:43,228
Nothing much to look at, of course, sir, but...

1111
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:46,460
ladies like a bit of color and I thought...

1112
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:53,904
By Jove, it must be getting late...
It is 19 and a half minutes past twelve.

1113
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:05,100
By Jove, it's high time that I was moving.

1114
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:11,238
Goodbye, Miss Barrett.
Goodbye, Captain.

1115
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:16,459
Goodbye, Miss Henrietta.
I'll see you out.

1116
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,809
Your servant, sir.

1117
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,807
I'm seeing Captain Cook to the door.
The servants will attend to that.

1118
01:23:37,131 --> 01:23:40,588
This house is fast becoming a rendez-vous for half London.

1119
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:43,481
This was the first time I had the pleasure of meeting Captain Cook.

1120
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:46,021
Indeed, but I infer from what I saw as I came into the room ...

1121
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:49,488
... that Henrietta's acquaintance
has a somewhat longer standing, or am I mistaken ?

1122
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:52,043
I've known Captain Cook for some time now.

1123
01:23:52,044 --> 01:23:56,284
Oh, since when has it been your custom to buckle on his accoutrement ?

1124
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:58,534
I'd never seen him in full uniform before.

1125
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:02,910
And I think it improbable that you will see
him in full uniform or otherwise in the future.

1126
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:04,136
But papa...

1127
01:24:04,137 --> 01:24:09,276
Captain Cook to be forbidden to visit us
because I helped him on with his sword....

1128
01:24:10,877 --> 01:24:13,204
You received my letter ?
Yes, papa.

1129
01:24:13,205 --> 01:24:16,357
What has just happened
fully confirms me in the wisdom of my decision.

1130
01:24:16,358 --> 01:24:20,275
Fortunately our new home is so far from town
that your London friends are not likely to trouble us.

1131
01:24:20,276 --> 01:24:23,299
Our new home ? I don't understand.

1132
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,427
Are we leaving Wimpole Street ?

1133
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:28,297
I have taken a house in Bookham in Surrey.
Why ?

1134
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:32,805
I am not in the habit of accounting
for my actions to anyone, least of all to my children.

1135
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:35,260
But one thing I've the right to ask you, papa.

1136
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:39,490
Is Captain Cook to be forbidden the house because of what just happened ?

1137
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:47,283
I understood you to say Captain Cook was George's friend and Octavius'.

1138
01:24:47,284 --> 01:24:50,657
Yes, and my friend too.

1139
01:24:50,658 --> 01:24:53,054
Ah... come here.

1140
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:56,906
Yes, papa ?

1141
01:24:56,907 --> 01:24:58,739
Come here !

1142
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,281
What is this man to you ?

1143
01:25:03,282 --> 01:25:05,587
I told you, he's a friend of ours.

1144
01:25:05,588 --> 01:25:07,569
What is he to you ?

1145
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,637
A friend.
Is that all ?

1146
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,240
Yes.

1147
01:25:11,241 --> 01:25:13,498
You liar !
Papa !

1148
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:15,857
Papa, let me go.
What is this man to you ? Answer me.

1149
01:25:15,858 --> 01:25:18,474
Please, papa, please.
Answer me !

1150
01:25:18,475 --> 01:25:20,073
No. No.
Answer me !

1151
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:21,704
He's... he's...

1152
01:25:21,705 --> 01:25:25,772
Oh, papa, I love him !
Ah...

1153
01:25:25,773 --> 01:25:28,138
Oh, you... you... you...

1154
01:25:28,139 --> 01:25:30,667
You... you... !
Papa ! Papa !

1155
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:34,073
Let her go ! I won't have it !
Let her go at once.

1156
01:25:35,274 --> 01:25:38,659
You and this filthiness !

1157
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:42,202
I've known that Henrietta loved Captain Cook
for some time and I've given her all my strength.

1158
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,397
You dare to tell me !
Yes !

1159
01:25:44,398 --> 01:25:47,449
I would have given her
all my help too if I had it to give.

1160
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:50,580
I'll deal with you later.
Get up !

1161
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:53,988
Papa, listen to me, please...

1162
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:57,087
I'm not a bad girl, I swear to you I'm not.

1163
01:25:57,088 --> 01:26:01,010
I know I've deceived you, I'm sorry.
I love him. I love him.

1164
01:26:01,011 --> 01:26:03,743
He's a good man. It can't be wrong to love him.

1165
01:26:03,744 --> 01:26:06,441
I want love. I can't live without love.

1166
01:26:06,442 --> 01:26:11,449
Papa, remember how you loved mama and she loved you
and you'll understand and pity me...

1167
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,158
Get up !

1168
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,326
Sit there !

1169
01:26:28,427 --> 01:26:33,433
How long has this been going on ?
Do you hear me ? How long have you been carrying on with this fellow ?

1170
01:26:34,234 --> 01:26:38,789
I've known Captain Cook for over a year.
You've been with him often ?

1171
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,251
Yes,
Alone ?

1172
01:26:40,351 --> 01:26:42,513
Yes.
Where ?

1173
01:26:42,514 --> 01:26:46,282
We met in the park, and...
In here ?

1174
01:26:46,283 --> 01:26:49,247
Yes.
Here and alone ?

1175
01:26:49,248 --> 01:26:51,936
Have you been with him in this house alone ?

1176
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:53,775
Yes.

1177
01:26:53,776 --> 01:27:00,366
So clandestine meetings under my own roof
and abetted by one whom I beleived to be holy, chaste and good...

1178
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:02,366
How dare you, papa.

1179
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:06,733
Now listen to me.
Unless you give me your solemn word that you will neither...

1180
01:27:06,734 --> 01:27:09,035
... see nor have any communication with this man again,

1181
01:27:09,036 --> 01:27:13,627
... you will leave my house at once
as you are with nothing but the clothes you have on.

1182
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:17,591
Once outside my doors,
you can go to perdition any way you please.

1183
01:27:17,592 --> 01:27:20,284
But you will never be admitted again as long as I live.

1184
01:27:20,285 --> 01:27:23,332
I think you know I never go back on my word.

1185
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:27,322
You have your choice. Take it.

1186
01:27:27,323 --> 01:27:31,002
Is it nothing to you
that I shall hate you for this to the end of my life ?

1187
01:27:31,003 --> 01:27:32,726
Less than nothing.

1188
01:27:32,727 --> 01:27:36,364
Will you give me your word neither to see
nor to have any communication with this man again ?

1189
01:27:37,665 --> 01:27:40,468
I have no choice.

1190
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,873
Elizabeth, give me your Bible.

1191
01:27:44,474 --> 01:27:48,157
My Bible belonged to mama.
I can't have it used for such a purpose.

1192
01:27:50,258 --> 01:27:52,782
Give me your Bible.
No.

1193
01:27:53,783 --> 01:27:55,298
You refuse ?

1194
01:27:55,299 --> 01:27:56,709
Yes.

1195
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:07,052
Come here.

1196
01:28:18,553 --> 01:28:20,336
Place your hand upon the Book.

1197
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:26,381
Repeat after me.
I give you my solemn word...

1198
01:28:26,382 --> 01:28:30,210
... that I shall neither see
nor have any communication with Captain Cook again.

1199
01:28:30,211 --> 01:28:34,333
I give you my solemn word that I will neither see...

1200
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:37,806
nor have any communication with Captain Cook again.

1201
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:46,733
You will now go your room
and remain there until you have my permission to leave it.

1202
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:55,718
Henrietta.

1203
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,166
Henrietta.

1204
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,215
Do you remember what I told you ?

1205
01:29:07,916 --> 01:29:12,118
Just what did that mean ?
I was reminding Henrietta what I told her a short time ago.

1206
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:14,619
I begged her to fight for her happiness.

1207
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:17,618
You dare !
Yes, yes !

1208
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:23,013
For years I've crushed down my doubts.
I tried to persuade myself that in spite of all you loved us.

1209
01:29:23,014 --> 01:29:25,351
But at last I've been forced to face the truth.

1210
01:29:25,352 --> 01:29:28,815
You're like a shadow over our lives.
I command you to be silent.

1211
01:29:28,816 --> 01:29:31,862
I won't stand by and see you wreck her life if I can save it.

1212
01:29:31,863 --> 01:29:34,383
You may be too strong for me, but at least I'll try.

1213
01:29:34,384 --> 01:29:35,858
I'll try...
Elizabeth !

1214
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:39,436
You might have had the love of all your children.
But instead you have fear.

1215
01:29:39,437 --> 01:29:40,927
Fear and hatred.
Elizabeth !

1216
01:29:40,928 --> 01:29:44,551
Hatred, I tell you. Hatred and mine too. Hatred.

1217
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,805
It will be hard for me to forget what you have said.

1218
01:29:52,806 --> 01:29:56,441
I shall leave you under my extreme displeasure.

1219
01:29:56,442 --> 01:30:01,655
When you have repented your wickedness
and are ready to ask for God's forgiveness,

1220
01:30:01,656 --> 01:30:04,784
... and mine, you may send for me.

1221
01:30:29,985 --> 01:30:31,418
Come in.

1222
01:30:31,419 --> 01:30:33,798
Wilson, shut the door, please.

1223
01:30:38,799 --> 01:30:40,242
Wilson...

1224
01:30:40,243 --> 01:30:42,246
Are you my friend ?
Your friend ?

1225
01:30:42,247 --> 01:30:45,449
Yes, I'm very much in need of friendship and help at the moment.

1226
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:48,893
Oh, I'm that fond of you
I'd do anything to help you, miss Ba.

1227
01:30:48,894 --> 01:30:50,672
Good.

1228
01:30:50,673 --> 01:30:54,077
I'm going to marry Mr. Browning.
Marry ?
Shhh.

1229
01:30:55,278 --> 01:30:58,034
Does he know ?
No, and he mustn't. Nobody must.

1230
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,734
I should just think not indeed.

1231
01:31:00,735 --> 01:31:02,122
Oh, Miss Ba.

1232
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,087
I'm that glad.

1233
01:31:04,088 --> 01:31:06,051
After we're married we're going to Italy.

1234
01:31:06,052 --> 01:31:08,225
And Mr. Browning would like to know if you'll come with us.

1235
01:31:08,226 --> 01:31:10,627
To Italy ?
Yes. Will you come ?

1236
01:31:10,628 --> 01:31:12,867
Well, miss, I don't see as how I can help meself.

1237
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:15,888
Not that I hold to foreign parts, I don't, but...

1238
01:31:15,889 --> 01:31:19,411
husband or no husband,
you'd never get to Italy alive without me.

1239
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:23,728
Thank you, Wilson.
Now, I want you to take a letter right to Mr. Browning.

1240
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:25,726
You'll have to take a cab at once.

1241
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:29,217
A cab ?
Yes, go and get all your things.
I'll have this finished by the time you're ready.

1242
01:31:29,218 --> 01:31:30,784
Hurry !
But Miss Ba...

1243
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:33,452
... is it to be at once ?
No, probably not for a month or so.

1244
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:35,196
Be quick, though.
Yes, miss.

1245
01:31:37,797 --> 01:31:39,831
But Miss Ba...

1246
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:43,247
If it's not to be for a month...
Yes, Wilson, I know I'm absurd...

1247
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:49,024
but I made up this courage.
Besides, I believe Mr. Browning will be glad to get my letter.

1248
01:31:49,025 --> 01:31:50,903
Oh, I'm sure he will, miss.

1249
01:32:01,604 --> 01:32:04,560
Miss Wilson, has anything happened ?

1250
01:32:06,061 --> 01:32:09,385
What is it ?
Miss Ba sent this for you, sir.

1251
01:32:09,386 --> 01:32:11,047
Oh.

1252
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:18,290
Oh, it's all right, sir.

1253
01:32:30,391 --> 01:32:31,973
Wilson, I...

1254
01:32:35,274 --> 01:32:38,565
I was afraid that... perhaps...

1255
01:32:43,666 --> 01:32:45,676
If you don't mind, sir...

1256
01:32:45,677 --> 01:32:51,805
I think it's splendid.
Oh, thank you, Wilson, thank you.

1257
01:32:51,806 --> 01:32:54,275
Thank you, Wilson.
If you don't mind, sir.

1258
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:56,945
Wilson, I knew she'd do it.
I had no right to be afraid.

1259
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:59,900
I wasn't really afraid.
Oh, no, sir.

1260
01:32:59,902 --> 01:33:04,721
Wilson, do you realize that you are the bearer
of the greatest good tidings since
they brought the good news from ------ ?

1261
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:07,678
You wait here, Wilson.
I'm going upstairs and tell the good news to my mother.

1262
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,294
I'm going to tell it to everybody.
Oh I wouldn't do that, sir.

1263
01:33:10,295 --> 01:33:13,464
You wait here and then we'll go back
together in triumph to Wimpole Street.

1264
01:33:13,465 --> 01:33:17,389
Perhaps we'd better have music, a band or something.
You're not to do that, sir.

1265
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:19,764
The master's come home.
What's that ?

1266
01:33:19,765 --> 01:33:22,682
Mr. Barrett, sir. He came home.

1267
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,590
Oh, Miss Ba.
Shhh.

1268
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:49,251
Oh, Miss Ba, you can't imagine...

1269
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:58,852
What did he say ?
Well, miss, he's a most unusual man.

1270
01:33:58,854 --> 01:34:02,112
There he stood giving me orders.
Telling me what you and me was to do.

1271
01:34:02,113 --> 01:34:04,652
Really, miss, I don't know what your married life is going to be like.

1272
01:34:04,653 --> 01:34:06,635
Wilson, was he pleased when he read the letter ?

1273
01:34:06,636 --> 01:34:10,933
He was that pleased, miss.
What did he say, how did he look ?
I want to know everything.

1274
01:34:10,934 --> 01:34:13,924
Well, miss... He couldn't say a word at first.

1275
01:34:13,925 --> 01:34:18,659
He seemd all kind of choked up, like...
Oh, Wilson.

1276
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:24,091
Wilson, he was happy that I...
Yes, miss, he was that happy. You should have seen his face.

1277
01:34:24,092 --> 01:34:27,209
And then he started running
around with timetables and those things.

1278
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:30,257
And he says you are to wear
your ordinary travelling clothes to the church.

1279
01:34:30,258 --> 01:34:31,519
Church ?

1280
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,067
Yes, miss, you're going to be married tonight.

1281
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:36,858
But, Wilson. That's absurd.

1282
01:34:36,859 --> 01:34:40,343
Tonight ? How can we ?
I don't know. But we're going to.

1283
01:34:40,344 --> 01:34:43,160
He's going to get a vicar and a special license.

1284
01:34:43,161 --> 01:34:45,497
And as soon as we're finished packing,
we're to meet him at the church.

1285
01:34:45,498 --> 01:34:47,615
So I might just as well start packing.

1286
01:34:47,616 --> 01:34:50,439
But Wilson, how can we ?
Don't ask me, ask him.

1287
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:55,029
What dresses are you going to pack, miss ?
Wilson, do you want to drive me mad. You know we can't.

1288
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:57,332
He says you can.

1289
01:34:57,333 --> 01:34:59,603
Oh, miss. There's a lot I'd give to be here...

1290
01:34:59,604 --> 01:35:02,814
... when the master finds out you've gone and got married.

1291
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:05,372
Don't Wilson, don't. The very thought terrifies me.

1292
01:35:05,373 --> 01:35:08,131
Wilson, put back those things and give me time to think.

1293
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:11,483
You know it's out of the question.
I'm not prepared and I...

1294
01:35:13,084 --> 01:35:16,551
Wilson ! Put back those things.

1295
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:23,382
Oh, miss, you did give me a turn.
Be quiet.

1296
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:24,949
Ba !

1297
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:28,566
What on earth is the matter ?
Why, nothing.

1298
01:35:28,567 --> 01:35:30,763
Nothing. It's just...

1299
01:35:30,764 --> 01:35:33,304
... it's all been so upsetting.
I don't believe that's all.

1300
01:35:33,305 --> 01:35:35,600
Look at Wilson.
You've startled us.

1301
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:38,274
Wilson, will you come back in a little while ?

1302
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,594
Is there something you want to say to me, dear ?

1303
01:35:41,595 --> 01:35:42,987
Yes.

1304
01:35:44,188 --> 01:35:49,178
Papa threatened to turn me out of the house
unless I swore on the Bible not to write or see Surtees.

1305
01:35:49,179 --> 01:35:52,410
Well, I'm going to break that Bible oath.
Are you, dear ?

1306
01:35:52,411 --> 01:35:56,665
Yes, and I shall glory in breaking it.
I shall see Surtees every day when we leave.

1307
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,282
And when we're in the country I shall write to him.

1308
01:35:58,283 --> 01:36:01,196
And if papa asks me, I'll go out of my way to lie to him.

1309
01:36:01,197 --> 01:36:03,616
I see. Why do you tell me this ?

1310
01:36:03,617 --> 01:36:06,921
Because I want you to say
that I'm a wicked, deceitful, perjured, loose woman...

1311
01:36:06,922 --> 01:36:09,073
... so that I can fling the words back in your face.

1312
01:36:09,074 --> 01:36:12,205
Oh, Ba.

1313
01:36:12,206 --> 01:36:15,097
Ba, darling, I didn't mean that.
I'm not myself.

1314
01:36:15,098 --> 01:36:18,148
I'm all love and hate.
I don't know which is the worse torture.

1315
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:23,829
Oh, my dear. You think I don't understand, but I do.

1316
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:26,065
I do.

1317
01:36:26,066 --> 01:36:28,833
And I implore you, dear, never lose hope.

1318
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:31,377
Never lose courage. Never.

1319
01:36:32,778 --> 01:36:33,749
The master.

1320
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:36,553
Ba, there is something.

1321
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,425
You're as white as a sheet.
What is it ? Is there anything I can do ?

1322
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:42,420
No, no. Don't speak, don't ask me anything.

1323
01:36:42,423 --> 01:36:45,218
You know nothing, you understand ? Nothing, nothing.

1324
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:56,376
What's the matter with that woman ?

1325
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:59,080
Wilson ?
Yes. And you.

1326
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,394
Nothing, papa.

1327
01:37:01,395 --> 01:37:05,129
Where have you been ?
Nowhere.

1328
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:07,193
Where are you going ?
To Aunt Hedley's.

1329
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:08,900
Is that the truth ?
Yes.

1330
01:37:08,901 --> 01:37:10,366
Remember your oath.
Yes.

1331
01:37:10,368 --> 01:37:12,234
Are you going to keep it ?
Yes.

1332
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,515
I want to speak to your sister. You may go.

1333
01:37:40,116 --> 01:37:43,243
Do you know why I've come back ?
No, papa.

1334
01:37:43,244 --> 01:37:45,741
Because I cannot bear to be estranged from you.

1335
01:37:45,742 --> 01:37:48,874
You should have come to me to beg
my forgiveness for your wicked and cruel words.

1336
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:53,173
But in spite of my sense of right
and justice and duty I had to come to you.

1337
01:37:53,174 --> 01:37:56,500
And I despise myself for coming.

1338
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:59,621
I despise myself, I hate myself...
Oh, no, no, no.

1339
01:37:59,622 --> 01:38:03,303
Oh, papa, can't you see,
won't you ever see that strength may be weakness ?

1340
01:38:03,304 --> 01:38:07,701
And that your sense of justice,
duty and right are all mistaken and wrong ?

1341
01:38:07,702 --> 01:38:15,218
It's been my heavy cross that those whom I was given to guide and rule
have always fought against the right which I knew to be the right.

1342
01:38:15,219 --> 01:38:20,521
And was in duty bound to impose upon them, even you.
Even your mother

1343
01:38:20,522 --> 01:38:22,511
My mother ?
Yes, your mother.

1344
01:38:22,612 --> 01:38:25,861
You, my eldest child, were born of love and only love.

1345
01:38:25,862 --> 01:38:31,632
But the others, long before they came,
love died out and fear took its place.

1346
01:38:31,633 --> 01:38:36,905
No, no...
Fear. And all because I saw the right and did it.

1347
01:38:36,906 --> 01:38:40,712
Not that she ever opposed me ever once.

1348
01:38:40,713 --> 01:38:43,676
Oh, dear God, what she must have suffered.

1349
01:38:43,677 --> 01:38:46,903
Ba, my dear, don't, don't.

1350
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:50,337
I shouldn't have spoken about it.
Take your hands from your face.

1351
01:38:52,438 --> 01:38:55,500
Don't look at me like that. You don't understand, how should you ?

1352
01:38:55,501 --> 01:39:00,334
You know nothing of the brutal tyranny of the senses and how
even the strongest and best are driven by it to hell.

1353
01:39:00,337 --> 01:39:03,312
Would you have abetted your sister...
Henrietta's in love !

1354
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:06,756
You dare speak of it in the same breath ?
Her, love ?

1355
01:39:07,557 --> 01:39:11,132
You ignorant little fool,
what do you know about love ?

1356
01:39:11,133 --> 01:39:13,299
Love. Desire.

1357
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,498
It's time a little reality were brought into your dream of life.

1358
01:39:16,499 --> 01:39:19,034
I won't listen to you.
You must ! You shall !

1359
01:39:19,035 --> 01:39:22,575
Do you suppose I should have guarded my house
like a dragon from this so-called love...

1360
01:39:22,576 --> 01:39:26,929
... if I hadn't known from my own life
all it entails of degradation and remorse ?

1361
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:32,481
With the help of God and through years
of tormenting abstinence I strangled it in myself...

1362
01:39:32,482 --> 01:39:37,587
... and so long as I have breath in my body
I'll keep it away from those I was given to protect.

1363
01:39:37,588 --> 01:39:39,456
Do you understand me ?

1364
01:39:40,957 --> 01:39:42,521
Yes.

1365
01:39:42,621 --> 01:39:44,670
I understand you.

1366
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:47,240
I understand you.

1367
01:39:47,241 --> 01:39:48,795
Very well.

1368
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:57,154
This has been a painful necessity
but I had to speak plainly lest your very innocence...

1369
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:01,429
... should smirch the purity I'm utterly
resolved to maintain in my household.

1370
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:05,648
You're cold as ice. Why are you trembling ?
I shall never forget what you have said.

1371
01:40:05,649 --> 01:40:10,225
For the love of heaven, my darling,
don't let this raise any further barrier between us.

1372
01:40:10,226 --> 01:40:14,709
I cannot play the coward's part
and take the easier way and shirk my duty.

1373
01:40:14,772 --> 01:40:17,867
I'd rather be hated by the whole world
than gain love that way.

1374
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:20,281
Oh, papa, you don't know how I pity you.

1375
01:40:20,283 --> 01:40:21,354
Pity ?

1376
01:40:21,355 --> 01:40:24,241
I don't want your pity.

1377
01:40:24,242 --> 01:40:26,701
If ever I should lose you or your love...

1378
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:32,229
My darling, in our new home
we shall draw close to each other again.

1379
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:38,101
Nothing and no one can come between us,
my child, my darling.

1380
01:40:38,102 --> 01:40:44,572
You want me to be happy.
The only happiness I shall ever know is all yours to give or take.

1381
01:40:44,573 --> 01:40:47,725
You must look up to me and depend on me and lean on me.

1382
01:40:47,726 --> 01:40:51,762
You must share your thoughts with me,
your hopes, your fears, your prayers...

1383
01:40:51,763 --> 01:40:54,441
I can't bear it, I can't bear any more.
Let me go papa. Please, let me go !

1384
01:41:06,242 --> 01:41:09,092
Forgive me, my dear, I was carried away.

1385
01:41:13,693 --> 01:41:16,617
Shall I leave you now ?
Please.

1386
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:20,082
Shall I see you again tonight ?
Not tonight.

1387
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:22,566
I shall pray for you.

1388
01:41:22,567 --> 01:41:25,129
Pray for me tonight ?

1389
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:28,024
Yes.

1390
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:30,670
Pray for me tonight if you will.

1391
01:41:50,001 --> 01:41:51,985
Did he find anything out ?

1392
01:41:51,986 --> 01:41:56,074
Wilson, I'm going. I must.

1393
01:41:56,075 --> 01:41:59,872
Now, at once.
Oh, Miss Ba, what's happened ? But we haven't packed.

1394
01:41:59,873 --> 01:42:02,172
Well, we must go without.
But we won't have as much as a nightgown.

1395
01:42:02,173 --> 01:42:05,474
We can buy them.
Miss Ba...
I can't stay here, Wilson.

1396
01:42:05,475 --> 01:42:08,405
I'm frightened. I'm frightened.

1397
01:42:08,406 --> 01:42:10,449
Fetch your cloak and bonnet.

1398
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:14,434
But, Miss Ba, if he did catch us...
He can't stop me. I don't belong to him anymore.

1399
01:42:14,435 --> 01:42:18,343
He could kill me, but he can't stop me.
Oh, Miss Ba, I daren't just now. I daren't.

1400
01:42:18,246 --> 01:42:21,425
Let's go to the other room.
Oh, we can't do that.

1401
01:42:21,426 --> 01:42:25,283
Wilson, I must. That's all I know. I must go.

1402
01:42:25,284 --> 01:42:27,953
To Robert.
But, miss Ba...

1403
01:42:27,954 --> 01:42:32,343
Wilson, until today I've never really known my father.

1404
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:36,071
I've even hoped I might confide in him,
but now I know t would be hopeless.

1405
01:42:36,072 --> 01:42:38,592
He'd crush me as he crushed my mother.
Oh, miss Ba...

1406
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:42,084
He's cruel, Wilson, cruel and pitiless and I'm afraid.

1407
01:42:42,085 --> 01:42:46,773
If you want to draw back
you needn't ever reproach yourself.

1408
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:49,391
But I must go to Mr. Browning now.

1409
01:42:49,392 --> 01:42:53,260
I'll fetch my cloak and bonnet at once, miss.

1410
01:42:53,261 --> 01:42:56,274
Wilson.
Oh, miss Ba.

1411
01:43:15,675 --> 01:43:19,662
They're all down to dinner now, miss.
The master's just gone in.

1412
01:43:19,663 --> 01:43:21,745
All right, Wilson.

1413
01:43:22,846 --> 01:43:24,797
Come, Flush.

1414
01:44:08,653 --> 01:44:12,433
Henrietta !
I'm going to call Arabel, papa.

1415
01:44:12,434 --> 01:44:15,935
Take your place and be seated without her.

1416
01:44:18,636 --> 01:44:21,911
Almighty Father, giver of all good gifts...

1417
01:44:21,912 --> 01:44:26,815
... who of thy thy divine providence
has provided thy unworthy servants...

1418
01:44:26,816 --> 01:44:30,581
... with all things necessary to their bodily sustenance.

1419
01:44:30,582 --> 01:44:34,516
Grant, we beseech thee, spiritual grace...

1420
01:44:34,517 --> 01:44:38,358
... that we may enjoy it in
quietness of spirit as proof of thy bounty...

1421
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:43,551
... and render unto Thee
most humble and hearty thank. Amen

1422
01:44:43,552 --> 01:44:44,989
Amen.

1423
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:07,884
For heaven's sake, what is it ?
Tell us at once !

1424
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:10,616
She's gone. To be married.

1425
01:45:10,617 --> 01:45:13,027
What do you mean ?
Arabel !

1426
01:45:13,028 --> 01:45:15,264
Arabel, pull yourself together at once !

1427
01:45:15,265 --> 01:45:21,549
Where's Ba ? Answer me, where's Ba ?
She's gone. She left this note. Read it.

1428
01:45:23,999 --> 01:45:25,922
It's true.

1429
01:45:25,923 --> 01:45:28,298
It's true.

1430
01:45:28,299 --> 01:45:31,799
She sends us her love
and will write to all of us from Italy.

1431
01:45:31,916 --> 01:45:33,173
Italy.

1432
01:45:33,174 --> 01:45:36,789
Look !
This letter is for papa.

1433
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:40,191
Papa.
What's to be done ?

1434
01:45:40,192 --> 01:45:42,765
Someone must give him Ba's letter.

1435
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:46,475
Let me. I should love to.

1436
01:45:53,176 --> 01:45:58,014
What is the meaning of this ?
Who was making that hideous noise ?

1437
01:46:00,615 --> 01:46:03,727
Where is Elizabeth ?

1438
01:46:03,728 --> 01:46:06,213
You hear me.

1439
01:46:07,214 --> 01:46:09,845
Where is your sister ?

1440
01:46:13,246 --> 01:46:15,484
She left you this letter.

1441
01:46:16,085 --> 01:46:18,541
Left me ?

1442
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:20,069
What do you mean ?

1443
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:22,694
She left a letter for Arabel.

1444
01:46:22,695 --> 01:46:24,610
And this for you.

1445
01:46:33,411 --> 01:46:36,918
Oh, papa, you must forgive her.
Not for her sake, but for yours.

1446
01:46:36,919 --> 01:46:39,800
I thought I hated you, but I don't.
I pity you.

1447
01:46:39,801 --> 01:46:42,251
And if you have any pity for yourself, forgive her.

1448
01:47:03,037 --> 01:47:05,143
Elizabeth.

1449
01:47:24,744 --> 01:47:29,065
Yes, yes, her dog.

1450
01:47:33,566 --> 01:47:37,169
Yes, I'll have her dog.

1451
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:41,818
Octavius.
Yes, sir.

1452
01:47:41,821 --> 01:47:45,196
Her dog must be destroyed at once.
What ?

1453
01:47:45,197 --> 01:47:50,176
You will take it to the vet tonight.
Do you understand me ? Tonight.

1454
01:47:50,677 --> 01:47:52,369
Do you understand me ?

1455
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:54,868
Heavens, I don't see what the ppp...poor little beast has done.

1456
01:47:54,869 --> 01:47:57,348
Do you understand me ?

1457
01:47:57,349 --> 01:48:02,388
In her letter, Ba writes that she has taken Flush with her.

1458
01:48:13,789 --> 01:48:19,640
For as much as Robert and Elizabeth
have consented together in holy wedlock...

1459
01:48:19,641 --> 01:48:23,923
... and have witnessed the same before God and this company...

1460
01:48:23,924 --> 01:48:28,490
... I pronounce that they be man and wife together.

1461
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:33,953
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost...

1462
01:48:33,954 --> 01:48:35,594
Amen.

1463
01:48:35,694 --> 01:48:40,157
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost...

1464
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:46,834
Bless, preserve and keep
that ye may so live together in this life...

1465
01:48:46,835 --> 01:48:52,766
... that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting.

1466
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,744
Amen.

1467
01:48:55,305 --> 01:49:55,879
