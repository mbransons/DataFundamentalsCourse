00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,796
Will you close it a little?

3
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,562
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.

4
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,606
Old solemn Roy himself.

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,778
Sit down, Roy. Sit on the floor
and hang your legs over.

6
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,991
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.

7
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,159
{y:i}You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.

8
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,496
{y:i}Who asked you
to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,792
Home? Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.

10
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,794
I was until you came in.

11
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:30,174
I advise you to get out
before you're kicked out.

12
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,093
Keep your... Keep your
filthy hands off of my girl.

13
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,514
Your girl. You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you
if you were the last man on Earth.

14
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,393
You're nothing to me. Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

15
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,813
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you. I never have.

16
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,692
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,696
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.

18
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:57,409
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick. Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!

19
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,127
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.

20
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,884
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.

21
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,929
{y:i}N'est-ce pas?

22
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,348
{y:i}Mmm, n'est-ce pas,
kiss Papa, huh?

23
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,727
Oh, baby.

24
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,903
Hello, chčri.

25
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,452
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.

26
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,372
Is your friend sick?

27
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,959
No. He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.

28
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,801
I still can't believe it.

29
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:42,347
You just don't know
anything about women.
They're all the same.

30
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,392
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.

31
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,396
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,570
- It's the war. She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.

33
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,992
War doesn't change people.
It's... It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.

34
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,745
You can't make me believe
Helen was like that before.

35
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,582
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?

36
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,503
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard. She isn't worth it.

37
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:17,049
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

38
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,512
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.

39
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,016
{y:i}You see, like this. Look.

40
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,812
Go ahead, Roy. Try it.

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,700
That's the way.

42
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,963
Oh! What you do, baby?
All wet! No, no, no, no!

43
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:01,552
{y:i}Imbecile! Aw, baby. Voilŕ.

44
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,639
Hey, listen, Monte. Monte.
Go easy. We gotta go up at 3:00.

45
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,016
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.

46
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,727
{y:i}What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.

47
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,565
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.

48
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,276
Oh, why can't we?

49
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,445
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff
won't get you anywhere.

50
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,199
You tried it on Helen
and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.

51
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,411
You can't go through life
thinking the way you do.

52
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,331
People take advantage of you
and make a fool of you
the way she did.

53
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,006
- It's beginning to look
as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

54
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,218
I was right about Helen,
and now I'm right about
this 3:00 business too.

55
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,889
This is another thing entirely, Monte.

56
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,310
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you
in another way, that's all.

57
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,396
It's chaps like you
that are meat for them.

58
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:58,108
All they gotta do
is make it sound heroic,
and you fall for it.

59
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:03,197
Listen, Roy,
what's the difference if we don't go?

60
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:09,786
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?

61
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,707
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.

62
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,377
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?

63
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,674
Well...

64
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,936
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chčri.

65
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,232
Oh, baby.

66
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,819
{y:i}N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.

67
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,072
Oh, baby.

68
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,746
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.

69
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,922
Yes, I am and so are you.

70
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:07,177
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk
and we've been talking wildly.

71
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,763
There's no way out of this
and we know it. Come on, Monte.

72
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:14,476
No, no. Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.

73
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,020
Monte.

74
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,440
Why, they'd court-martial us
in a minute if we didn't show up.

75
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,694
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.

76
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,114
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Come on.

77
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,701
Come on.
I suppose you're right.

78
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,122
Oh, no, no, no, no. Monte.
What a pair of fools
we are.

79
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,555
Let's go.

80
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,689
Easy, now.
Easy.

81
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,904
Look out for the firing pin.

82
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,243
Righto. I got it.

83
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,422
{y:i}Contactor.
Contact.

84
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,430
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.

85
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:38,185
Then pull the release
when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?

86
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:43,232
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

87
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,909
{y:i}Contactor.
Contact.

88
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:04,962
Remember this ship weighs
20,000 pounds. Good luck.
Thank you.

89
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,266
Roy, the depot.

90
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,207
Roy, look there!

91
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,998
They've seen us.
They're coming on.

92
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,720
For Christ's sake.

93
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.

94
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,752
I got him!

95
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:40,449
Roy! Look over there.
It's our squadrons. They're coming!

96
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:41,004
Roy, they've gone.

97
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,939
Jesus.

98
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:32,264
Son of a Boche.

99
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,114
Hey!

100
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:53,535
It's me! Hey! It's me!
Goddamn it!

101
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,872
It's old Baldy. Hey! Baldy.

102
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,542
Hello. It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.

103
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,127
It's Baldy.

104
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:09,718
You see that guy?

105
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,678
Good old Baldy.

106
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,881
Good boy. See that? He's got him.

107
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,933
Hey, look. He's got him.
He's got him.

108
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,701
Oh. Look. They've changed around.

109
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,501
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.

110
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:21,683
Roy, he got us! Roy!
Go down! Go down! Go down!

111
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,777
One more for Baldy!

112
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,453
No more control?

113
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,625
Pull her up!

114
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:24,097
Oh, my God! We're on fire!
We're burning!

115
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,561
Roy, get down!

116
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,922
Do something! Roy!

117
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,640
Ah, so. We meet again.

118
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,898
{y:i}It was you who bombed
the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?

119
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,900
Yes.

120
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:25,070
{y:i}And you were flying
a German plane, nicht wahr?

121
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,991
- Yes.
- Very clever.

122
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,744
It is a pity you must
take your congratulations from me.

123
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,583
There are a few questions
I must ask you.

124
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,252
If you answer them simply,
it will be easy for you.

125
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:45,924
To what squadron of
the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?

126
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:54,892
Just why were you sent to bomb
that munition depot this morning?

127
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,477
It was our natural target.

128
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:03,066
But possibly it was to clear the way
for a little surprise attack, huh?

129
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,990
You are surprised.

130
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:14,369
We know all about it,
so you need not be afraid to talk.

131
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:19,374
Now, please, when and where
is the attack to be made?

132
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:28,884
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.

133
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,930
{y:i}For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.

134
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,932
Hmm.

135
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,895
Listen, if you tell me,

136
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:45,025
I will see that you are sent to
a special camp reserved only
for certain prisoners of war.

137
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:48,737
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.

138
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,615
You will have every comfort.

139
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:57,120
{y:i}And in a few months from now
when the war is over,
you will be alive and in good health,

140
00:33:57,204 --> 00:34:01,542
which is more than most of us
will be able to say.

141
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:05,462
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.

142
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,173
Now, please.

143
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:18,183
So, you will not tell?

144
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:23,438
Possibly you do not know
that flying a German plane...

145
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,858
is the same as wearing
a German uniform.

146
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:30,612
{y:i}Any disguised soldier is a spy,
nicht wahr?

147
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:34,741
{y:i}And you know
what happens to spies?

148
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,662
I think you two friends
had better talk it over.

149
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,332
I will give you 15 minutes.

150
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:46,712
If you change your mind
and tell, good.

151
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,048
If not, you will be shot.

152
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:33,175
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.

153
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,645
He's the man
I was to fight that duel with.

154
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,481
Really? Quite a coincidence.

155
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,860
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it
by this time.

156
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,576
The brigade will be
going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.

157
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:20,722
Roy, look.

158
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:25,435
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.

159
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,454
God, what nerve.

160
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,750
Roy.

161
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,795
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.

162
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:55,132
Don't be a fool, Monte. Do you realize
what it would mean if we told?

163
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,218
It would mean being alive
when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.

164
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:00,637
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.

165
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,849
I'm not gonna be shot down
like that. I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute. Monte.

166
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,351
But I...
Listen.

167
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,857
Let me go.
You?

168
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,860
Yes. You're all upset.

169
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:18,947
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps
I won't have to tell him everything.

170
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,491
I- I'll come with you.
No.

171
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:25,913
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.

172
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,123
All right.

173
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,760
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.

174
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,803
Good. Come.

175
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,791
Ah, yes.

176
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,643
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.

177
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:35,357
My friend will never tell,
but I wanna live. I'm ready to talk.

178
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,609
You are very wise.

179
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:43,115
Now, please, draw a rough map for me
showing your positions,

180
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:46,159
brigade numbers, disposition,
hour of attack, purpose, number of men.

181
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:50,914
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.

182
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:54,001
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.

183
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,379
If I give this information,
my friend will know it.

184
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:02,301
Back home after the war,
he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.

185
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,761
You leave that to me.

186
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,056
Why not let me
have that satisfaction?

187
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:11,435
What do you mean?

188
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:23,113
I do not understand.

189
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,033
One does not kill a friend.

190
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,578
Friend. He's not my friend.

191
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,164
He stole the girl I love
and I hate him.

192
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:36,210
Huh. History repeats itself.

193
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,757
You make rather hard terms.

194
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,801
I'll tell
only on that condition.

195
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,986
One bullet.

196
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,698
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.

197
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,538
No. A good soldier
will need only one.

198
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:16,250
Very well.
Not so fast.

199
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:28,846
He will give you the bullet outside.

200
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:04,506
Well?

201
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:09,595
I didn't tell, Monte.

202
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,432
Why? What happened?
Has he changed his mind?

203
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:17,144
No. Don't you think
you can go through with it now?

204
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,897
What do you mean?

205
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,608
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.

206
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:27,029
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.

207
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,366
No, no, Roy. L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.

208
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:35,412
Listen, Monte. We tell,
the whole brigade will be wiped out.

209
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:39,333
Three thousand men,
and they all want to live too.

210
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,252
You wouldn't spoil
their chances, would you?
That's not my business.

211
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,963
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.

212
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:48,008
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out
sooner or later anyway.

213
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,969
I wanna live. Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.

214
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,263
{y:i}Listen, Monte!
I'll tell! I'll tell!

215
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,349
{y:i}Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.

216
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:57,768
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...

217
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,860
Oh. Roy.

218
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:11,698
Oh, Monte. Monte.

219
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,700
Monte.

220
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,455
Monte.

221
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,467
Don't cry, Roy.

222
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,391
It was the only thing
you could do.

223
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:51,405
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?

224
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,535
They'll be all right now,
won't they?
Yes.

225
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:05,335
Who's that?
It's the general.

226
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:13,177
You... You thought we'd tell,
didn't you?

227
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,430
Good old Roy.

228
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,432
You won't tell, and I...

229
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,604
forgotten... it all.

230
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:27,524
Oh, Roy. Roy.

231
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:30,068
Yes?

232
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:33,822
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.

233
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,867
I'm here, Monte.

234
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,786
Can't you feel me holding you?

235
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,964
Hello, Karl. Fig eights.

236
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,139
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.

237
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,811
Oh. I'm afraid.

238
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,068
Look out. Look out!

239
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:15,822
We're falling! We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!

240
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:18,534
Quick! Quick! Quick!

241
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:22,454
It's all right, Monte. Monte?

242
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:25,207
It's all right.

243
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:28,752
Monte? Monte.

244
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,838
Oh.

245
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,853
Well?

246
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:00,075
You heard what my brother said.

247
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,954
Your brother?

248
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,457
I'll never tell you anything.

249
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:55,214
{y:i}Achtung!

250
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:28,789
{y:i}I'll be with you
in just a minute, Monte.

251
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,003
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
