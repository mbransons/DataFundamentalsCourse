1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,601
- Freddie!
- I dropped something.

2
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,161
Ralph, talk to him.

3
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,571
Listen to your father.

4
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,668
- From there we can see Cape Cod.
- We were just there!

5
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,542
We could have stayed and saved $ 12.00.

6
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:59,244
Allen, don't you want to see Cape Cod?

7
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,777
You know where we are
if you change your mind.

8
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,565
Allen!

9
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,639
Oh, my God.!

10
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:58,343
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

11
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,869
You okay, Allen? Lend me a towel.

12
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,313
Why did you do that?

13
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:19,493
Come on, son.

14
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,343
Augie, pick up line four, please.

15
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,420
- Where are my cherries?
- Mr. McCulloch,

16
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:55,364
they came in, but there was a fog...

17
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,232
If I don't get my cherries in 5 minutes,

18
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:01,329
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.

19
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:03,898
Jerry?

20
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:08,437
- Where are McCulloch's cherries?
- They're here,

21
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,674
but you gotta take a look.

22
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,683
Ah, Mr. McCulloch, be right back.

23
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:16,242
Where are my cherries?

24
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,990
Augie, did you grow these under your arms?

25
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,527
Jesus, snails with stems.
Get them outta here!

26
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,859
- George, get them out of here.
- You got it.

27
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,560
Bauer. Thank you. Honey, what's up?

28
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,230
We get a lot of rain and cherries get slime.

29
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:37,069
- I can't hear ya.
- You agreed to take these off our hands.

30
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:40,838
- When the hell did I agree to that?
- Not you, your brother.

31
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,846
Ah, all right.

32
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,848
Victoria, I can't hear you.

33
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,282
What I'm doing is important too.

34
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:49,286
My brother bought your slimy cherries?

35
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,584
Yeah. We were playing poker.

36
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,647
He had two pair. I had a flush.

37
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:56,853
He had no cash, so we worked this out.

38
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:08,104
Who put this goddamn fruit here?

39
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,470
I'm all right, if anyone's concerned.

40
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,065
Good morning, Freddie.

41
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,771
Allen! Allen!

42
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,871
A simple "yes" or "no."

43
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:19,609
I made it. I'm in Penthouse magazine.

44
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,914
They printed my letter!

45
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:24,351
Listen, I'm very happy.

46
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,356
I'm in the Forum section.

47
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:28,790
The story's entitled, "A Lesbian No More."

48
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,225
They printed every word.
It's a beautiful story.

49
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:33,627
I want copies for everybody.

50
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,756
Augie, good to see you!

51
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,766
Great game. We gotta do that more.

52
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,928
- Can we talk?
- Great poker player.

53
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:43,097
- Cheats like a son of a bitch!
- We have to talk.

54
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:46,939
- Missing petty cash? It was the cleaning girl.
- I don't care.

55
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,137
You don't? I admit the whole thing.

56
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,374
I still don't care about it.

57
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,144
I love this guy! Do you hear me?

58
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,152
- Gimme a kiss.
- Oh, Freddie.

59
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,278
Too big to kiss your older brother?

60
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,784
I love this guy's head.

61
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,421
Here's a buck. Wash my car.

62
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:10,557
Bauer! Where are my...

63
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,568
Your cherries, yes.

64
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:16,003
Believe me, you won't be
satisfied with what we have.

65
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:19,303
You're ruined! Everyone's gonna know
you left me dry.

66
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,435
You're finished, a ghost.

67
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:24,412
- How'd you like bananas at cost?
- Deal!

68
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:27,245
Set up our friend with bananas at cost.

69
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:30,377
Allen, wait. I've got to get out early.

70
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:33,252
Gee, right. Today's the big day.

71
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:35,621
Ushers have to be early too.

72
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,626
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

73
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:43,422
Will someone
get thoseJonathans off the truck?

74
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,600
Any messages, Mrs. Stimler?

75
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,104
Yes.

76
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,709
What are they?

77
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:58,805
Huh? Oh,

78
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:02,146
your father wants you to call him back.

79
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:06,621
Mrs. Stimler, our father
passed away five years ago.

80
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,784
- Remember?
- Right.

81
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,988
Should I get him for you?

82
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:17,124
No, no. We'll... I'll take care of it.

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,793
You just get back to work.

84
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:30,141
- What's with her?
- A little accident over the weekend.

85
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:33,011
Got hit in the head by some lightning.

86
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,917
It's not funny, Freddie!

87
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:39,888
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

88
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,015
Besides, she can still do certain things.

89
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,527
Like jump-start a car?

90
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,586
Jump-start a car.!

91
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

92
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:54,592
- What the hell are you doing down here?
- Maybe I went...

93
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,901
- to the "Club A" last night.
- Something new for you.

94
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,771
Maybe I met Mr. Buyrite,
owner of Buyrite Markets.

95
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:03,471
Maybe we had a few drinks.

96
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:06,879
And maybe, just maybe...

97
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,974
we're his new produce suppliers.

98
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,714
I'm proud of you.
That's great.! Which store?

99
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:16,451
Not which store, the whole chain.

100
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,789
I hope you are joking with me.

101
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,295
Think big, be big.

102
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,593
He was a colonel. I made up a story...

103
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,133
about you being wounded in Nam
and he wants to do business.

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,226
He's coming this morning.

105
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,795
Great, Freddie. It's only chaos down here.

106
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:34,809
- Augie brings me slimy cherries.
- So what?

107
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:38,505
- Jerry's getting married tomorrow.
- So what?

108
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,776
I was drinking with this bum all night.

109
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:44,011
- I'm busting my buns.
- East 77 th Street.

110
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,715
- Come on, you can handle this deal.
- Yeah, I'll handle it.

111
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,521
- Your desk looks like a pigsty.
- I have a system.

112
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,857
Phone for you.

113
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:57,831
Yes? All right. Thank you.

114
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,992
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.

115
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,002
I forgot to call you back.

116
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,699
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.

117
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,263
What? Now?

118
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:10,709
You're moving out of the apartment now?

119
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,645
While we're talking?

120
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:17,207
Yeah, I know we were going to talk about it.

121
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:21,017
Victoria, this is a little impulsive.

122
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,024
If we were married you
wouldn't move out like this.

123
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:26,458
- She might. Sure.
- Get off!

124
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,722
- Was that you?
- Get off the phone!

125
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,321
- I'm so sorry!
- Not you.

126
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,027
Why not tell a guy you're on the phone?

127
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:39,038
What do you mean, "Do I love you?"

128
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,339
Well, I...

129
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,346
Well, we met and...

130
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,980
You moved in, didn't you?

131
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:56,855
Well, it's... it's just a very
complicated thing.

132
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,688
Hey, do you love me?

133
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,820
Well, there you go.

134
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,534
There she went.

135
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,906
What a huge wedding.

136
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,675
Cindy, hi.

137
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:26,046
- How are you?
- How are you?

138
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,213
Excuse me.

139
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,518
You look so pretty.!

140
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:37,054
Darn! My flash never works!

141
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,998
Figures. My mother-in-law gave it to me.

142
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,064
- Get up.!
- What? What?

143
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,607
It was embarrassing when you were 10.

144
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,304
If something works for me,
I stick with it!

145
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,970
I've been thinking.

146
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,742
I intend to get more involved with business.

147
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,149
I mean that this time. I know the business.

148
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,188
I was there at the beginning with Dad.

149
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,385
Do we sell fruit and
vegetables or just fruit?

150
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,396
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.

151
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,796
- Victoria left, huh?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,562
You know why she left me?

153
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,934
- Because I didn't love her.
- That bitch.

154
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,203
Hi. Anywhere but the first three rows.

155
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,505
- Anywhere but the first three rows.
- Hey!

156
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,413
Hi, Freddie. Allen, where's Victoria?

157
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,815
She's sick, and she can't make it.

158
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,616
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

159
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,890
Can you answer me
why I didn't love her, Freddie?

160
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,895
She had everything.

161
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,625
She was bright, sensitive, beautiful.

162
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,997
- Hey, Allen.!
- Hi.

163
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:53,233
- Where's Victoria?
- She can't make it because of the flu.

164
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,830
- Give her my love.
- You bet! Sure.

165
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,504
I can't even give her my love!

166
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,139
Something in here is not working.

167
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,776
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!

168
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,116
Hi, guys. Bauer, where's your pretty lady?

169
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,123
She's not coming! Okay?

170
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,590
Do you want your money back?

171
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,056
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

172
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,329
- Hey, Allen.
- She left me! My life's a shambles.

173
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,426
That's the news. Want the weather?

174
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,994
Anywhere but the first three rows!

175
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:32,299
Lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.

176
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,141
Drinking is a matter
of algebraic ratios.

177
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,011
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume...

178
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,214
in relation to your total body weight.

179
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,383
It's not that you had too much to drink,

180
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,018
it's that you're too skinny!

181
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,255
- Marceau, more drinks here.
- No.

182
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,198
- Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.
- But you are.

183
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,758
A sober person would have
reached for the pretzels.

184
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,567
- Is he going to be there long?
- I don't know.

185
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,336
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
- You're on the bar.

186
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,435
Come on, off the bar.

187
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,344
This stool is in your way. Let me move it.

188
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:11,406
Oh, oh, you fell.

189
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,311
That hurt. You're not having a good day.

190
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,323
- Wasn't that a beautiful wedding?
- That was.

191
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,849
It was. It really was.

192
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,021
- The most gorgeous ceremony...
- A lovely...

193
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,500
- How ya doing?
- Fine.

194
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,593
The fabulous Freddie Bauer here.

195
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,004
- Where did you get those?
- My grandmother.

196
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,770
- She left them to me.
- She did?

197
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,312
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,074
Hi.

199
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:45,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,717
You guys are in love, aren't you?

201
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,844
We just met.

202
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,255
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.

203
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,485
I can see. I can tell.

204
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,721
You two guys, you're in love.

205
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,161
I think that's beautiful.

206
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,825
Thanks.

207
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,168
I don't live too far.

208
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,675
Let's go to my place for a quiet drink.

209
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:15,577
Do I expect too much out of life?

210
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,639
My dress! I can't believe this.

211
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,685
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what are you doing?

212
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,654
Both of you. You're both crazy!

213
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,656
I'm sorry. Look...

214
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,988
I don't ask that much, do I?

215
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,153
I don't ask to be famous, rich,

216
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:35,131
or play center field for the Yankees.

217
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,963
I just want to meet a woman...

218
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,596
and fall in love, and get married.

219
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,765
And I want to have a kid,

220
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,569
and I want to see him play
a tooth in the school play.

221
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,611
It's not much.

222
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,806
But I'm kidding myself.

223
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,248
It's never going to happen.

224
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,752
I'm going to grow old...

225
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,085
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die;

226
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:03,149
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.

227
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,196
- Freddie?
- No kidding!

228
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:08,891
Freddie?

229
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,194
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

230
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,795
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

231
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:17,807
- I'm Tawny.
- You're Tawny Tiger!

232
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,468
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.

233
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,479
- My brother, Allen.
- Hi.

234
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,481
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
- Absolutely.

235
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,483
Excuse me.

236
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,884
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.

237
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,353
I've got some whispering for you!

238
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,357
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

239
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:37,325
Pack your bags. We're going to Rio!

240
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,692
They have a timesharing condominium.

241
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:42,698
We're gonna share some time with them.

242
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,825
No, I'm going to Cape Cod.

243
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:46,927
What are you talking about?

244
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,938
Why would you go to Cape Cod?

245
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,600
Because I like Cape Cod.

246
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,609
I feel better up there.

247
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:56,441
I look at the water
and feel closer to something.

248
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,778
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

249
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,286
- Let me drive you up there.
- No, no.

250
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:05,287
- You got enough money?
- I've got plenty.

251
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,755
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

252
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,758
Can I have some then?

253
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,564
- Where to?
- Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

254
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:27,374
You break that, you pay for it.

255
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:30,379
Well, I'm sorry. I usually enjoy...

256
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,641
smashing the glass with my face.

257
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,709
That's about 300 miles.
You got the cash?

258
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,448
What is this?

259
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:02,501
Careful with that.

260
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,513
Be careful with that!

261
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:07,071
What do you think you're loading?

262
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,517
This is delicate scientific equipment.

263
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:15,648
Hold it. Put it down. You see that?
It says, "This end up."

264
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,124
Know what that means? This end up!

265
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:21,493
Why don't you try holding that end up?

266
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,432
All right, get away!

267
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,266
I'll do it myself. Get away. Give me a hand.

268
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:35,140
Easy.

269
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,146
- Move that...
- Excuse me.

270
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:42,181
- Morning.
- Morning.

271
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,185
Ah,

272
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,983
I was dropped off on
the wrong side of the beach.

273
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,547
Could you take me over to the island?

274
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,318
Well, ah, we're not...

275
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:55,329
We're not going...

276
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:58,560
We're taking the boat.
We're not going out there!

277
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:02,126
Have you seen anyone else
along this beach?

278
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,002
No, just me and the moron twins.

279
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:07,702
We're not twins.

280
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:13,414
- What is all this stuff?
- I knew it!

281
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:16,645
Who sent you up here?
Dr. Ross from Chicago?

282
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,846
Who's Dr. Ross from Chicago?

283
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,151
Who's Dr. Ross? You're very good.

284
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:24,624
I suppose you're some
harmless beachcomber...

285
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,490
who happens to wear a tuxedo!

286
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:30,225
How dare you try and horn in
on someone else's research!

287
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,232
I'm just a guy...

288
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,666
Walter Kornbluth is not
to be taken advantage of.

289
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:38,900
Just stay out of my way, sonny.

290
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,677
All right, let's move out!

291
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:52,680
A guy down the beach
runs people out to the island.

292
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,915
What's the name?

293
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:56,923
The guy or the island?

294
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,357
I'll find him.

295
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:06,629
What's the matter? You look nervous.

296
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:09,465
Yeah. The truth is, FatJack,

297
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,199
I don't know how to swim.

298
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:14,264
- You can't swim?
- No, sir.

299
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:17,402
Then you wouldn't want me to do this.

300
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:20,276
Stop! Ah, don't!

301
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:23,806
Please, cut it out!
There's water coming in the boat!

302
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:26,115
I'm just having a little fun.

303
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,816
Well, don't.

304
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,724
What is that? What's the matter?

305
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:36,286
When I rocked the boat,
I must have got water in the engine.

306
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:39,162
I can fix it. I'm mechanical.

307
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,741
Did you fix it?

308
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,868
No. I'll go back for the other boat.

309
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:52,878
What?

310
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,649
Where are you going, Mr. FatJack?

311
00:20:57,718 --> 00:21:00,688
Back to the dock. It's only a few miles.

312
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:04,019
I can swim it.
I'll be back with the little boat.

313
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:07,459
The little boat?

314
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,568
I knew it. I knew that guy was spying on me.

315
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:26,044
I want to go down!

316
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:30,843
Mr. Cornbeef?

317
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,215
Kornbluth!

318
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,620
Whatcha looking for down there?

319
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,919
Buried treasure?

320
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:40,016
Want to know what I'm looking for?

321
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:42,027
I'll tell ya.

322
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,056
None of your goddamn business, that's what!

323
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,328
Get out of my way!

324
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,632
Let's pee down his air hose.

325
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,904
You get that.

326
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:19,163
Piece of shit.

327
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:33,836
Ahh!

328
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,423
Ah, gee.

329
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:20,590
Ohhh!

330
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:25,589
Ohh.

331
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:34,806
Ouch!

332
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:37,399
Ouch.

333
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,329
Hello.

334
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,300
You have any idea how I got here?

335
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,131
Did you save me?

336
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:12,602
Ah,

337
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,975
do you speak English?

338
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,545
Hey! Come back!

339
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,918
Hey, come back! Please?

340
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,423
Just tell me who you are.

341
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:04,155
I've gotta talk to you.
Can I call you? What's your number?

342
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,789
I don't know how to swim.

343
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:10,198
I don't know how to swim! Come back.

344
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:12,930
Why didn't I learn how to swim?

345
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:15,370
Please, just...

346
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,963
It's a mermaid. It's her!

347
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,471
Wait a minute.

348
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,565
Wait a minute.! Don't go.

349
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,636
Come back.

350
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,078
I gotta take your picture.

351
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:33,674
Hold it.

352
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,920
Hi, Mrs. Stimler.

353
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,048
Hi. What happened to your head?

354
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:25,821
- Lightning?
- No, a boat hit me.

355
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:30,096
- Mrs. Stimler?
- Yes?

356
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:33,863
- Nothing.
- So nice to have you back.

357
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,235
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

358
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:40,673
The statue is a gift from French citizens...

359
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:44,577
and symbolizes hope for oppressed people.

360
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:48,343
Over the past century,
she has seen the skyline,

361
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:52,910
which once she dwarfed,
rise in mountains of stone and steel.

362
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:56,947
If you'll go inside, the tour will continue.

363
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,323
Come on. Here we go.

364
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:01,920
Let's go. We're backing up.

365
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,624
You've got feet, use them.!

366
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:09,602
Don't touch my hat.
Do not ever touch my hat. That's it.

367
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:12,606
Up-up-up-up-up-up. Okay.

368
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:14,802
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

369
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:17,936
The statue is a gift from French citizens.

370
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:21,345
It has come to symbolize hope
for naked women everywhere.

371
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,350
Bocci balls!

372
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,751
Hey, hey.

373
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:28,118
Come on. Don't be doing that.

374
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:31,421
Take a picture of me, Vinnie.

375
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:33,825
Vinnie, take my picture.

376
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:37,491
You get it? You get it!

377
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:41,695
The statue was a gift from French people.

378
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,034
Get out of the way. What's going on?

379
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:49,634
Okay, miss. This ain't California.
We don't go for this.

380
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:10,322
- What's your name?
- She don't speak no English.

381
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,492
- And you do?
- Here. She was carrying this.

382
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,502
What's this?

383
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:19,969
Who's this guy?

384
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:24,410
Is that enough? Do you want some more?

385
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:27,380
That's all we can handle. Let's talk terms.

386
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:29,711
- He doesn't have a clue.
- Don't worry.

387
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:31,718
We'll move it out in the morning.

388
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:34,254
Bauer. Your brother told me about...

389
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,255
your unfortunate experience in Vietnam.

390
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:39,655
Huh?

391
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:42,786
The incident in Vietnam. Remember?

392
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:48,224
The grenade still bother you?
You're wearing a bandage.

393
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,567
Page him. Hey, Al?

394
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,571
- Yeah?
- Phone.

395
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,607
Um, excuse me.

396
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,775
Thanks, Jerry. Yeah?

397
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:01,441
Allen Bauer. Speaking.

398
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:09,455
Yeah. On my way!

399
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:11,457
I believe this...

400
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,420
Allen, where are you going?

401
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,019
Allen!

402
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,866
- What happened?
- Telephone.

403
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:25,063
He was on the phone in Nam
when the grenade went off.

404
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:28,130
Ever since then, he runs,

405
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,403
gets in a car, and drives away.

406
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:33,071
- Oh.
- I don't know why.

407
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,137
- It just happens.
- Oh.

408
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,148
Let's review this.

409
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:00,672
Pardon me. Excuse me!

410
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,471
Mr. Police Officer?

411
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:06,010
Hey! Take it easy.

412
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:08,047
What do you want?

413
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:10,549
My name's Allen Bauer. You guys called me.

414
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:13,882
Any of you guys call for an Allen Bauer?

415
00:32:13,954 --> 00:32:17,650
Bauer. Yeah. That's for her.

416
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:19,658
Right over there.

417
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,549
Hi.

418
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:53,517
I take it you know this girl?

419
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,661
Yeah, I do.

420
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:58,663
Who is she?

421
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,634
I don't know.

422
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:05,000
Of course.

423
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:20,447
Afternoon. You're home early.

424
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,612
Yeah.

425
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,527
Uh,

426
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,894
that doorway spins.

427
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:35,797
Want to get this fixed, Timmy?

428
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:44,165
- Hi.
- Hello.

429
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,889
#Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a- dee-ay #

430
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,259
#Mr. Bluebird's on my shoulder #

431
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,891
#It's the truth, it's actual
Everything is satisfactual #

432
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:45,959
#Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a- dee-ay #

433
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:48,096
# My, oh, my
What a wonderful day #

434
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:51,074
Room service.
I didn't know what you liked,

435
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:54,942
so I got you a choice.
Fruity Pebbles, pancakes...

436
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,174
No. No.
No-no-no- no-no-no-no.

437
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:00,978
I've got to get back to work.
That will keep you company.

438
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:05,216
When I come back from work,
we'll get some dinner,

439
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,689
and pick you up some clothes.

440
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:10,489
Not that you don't look
spectacular in my robe.

441
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:13,462
Okay? Bye-bye.

442
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:18,601
No. Please.

443
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:20,865
You're gonna put me in the hospital.

444
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:23,839
It's about 3:00. I really have to get back.

445
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:26,069
You are wonderful.

446
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:28,635
Bye-bye. Bye.

447
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:37,418
Things don't get started again until 4:00.

448
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:45,688
Let's not be so choosy with these onions.

449
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:48,822
Some of these are perfectly good onions.

450
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,596
Everybody, zip-a-dee-doo-dah.!

451
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:55,229
#Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a- dee-ay #

452
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:58,900
# My, oh, my
What a wonderful day #

453
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:01,911
#Plenty of sunshine
heading my way #

454
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:04,880
#Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a- dee-ay #

455
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:08,544
# Mr. Mango on my shoulder #

456
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,248
- Freddie, dance with me!
- Please, not in front of the teamsters.

457
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:15,382
- Come on, they're happy guys.
- You're a rotten lead.

458
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:17,723
I've got the Buyrite contracts ready.

459
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,819
- Want to check them?
- No.

460
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:21,831
You check them. You know the business.

461
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:23,833
- So I'm in charge?
- Sure.

462
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:25,765
What about the lawyer's meeting at 8:00?

463
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:29,237
8 p. m.? That's too late for me.

464
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:32,742
I'm going upstairs and take a nap.

465
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:35,107
Wake me when it's time to go home.

466
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:38,615
#Zip-a-dee... ##
Jerry, handle those for me!

467
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:43,011
Anne Klein.

468
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:45,714
Bloomingdale's.

469
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:51,160
Anne Klein.

470
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:53,458
Bloomingdale's.

471
00:36:57,234 --> 00:37:00,293
The Anne Klein Collection, available at...

472
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,804
Bloomingdale's.

473
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,317
Can I help you?

474
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,382
Can't you talk?

475
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:25,085
- Bloomingdale's?
- Sure. Hey!

476
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,008
Oh, my God.

477
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:27,954
Darling. Darling.

478
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:32,016
Darling! That outfit, it's to die from.

479
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:34,892
What happened?
You saw Annie Hall 100 times?

480
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,591
That look is over.

481
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,658
You want to try that on?

482
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,134
Who knows? Maybe it's you.

483
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,364
I couldn't get one leg in there.

Hello?

506
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,690
I'm home.!

507
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:30,869
- I'm looking for a girl, Timmy.
- 200 bucks.

508
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,505
No, the blonde I came in with.

509
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,378
- Oh, she left.
- Any idea where?

510
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,352
- I put her in a cab.
- To where, Timmy?

00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:42,253
- Bloomingdale's.
- Bloomingdale's. Great. Thanks.

Yo! Hey, taxi! Hey!

513
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:47,660
Halt, taxi, please!

514
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:50,094
# She works hard
for the money #

515
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:53,531
Come on, come on. Let's go!

516
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,503
# She works hard for the money
so you better treat her right #

517
00:40:57,572 --> 00:41:00,938
Excuse me, miss,
we're getting ready to close.

518
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:03,943
She's been here for six hours.

519
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,946
Excuse me, miss.

520
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,540
I'm going to insist that...

521
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:14,178
that you stop doing that.

522
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:19,989
She's exercising.

523
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,629
Give her... a minute.

524
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:26,756
Sir, we're closing.

525
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,359
I know.
Just give me three minutes.

526
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,733
- Come back.
- Three minutes. You can time me!

527
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,971
Oh, thank God.

528
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,170
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?

529
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,010
Yeah. Just don't ask me her name.

530
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,447
We've been trying to tell her
it's closing time,

531
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,816
but she doesn't seem to understand.

532
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,753
That's because she doesn't speak English.

533
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:53,759
Hello, Allen. How was your day?

534
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:56,885
I never went to college,

535
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,262
but wasn't that English?

536
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,266
Thank you for letting me use your television.

537
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:04,395
It was very educational.

538
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:07,772
It's all right, miss.

539
00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:12,611
What's your name?

540
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:15,477
It's hard to say in English.

541
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,608
Well, just say it in your language.

542
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:21,152
All right. My name is...

543
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,798
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks?

544
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:43,001
I'm confused why you haven't
said anything until now.

545
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:46,340
- I didn't know English.
- I see. Now you do?

546
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:49,040
I learned from television. It's wonderful!

547
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:51,811
I'll ask questions
and if you answer correctly,

548
00:42:51,884 --> 00:42:54,284
you can win one of these prizes.

549
00:42:54,353 --> 00:42:57,048
A wall clock, matching washer and dryer,

550
00:42:57,122 --> 00:42:59,182
or a brand-new car!

551
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:01,283
Let me go first, okay?

552
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,293
Who are you? Where are you from?

553
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,296
Begin when you were born...

554
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:07,764
and finish when you blew up the TV's.

555
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:17,634
Pretty.

556
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,942
Well, yeah. I've never
thought about it before.

557
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,940
Are you from Cape Cod?

558
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:30,149
No, I'm from another place.

559
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:34,886
Yeah? I've got a cousin from there.
Ha-ha- ha.

560
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,396
Are you an American?

561
00:43:39,464 --> 00:43:41,456
No.

562
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:45,333
Then why were you in
Cape Cod and now New York?

563
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:49,339
- How did the cops find you naked?
- What's that?

564
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,432
What? The music?

565
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,137
I like music! I heard some in the television,

566
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:56,373
Dance Fever.

567
00:43:56,448 --> 00:44:00,179
# Hey, I love you, girl #

568
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:03,652
- # Darling #
- Ah, hi, hi.

569
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:06,282
We better go, hon, or else we'll be late.

570
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:09,486
- You never heard music?
- What's that?

571
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:12,257
Ah...

572
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,264
Oh, gosh!

573
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:16,266
- What's that?
- It's a movie theater.

574
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,666
What the hell you doin'?
You coulda got me killed!

575
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:21,171
Cut her some slack.
She's from out of town.

576
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,367
- Keep her on a leash.
- Yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.

577
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:26,376
Hello?

578
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:31,315
Did you see this?

579
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:35,547
It's wonderfully delicious
and so good for you.

580
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,111
While you're here, watch a little less TV.

581
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:44,722
How long are you going to be in town?

582
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,459
Six fun-filled days.

583
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,500
Oh, six days.

584
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:52,502
Is that all?

585
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,368
Six days,

586
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,035
and the moon is full.

587
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,475
Oh.

588
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,514
The moon is full.

589
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:14,719
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.

590
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:16,727
Oh, I get... What?

591
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:20,059
Is there some sort of immigration problem?

592
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,065
Where did you get that?

593
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,657
Where? Oh, for...

594
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:30,566
Sir? Here you are, sir. There you go.

595
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:34,169
I'm going to have to call
you something in English,

596
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:37,179
because I can't pronounce... What?

597
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:39,272
What are English names?

598
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,647
There's millions of them, I guess.

599
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,744
Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary.

600
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,120
Careful. Those are hot.

601
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:48,624
Names, names. Linda, Kim...

602
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:50,717
Where are we? Madison.

603
00:45:50,794 --> 00:45:53,524
- Elizabeth, Samantha...
- I like Madison.

604
00:45:53,597 --> 00:45:55,997
Madison's not a name.

605
00:45:57,501 --> 00:46:00,595
Well, all right. Madison it is.

606
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:03,469
Good thing we weren't
at 149th Street.

607
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,304
Are we going back to where you live?

608
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:09,310
Okay, um... Here's the thing.

609
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:12,075
I was going to find you a hotel,

610
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:16,449
but I figure that after this afternoon...

611
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,251
Well, I just assumed that...

612
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,619
Would you mind staying with me?

613
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,162
I want to stay with you.

614
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:32,167
You're the reason I came here.

615
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:44,273
Ah, that was a kiss.

616
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:46,282
I know.

617
00:48:57,779 --> 00:48:59,713
Madison?

618
00:49:08,523 --> 00:49:11,287
- Madison?
- Allen?

619
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,089
Yeah, of course, it's Allen.

620
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:16,096
What are you doing, sweetheart?

621
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,496
Taking a bath.

622
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:21,763
Ooo, ooo. Can I come in?

623
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,467
No!

624
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,700
What was that?

625
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:29,710
Madison, are you all right?

626
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:32,770
- Everything's fine.
- Then let me in.

627
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:35,645
I'll be right there. I'm just changing.

628
00:49:35,717 --> 00:49:38,550
Enough! Open the door.
Something is wrong.

629
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,918
Allen, can you make me some pancakes?

630
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,014
Make you some... Madison.!

631
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:45,650
All right, Madison, this is getting scary.

632
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:47,820
Either open this door,
or I'll break it down!

633
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:50,728
- No, Allen, please.
- All right, that's it.!

634
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:53,996
- Allen, no!
- Ow.

635
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:06,546
Hi.

636
00:50:06,614 --> 00:50:10,310
Hi. Are you okay?

637
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:12,319
Yeah.

638
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:15,514
Why wouldn't you let me in?

639
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:19,525
I was... shy.

640
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,495
You were shy?

641
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:25,555
After the car, elevator, bedroom,

642
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:29,501
and top of the refrigerator,
you were shy?

643
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,563
I was shy.

644
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,574
She was shy.

645
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:08,134
Hey, B.B. Brain!

646
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:12,406
- Yeah?
- See this hose?

647
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:15,936
- It's so I can breathe.
- Uh-huh.

648
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,780
You want to get your chair off it?

649
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:21,251
Huh?

650
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,891
The Star Confidential?

651
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:34,332
Yeah.

652
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,564
- Why are you reading that?
- I don't know.

653
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:42,132
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these?

654
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:46,042
- Interesting.
- You're not helping yourself.

655
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:49,240
You're not... This is not news.

656
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,250
Give me this. You know what's in here?

657
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,754
Nothing. You have sex, perversion.

658
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:58,586
It's all fabrication. Look at this.

659
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:01,684
A naked woman at the Statue of Liberty.

660
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,355
Where would they find a girl to do that?

661
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:13,367
- Ow, my head!
- Let me see that.

662
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:24,209
Take me back to shore. Now!

663
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,849
Hello.

664
00:52:34,593 --> 00:52:37,222
Madison, what is it?

665
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:39,321
What happened?

666
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:44,163
It's the saddest thing I ever saw.

667
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:48,799
It's Bonanza.

668
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,173
The man killed another man
and he died in the street.

669
00:52:52,244 --> 00:52:56,909
No, no. This is only TV.

670
00:52:56,983 --> 00:53:00,544
I thought you understood
about TV being make-believe.

671
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,986
It's pretend killing that's going on.

672
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,183
This guy is an actor.

673
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:08,489
Next week, he'll get shot
on another show.

674
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,494
It's kinda funny.

675
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:15,232
I'm supposed to laugh?

676
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,495
Yeah.

677
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,561
There you go.

678
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:22,038
Yeah.

679
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:24,269
I got you something.

680
00:53:39,457 --> 00:53:42,551
It's beautiful. I love it.

681
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,130
No, you open it.

682
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,190
There's more?

683
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,843
Do you like that?

684
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:10,243
Yeah, I do.

685
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:14,148
I don't know why. Just...

686
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:16,152
something about it.

687
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,348
It's always appealed to me.

688
00:55:20,357 --> 00:55:22,484
Do you like the sea?

689
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,528
No. When I was about eight,

690
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:28,030
I had this accident on a ship.

691
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:30,225
I remember.

692
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:32,201
What?

693
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,635
Ah, I can't.

694
00:55:34,705 --> 00:55:36,639
I forget the words.

695
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:39,835
What's... "I understand."

696
00:55:42,646 --> 00:55:44,841
Did you get hurt?

697
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:49,379
No, no, I didn't,

698
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:54,356
but when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I saw...

699
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:58,486
- What?
- Nothing.

700
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,496
- What?
- Nothing!

701
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:03,397
I was just a stupid kid.

702
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,227
- They're going to tear this park out.
- Why?

703
00:56:10,306 --> 00:56:14,073
They're gonna build condos
or some such nonsense.

704
00:56:14,144 --> 00:56:16,475
What are you gonna do, huh?

705
00:56:20,617 --> 00:56:22,846
You want to go home?

706
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,888
No, I have five days left!

707
00:56:24,955 --> 00:56:28,788
No-no-no. My home!

708
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:32,351
Oh. Yes.

709
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:45,233
Why do we want
to go to a political dinner?

710
00:56:45,308 --> 00:56:48,472
- The president will be speaking.
- President of what?

711
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:50,945
President of the
Three Stooges Fan Club.

712
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:53,448
- The president of the United States!
- Wow.

713
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:55,507
We'll be rubbing elbows
with the big boys.

714
00:56:55,585 --> 00:56:58,349
- You think big, you be big.
- I guess so.

715
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:00,355
Listen,

716
00:57:00,424 --> 00:57:03,620
would you mind if I took Madison...

717
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,287
instead of going with you?

718
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:10,329
What?

719
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,834
- What?
- What?

720
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:15,462
Something in here not working?

721
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:19,201
"Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.

722
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:22,073
I can't. It won't work with me."

723
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:24,943
Who said anything
about me being in love?

724
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:27,380
You haven't been to work in two days.

725
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,383
- So?
- Admit it.

726
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:31,044
- No.
- Admit it!

727
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,883
Eye gouge!

728
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:37,424
Ahhh. Ahhh!

729
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:40,928
- Admit it. Bone crusher!
- No.

730
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:47,795
Son of a bi...

731
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:58,279
Ow.

732
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:03,075
How long we been playing?

733
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:06,245
- About five minutes.
- Oh, God.

734
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:09,484
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

735
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:11,492
You, uh, want a beer?

736
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,756
No, thanks.

737
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:30,343
So, tell me this.

738
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:32,812
If you're not in love with her,

739
00:58:32,881 --> 00:58:35,975
how come little things she does,
drive you crazy?

740
00:58:36,051 --> 00:58:37,985
Little things?

741
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:42,251
Freddie, the woman learned English
in a single afternoon.

742
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:46,887
She could probably speak English already.

743
00:58:46,962 --> 00:58:49,021
I think she was in shock from being arrested.

744
00:58:49,097 --> 00:58:51,327
What about that, huh?

745
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,096
What about a woman showing up
naked in a public place?

746
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,830
I'm for it.

747
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:57,804
You said...

748
00:58:57,873 --> 00:59:01,502
that she had some kind
of immigration problem.

749
00:59:01,576 --> 00:59:05,478
She's on an ocean liner
in international waters.

750
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:09,483
She sees America. It looks good.

751
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:13,146
So, she greases her body
like a channel swimmer.

752
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:17,554
She dives in.
She has heavy trouble with sharks,

753
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:21,824
she goes through the Coast Guard,
minefields and then she's on shore.

754
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,830
She's okay. That's it.

755
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:28,061
What about the bathtub?

756
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:31,162
This moon stuff, and all those TV's?

757
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,503
Look, I'm being serious.

758
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:38,410
I admit to a few minor fiascos
in my love life.

759
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,213
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings!

760
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:45,616
I'm a free spirit!

761
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,986
I'm extremely liberal,
a freewheeling dude.

762
00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:53,925
You're in love with this girl. You're
trying to convince yourself you're not.

763
00:59:55,564 --> 00:59:57,758
I just don't know, Freddie.

764
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:00,027
Something about it isn't right.

765
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:02,036
I'll serve.

766
01:00:02,104 --> 01:00:04,537
Hold the beer. That will be your handicap.

767
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:07,200
- Oh, we're gonna play?
- Yeah.

768
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:10,539
- I'm gonna teach you a lesson in humility.
- Wait.

769
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,636
Humility 101.

770
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:14,647
- You all set?
- Yeah.

771
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:16,910
Here we go.

772
01:00:16,984 --> 01:00:18,611
Oh!

773
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:27,886
This is what we came to hear?

774
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:36,560
You call and tell us you have
stretched the frontiers of paleontology...

775
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:38,730
and zoology.

776
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:42,138
We interrupt important, serious work...

777
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,370
to fly here at a moment's notice,

778
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:47,039
and you give us mermaids.!

779
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:49,947
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.

780
01:00:50,017 --> 01:00:53,952
Enough. We have a seminar
in three weeks. Be ready.

781
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:02,058
Allen, you're here! I got you a present.

782
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:05,723
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
- I gotta close the door.

783
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,995
What are you doing?

784
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:10,434
All right.

785
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:14,406
Okay. Look.

786
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,009
Ha-ha! Wha... You, ah...

787
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:27,077
Well, that's big!

788
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:31,114
Yeah, this is...

789
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:33,785
This is very... big,

790
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,260
and it's... really here.

791
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,321
It's just so big.!

792
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:40,958
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.

793
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,868
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

794
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:48,936
Madison, where's your necklace?

795
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:52,637
- I traded it for the statue.
- Why?

796
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:56,477
Because I love you.

797
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,449
Oh, Madison.

798
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,883
Madison, I love...

799
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:09,190
this, ah, present.

800
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,457
I love it.

801
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,461
And I love you.

802
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,808
What's happened to you?

803
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:27,108
You were the brightest student in my class.

804
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,478
True, emotionally, you were 12 years old.

805
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:34,145
- I was 12 years old.
- That's right.

806
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,414
Look what you've become;

807
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:38,719
a schmuck.

808
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,590
There is a mermaid in New York City.

809
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:46,597
You mean this, this naked girl?

810
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:48,690
How come she's got legs?

811
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:52,999
She has legs out of water
and fins in the water.

812
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:56,769
You taught me that,
Dr. Zidell. Remember?

813
01:02:56,843 --> 01:02:59,743
You taught me all the legends.

814
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:02,906
You used to show me charts
on your office walls...

815
01:03:02,982 --> 01:03:06,712
where sailors had claimed they saw mermaids.

816
01:03:06,785 --> 01:03:09,720
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,

817
01:03:09,788 --> 01:03:13,053
not for you to build your whole life on.

818
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:18,024
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else that...

819
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:21,156
that girl is a mermaid!

820
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:23,599
How? You gonna get her wet...

821
01:03:23,669 --> 01:03:25,900
so everybody sees she has fins?

822
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:02,907
Taxi?

823
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:07,271
Oh!

824
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:09,678
- Watch it.!
- Hey, watch it, buddy.

825
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:12,409
Excuse me.

826
01:04:15,554 --> 01:04:17,783
Look out.

827
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:22,784
What does he think he's doing?

828
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:26,286
Hey.! Hey.!

829
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,772
Oh, my...

830
01:04:41,846 --> 01:04:45,350
Ow, ohh, ooof!

831
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,170
Oops.

832
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,337
Nice earrings.

833
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:22,248
- Is something the matter?
- No, nothing at all.

834
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,757
I was thinking.
You don't have to leave the country.

835
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:31,826
- I do.
- You don't. There's stuff we can do...

836
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,865
to get around the immigration laws.

837
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:38,800
I could give you a job down at the market.

838
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:41,531
You could get a work visa.

839
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,302
Or, uh, you could, uh,

840
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:48,776
marry, like, an American,

841
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,041
and they have to let you stay.

842
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,083
Our food is here!

843
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:59,022
Oh. Well, we'll talk about it later.

844
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,857
Do be careful, madam.
The plate is very hot.

845
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:05,861
Thank you. These look terrific.

846
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,085
She's really hungry!

847
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,912
You were very good.

848
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,972
Come on. Oops. Come on.

849
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:05,319
Let's sit down and talk.

850
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,355
Ah.

851
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,188
Your nose is cold.

852
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,194
I don't want to talk about my nose.

853
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,663
Your ears are all red!

854
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:19,599
I don't want to talk
about any part of my face.

855
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:24,935
But I do want to talk about
what happened in the restaurant.

856
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,976
I'm sorry.

857
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,534
That's how we eat lobster
where I come from.

858
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:35,948
Oh, no-no-no.
I don't care about that.

859
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,714
I was trying to do something in there,
and I guess I did it very badly.

860
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,916
I was trying...

861
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:49,557
to ask you if you wanted to get married.

862
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:53,566
Madison, will you marry me?

863
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,575
No.

864
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:04,703
What? No? Just no?

865
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,749
You don't want to think
about it, kick it around?

866
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:10,011
- I can't.
- Why?

867
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:12,679
I can't tell you.

868
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:15,019
I know you have some big secret you think...

869
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,149
you can't tell me, but you can.

870
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,251
- You're already married?
- Allen.

871
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,489
You're dying? You were once a man?

872
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:24,088
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.
- Allen.

873
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,567
I only have three days left.

874
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,765
Please make them wonderful.

875
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:36,043
Okay.

876
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,843
Want to skate some more?

877
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:48,982
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

878
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,695
Allen?

879
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:12,879
You know them?

880
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:16,748
No, I'vejust seen them before.

881
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:19,581
I guess they've come here
for about 40 years.

882
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,224
They look very happy.

883
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:27,592
Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?

884
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,927
They get to spend
their whole lives together.

885
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:37,869
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?

886
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:40,066
Yeah.

887
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:43,167
Where I come from, it never gets cold.

888
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,679
Well, hey, what a breakthrough!

889
01:09:45,746 --> 01:09:48,977
You just really opened up to me there.

890
01:09:51,519 --> 01:09:54,079
Your voice sounds funny.

891
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:56,350
It's called sarcasm.

892
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:59,188
They don't have that where
you come from either?

893
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:02,920
No.

894
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,593
Well, they don't have anything, do they?

895
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:12,002
They don't have ice, or music or clothes.

896
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:14,870
What kind of a place is this?

897
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:18,338
Madison?

898
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:21,404
- Madison!
- Hey, those skates are rented!

899
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:25,282
Give me one second. Madison?
Ahh! Madison!

900
01:10:27,455 --> 01:10:30,549
Madison, please? I'm sorry!

901
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,651
Let her go. Show some dignity.

902
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:35,218
Madison?

903
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,405
Thanks.

904
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:39,145
Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?

905
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:45,757
- Allen?
- What?

906
01:12:54,366 --> 01:12:56,357
Yes.

907
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:15,317
If we get our blood test today,
we can marry tomorrow!

908
01:13:15,386 --> 01:13:17,321
Before the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.

909
01:13:17,389 --> 01:13:19,857
So, tell me.

910
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:22,792
- Not today.
- But see,

911
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,489
if we get the test today...
no pressure, mind you...

912
01:13:25,564 --> 01:13:29,295
then as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.

913
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,859
Listen, you will love being married to me.

914
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:36,397
I was born to be married.
Mom and Dad were married.

915
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:39,842
Their moms and dads were married too.

916
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:20,676
Son of a bitch.

917
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:23,186
I thought we were going upstairs.

918
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:26,087
I love you. I'm not gonna lose you again.

919
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:28,592
We are getting married tonight.

920
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,254
We're gonna drive to Maryland.
Freddie always marries there.

921
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,663
You don't need
a blood test down there.

922
01:14:34,732 --> 01:14:37,997
There's this dinner
with the president. Damn!

923
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:41,800
Hey, that's okay!
We'll go to Maryland after dinner.

924
01:14:41,873 --> 01:14:44,433
- We'll already be dressed up!
- I haven't told you...

925
01:14:44,508 --> 01:14:46,942
You haven't told me this big secret.

926
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:48,945
Tell me on the way to Maryland.

927
01:14:50,014 --> 01:14:51,947
Oooh!

928
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,712
I hope we have a boy and a girl.

929
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:31,512
- What kind?
- Wha... What kind?

930
01:15:31,588 --> 01:15:33,988
The young kind, I guess.

931
01:15:34,057 --> 01:15:36,652
The older ones are
a little hard to deliver.

932
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:38,660
We're getting married tonight.

933
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:40,663
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

934
01:15:40,731 --> 01:15:44,393
Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?

935
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:47,062
The butter is hard like a rock.

936
01:15:47,138 --> 01:15:49,662
Do you have a broken arm?

937
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:52,834
No, it's fractured in 16 places.

938
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:54,877
Why are you here?

939
01:15:56,246 --> 01:15:58,180
The union sent me.

940
01:16:00,984 --> 01:16:03,714
My God, the president is here!

941
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:07,188
The president's here. The president's here!

942
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:26,475
Hmm.

943
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:44,854
I'm just a corn-fed Kansas boy,

944
01:16:44,928 --> 01:16:48,056
but you are the Big Apple of my eye.

945
01:16:49,632 --> 01:16:53,735
Thank you.

946
01:16:53,803 --> 01:16:55,862
Thank you very much.

947
01:16:57,406 --> 01:17:01,776
Thank you.
It's great to be back in New York.

948
01:17:12,322 --> 01:17:14,346
Alert. Alert. Table 5.

949
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:16,414
Intercept busboy with suspicious hump.

950
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:21,793
He's reaching! Get him now!

951
01:17:21,864 --> 01:17:24,958
- Sir, I'd like a word with you, please.
- About what?

952
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,968
This has nothing to do with the president.

953
01:17:27,036 --> 01:17:29,870
This has nothing to do with the president.!

954
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:36,536
Well, I guess he just found out
what his dinner cost.

955
01:17:39,515 --> 01:17:43,978
I want to talk to the press.

956
01:17:44,053 --> 01:17:46,385
I have a formal statement to make!

957
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:50,084
In Bob Hollins,
you have a candidate for Congress...

958
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,218
who is in touch with the people,

959
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:56,094
a man who built up the business
left to him by his grandfather.

960
01:17:56,165 --> 01:17:58,099
What was once a small
pushcart on wheels...

961
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:01,136
- Allen?
- Yeah?

962
01:18:01,203 --> 01:18:03,569
It's time for me to tell you.

963
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:05,732
What? Now?

964
01:18:05,808 --> 01:18:09,141
- Right now.
- Okay. Great.

965
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:11,179
- Not here.
- Fine. Fine.

966
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:13,180
But more importantly, with fresh meat.

967
01:18:15,683 --> 01:18:18,778
- I am not crazy. There's a mermaid in there.
- Shut up.

968
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:20,788
- What mermaid?
- I am a scientist!

969
01:18:20,856 --> 01:18:23,324
Where's the goddamn car!

970
01:18:23,425 --> 01:18:26,155
The gray BMW.

971
01:18:30,866 --> 01:18:32,992
Hey, I know that guy.

972
01:18:33,067 --> 01:18:36,003
I saw him on Cape Cod. He was crazy then.

973
01:18:36,071 --> 01:18:39,631
There she is! There she is!

974
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:44,605
- Don't let him shoot that.
- That a gun?

975
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,308
- Hold it.!
- No!

976
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:50,509
Get that thing out ofhis hand.

977
01:18:50,585 --> 01:18:52,485
Grab that hose.!

978
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:55,716
Grab him.! Get him.!

979
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:02,353
- No!
- What's going on?

980
01:19:21,516 --> 01:19:23,882
I was right!

981
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:27,853
Behold the mermaid!

982
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,054
Let me outta here.!

983
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:38,064
Who are you? What is your name?

984
01:19:38,132 --> 01:19:39,827
Allen!

985
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:43,402
- What do we do?
- Grab her. Grab everybody.

986
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:47,669
- I want to see her.
- Allen! Allen!

987
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,777
Get her.! Get her.!

988
01:19:52,445 --> 01:19:54,437
Allen.!

989
01:19:57,784 --> 01:19:59,548
Please?

990
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,589
- Let's pick her up.
- Allen. Allen!

991
01:20:07,995 --> 01:20:10,087
Allen. Allen.

992
01:20:14,968 --> 01:20:16,993
Allen.!

993
01:20:23,143 --> 01:20:26,704
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.

994
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,750
Dr. Hill, line 5. Stat.!

995
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,552
- Buckwalter.
- Sir!

996
01:20:34,688 --> 01:20:36,623
Gentlemen.

997
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:38,624
- Anything?
- No change.

998
01:20:49,569 --> 01:20:52,037
I am not a fish!

999
01:20:52,105 --> 01:20:56,633
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

1000
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:59,771
Will you just let me out of here?

1001
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:03,077
Please? Huh? People?

1002
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,242
Let's try some interaction.

1003
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,684
Fine. Jim?

1004
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:03,699
I guess they thought you might be one.

1005
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:07,411
Yeah.

1006
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,538
I guess so.

1007
01:22:10,749 --> 01:22:14,651
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.

1008
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,020
I know.

1009
01:22:20,759 --> 01:22:24,560
You thought at least I was a human being.

1010
01:22:31,103 --> 01:22:33,037
Allen?

1011
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:52,888
He's been in the water 12 hours.
He's just a man.

1012
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:56,223
Get him out so we
can concentrate on her.

1013
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:10,339
Greg Martin, W-M-E-T Radio,
here with Allen Bauer.

1014
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:13,867
- When did you meet the mermaid?
- Tell me where.

1015
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:16,140
Did you know she was a mermaid?

1016
01:23:16,214 --> 01:23:19,878
- Did you actually make love to her?
- That's a stupid question.

1017
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:21,885
Did she eat worms?

1018
01:23:21,953 --> 01:23:24,616
Would you have to make
love to her in water?

1019
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:26,590
That's none of your business.

1020
01:23:26,658 --> 01:23:29,091
Is she a mutant or missing link?

1021
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,095
No, she's not.

1022
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:33,995
I'm from People.
Is she also seeing Burt Reynolds?

1023
01:23:34,065 --> 01:23:37,160
For crying out loud!

1024
01:23:40,138 --> 01:23:42,300
Leave him alone!

1025
01:23:42,374 --> 01:23:46,139
Leave him alone! Get out of the way!

1026
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,202
- Let me through.
- Out of the way.

1027
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,373
- Allen, you all right?
- Yeah. Get me out.

1028
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:53,918
Is anyone here from Penthouse?

1029
01:23:53,986 --> 01:23:57,284
- No.
- Then we ain't talking.

1030
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:20,205
Hey, Allen?

1031
01:24:26,717 --> 01:24:30,551
What are you looking at? You never
saw a guy who slept with a fish?

1032
01:24:30,621 --> 01:24:33,215
Get back to work!

1033
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:37,394
Mr. Bauer, you had a million messages.

1034
01:24:37,462 --> 01:24:39,521
I wrote them down.

1035
01:24:39,597 --> 01:24:44,864
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP,

1036
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:48,963
UPI, Ted Turner, Time, Newsweek,

1037
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,736
Marineland, "Ripley's Believe It Or Not,"

1038
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:54,243
and Mrs. Paul.

1039
01:24:54,312 --> 01:24:57,042
Not now, Mrs. Stimler.

1040
01:25:01,385 --> 01:25:04,217
"Fishman?"

1041
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:06,222
Fishman!

1042
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:09,157
That's what they're
calling you on TVtoo.

1043
01:25:09,227 --> 01:25:11,717
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.

1044
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:18,626
- So, how is she?
- How is she?

1045
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:23,162
She's... a mermaid.

1046
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,301
I don't understand. All my life...

1047
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:29,504
I've been waiting for someone...

1048
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:31,911
and when I find her,

1049
01:25:31,982 --> 01:25:33,916
she's a fish.

1050
01:25:33,984 --> 01:25:36,283
Nobody said love's perfect!

1051
01:25:36,354 --> 01:25:41,154
Oh, Freddie, I don't expect it
to be perfect,

1052
01:25:41,224 --> 01:25:44,091
but for God's sake, it's usually human!

1053
01:25:45,829 --> 01:25:48,560
Every day people meet and they fall in love.

1054
01:25:48,633 --> 01:25:50,566
Look what I got.

1055
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:56,365
Look what you got. Yeah, let's look.

1056
01:25:57,474 --> 01:26:00,443
Let's take a good look at what you got.

1057
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:03,070
- People fall in love every day, huh?
- Yeah.

1058
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:07,048
That's a crock! It doesn't work that way.

1059
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:09,745
Do you realize how happy
you were with her?

1060
01:26:09,819 --> 01:26:12,286
That is, when you weren't
driving yourself crazy.

1061
01:26:12,354 --> 01:26:15,415
Every day? Come on.

1062
01:26:15,492 --> 01:26:19,155
Some people will never be that happy!
I'll never be that happy.

1063
01:26:23,832 --> 01:26:25,767
What am I talking to you for?

1064
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:28,803
You don't know nothing. Mrs. Stimler?

1065
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:04,038
Does she look a little pale?

1066
01:27:06,075 --> 01:27:08,270
Ah, that's a good day's work.

1067
01:27:08,344 --> 01:27:11,711
Tomorrow, I want to see
how she interacts...

1068
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:15,147
with other marine life,
then the internal examination.

1069
01:27:17,586 --> 01:27:19,521
Internal?

1070
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:22,614
I want to study her pulmonary system,

1071
01:27:22,691 --> 01:27:26,218
- reproductive organs, everything!
- Dr. Ross?

1072
01:27:26,295 --> 01:27:29,856
Are we considering...

1073
01:27:29,932 --> 01:27:33,629
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure?

1074
01:27:33,702 --> 01:27:35,636
I'm considering everything!

1075
01:27:35,704 --> 01:27:38,070
Ah, yes,

1076
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,734
I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.

1077
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:43,403
How stupid of me. But let me ask,

1078
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:45,709
are you considering the possibility...

1079
01:27:45,781 --> 01:27:48,146
that you might be a sadistic pig?

1080
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:56,391
While we are baring
our souls, Mr. Kornbluth,

1081
01:27:56,458 --> 01:28:00,018
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.

1082
01:28:00,094 --> 01:28:03,189
You're not a member of my team.

1083
01:28:03,265 --> 01:28:08,293
Run along, Walter.
See if you can't find a unicorn.

1084
01:29:17,038 --> 01:29:20,530
- What's that?
- Painkiller, Mr. Kornbluth.

1085
01:29:20,608 --> 01:29:23,509
Whoever punched you
cracked your tooth.

1086
01:29:23,578 --> 01:29:26,138
We'll be very close to the nerve.

1087
01:29:26,214 --> 01:29:30,047
I don't deserve painkiller. Just drill.

1088
01:29:30,117 --> 01:29:33,815
Oh, you want pain.
Well, we aim to please.

1089
01:29:36,757 --> 01:29:38,623
Get out.

1090
01:29:38,693 --> 01:29:40,752
- What are you...
- Get out!

1091
01:29:40,828 --> 01:29:44,161
- Ja, ja, ja.
- Please stay. Ahh!

1092
01:29:45,266 --> 01:29:47,199
Let's talk.

1093
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:52,630
Hey, put that down.

1094
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:55,198
- Put that needle down.
- Stay away from me.

1095
01:29:55,276 --> 01:29:59,006
- I said, "Let's talk." Put it down.
- Stay away!

1096
01:30:04,084 --> 01:30:06,018
Ahhh!

1097
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:10,751
Ahhh! Ohhh!

1098
01:30:12,058 --> 01:30:13,754
Uh.

1099
01:30:14,996 --> 01:30:16,792
Ah!

1100
01:30:17,864 --> 01:30:21,934
Ah!

1101
01:30:22,002 --> 01:30:24,061
What a week I'm having!

1102
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:29,174
You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.

1103
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:32,302
I didn't mean to.

1104
01:30:32,379 --> 01:30:35,507
I just had to prove that I wasn't crazy.

1105
01:30:35,582 --> 01:30:38,380
I'm a man of science.

1106
01:30:40,487 --> 01:30:44,685
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you...

1107
01:30:44,758 --> 01:30:46,692
or her.

1108
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,193
I'm really a nice guy.

1109
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:51,822
If I had friends, you could ask them.

1110
01:30:51,898 --> 01:30:56,426
I've been on the phone to
every employee of the government...

1111
01:30:56,503 --> 01:31:00,371
calling them sons of bitches.

1112
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,204
Nobody could even get in to see her.

1113
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:06,911
I can.

1114
01:31:10,016 --> 01:31:12,415
Come on. Come on!

1115
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:14,544
- Ahh!
- Come on.

1116
01:31:56,563 --> 01:31:59,827
Good afternoon, Dr. Kornbluth.
I wasn't expecting you today.

1117
01:31:59,899 --> 01:32:01,993
These are Drs. Jarred and Johanssen...

1118
01:32:02,068 --> 01:32:04,126
from the Stockholm Institute.

1119
01:32:04,203 --> 01:32:06,433
I thought they were
coming later with Dr. Ross.

1120
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:11,465
No, no. That story was to fool the press.

1121
01:32:11,543 --> 01:32:14,910
You know, I'm half Swedish.

1122
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:21,342
- Ja.
- Ja.

1123
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:28,759
- Ja.
- Oh, ja.

1124
01:32:28,827 --> 01:32:32,627
- Well!
- Just a second.

1125
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,681
Ah.

1126
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:05,489
- How the hell did you do that?
- Let me tell you.

1127
01:33:05,563 --> 01:33:08,158
Many nudie films come from Sweden.

1128
01:33:08,233 --> 01:33:12,134
After you see them 400 or 500 times,
the stuff sinks in.

1129
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:14,638
Afternoon, Buckwalter.

1130
01:33:14,707 --> 01:33:16,799
Sorry, no one comes in...

1131
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:19,672
until Dr. Ross gets back
with them Swede people.

1132
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,679
These are the Swedish doctors.

1133
01:33:21,747 --> 01:33:25,113
These are... Swedes?

1134
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:27,345
Ah, come here.

1135
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:31,218
Isn't that one kinda dark?

1136
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:33,587
He's dirty from the trip!

1137
01:33:33,658 --> 01:33:36,024
- Let us in.
- I'm not supposed to.

1138
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:38,120
What are you afraid of?

1139
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:42,030
Do you think we're
gonna steal the mermaid?

1140
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,399
Steal the mermaid.
Stealing the mermaid!

1141
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:47,802
Are we gonna fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?

1142
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,863
In a briefcase. In half.

1143
01:33:49,941 --> 01:33:52,603
I guess it's all right.

1144
01:33:52,677 --> 01:33:54,508
Go in. Go in.

1145
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:56,444
- Good joke, there.
- Yeah.

1146
01:34:31,515 --> 01:34:33,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

1147
01:34:33,985 --> 01:34:37,750
Is this the big secret you've been keeping,

1148
01:34:37,821 --> 01:34:40,552
that you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?

1149
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:42,751
No, that's it.

1150
01:34:45,997 --> 01:34:49,329
Allen, don't feel guilty.

1151
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:51,561
Guilty? About what?

1152
01:34:51,636 --> 01:34:53,933
About not loving me anymore.

1153
01:34:55,472 --> 01:34:58,135
Oh, Madison.

1154
01:34:58,209 --> 01:35:00,472
All the time we were together,

1155
01:35:00,544 --> 01:35:03,013
you always knew how I was feeling.

1156
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:05,014
Can't you tell now?

1157
01:35:14,325 --> 01:35:18,021
#Well, left my wife
in New Orleans #

1158
01:35:18,095 --> 01:35:20,326
# Forty-eight kids
and a can of beans #

1159
01:35:20,398 --> 01:35:23,298
- # Left, right, one, two ##
- Oh, my God!

1160
01:35:23,366 --> 01:35:25,425
- What?
- Stand back, man.

1161
01:35:25,502 --> 01:35:28,938
Cover his face, for God's sake!

1162
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:31,599
What happened? What's going on?

1163
01:35:31,675 --> 01:35:34,235
Dr. Johanssen bent down
to examine that creature...

1164
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,041
and suddenly these rays
came out of her eyes!

1165
01:35:37,114 --> 01:35:40,447
Don't go in there!
She'll melt your face off.

1166
01:35:40,517 --> 01:35:42,508
I knew something would happen.
What should I do?

1167
01:35:42,586 --> 01:35:46,022
- Don't whine. Seal off the area.
- I'll call the Pentagon.

1168
01:35:46,089 --> 01:35:49,058
You want to create a national panic?

1169
01:35:49,126 --> 01:35:52,459
- I don't want to die!
- Pull yourself together.

1170
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:54,690
Don't let anybody in that room.

1171
01:35:54,764 --> 01:35:57,995
I'll be back with nuclear weapons.
Come on, Doctor.

1172
01:36:25,794 --> 01:36:28,025
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.
Who are your guests?

1173
01:36:28,098 --> 01:36:31,396
Drs. Jarred and Johanssen
from the Swedish Institute.

1174
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:33,629
Sir?

1175
01:36:33,703 --> 01:36:38,162
Dr. Kornbluth left with
the Swedes a few minutes ago.

1176
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:48,082
Hiya, boys. Come in. The water's fine.

1177
01:36:51,454 --> 01:36:55,184
Let's get her back now! And arrest him.

1178
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:14,709
We have a blue BMW. Over.

1179
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:38,799
Come on.

1180
01:37:38,867 --> 01:37:42,598
Know something?
I don't think we're being followed.

1181
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:45,663
Wha... Well, that was easy.

1182
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:49,232
That was simple! We did it!

1183
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:51,609
- My plan.
- You're a genius.

1184
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,147
I am a genius,
but you came in with the Swedish thing.

1185
01:37:54,215 --> 01:37:57,777
That was a brilliant touch.

1186
01:37:57,853 --> 01:38:00,082
I didn't even like you when we first met.

1187
01:38:00,154 --> 01:38:02,520
Nobody likes me when they first meet me.

1188
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:07,026
Allen?

1189
01:38:13,768 --> 01:38:15,862
- Move!
- All right. Here we go!

1190
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,350
Suspect heading south on Broadway.

1191
01:39:07,088 --> 01:39:11,525
Unit One. Lost them
in the Wall Street district. Over.

1192
01:39:14,294 --> 01:39:16,229
- Stop the car.
- What?

1193
01:39:16,297 --> 01:39:19,061
Stop and let me out.
I'll slow them down. Do it!

1194
01:39:25,505 --> 01:39:28,998
I caused all this.
Now I'm gonna finish it.

1195
01:39:37,651 --> 01:39:39,586
Get the hell out of here.

1196
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:41,554
Go!

1197
01:39:59,306 --> 01:40:01,467
Whoa! Oooh.

1198
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:06,611
What a week I'm having.!

1199
01:40:21,595 --> 01:40:23,961
Hey, mac, move that thing out of here.

1200
01:40:25,465 --> 01:40:27,763
Up yours, Gomer. I'm waitin' for a fare.

1201
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:38,003
Heave!

1202
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,144
All right. Move out.

1203
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:45,514
Come on, let's go!

1204
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:13,944
- I was ready to stay with you forever.
- I know.

1205
01:41:14,013 --> 01:41:16,949
They know who you are.
They won't leave you alone.

1206
01:41:17,017 --> 01:41:19,484
I can't ever come back to you.

1207
01:41:19,552 --> 01:41:22,113
I wish I could go with you.

1208
01:41:22,189 --> 01:41:24,486
You can.

1209
01:41:24,557 --> 01:41:27,025
- How?
- It can be done.

1210
01:41:27,092 --> 01:41:31,028
Remember when you were eight
and fell off the ship?

1211
01:41:31,096 --> 01:41:33,565
You were safe under
the water, weren't you?

1212
01:41:33,633 --> 01:41:35,827
Yeah.

1213
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:38,392
You were with me.

1214
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:41,668
You mean, that was real?

1215
01:41:42,675 --> 01:41:45,200
That was you?

1216
01:41:45,277 --> 01:41:48,041
That was you!

1217
01:41:50,816 --> 01:41:53,512
This is great. This is great!

1218
01:41:53,586 --> 01:41:55,884
I can go with you
and still come back...

1219
01:41:55,955 --> 01:41:58,719
and see Freddie at Christmas.

1220
01:41:58,791 --> 01:42:00,816
You can't ever come back.

1221
01:42:14,573 --> 01:42:16,541
Madison.

1222
01:42:19,378 --> 01:42:21,311
I understand.

1223
01:42:30,589 --> 01:42:32,715
You on the dock, don't move.

1224
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:34,782
You're under arrest.

1225
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:37,021
Let the girl go. Step back.

1226
01:42:37,096 --> 01:42:39,188
You're under arrest.

1227
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:41,199
You have to go.

1228
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:43,632
Move out. Let's go.!

1229
01:42:44,636 --> 01:42:46,571
I love you, Madison.

1230
01:42:48,274 --> 01:42:49,797
Go.

1231
01:42:52,044 --> 01:42:54,035
Go!

1232
01:43:00,518 --> 01:43:03,453
Get that guy on the dock.

1233
01:43:04,723 --> 01:43:06,451
Leave her alone!

1234
01:43:09,394 --> 01:43:11,124
Leave her alone!

1235
01:43:21,372 --> 01:43:23,670
Madison.

1236
01:43:30,582 --> 01:43:32,243
Madison!

1237
01:43:42,393 --> 01:43:46,159
Stay where you are. We'll get you out.

1238
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,763
Madison!
