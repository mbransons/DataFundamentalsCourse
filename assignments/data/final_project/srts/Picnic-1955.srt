1
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,598
Hey, son!

2
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,331
This is where you wanted off.

3
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,201
Well, thank you, sir.

4
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,377
Thank you for the hitch too.

5
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,879
I've ridden them lots of times
when I was your age myself.

6
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,243
What do you want here?

7
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,919
A friend of mine lives here.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,087
His old man's a big shot
in the grain business.

9
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,584
Real rich.

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,990
- Honest.
- Sure!

11
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,422
The governor's an old
sidekick of mine.

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,598
That's how I got this job.

13
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,664
Millie!

14
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,738
Does it make your mouth water?

15
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,438
It's beautiful, Mrs. Potts.

16
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,133
Thank you, dear.

17
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,159
Ma'am?

18
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,163
Yes?

19
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,733
About your yard, ma'am.

20
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,936
I could rake it up
and burn your trash for you...

21
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,640
...or any other job needs done.

22
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,407
My gracious!

23
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,744
Nobody works today.

24
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,055
It's Labor Day!

25
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,555
Are you hungry?

26
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,297
I guess my stomach didn't know
it was Labor Day, ma'am.

27
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,560
You just stop being embarrassed.
Come in and have breakfast.

28
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,137
- Not unless I clean up your yard.
- All right, but after you eat.

29
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,174
Come on, get in the house
and get something to eat.

30
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,994
Madge!

31
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,595
Dry your silly hair
over somebody else.

32
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,439
Why don't you read your silly book
under somebody else?

33
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,083
My, it's hot and still today.

34
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,761
It looks lovely, dear.

35
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,055
I wish it didn't
take so long to dry.

36
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,431
I think, one summer
I'll cut it short.

37
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,793
Madge!

38
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,469
She's just talking.
The way she primps and fusses...

39
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,196
...somebody'd think
she was the Queen of Sheba.

40
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,341
Well, if you fussed a little...

41
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,669
...maybe you'd have a date
for the picnic today.

42
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,609
I don't want any of these crazy boys
to take me anywhere.

43
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,477
Beggars can't be choosers!

44
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,446
Madge, that's mean.

45
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,644
There'll be dancing tonight.

46
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,516
Millie ought to have a date.

47
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,190
All she has to do is
dress up and act decent.

48
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,722
I will dress and act the way I want.

49
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,373
Anybody mind if an old maid
schoolteacher joins their company?

50
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,803
Morning, Miss Sydney.

51
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,444
Come out and join us, Rosemary.

52
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,410
- Mail in yet?
- It's a holiday.

53
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,175
Oh, that's right.

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,487
I forgot.

55
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,086
Thought there might be a letter
from that man I met...

56
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,854
...at the high-school dance
last spring.

57
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,355
He's been wanting to
marry me ever since.

58
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,558
He was a peck of fun.

59
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,369
But I don't have time for any of them
when they get serious on me.

60
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,404
You schoolteachers
are mighty independent.

61
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,672
Shoot!

62
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,873
I lived this long without a man.

63
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,978
What's to keep me
from getting on without one?

64
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,846
What about Howard?

65
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,612
Howard Bevans?

66
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,490
He's just a friend-boy...

67
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,217
...not a boyfriend.

68
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,162
I'll bet you never had cherry pie
for breakfast before, did you?

69
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,335
No, ma'am.

70
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,026
I never did.

71
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,338
I'll get started on your yard now.

72
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,237
You had such a big breakfast.

73
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,378
Wouldn't you like
to rest for a while?

74
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,275
No, ma'am.
Work's good for my digestion.

75
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:09,360
I was figuring to look up
this friend of mine that lives here.

76
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,257
I was in college with him...

77
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,097
...some years back.

78
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,098
You look like a college man.

79
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,260
Well, thank you, ma'am.

80
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,441
I don't suppose you'd know him.
His name's Alan Benson.

81
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,803
Alan Benson!
Why, of course!

82
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,673
He visits one of
the girls next door.

83
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,772
What do you know!

84
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,411
It's right around here.

85
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,518
It'll be awful hot in that jacket.

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,381
You better take it off.

87
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,787
My shirt's awful dirty, ma'am.

88
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,823
I'll wash it for you.

89
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,187
You think anybody'd mind?

90
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,491
Of course not. You're a man!

91
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,497
What's the difference?

92
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,095
Helen!

93
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,069
It's my mother.
She lives upstairs.

94
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,674
She's an invalid, you see.

95
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,674
She's very old.

96
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,206
Sure. Older people take a lot of care.

97
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,747
Helen!

98
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,482
All right, Mama.
I'm coming.

99
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,450
I'm coming!

100
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,184
Working over there
naked as an Indian!

101
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,910
Who's naked as an Indian?

102
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,453
Who does he think is interested?

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,861
- Good morning.
- Hey, Bomber, you stupe!

104
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,827
You want to knock the house down?

105
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,523
Go back to bed, will you?

106
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,794
Go blow your nose!

107
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,739
Tell your pretty sister
to come out.

108
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,465
It's no fun looking at you,
goonface!

109
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,144
You take that back,
you dirty little pest!

110
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,179
Look at goonface!
She fights just like a man. Oh, boy!

111
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,225
One of these days, you'll come here
and I'll shoot you, so help me!

112
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,822
Morning, Madge.

113
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,395
Hello, Bomber.

114
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,264
A bunch of us guys...

115
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,697
...are chipping in on a hot rod.

116
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,204
I get it every Friday night.

117
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,264
Well, don't expect to honk the horn
and have me run out.

118
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,378
If a boy wants a date, he can
come to the door and ask if I'm in.

119
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,675
Alan Benson sends her flowers
every time they go out.

120
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,779
I can't send you flowers, baby, but...

121
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,847
...I can...

122
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,080
...send you.

123
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,153
Let me pick you up some night
after Benson brings you home.

124
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,128
Will you stop being ridiculous?

125
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,738
I've seen you riding
around in his convertible...

126
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,338
...like you was a duchess.

127
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,305
Why do good-looking girls
have to be so...

128
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,740
...stuck on themselves?

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,612
I am not stuck on myself.

130
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,683
Let me pick you up some night
after Benson brings you home.

131
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,512
Bomber, will you let me alone?

132
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,018
Give a guy a break!

133
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,247
On your way, lover-boy.

134
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,655
Who are you?

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,031
What's that matter?
I'm bigger than you are.

136
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,429
I'm late on my route!

137
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,373
Go on.
Go peddle your papers!

138
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,272
Drop dead!

139
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,146
Hi.

140
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,689
Hey, you working for Mrs. Potts?

141
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,398
Just doing a few odd jobs
in the yard.

142
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,861
- She give you breakfast?
- Millie, stop it.

143
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,526
I need you girls to help me
with the picnic sandwiches, so...

144
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,707
Is there something you want,
young man?

145
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,805
Just loafing, ma'am.

146
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,607
This is a busy day for us.
We have no time to loaf.

147
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,776
Are you the...

148
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,683
...mother?

149
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,420
Yes.

150
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,001
Come on, Millie.

151
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,933
Madge!

152
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,067
Come here!
Come here a minute.

153
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,747
He knows Alan!

154
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,382
Isn't that nice?

155
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,724
I've never been to Kansas before.

156
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,764
Maybe you can tell me
where Benson lives.

157
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,866
He lives on the
other end of town.

158
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,700
Ask anyone over there.

159
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,202
Alan's father is an elevator man.

160
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,739
He owns all those big grain elevators.

161
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,284
See you.

162
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,216
See you.

163
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,240
Nice chip, Dad.

164
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,447
Keep your head down, son.
Follow through.

165
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,281
Benson?

166
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,058
Hal Carter!

167
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,124
Kid!

168
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,126
Well, where did you come from?

169
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,123
Oh, around.

170
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,893
You old son of a gun!
Of all the people in the world!

171
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,129
Hey, now. Watch it! Watch it!

172
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,534
Remember how we used to
wake up that fraternity?

173
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,902
Do I?

174
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,671
Who's Winkin'...

175
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,980
...Blinkin' and Stinkin'?

176
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,313
Dad, this is Hal Carter.

177
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,950
Yes, so it is.

178
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,983
I remember you
on the football field.

179
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,118
Thank you, Mr. Benson.

180
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,790
You still look able
to dodge a few tacklers.

181
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,925
You look pretty fit yourself, sir.

182
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,253
Well, I try.

183
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,894
I try.

184
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,058
Great guy.

185
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,459
- When did you get into town?
- Early this morning.

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,604
Imagine living in
a place like this.

187
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,069
Why didn't you come
to see me first thing?

188
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,337
I didn't want to walk in on you,
looking like a bum.

189
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,173
I thought I'd scrounge around, get me
a little change and pick up a new shirt.

190
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,406
That wouldn't have made
any difference.

191
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,414
Hal Carter!

192
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,311
Where have you been all these years?

193
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,320
I was working back home...

194
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,254
...in the filling station.

195
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,720
- Then I was in the Army.
- Yeah? How long?

196
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,488
Till I got out.

197
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,397
I heard you went to Hollywood...

198
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,070
...to become a big movie hero.

199
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,504
I was going to have a big career.

200
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,676
They were going to call me
"Brush" Carter.

201
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,572
What happened, "Brush"?

202
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,811
This babe told me they'd have to
pull out all my teeth...

203
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,745
...and get me new ones,
so naturally...

204
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,543
Wait a minute. What babe?

205
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,950
The babe that got me the screen test.

206
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,887
She wasn't exactly a babe.
She was kind of beat-up, but...

207
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,689
...not bad.

208
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,132
Same old Hal.

209
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,928
Aren't you glad to see me?

210
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,594
Well, sure.

211
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,502
How about lending me a razor?

212
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay, go on now. Fill me in.

213
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,268
After I left Hollywood...

214
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,073
...I took a job on a ranch in Nevada.

215
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,543
You'd have been proud of me.

216
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,547
In bed every night at 10...

217
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,845
...up every morning at 6.

218
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,887
No liquor, no babes, no nothing!

219
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,957
I even saved up 200 bucks.
Then I got rolled.

220
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,889
Rolled? You?

221
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,963
I was...

222
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,335
...hitchhiking my way down to Texas...

223
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,200
...on a big oil deal...

224
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,007
...when two babes pull up...

225
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,201
...in this big, yellow convertible.

226
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,973
One of them slams on the brake
and hollers...

227
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,650
..."Hey, beefcake! Get in."

228
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,918
So I...

229
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,182
...got in.

230
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,352
Benson, it was crazy.

231
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,561
They had a shaker full of martinis
right in the car.

232
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,698
- Remembering old times?
- Oh, yes, sir. Oh, no, sir.

233
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,835
I'm due at the club, Alan.
Join me later if you wish.

234
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,739
I've got a date, Dad.

235
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,530
Same young lady?

236
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,270
Of course.

237
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,181
Delighted to have seen you.

238
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,243
It's mutual, sir.

239
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,680
Great car.

240
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,014
Go on. Now tell me
what happened exactly.

241
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,723
You know me.

242
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,594
- I'm an agreeable guy.
- Sure.

243
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:41,255
So when they park in front of
this tourist cabin, I said:

244
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:46,336
"If I got to pay for the ride,
this is the easiest way I know."

245
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,902
So we got busy...

246
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,574
...on the martinis.

247
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,304
They must have thought
I was Superman.

248
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,875
Nothing like that
ever happens to me.

249
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,748
So then I said...

250
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,680
..."Okay, girls, party's over.

251
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,411
Let's get going."

252
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,113
And one of them sticks a gun
in my back and says...

253
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,159
..."This party's going on
till we say it's over, Buck."

254
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,693
You'd have thought
she was Humphrey Bogart.

255
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,366
Wait a minute. Then what?

256
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,592
So finally I passed out.

257
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,771
When I woke up, the dames were gone
and so was my 200 bucks.

258
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,873
I went to the police.
They wouldn't believe me.

259
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,772
They said my story was wishful thinking.
How do you like that?

260
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,206
I'm telling you, Benson...

261
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,976
...women are getting desperate.

262
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,654
Be awfully nice to
be married to Alan, Madge.

263
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,519
Better get busy.

264
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,784
Busy?

265
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,487
A pretty girl doesn't have long.
Just a few years.

266
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,995
Then she's the equal of kings.

267
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,897
She can walk out of
a shanty like this...

268
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,972
...and live in a palace.

269
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,571
If she loses her chance
when she's young...

270
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,338
...she might as well throw
all her prettiness away.

271
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,380
I'm only 19.

272
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,176
And next summer, you'll be 20.

273
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,618
And then 21, and then...

274
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,252
...40.

275
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,460
You don't have to be morbid.

276
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,991
Is this a private party I'm crashing?

277
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,163
Oh, no.

278
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,528
I won't be back
for lunch, Mrs. Owens.

279
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,466
There's a welcome-home party
at the hotel...

280
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,699
...for the new girls on the faculty.

281
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,474
My, isn't that scrumptious!

282
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,911
You'll be the belle of the ball, Madge.

283
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,588
You look nice yourself, Miss Sydney.

284
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,623
It's the new fall outfit.

285
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,520
You schoolteachers
certainly have nice things.

286
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,217
I got it in Kansas City.

287
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,659
Paid $22.50 for the hat.

288
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,269
Good land! You let your daughter
read filthy books like that?

289
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,097
- Filthy?
- What are you reading, Millie?

290
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.

291
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,302
And it's not filthy.
It's wonderful.

292
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,139
Somebody wanted it
banned from the public library.

293
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,613
It's on the reading list at college,
and Alan Benson loaned it to me.

294
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, dear.

295
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,586
What is a person to believe?

296
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,825
Well, those college professors
don't have any morals.

297
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,992
Bye, now.

298
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,101
Madge, let's get at this dress.

299
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,613
Everybody around here gets to
dress up and go places except me.

300
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,218
That's because you're not
interested in boys.

301
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,782
You'd think all boys cared
about was what somebody wears.

302
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,018
They do care about
how they look and act, though.

303
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,157
And how they smell
a lot of the time.

304
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,161
Girls, don't fight!

305
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,697
La-dee-da!

306
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,233
Madge is the pretty one.
But she's so dumb, they almost had to...

307
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,872
...burn the schoolhouse
to get her out of it.

308
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,905
That is not so!

309
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,202
You have to work in the dime store.

310
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,006
Bomber was right. You are a goon!

311
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:21,816
You slut! You take that back or
I'll kill you! Take it back!

312
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,326
Hello, girls.

313
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,130
Lovely morning, isn't it?

314
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,027
- Mother!
- Take it back, Madge!

315
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,032
Girls! What will the neighbors say?

316
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,729
Nobody can call me "goon"
and get by with it.

317
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,204
You've called her worse names.

318
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,843
It doesn't hurt, what names I call her.

319
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,209
Madge is the pretty one.
Names don't bother her at all.

320
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,849
Poor Millie!

321
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,958
All I ever hear is "poor Millie"!

322
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,591
Poor Millie won herself a scholarship...

323
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,354
...for four whole years of college.

324
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,361
A girl like Millie...

325
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,297
...can need confidence in other ways.

326
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,302
With Alan...

327
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,675
...you'd live in comfort
the rest of your life.

328
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,878
Charge accounts at all the stores.

329
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,587
Automobiles and trips.

330
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,526
And you'd belong to the country club.

331
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,187
I don't feel right with those people.

332
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,856
Why not?

333
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,035
Your grandfather was in
the state legislature.

334
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,206
You're as good as they are.

335
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:52,001
When a girl's as pretty as you are,
she doesn't have to...

336
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,146
What good is it just to be pretty?

337
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,418
What a question!

338
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,917
Maybe I get tired of
only being looked at.

339
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,991
You puzzle me when you talk that way.

340
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,502
Does Alan ever make love?

341
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,431
Sometimes we park the car
by the river.

342
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,676
Do you let him kiss you?

343
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,176
After all, you've been
going together all summer.

344
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,474
Of course I let him.

345
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,390
Does he ever want to
go beyond kissing?

346
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm your mother!
These things have to be talked about.

347
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,837
Do you like it when he kisses you?

348
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,433
Yes.

349
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,708
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

350
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,275
What do you expect me to do?

351
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,416
Pass out every time Alan
puts his arms around me?

352
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,915
No, you don't have to pass out.

353
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,055
But there won't be many more
opportunities like the picnic tonight.

354
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,520
It seems to me you could at least...

355
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,851
What?

356
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,493
Nothing!

357
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,490
That dress is to be worn
only to parties. Do you understand?

358
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,862
I don't want to have to remind you.

359
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,361
And another thing...

360
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,507
...I want you to stop picking on
Millie all the time!

361
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,580
Poor darling.

362
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,993
Oh, don't.

363
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,898
Do you love Millie more than me?

364
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,904
Madge, of course not.

365
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,611
But sometimes you act like you did.

366
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,247
Don't say things like that.

367
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,382
Listen to me.

368
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,582
When you were born...

369
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,079
...we didn't know how to
hold in our joy.

370
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,183
We laughed...

371
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,326
...and we cried.

372
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,155
We planted that elm tree
in the back yard.

373
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,435
When you got older, your father
carried you on his shoulder...

374
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,197
...for all the neighborhood to see.

375
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,138
And when Millie came...

376
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,635
...it was different.

377
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,044
Your father wasn't home
a lot of the time.

378
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,518
He'd found other things.

379
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,986
Then he walked out of the house
and never came back.

380
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,755
If I ever seem to favor Millie...

381
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,796
...maybe it's because I want
to make it up to her.

382
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,896
All those golden years you had
and she didn't.

383
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,914
I was just remembering you at school.

384
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,814
How you always
had things under control.

385
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,921
Who, me?

386
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,549
You never cut classes...

387
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,355
...understood the lectures...

388
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,789
...took notes.

389
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,995
The hero of the campus,
and he envied me.

390
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,136
Yeah. Big hero.

391
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,602
Between the goal posts.

392
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,975
It finally happened, kid.

393
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,442
Your father?

394
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,751
He went on his last bender.

395
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,251
The police scraped him up
off the sidewalk.

396
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,084
He died in jail.

397
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,151
I'm sorry to hear that, Hal.

398
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,564
You wanted to see them.

399
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,200
There they are!

400
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,946
Mr. Benson!

401
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,778
Hello, Mike!

402
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,584
You're not working today?

403
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,622
Have to. Got a backlog.

404
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,787
Come on.

405
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,592
They're loading.

406
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,598
What do you say, Red?

407
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,137
Hello, Alan.

408
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,007
The wheat comes down
through that spout.

409
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,771
All the way from the top.

410
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,084
- It must come down like a ton of...
- It does. Come on.

411
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,022
- I'll give you a hand, Red.
- Thanks. I can use a hand.

412
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,859
Tie it up good, now.

413
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,962
If these things ever get loose,
they can be mean.

414
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,133
I worked with the boys here one summer.
I was a wheat scooper.

415
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,198
No kidding.

416
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,132
Dad wanted me to learn the business
from the bottom up.

417
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,033
I guess that'll hold it.

418
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,203
- All set?
- Okay, ready to go.

419
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,505
Watch this.
I'll push a button.

420
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,022
Hey, Hart!
How you doing, Charlie?

421
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,558
What's this thing?

422
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,323
It's the man-lift.

423
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,996
Go on! Get on it.

424
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,762
Go on! Don't be afraid.

425
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,139
This is great!

426
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,243
Watch your head.

427
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,192
- You own all these?
- The corporation does.

428
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,422
That one too?

429
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,465
That's their newest one.
That holds 10 million bushels.

430
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,364
That's a lot of biscuits.

431
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,537
You know...

432
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,775
...what I was hoping was that...

433
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,770
...you and your old man...

434
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,236
...between you might be able to
fix me up with a job.

435
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,915
Sure.

436
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,878
These companies can always use men.

437
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,144
I'm sure Dad can do something.

438
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,787
Maybe...

439
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,751
...something in a nice office
where I can wear a tie...

440
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,690
...have a sweet little secretary.

441
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,760
And talk over the telephone...

442
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,700
...about enterprises...

443
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,470
...and things.

444
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,508
I got to get someplace in this world.
I just got to.

445
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,443
Sure.

446
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,112
But...

447
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,850
...before you get to be president
of the company, you'll have to be...

448
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,247
...a little patient.

449
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,422
That's something I gotta learn.

450
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,650
Patience!

451
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,796
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

452
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,432
We're going swimming.

453
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,864
- With a couple of girls.
- A couple of girls?

454
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,800
Wait till you see mine.
She is unbelievable!

455
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,167
I know. Her name's Madge.

456
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,529
Absolutely and positively
the cutest thing I ever saw.

457
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,400
He's all right.

458
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,975
All right?

459
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,581
lmagine him on a cold and rainy night.

460
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,514
He's going to the picnic with Alan,
and he's taking me.

461
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,482
He's taking you?

462
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,359
After the picnic tonight...

463
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,589
...let's get away from the others.

464
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,529
All right.

465
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,671
We'll take a boat out on the river.

466
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,944
Come on, kid.
Let's show them how to swim!

467
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,610
On your mark, get set...

468
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,077
...go!

469
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,084
"Come on, kid.
Let's show them how to swim."

470
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,456
Big shot!

471
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:04,717
Bomber, don't be forever a creep.

472
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,393
I want to find out something.

473
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,463
I want to find out if
you look real in the moonlight.

474
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,433
Don't say that.

475
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,632
Why not?

476
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,037
Because I'm real, all right.

477
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,611
It doesn't matter
whether you are or not.

478
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,177
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

479
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,170
What's on your mind?

480
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:57,144
I don't know if it's a good idea,
me going on this picnic.

481
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,347
Why not?

482
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,016
You're taking Millie.

483
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,546
I've never been on a picnic.

484
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,087
What are you talking about?

485
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,816
Everybody's been on a picnic.

486
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,255
Yeah? Not me.

487
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,951
When I was a kid,
I was too busy...

488
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,326
...shooting craps
or stealing milk bottles.

489
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,067
You went on the steak fries
in the fraternity, didn't you?

490
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,505
And you know what
they turned out to be.

491
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,001
This picnic won't be that primitive.

492
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,337
How do you talk to boys?

493
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,376
Why, you just talk, silly.

494
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,218
How do you think of things to say?

495
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,557
You just say whatever
comes into your head.

496
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,593
Supposing nothing ever
comes into my head?

497
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,358
Why ask me all the questions?

498
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,003
You're supposed to be
the smart one.

499
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,902
What do you think of her?

500
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,166
Who?

501
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,568
My girl!

502
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,579
Not bad.

503
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,711
Not bad?

504
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,149
She's the prettiest girl in town.

505
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,813
I bet you they announce tonight
she's going to be Queen of Neewollah!

506
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,681
Nee-what-a?

507
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,020
Neewollah!

508
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,401
It's Halloween spelled backwards.

509
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,800
They have this big
coronation ceremony every year.

510
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,840
Madge should have been Queen
last year. She had 400 votes.

511
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,534
- Only this other jerk...
- Stop it!

512
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,076
- What have we been talking about?
- I don't know.

513
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,209
Get away from this wall.
You're liable to get educated.

514
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,023
Millie, stop it!

515
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,989
I can't see anything.

516
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,528
We brought home your wayward girl.

517
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,966
Welcome back, Irma. Rosemary
told me you've been in New York.

518
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,699
Whatever she says,
I didn't disgrace myself.

519
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,037
Mrs. Owens, this is
Christine Schoenwalder.

520
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,148
She's taking Mabel Fremont's
place this year.

521
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,215
In Feminine Hygiene.

522
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,148
I'm delighted to know you, Christine.

523
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,214
Howard phoned.

524
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,088
He did?

525
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,129
How do I look?
Now tell me the truth.

526
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,097
You look very nice.

527
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,039
Feel sort of funny, though.

528
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,401
You think he'll like me?

529
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,908
I don't really care anyway.
I just wonder.

530
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,539
Bye!

531
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,922
You better hurry if you're going
to change. Howard'll be here soon.

532
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,454
Shoot!

533
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:57,389
It doesn't take me any time
to dress for Howard.

534
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,833
Hey, Hal! Here.

535
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,167
Try this.

536
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,904
Can you imagine that?
Alan's brought two cars!

537
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,105
Here's your date, Millie.

538
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,309
Hey, kid! Look at you!

539
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,549
I've decided to go along too.

540
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,281
My best girl!

541
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,428
Romeo, you've met Mrs. Owens too,
you know.

542
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,859
Oh, sure. She's the mother.

543
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,995
I'm coming too, Rosemary.

544
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,034
This is Miss Rosemary Sydney.

545
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,467
Miss Sydney teaches
in the high school.

546
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,039
I'm an old maid schoolteacher.

547
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,768
I have every respect
for schoolteachers, ma'am.

548
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,812
It's a lot of hard work
and not much pay.

549
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,044
If the men will take
the baskets out to the cars...

550
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,812
And there's a big tub of ice,
but I don't think...

551
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,318
I'll handle that, ma'am.

552
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,854
I'll help.

553
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,321
Be careful. It's very heavy.

554
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,656
Here we go.

555
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,525
Look at him!
He carries that old washtub...

556
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,667
...as if it was
so much tissue paper.

557
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,599
Here, let me help.

558
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,837
It's him!

559
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,501
Who?

560
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,484
It's Howard.

561
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,213
If he's been drinking,
I'm not going with him.

562
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,650
Hold it, Hal.

563
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,157
I want you to meet Howard Bevans.
Hal Carter.

564
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,350
Pleased to meet you, sir.

565
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,155
Same here.

566
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,260
Hey, Millie's a good-looking
little lady.

567
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,867
I never realized that before.

568
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,366
He's right, kid!

569
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,370
I've been telling her that
for years.

570
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,605
- Is there anything else, ma'am?
- Thermoses.

571
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,508
Thermoses, coming up.

572
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,874
Howard, I'm going along too.

573
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,382
That's fine.

574
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,986
Howdy, ladies.

575
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,323
Alan, I think you better
hurry Madge up.

576
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,588
Say, Delilah?

577
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,821
- Go on up.
- Coming.

578
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,228
You sure look nice, Rosemary.

579
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,065
It seems to me you might at least
have left your coat on.

580
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,640
It's still too darn hot...

581
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,002
...even if it is September.

582
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,140
How are things across the river?

583
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,579
Business is fine.

584
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,482
Back to school.
Everybody's buying.

585
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,685
Bride and groom!

586
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,260
Everybody look. Bride and groom!

587
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,336
It's a picnic.
Why did you wear that dress?

588
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,271
I don't know, Mom.

589
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,737
I just put it on.

590
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,284
I never could wear
another fellow's clothes.

591
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,787
I'm kind of beefy
through the shoulders.

592
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,691
I should have all
my clothes tailor-made.

593
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,920
Nobody'd mind if you took it off.

594
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,531
Yeah, look at me. Eh, Rosemary?

595
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,841
Nothing like being loose.

596
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,106
We'd better hurry.
All the tables will be taken.

597
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,512
- I'll race you to the car.
- Roger.

598
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,113
On your marks.

599
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,548
Get set.

600
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,913
Go!

601
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,688
Ready?

602
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,595
See you there!

603
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,054
How did a boy like that
ever get into college?

604
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,790
On a football scholarship.

605
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,898
But he was in your fraternity.

606
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,864
Don't those boys...

607
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,267
...have a little more breeding?

608
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,004
Maybe.

609
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,580
But fraternities like to
pledge big athletes.

610
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,908
Hal could have been an all-American.

611
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,547
If he'd only studied.

612
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,453
He flunked out his third year.

613
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,487
And on this farm he had some pigs

614
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,023
E-l-E-l-O

615
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,024
With an oink- oink here
And an oink- oink there

616
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,891
Here an oink, there an oink
Oink- oink everywhere!

617
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,563
Old MacDonald had a farm

618
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,395
E-l-E-l-O

619
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,396
Here's one my old man taught me.

620
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,371
Old MacDonald had a farm

621
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,168
E-l-E-l-O

622
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,009
At first, I couldn't stand...

623
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,478
...the way he bragged
and swaggered either.

624
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,208
Then we shared a room,
and I got to know him better.

625
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,350
Is he wild?

626
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,015
Not really.

627
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,994
Does he drink?

628
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,495
A little.

629
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,289
After all, Millie's only a child!

630
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,864
Now, Flo.

631
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,162
Don't be an old poke.

632
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:44,201
A picnic isn't a picnic
without a little drink.

633
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,739
Put that bottle down
where you found it.

634
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,778
Old poke!

635
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,554
What if somebody saw us
from the school board?

636
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,022
I'd lose my job.

637
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,925
Honey, why do you think
I drove down this street?

638
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,432
There isn't a soul in sight.

639
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,641
Come on, honey. Be a sport.

640
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,369
Have one little one.

641
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,241
Just for me.

642
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,883
If I have one,
will you stop coaxing?

643
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,524
Just the same, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

644
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,887
Oh, kids!
That looks like a lovely spot.

645
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,323
Yes! That's just fine.

646
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,030
That's enough of you kids.

647
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,003
That's all the swan boat will hold.

648
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,864
Going to run all night
Going to run all day

649
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,422
Dancing tonight will begin
at 8:00.

650
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,865
The music will be provided by
Ernie Higgins and His Happiness Boys.

651
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,086
Don't overdo it!

652
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,805
I hear

653
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:41,569
The gentle voices calling

654
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,575
We are putting in the haystack...

655
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,840
...$125...

656
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,608
...in nickels, dimes and quarters.

657
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,995
All the world is sad and dreary

658
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,831
Everywhere I roam

659
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,112
Attention, everybody! Attention!

660
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,910
A child has been found.

661
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,213
He says he has no name.

662
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,256
Anyone missing
a child with no name...

663
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,757
...can claim him here
at the pavilion.

664
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,658
Get your partners
for the trained-seal game.

665
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,169
No, ladies.
You've got to have a man.

666
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,962
I've got one!

667
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,530
I'll get my pants dirty.

668
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,302
Now, Howard, we're going to play.
Kneel down!

669
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,809
The object of the game...
Men, put your hands behind your back.

670
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,949
Ladies with the jar rings,
ring the lollipop sticks...

671
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,584
...in the fellow's mouth.

672
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,820
Hal! Catch it!

673
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:08,495
While my little one

674
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:14,028
While my pretty one...

675
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,666
...sleeps

676
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,244
Faster!

677
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,311
Go on!

678
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:28,679
Come back here!

679
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,357
And it is proper...

680
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,295
...that this holiday
known as Labor Day...

681
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,695
...be set aside...

682
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,835
Hey, Hal, look at the mutt!

683
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,410
That dog ate up our food.

684
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,609
No, no!
Leave room for the cake.

685
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,690
I've never had so much fun
since Grandma caught...

686
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,294
Since ever.

687
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,028
How about it, kid?

688
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,893
We'd have won that
three-legged race if I hadn't...

689
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,226
...let you down.

690
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,871
Millie doesn't go in much for sports.
She cultivates her mind.

691
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,898
I wasn't taking anything
from her there, ma'am.

692
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,133
She's got a...

693
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,039
...splendid mind.

694
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,547
Come on, both of you!
Cut it out!

695
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,450
You ought to come to Halster someday
and see my shop.

696
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,555
Notions, novelties, school supplies.

697
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,383
You too, Alan.

698
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,618
It's right across the big river.

699
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,724
We'll be over, sir...

700
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,398
...as soon as we can fit it
in our schedule.

701
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,830
You can't miss it.
The store right next to the bank.

702
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,765
I live right upstairs.

703
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:59,169
Only one big room, but it's big
enough for me and my 21 -inch TV.

704
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,973
Where did you ever get those boots?

705
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,080
My old man left them to me
when he died.

706
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,742
He had a very big foot.

707
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,545
Is that all he left you?
Just a pair of boots?

708
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,588
He used to sit on
the bed at night and I'd...

709
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,384
...tug them off him.

710
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,729
And he'd say:

711
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,359
"Son...

712
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,262
...the man of the house has
got to have a pair of boots...

713
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,165
...because he's got to do
a lot of kicking."

714
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,809
Then he said:

715
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,309
"Son...

716
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,816
...there'll be times
when all you've got...

717
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,714
...to be proud of is
the fact that you're a man.

718
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,084
So wear boots so people know you're
coming, and double your fists up...

719
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,953
...so they know you mean business
when you get there."

720
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,318
My old man, he was a corker.

721
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,622
Hal's shy of people
before he meets them...

722
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,460
...and then you can't keep him still.

723
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,403
What line of business you in, son?

724
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,902
I'm about to...

725
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,338
...enter the grain business, sir.

726
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,078
You see...

727
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:16,415
...my old man was no aristocratic
millionaire or anything, but he had...

728
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,453
...some very important friends.

729
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,190
Some very big people...

730
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,881
...in their own way.

731
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,552
And one of them was
always after me...

732
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,095
...to take this position with the...

733
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,164
...oil company down in Texas and...

734
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,462
Dad and I found a place
for Hal scooping wheat.

735
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,864
Yeah, I've decided to
start from the very bottom.

736
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,878
I sure do appreciate Alan
and his old...

737
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,775
...his old father...

738
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,975
...giving me this opportunity.

739
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,089
A young man coming to town
has got to be a good mixer.

740
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,929
Wouldn't it be nice if he could join
the country club and play golf?

741
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,224
He won't be able to afford that.

742
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,969
The bowling team's a rowdy gang.

743
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,698
There's a young man's Bible class
at the Baptist church.

744
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,541
I learned something today.

745
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,547
And it's that there comes a time
in a man's life...

746
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,243
...when he's got to quit
rolling around like a pinball.

747
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,055
Maybe...

748
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,623
...a little town like this is...

749
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,860
...the place to settle down.

750
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,729
Where people are...

751
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,934
...easygoing and...

752
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,863
...sincere.

753
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:42,935
Hi.

754
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,332
Hi.

755
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:02,852
I'm sorry.

756
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,029
Look, watermelon!

757
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:36,622
In thy dark eyes' splendor

758
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:43,298
Where the warm light
Loves to dwell

759
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:49,204
Weary looks
Yet tender

760
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:55,043
Speak their fond farewell

761
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,249
A day like this reminds me of...

762
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,219
...when I was a girl.

763
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,758
Things I haven't thought about
in a long...

764
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,591
...long time.

765
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,164
Now, Helen.

766
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,325
Flo...

767
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:26,034
...you'll never know what it's meant
to have you next door to me.

768
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,210
Watching your two girls grow up.

769
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,175
It's made it easier.

770
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,747
Now, Helen.

771
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,115
Where is everybody?

772
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,788
Don't you remember, Flo?

773
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,858
At a picnic...

774
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,528
...everybody disappears.

775
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,165
Look at that sunset, Howard.

776
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,769
A sunset's a beautiful thing,
all right.

777
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:04,708
It's like the daytime
didn't want to end, isn't it?

778
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,881
It's like the daytime was going to
put up a big scrap.

779
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,886
Set the world on fire...

780
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,987
...to keep the nighttime
from creeping on.

781
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,477
Hey, kid!

782
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,410
It's me!

783
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,075
I had a job as a model once.

784
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,685
Like this.

785
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:49,286
They had me posing in front of
a class, almost raw.

786
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:57,157
I sure do admire people
who are artistic.

787
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,099
I just like to draw.

788
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,662
People who draw...

789
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,440
...read books...

790
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,535
...listen to the...

791
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,707
...better music...

792
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,420
I used to go with a girl
who read books.

793
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,380
She joined the...

794
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,148
...Book-of-the-Month Club...

795
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,560
...and they had her reading books
all the time.

796
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,592
She'd no more finish one,
and they'd shoot her another.

797
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,370
Last summer I memorized
all of Shakespeare's sonnets.

798
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,409
No kidding?

799
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,126
You're thinking about your father,
aren't you?

800
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,101
I was thinking how impressed
he'll be when he reads you were...

801
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,101
...picked as
Queen of Neewollah tonight.

802
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,536
But they haven't picked me yet.

803
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,732
Besides...

804
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,871
...l'm sure he thinks
the whole thing is silly.

805
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,073
No, you don't know him.

806
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,953
He's always impressed by
people who win things...

807
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,687
...or make the most money...

808
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,425
...or score the most points
at a football game.

809
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,866
I write poetry myself.

810
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:49,776
I've written poems I've never
shown to a living soul.

811
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,584
Kid, I think you must be
some sort of a genius.

812
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,145
We're all going down to the dock
in a minute. Now remember!

813
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,826
Aren't you excited?

814
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:20,268
Millie won't be shocked
to see somebody take a drink.

815
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,030
- Are you, Millie?
- Gosh, no.

816
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,555
One more drink won't hurt you, honey.

817
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:48,086
I guess I know why you want me
to keep on drinking.

818
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,459
Now, honey, that's not so.

819
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,777
Ladies and gentlemen...

820
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,141
...the moment we have been
waiting for has arrived.

821
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,738
Is she the Queen?

822
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,475
I bet she is.

823
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,988
On October 31 st, next Halloween...

824
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:16,090
...we will crown our
Queen of Neewollah.

825
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,784
She has not yet
reached our shores, but...

826
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,395
Wait a minute!

827
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,096
Here she comes now!

828
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,864
It's Madge.
I'll bet you anything.

829
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,404
No kidding?

830
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:43,852
Neewollah

831
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,746
Ain't she sweet

832
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,013
See her coming down the street

833
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,783
Now I ask you very confidentially

834
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,516
Ain't she sweet

835
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,589
Ain't she nice

836
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,764
Look her over once or twice

837
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,331
Now I ask you very confidentially

838
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,592
Ain't she nice

839
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,929
Just cast an eye

840
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,003
In her direction

841
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,174
Oh, me
Oh, my

842
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,343
Ain't that perfection

843
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,373
Shoot!

844
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,241
When I was a girl I was
just as good-looking as she is.

845
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,135
You know...

846
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,966
...I look forward to seeing her
every time I go to the Owens' house.

847
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,647
But I tell myself,
"Howard, old boy...

848
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,645
...you look all you want...

849
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,148
...but you couldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole."

850
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,455
Welcome to our shores...

851
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,217
...Your Majesty!

852
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,432
Ladies and gentlemen...

853
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,728
...the new Queen...

854
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,802
...Madge Owens!

855
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,837
Speech!

856
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,712
Thank you.

857
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,304
I'm very proud...

858
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,380
...and I'll try hard
to be a good Queen.

859
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,718
And I'll try hardest of all
not to get conceited.

860
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,263
No, Your Majesty!

861
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,767
The president's first.

862
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,372
Don't you worry, Mr. Benson.

863
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,940
We'll not leave you out.

864
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,847
Land! I love that music!

865
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:34,887
Dance with me.

866
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,752
Honey, I'm no good at dancing.

867
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,484
That's just what you men say
to get out of it.

868
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,630
We'll show you we can do without them.

869
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,765
Won't we, Millie? Come on.

870
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,694
All right, but...

871
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,870
Well, I got to lead.

872
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,709
Mr. President, could I see you
just a moment, please?

873
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,039
Excuse me.

874
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,488
Where's Mrs. Johnson?
I've got to return this cape.

875
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,787
- Excuse me a minute, Mom.
- All right, darling.

876
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,724
See how Millie is.

877
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,824
Stop it!

878
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:48,921
- I thought we were doing very nicely.
- You think you're so funny.

879
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,001
Hey, kid, dance with me.

880
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,171
I never dance with boys.

881
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,739
Sure you can. All you have to do
is follow the steps.

882
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:05,672
Here's the cape, Mrs. Johnson.
All safe and sound.

883
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,129
More!

884
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,459
I'll show you a step I learned in L.A.

885
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,130
Now watch this.

886
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,931
First you've got to set the rhythm.

887
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:09,941
I wish I could do it.

888
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,679
Aren't they graceful?

889
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,541
You used to dance like that, Flo.

890
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,624
Why can't you dance that way?

891
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,633
Honey, I'm a businessman.

892
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:27,971
One night I went dancing
at a big valentine party.

893
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,672
I danced so hard I swooned.

894
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,643
That's when they called me
the dancing fool.

895
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,249
Mighty pretty legs.

896
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,388
That's just like you men.

897
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:44,320
Can't talk about anything
but women's legs.

898
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,488
I just noticed their nice shape.

899
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:48,356
How'd you like it if we women...

900
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,397
...went around talking about
your legs all the time?

901
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,794
All right.

902
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,627
There's my legs.

903
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,539
I never saw anything so ugly.

904
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,381
Young man, let's see your legs.

905
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,311
New rule tonight.
Every man's got to show his legs.

906
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,680
Come on. The other one too.

907
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,083
Let him alone.
He's dancing with Madge.

908
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,656
It's his turn to dance with me.

909
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,056
I may be an old maid schoolteacher,
but I can keep up with you.

910
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,559
Come on, ride 'em, cowboy!

911
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:22,628
But, ma'am, I...

912
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,326
Used to have a boyfriend
was a cowboy.

913
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,929
Met him in Colorado.

914
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,572
He was in love with me
because I was...

915
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,709
...an older woman and had some sense.

916
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,139
Sorry.

917
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:40,237
He took me up in the mountains
one night...

918
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,848
...and wanted to marry me.

919
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,383
Right there on the mountaintop.

920
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:49,456
He said the stars would be our preacher
and the moon our best man.

921
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,084
Did you ever hear such talk?

922
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,559
You know what?

923
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:01,531
You remind me of one
of those old statues.

924
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,772
One of those Roman gladiators.

925
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,340
All they had on was a shield.

926
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,041
My, those ancient people
were depraved!

927
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,807
- I don't think I can dance.
- I can keep up with you.

928
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,574
Please, I want to dance.

929
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,308
Please, I gotta dance!

930
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,132
He was dancing with Madge.
Let them alone.

931
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,697
They're young people.

932
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,163
Young?

933
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,859
What do you mean?

934
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:42,870
I'm sick.

935
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,949
I just want to die!

936
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,114
Here, Millie.

937
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,218
Over here, darling.

938
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,518
I hate you!

939
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,658
Madge is the pretty one!

940
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,350
Madge is the pretty one!

941
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,692
What did she have to do that for?

942
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,025
I guess that's something wonderful.

943
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,531
Young!

944
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,970
How much do you suppose
the little dickens...?

945
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,298
I want to know who fed
liquor to Millie!

946
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,439
He did, Mrs. Owens!
It's all his fault!

947
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,311
Wait a minute.

948
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,115
Millie was your date.
You should've been looking after her.

949
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,808
But you were too busy
making eyes at Madge.

950
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,585
The boy didn't do anything.

951
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,021
You've been stomping around in
those boots like you owned the place.

952
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,128
Thinking every woman you saw
was gonna fall madly in love.

953
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,094
Here's one woman
didn't pay you any mind!

954
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,101
Bragging about your father!

955
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,463
I bet he wasn't
any better than you are.

956
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:45,071
Strutting around here
like some crummy Apollo!

957
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,935
You think, because you act young...

958
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,975
...you can walk in here and
make off with whatever you like.

959
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,148
Let me tell you something.

960
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,414
You're a fake!

961
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,145
You're no jive kid.
You're just scared to act your age!

962
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,721
Buy yourself a mirror
and take a look in it.

963
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,892
It won't be long before
you're counting the gray hairs...

964
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,960
...if you've got any left!
And what'll become of you then?

965
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,097
You'll end your life in the gutter,
and it'll serve you right!

966
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,564
The gutter's where you came from,
and the gutter's where you belong!

967
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,166
Shut your mouth!

968
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:27,814
Turn that off!

969
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,113
This isn't a sideshow!

970
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,980
Go on now. Come on!

971
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,848
Go on about your business!

972
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,583
Go on about your business!

973
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,282
Get out of here!

974
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,587
Turn out that light, I said!

975
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,523
What happened, Hal?

976
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,797
Answer me.
What did you do?!

977
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,036
Same old Hal!

978
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,242
I'm sorry, Mrs. Owens.

979
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,643
I should have known better
than to trust him.

980
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,759
There's to be no more drinking!

981
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,323
It was my fault, Mrs. Owens.

982
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,929
I brought the whiskey.

983
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,967
Alan, come and help me with Millie.

984
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,744
What made me do it, Howard?

985
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,752
What made me act that way?

986
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,254
Maybe it's...

987
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,232
...the harvest moon, honey.

988
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,233
I wanted to have
a good time tonight, Howard.

989
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,769
This is my last night of vacation.

990
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,100
Maybe we should go for a ride, honey.

991
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,336
Yes!

992
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,246
Yes, let's.

993
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,745
I want to have a good time!

994
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,113
I want to have a good time!

995
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,104
Beat it, baby!
I'm in a bad mood.

996
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,274
Please wait a minute.

997
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,678
Alan shouldn't have talked
that way to you.

998
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,172
I said, beat it!

999
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,121
Okay, baby, you asked for it!

1000
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:27,990
Okay, go on home.

1001
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,859
Tell them anything you want.
Thank Benson for his shirt.

1002
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:34,558
- What are you going to do?
- There'll be a freight here soon.

1003
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,492
Women like Miss Sydney make me mad
at the whole female sex.

1004
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,533
What's the use, baby?

1005
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,430
I'm a bum.

1006
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,838
She saw through me
like an x-ray machine.

1007
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,102
There's no place in the world
for a guy like me.

1008
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,210
But there's got to be.

1009
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,505
Don't pay any attention to her.

1010
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,444
You are young.

1011
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,786
Yes, you are.

1012
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,979
But not so young you're not a man too.

1013
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,853
And you're very entertaining.

1014
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,593
I think you say
all sorts of witty things.

1015
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,497
I just love listening to your talk.

1016
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,095
And you're a wonderful dancer.

1017
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:45,767
Thanks.

1018
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:49,075
I can tell a lot about a man
by dancing with him.

1019
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,042
You know, some boys...

1020
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,737
...when they take a girl
in their arms to dance...

1021
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,914
...they make her feel
sort of uncomfortable.

1022
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,687
But with you...

1023
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,084
...I had the feeling you knew
exactly what you were doing.

1024
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,753
And I could follow you
every step of the way.

1025
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,425
You've got lots of qualities.

1026
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,965
Let me level with you, baby.

1027
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,671
When I was 14,
I spent a year in jail.

1028
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,200
Honest?

1029
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:23,009
Called it a reform school.
Let me tell you, it was a jail!

1030
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,740
For what?

1031
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,411
I stole another guy's motorcycle.

1032
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,251
I stole it because I wanted to get...

1033
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,719
...so far away so fast,
nobody would ever catch me.

1034
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,586
Everybody feels that way sometimes.

1035
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,757
Then my old lady
went to the authorities.

1036
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,398
"I've done everything I can
with the boy.

1037
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,729
I can't do anything more."

1038
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:53,869
So off I go to that
lousy, stinking place!

1039
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,872
When I finally get out...

1040
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,040
...the old lady's sorry
to see me back...

1041
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,946
...because my dad's loaded
all the time.

1042
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,582
And she's got a new boyfriend...

1043
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,488
...and I'm in the way.

1044
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,428
It's awful when parents
don't get along.

1045
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:21,360
Well, there you are!

1046
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,336
And I never told that
to another soul.

1047
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,708
If you wanna faint
or get sick or go home...

1048
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,535
...go on, because I won't...

1049
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,554
Baby, what did you do?

1050
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:47,124
I get so tired
of just being told I'm pretty.

1051
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,412
The others!
We've got to get back to the picnic.

1052
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:20,891
Do we?

1053
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,478
Here we are,
back where we started from.

1054
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,285
Everybody else must be home hours.

1055
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,788
I'm glad we went off.

1056
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,625
Good night, Rosemary.

1057
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:37,796
I should say, "Good morning."

1058
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,564
Where are you going, Howard?

1059
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,834
Why, home, honey.

1060
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,911
You can't go off without me.

1061
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,316
Not after tonight.

1062
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,916
Take me with you.

1063
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:56,249
Honey, be reasonable.
What would people say?

1064
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,451
People?

1065
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,727
What do they say
if I thumb my nose at them...

1066
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:03,056
...or if I showed my pink panties
on the street?

1067
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,062
What do I care what people say?

1068
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,127
Look, honey.

1069
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,963
You'd better go inside
and get some sleep.

1070
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,769
You got to start school
in the morning.

1071
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,310
Can't we talk this over on Saturday?

1072
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,542
Maybe you won't be back Saturday.

1073
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,549
You know better than that.

1074
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,989
Maybe you won't be back ever again.

1075
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,896
You're not yourself tonight.

1076
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,826
Yes, I am.

1077
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,699
I'm more myself than I ever was.

1078
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,899
I see what's in store for me.

1079
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,065
After you...

1080
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,038
...someone else...

1081
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,234
...then...

1082
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,179
...someone else.

1083
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:55,644
Then...

1084
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:56,873
Take me with you.

1085
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,918
If you don't, I don't know
what I'll do. I mean it.

1086
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,523
When we first started
to go together...

1087
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,556
...you were the best sport
I ever saw.

1088
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,424
Always good for a laugh.

1089
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,694
I can't laugh anymore.

1090
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,562
You said you'd marry me
after my vacation.

1091
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,333
You said you'd be waiting
with the preacher.

1092
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,910
- I've had a busy summer.
- Where's the preacher?

1093
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,783
I'm not a boy anymore.

1094
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,985
A person forms
certain ways of living.

1095
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,659
And one day it's too late to change.

1096
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:48,195
I'm no spring chicken either.

1097
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,939
Maybe I'm a little older
than you think.

1098
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,702
My ways are formed too.

1099
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:58,741
But they can be changed.

1100
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,449
They got to be changed.

1101
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,644
It's no good living like this...

1102
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,018
...in rented rooms...

1103
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,458
...meeting a bunch of old maids
for supper every night...

1104
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,191
...then coming back home...

1105
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:21,727
...alone.

1106
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:29,508
Each year I keep telling myself
it's the last.

1107
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,676
Something will happen.

1108
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:36,446
Nothing ever does.

1109
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,717
Except I get a little crazier
all the time.

1110
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,553
- Well...
- A well's a hole in the ground!

1111
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,918
I wasn't trying to be funny.

1112
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,162
Can't we talk this over
on Saturday?

1113
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,098
I'm dead tired.

1114
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,205
I got a busy week ahead of me.

1115
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:05,003
You got to marry me.

1116
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,474
I can't marry you now.

1117
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,776
You can be over in the morning.

1118
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,429
No.

1119
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,863
I'm not going to marry
anyone who says:

1120
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:34,405
"You've got to marry me, Howard."

1121
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,108
I mean, the thing is...

1122
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,277
If a woman wants me to marry her...

1123
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:44,350
...she can at least say, "Please."

1124
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,486
Please...

1125
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,589
...marry me, Howard.

1126
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:54,984
Please!

1127
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,735
Come on inside.

1128
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,339
Now go to bed and
get some sleep.

1129
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,779
I'll drive over in the morning.

1130
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,344
Maybe we can talk it over.

1131
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,117
Don't come unless you're
taking me away.

1132
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,488
Please marry me, Howard.

1133
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,349
Please.

1134
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:29,021
Go to bed.
Get some sleep.

1135
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:34,599
Please?

1136
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,940
How will you get in?

1137
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,716
The kitchen door is always open.

1138
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,417
Are you all right, baby?

1139
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,428
Yes, I'm all right.

1140
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,692
If I thought I'd done anything...

1141
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,493
...to make you unhappy...

1142
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,469
...l'd almost want to die.

1143
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:49,609
Yes, Mama.

1144
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,745
I'm coming.

1145
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,713
You'd better go.

1146
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,322
I'll take the car back
to Benson's house.

1147
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,161
I didn't even think of him
until this second.

1148
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,702
I ought to be shot at sunrise.

1149
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:20,132
I guess neither of us
thought too much about anything.

1150
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:25,641
Good night.

1151
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,438
When will I see you?

1152
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,674
I don't know.

1153
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,918
What time are you through
at the dime store?

1154
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:35,615
Six.

1155
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,121
Maybe I could come by then.

1156
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,793
I start a job tomorrow.

1157
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:52,303
Maybe not with Benson.

1158
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:55,374
Someplace.

1159
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,409
You don't mind...

1160
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,584
...seeing a guy who's...

1161
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,643
...just a grain scooper, do you?

1162
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,616
Of course not.

1163
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,198
Baby, would you...

1164
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,596
...kiss me good night?

1165
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,463
No.

1166
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,561
Just once for...

1167
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,502
...for luck maybe, huh?

1168
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:30,801
If I promise not to hold you?

1169
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,639
Are you trying to punish me?

1170
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,685
Yes.

1171
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:47,418
I think I was trying to punish you.

1172
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,155
Kiss me, Hal.

1173
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:02,569
Being with you is wonderful, baby.

1174
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,344
You make me feel...

1175
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:07,913
...important.

1176
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,105
No!

1177
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,414
You make me feel...

1178
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,351
...patient.

1179
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,396
Do I?

1180
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:36,368
Don't kiss me anymore.

1181
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:38,477
Please don't kiss me anymore.

1182
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,124
It's all right.

1183
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:36,229
I put Mom to bed.

1184
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,706
I was awful tonight, wasn't I?

1185
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:56,245
Honest, I'm never gonna touch
another drink till the day I die.

1186
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:34,093
So far, no go.
We've notified the highway patrol.

1187
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:35,125
You've had hours!

1188
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,991
Can't we all go to bed
and worry about this tomorrow?

1189
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,793
- It's only a stolen car.
- It's not!

1190
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,629
Maybe he kidnapped Madge.

1191
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,839
Nobody kidnapped her.

1192
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:48,767
She's home.

1193
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,480
You got every right to be sore.

1194
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:54,841
I didn't start out to...

1195
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:58,280
You saw another pretty girl,
and you had to add her to your list.

1196
01:30:58,486 --> 01:30:59,783
It wasn't that way at all.

1197
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:02,182
- No matter what you think.
- You're a liar!

1198
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,560
You're the only friend I ever had.

1199
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,559
I'm not your friend anymore!

1200
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,097
Let me go, you bum!

1201
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,497
You no-good hobo!

1202
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,700
When I think...

1203
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,840
...how glad I was
to see you this morning.

1204
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,337
How glad I was!

1205
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:30,546
I want him arrested.
He stole my car.

1206
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,810
That's a lousy lie!
The car's outside.

1207
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,885
It doesn't matter.
He stole it!

1208
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,752
We'll book you for the night.

1209
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,823
You've got no place to sleep anyway.

1210
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:40,493
I'm not going to any jail!

1211
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:43,163
No damn jail, see?

1212
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,462
It wasn't the car.

1213
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:49,063
Tell him.

1214
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,266
Tell him it's not the car!
Tell him it's because of Madge!

1215
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,517
Thanks, kid.

1216
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,690
- Why don't you let him go?
- Nobody's going to push us.

1217
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,263
Let's go to bed, son.

1218
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,695
Don't pretend you're not
pleased about this.

1219
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,203
- What are you talking about?
- Madge and me!

1220
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:02,102
You wanted to break this up!

1221
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:06,747
Well, I'm gonna marry Madge.
Start getting used to the idea!

1222
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:13,047
I hope he gets away.

1223
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:51,655
Over here!

1224
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:53,520
He went over this way!

1225
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:24,051
You check the freight cars.
I'll search the riverbank.

1226
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:16,967
I have to have at least
one more easy chair.

1227
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:19,774
What about the closets?

1228
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,907
Barely enough room for my suits.

1229
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:30,320
Slipcovers, I suppose.

1230
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:35,019
That would have to go.

1231
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,596
No!

1232
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,249
What happened, son?

1233
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,722
I remember you...

1234
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:10,158
...saying you lived
next to the bank.

1235
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:13,424
- The cops didn't see me hit the river.
- Cops?

1236
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:18,331
I don't know.

1237
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:21,099
Benson said I stole his car.

1238
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:23,500
Please, sir. You got to help me.

1239
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:27,078
I have to spend the night someplace,
then get out of town.

1240
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:29,340
Get out of those and dry off.

1241
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:31,446
What happened was this...

1242
01:36:31,652 --> 01:36:33,017
You don't have to tell me.

1243
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:34,945
I understand.

1244
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,418
What we need is a drink.

1245
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:43,095
You've got your troubles,
and I've got mine.

1246
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,268
You got a rag?

1247
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:55,703
Sure.

1248
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:12,354
You went for that Owens girl,
didn't you?

1249
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:23,063
I'll admit they can get
under your skin.

1250
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,503
That doesn't mean we got
to take them too seriously.

1251
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:32,842
For instance...

1252
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:37,543
...you wouldn't say a man had to
go as far as marrying them.

1253
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,450
You wouldn't say a thing like that,
would you?

1254
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,661
You're not being very helpful.

1255
01:38:23,264 --> 01:38:25,027
Were you awake when she got in?

1256
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:26,824
No, Mom.

1257
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:30,828
Didn't she say anything
to you this morning?

1258
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,266
Nothing.

1259
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,039
She's still got her door locked.

1260
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:40,710
Have you been smoking?!

1261
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:42,107
Hi, Mrs. Potts!

1262
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:44,045
Is Madge all right?

1263
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:45,910
Certainly.

1264
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:48,450
She told me all about it.

1265
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:52,459
She got out of the car
and left that hoodlum alone.

1266
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,024
And she walked home.

1267
01:38:57,798 --> 01:39:00,426
- Has anyone seen Howard?
- Why, no.

1268
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:03,569
He said he might be over this morning.

1269
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:12,374
She's running around like a chicken
with its head off. Something's up.

1270
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:21,219
Is Rosemary ready?

1271
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:23,413
We promised the principal
we'd be there early...

1272
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,023
...to help with registration.

1273
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:27,656
All set for school again?

1274
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:29,461
Lovely picnic, wasn't it?

1275
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:30,857
Wasn't it?

1276
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,657
How's Madge?

1277
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,763
Just fine.

1278
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,906
Come on, Christine.
Let's get that sleepy girl out of bed.

1279
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:03,692
I gotta see Rosemary.

1280
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:05,931
I think she's expecting me.

1281
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:09,899
Holler at the bottom of the stairs.
The others are up there with her.

1282
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:13,303
The others?

1283
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,702
Miss Henderson and Schoenwalder.

1284
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:18,935
I gotta see her alone.
I gotta explain something to her.

1285
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:20,943
This is the beginning
of my busy season.

1286
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,776
I don't think I'll be able
to make any plans...

1287
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:24,916
It's Howard!

1288
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,016
He's come for me!

1289
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,748
You came back!

1290
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,553
Girls! Girls!

1291
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:37,321
Here's my man!

1292
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,465
What are you screaming
and yelling about?

1293
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,733
What's the matter with you?

1294
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:44,233
Hear the news!
Most exciting thing you ever heard.

1295
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,700
We're going to be married.

1296
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:47,769
Now! Today!

1297
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,609
Let me be the first!

1298
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:53,004
Don't worry.
It won't take me long.

1299
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,679
We'll help pack.

1300
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,316
Packing's almost finished.
I was keeping it a secret.

1301
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:58,712
Weren't we?

1302
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:00,546
Don't forget to wear something old.

1303
01:41:00,754 --> 01:41:01,584
Nylons!

1304
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:03,221
Something new.

1305
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:05,023
My new handbag!

1306
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:06,884
Something borrowed.

1307
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:08,423
Thank you!

1308
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:11,597
I don't see anything blue.

1309
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:14,030
And you ain't going to.

1310
01:41:14,668 --> 01:41:16,636
We'll put something funny
in her bag.

1311
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:18,429
Irma, you kill me!

1312
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:23,241
Congratulations.

1313
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:25,776
I know you'll be happy.
I want you to know...

1314
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:31,974
I called and called.
Why didn't you answer?

1315
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,583
Alan phoned.

1316
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:39,054
He said to tell you he's not angry.
He knows it wasn't your fault.

1317
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,521
And then he said...

1318
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:42,489
Let me get this straight.

1319
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:47,065
He said, "Tell Madge it's important.
I want to see her."

1320
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,927
Did you hear what I said?

1321
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:52,530
Yes.

1322
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,970
You ought to thank
your lucky stars, young lady.

1323
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:58,577
Come see this divine outfit!

1324
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,872
We need your approval.
Come on!

1325
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:06,577
Come help us with the bags.

1326
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,714
He's outside.

1327
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:14,022
He's hiding in my car.
The police are after him.

1328
01:42:14,228 --> 01:42:15,559
But he says he's got to see you.

1329
01:42:24,104 --> 01:42:25,662
Be careful.

1330
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:29,436
I got the rice! Let's go get
some paint. Mrs. Potts has some!

1331
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:35,841
Miss Sydney is getting married!

1332
01:42:36,049 --> 01:42:37,073
Who?

1333
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,784
Let's decorate the car!
Let's get some paint!

1334
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:48,286
Christine, get some rice.
Be ready. She'll be right out.

1335
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:55,092
I'm gonna cry.

1336
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:58,066
Imagine something like this
the first day of school!

1337
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:01,133
All the happiness in the world!

1338
01:43:01,441 --> 01:43:03,841
Howard, look!
The sun has come out.

1339
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:07,172
You would pick a wonderful day.
Let's go!

1340
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:17,920
You've been a wonderful friend.

1341
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,958
I wish you all kinds
of happiness, Rosemary.

1342
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:21,991
I mean...

1343
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,686
...Mrs. Bevans!

1344
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:27,895
Wait till we tell
the principal about this.

1345
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:29,796
Where's Madge?
Goodbye, Madge!

1346
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:31,796
Goodbye.

1347
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,133
And don't worry about
the room, Mrs. Owens.

1348
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:37,105
I know Miss Breckenridge will take it.

1349
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:39,236
And she's a darling girl.

1350
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:40,743
Yes, she sure is. Look!

1351
01:43:41,915 --> 01:43:43,246
We've still got to
pick up the license.

1352
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:44,781
I nearly forgot.

1353
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:48,250
I left my hot-water bottle
and my curlers in the bathroom.

1354
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:51,253
Would you store the rest
of my things in your attic?

1355
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:52,781
We'd better hurry.

1356
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:54,620
Where are we going?

1357
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:04,165
I got a cousin who has
a tourist camp in the Ozarks, but...

1358
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:07,306
- I love the Ozarks!
- Wonderful this time of year!

1359
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:10,101
I was there three years ago
for my vacation.

1360
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,572
Get ready.

1361
01:44:14,314 --> 01:44:16,646
Have a wonderful time!

1362
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:20,746
So long. You know what
you can tell the principal for me.

1363
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:27,916
Hey, kids!

1364
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:29,220
It's Miss Sydney!

1365
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:31,294
She's getting married.

1366
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:32,656
It's Howard Bevans!

1367
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:50,277
Hi, baby.

1368
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:54,217
I'm in a jam.

1369
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:55,351
Howard told me.

1370
01:44:55,989 --> 01:44:57,581
I just couldn't run out of town...

1371
01:44:57,791 --> 01:44:59,122
...and never see you again.

1372
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,025
Where are you going?

1373
01:45:02,195 --> 01:45:03,526
Tulsa.

1374
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:05,497
I always get a job...

1375
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:07,166
...Hotel Mayo.

1376
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:08,800
Bellhopping.

1377
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:12,369
Did you see what I put
on the back of the car?

1378
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,807
It's the young man!

1379
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:24,612
Don't blow your top.
I'm leaving town.

1380
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:25,681
Leaving?

1381
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:29,155
I thought you were going
to stay here and settle down.

1382
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,787
I thought so too, ma'am.

1383
01:45:35,762 --> 01:45:37,059
Aren't you gonna say goodbye?

1384
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,486
Goodbye.

1385
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:41,427
Are you mad at me?

1386
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:46,397
I gotta know how you feel.

1387
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:48,265
Last night I thought...

1388
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:50,276
...you liked me.

1389
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:52,543
I did like you.

1390
01:45:52,746 --> 01:45:54,611
I liked you from
the first time I saw you.

1391
01:45:54,815 --> 01:45:57,079
Are you out of your senses?

1392
01:46:00,887 --> 01:46:02,718
I've been thinking all night.

1393
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:05,618
I've never said this before,
because it...

1394
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:09,526
It'd make me seem like
such a freak, but...

1395
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:10,856
What?

1396
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:13,196
I love you, Madge.

1397
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,697
Do you hear?

1398
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:17,335
I want you in the house
this minute.

1399
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,029
Do you love me?

1400
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:20,297
Do you?

1401
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:24,071
I'll have the police
put you where you belong.

1402
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:26,939
If you please, ma'am.
I'm catching that freight.

1403
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:30,577
Meet me, baby.
We'll get married.

1404
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:35,109
They'll give me a room in the hotel
until we find something better.

1405
01:46:35,322 --> 01:46:36,482
Don't listen.

1406
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,715
I got a chance with you.

1407
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:42,326
It won't be bigtime,
but that isn't important, is it?

1408
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:45,130
Come on.

1409
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:46,557
Oh, Hal, I can't.

1410
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:47,993
Why?

1411
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:50,932
Don't you see why?
Don't you?

1412
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,530
Listen, baby...

1413
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:58,241
...you're the only real thing
I ever wanted.

1414
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,610
Ever. You're mine.

1415
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:04,511
I've got to claim what's mine, or
I'll be nothing as long as I live.

1416
01:47:10,323 --> 01:47:11,483
You love me.

1417
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:12,885
You know it.

1418
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:14,520
You love me.

1419
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,395
You love me!

1420
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,104
You liked him, didn't you, Helen?

1421
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:09,077
Yes, I did.

1422
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,510
I got so used to things
as they were.

1423
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,088
Everything so prim.

1424
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:18,482
The geranium in the window...

1425
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:21,354
...the smell of Mama's medicines.

1426
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:23,688
And then he walked in.

1427
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,995
And it was different.

1428
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:29,999
He clomped through the place
like he was still outdoors.

1429
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:32,768
There was a man in the house.

1430
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:35,100
And it seemed good.

1431
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:50,754
When I graduate from college,
I'm going to New York...

1432
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:54,984
...and write novels that'll shock people
right out of their senses.

1433
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:57,925
I'm never going to fall in love.
Not me.

1434
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:00,964
I'm not going to live
in some jerkwater town...

1435
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:05,263
...and marry some ornery guy
and raise a lot of grimy kids.

1436
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:11,767
But just because I'm a dope
doesn't mean you have to be.

1437
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:20,145
I was watching out the window
when he said goodbye.

1438
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:27,792
Go with him, Madge.

1439
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:33,564
For once in your life,
do something bright.

1440
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:55,346
Hey, Madge,
do you want to go dancing?

1441
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:57,755
Let me be next, Madge.

1442
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:03,356
Get out of this yard!
Get out!

1443
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:05,087
Neewollah!

1444
01:50:19,045 --> 01:50:20,876
I'm going to Tulsa, Mom.

1445
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:24,883
You don't know what you're doing.
You can't.

1446
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:25,949
I'm going, Mom.

1447
01:50:26,152 --> 01:50:27,744
Listen to me.
Put down that bag.

1448
01:50:27,954 --> 01:50:31,082
- Listen to what I've got to say.
- A bus is coming. I've got to hurry.

1449
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:33,919
He's no good. He'll never
be able to support you.

1450
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:36,687
And when he does have a job,
he'll spend it all on drink.

1451
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:39,231
And after that,
there'll be other women.

1452
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:40,763
I know.

1453
01:50:41,568 --> 01:50:45,163
You don't love someone
because he's perfect.

1454
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,536
Just think about it a few days.

1455
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:57,849
Goodbye, Mrs. Potts.

1456
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:01,877
I'll miss you
almost as much as Mom.

1457
01:51:02,222 --> 01:51:03,655
Madge, look.

1458
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,858
You've got to be here
for the festival.

1459
01:51:06,059 --> 01:51:07,321
It's your duty.

1460
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,489
Alan's going to take you.

1461
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:16,364
But I don't love Alan, Mom.

1462
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:20,433
Don't worry about me.

1463
01:51:23,576 --> 01:51:25,305
My little girl.

1464
01:51:25,545 --> 01:51:26,705
My baby.

1465
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:28,778
Don't go. Don't!

1466
01:51:45,031 --> 01:51:48,023
But there are so many things
I meant to tell her...

1467
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:50,560
I never got around to it.

1468
01:51:50,804 --> 01:51:53,705
Let her learn them for herself.

1469
01:51:55,842 --> 01:51:58,868
Come on, Millie! You don't
want to be late the first day!
