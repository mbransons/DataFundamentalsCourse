1
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:05,051
- We have to stop seeing each other.
- Your wife?

2
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:09,556
That witch!
How long this time?

3
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,725
I'm afraid permanently.

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,436
Permanently?

5
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,689
- Permanently?
- Yes.

6
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:21,735
- She gave me an ultimatum.
- Like you have no choice in the matter.

7
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,236
- I haven't.
- You have to. Get rid of her!

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:27,239
- My own wife?
- Get rid of her. Out! Why can't you?

9
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,283
She's got enough evidence
in her safety deposit box to ruin me.

10
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,910
Her attorney has been told that
if anything accidental happens to her...

11
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,912
to give her box
to the authorities.

12
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:36,789
- Then get rid of the authorities.
- What do you think I am?

13
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:39,792
Get rid of her attorney.

14
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,963
- I couldn't afford the scandal.
- I'll show you a scandal.

15
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:48,384
You know I don't love her.
I need her respectability.

16
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:50,595
- Permanently?
- Yes!

17
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:54,641
Six years together, just washed up?
Just over with?

18
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:58,353
- I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.
- That's just wonderful, isn't it?

19
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:01,688
You obviously can't go on
being my secretary.

20
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:05,025
I have deposited a substantial amount
of money in your bank account--

21
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,027
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want?

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,112
I don't know what I want.

23
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,282
But I'll think of something!

24
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,215
Leaving early?

25
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,509
Later than you think, Mr. Algo.

26
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,435
Something you want me to do?

27
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,357
Not unless she decides
to be indiscreet.

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,820
If you have to, be sure
you make it look like an accident.

29
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,703
Ahoy!

30
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,787
Ahoy, the skipper!

31
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,500
Hello, up there in the fog.

32
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:19,846
Don't worry.

33
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:23,015
It's only an old salty
Swedish sea dog...

34
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:26,102
out there from the salty seas,
you know.

35
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,524
Pumpin' the air in the parrot.

36
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:37,237
Naughty bird afraid of the fog.

37
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,914
Swine leg.

38
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,965
Hello, lnspector.

39
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,385
Chief lnspector.

40
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,308
I will keep under the covers.
No one must suspect a thing.

41
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,776
What do you have of special interest...

42
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,363
to my secret investigations?

43
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:25,240
There's something big going down
at Le Club Foot.

44
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:28,870
Le Club Foot? Remarkable.

45
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,371
Keep your--

46
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,918
Keep your eyes and ears peeled.

47
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,128
Keep in constant contact.

48
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:42,674
I am extremely grateful
for this excellent piece of information.

49
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,552
Thar she blows!

50
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:52,351
Once again, I thank you
for this most useful tip.

51
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,562
And if there is anything
I can ever do to repay you--

52
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,565
Now that you mention it,
Chief lnspector--

53
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,924
Sixteen chests
on a dead man's rum

54
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,261
Yo ho ho in the bottle
of the chest

55
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:33,639
Drink to the devils
and some for the rum--

56
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,021
Do it some more

57
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,232
Yeah, give me some more

58
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,276
All right

59
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,572
Come on, yeah
Slide it

60
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,159
Move 'em out

61
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,203
Move 'em out

62
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,832
If you mess around with women, boy
You wanna fix the trimmin'

63
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,838
Better listen to me, cousin--

64
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,048
She's coming in now.

65
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,804
- Bonsoir, Vic.
- How you doing, Simone?

66
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,056
Mr. Toledo, Mr. Vancouver.

67
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,558
What's happening?

68
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,519
You can show us to my usual table.

69
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,939
How about something near the floor?
Easier for dancing.

70
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:29,025
No, thank you.
I want my usual table.

71
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,657
Is something wrong?

72
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,368
It is Mr. Douvier's table,
ain't it, love?

73
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,663
No, it really ain't, love, but if
you're worried about Mr. Douvier...

74
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,665
why don't you give him a call?

75
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,667
I wouldn't want you to get in trouble
with your boss.

76
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,669
- He ain't my boss.
- He ain't?

77
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,963
Then why you paying him
all that money every month?

78
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:54,716
- That ain't cool, baby.
- You ain't seen nothing yet. Come on.

79
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,691
Where we going?

80
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,011
We don't want to be obvious. We've got
to make our entrance through the back...

81
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:12,306
in disguise,
as I told you, you fool.

82
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,962
Get up here.

83
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,674
- It's a bakery.
- I know that.

84
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:26,680
Come on. At least
you're not yellow anymore.

85
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,224
This time I'm going to stand
on your shoulders.

86
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,519
What good would that do?

87
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,398
- Because I'm taller than you, you fool.
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,400
Make a cradle.

89
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,573
Get rid of that.

90
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,996
I can't reach it.

91
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,043
You'll have to find something
to stand on.

92
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,315
All right! Let me see some, baby.
Come on.

93
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,944
Do it, baby.

94
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,494
Let me go!

95
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,374
- Can you reach it?
- Yes.

96
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,272
- Hey, are you okay?
- No.

97
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,648
- You know something? You're terrific.
- What?

98
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:34,236
You're terrific. You saved my life.
Come with me.

99
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,405
- Where?
- Over here. I want to save your life.

100
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:38,824
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh, God.

101
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:56,427
-Come with me before the killers see us.
-What killers?

102
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,721
- I'll tell you at my apartment.
- What apartment?

103
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,307
My apartment.

104
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,705
Oh, my God!

105
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,707
And mine, too.

106
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,751
I'm soaked to the skin.

107
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:30,173
Yes, I have received
considerable soak also.

108
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:38,765
Get out of those wet clothes before
you catch your death of pneumonia.

109
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,770
Yes. What shall I do with my coat?
I don't want to spoil your beautiful--

110
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,191
Just put it down anywhere.
Put it on the floor. That's fine.

111
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,782
Help yourself.

112
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:56,785
I'm going to change.
I'll bring you a robe.

113
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm gonna put on some music.

114
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:21,396
- You know, it's strange.
- What?

115
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,524
I say, it's strange.

116
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,694
Yes, I know.
And I said "what?"

117
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,571
- You mean, what is strange?
- Yes.

118
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,410
It's strange...

119
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,123
that I have never yet
set foot in this building...

120
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:42,712
but I have the distinct impression
that I have been here before.

121
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,590
It's called deja vu.
I have it all the time.

122
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,718
Yeah, deja vu.
Thank you.

123
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,720
You're welcome.

124
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:53,015
- You okay?
- Yes.

125
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:56,727
That feels good.

126
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,440
It's not going to do you much good
if you don't take your pants off.

127
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,567
- What?
- Take your pants off.

128
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,027
Forgot about those.

129
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,154
Look at me.

130
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,741
Look at my hands.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

131
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,452
I can't stop shaking.
I know what it is.

132
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:17,040
You know what it is?
I'm just not used to being killed.

133
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:21,629
- That's my first time, you know?
- I know, but listen.

134
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:26,759
When you have been killed as many times
as I have, you get used to it.

135
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,763
- Really?
- Yes, oh, yes.

136
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:32,723
Yes, indeed. I'll put this here.

137
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:36,311
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

138
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:40,190
- This is for you.
- Yes, of course.

139
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:43,194
- Then this must be yours.
- Thank you. Cheers.

140
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,781
Yes. Anyway--

141
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,037
- You have nothing to fear.
- Yes, I have.

142
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,081
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I have.

143
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:00,964
No. You see, I am an officer
of the law.

144
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,259
- The "lew"?
- What?

145
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:08,389
You said you are an officer
of the "lew"?

146
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,685
That is correct. Yes, yes.
I am Chief Inspector of the surete.

147
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,106
What?

148
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,525
You doubt me.

149
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,820
No, I don't doubt you.
Why should I doubt you?

150
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:26,074
- That's right. Why should you?
- If you say so, I don't.

151
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:28,703
Who were those men
who tried to kill you?

152
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,122
- Killers.
- How do you know?

153
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,834
- Because they work for Douvier.
- Douvier? I know that name.

154
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,379
Everyone in France knows that name.
He's a millionaire businessman.

155
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:42,301
Yes, of course. Douvier the
millionaire businessman. I knew I knew.

156
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:45,721
But, how many people
do you think know...

157
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:50,434
that Douvier the millionaire businessman
is also Douvier the French connection?

158
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,977
How many?

159
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,610
I suppose his mother, for one.

160
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:00,862
Why do you suppose he wanted
to have me killed?

161
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,448
Elementary.
He wanted you dead.

162
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,417
- You all right?
- I got singed.

163
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,044
- I'm sorry about your robe.
- That's all right.

164
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,588
Tell me about this Douvier.

165
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:21,761
I was his mistress and
private secretary for two years.

166
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:26,641
I know enough about Philippe to send him
to prison for his whole life.

167
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:32,480
You keep talking about this Douvier.

168
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:36,777
But who is Philippe?

169
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:39,655
- Philippe Douvier.
- His son?

170
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,617
Whose son? He has no son.

171
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,951
- His brother then?
- His brother is Fred.

172
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:46,370
- Then it has to be his father.
- His father's dead.

173
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,373
Now we're getting somewhere.
Who killed him?

174
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:52,794
- No one. He died of natural causes.
- Then who is this Philippe?

175
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:56,381
I want to see some identification.
Right now.

176
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,094
Right now.
I want to see some identification.

177
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:03,681
If you're not a policeman, then I
shouldn't be telling you these things.

178
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:11,690
- Can you keep a secret?
- I don't know. That depends.

179
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:16,529
Brace yourself for what
I'm about to tell you.

180
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,407
I am none other...

181
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:24,997
then Staff lnspector
Jacques Clouseau.

182
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,832
No, you're not.

183
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,834
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

184
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,422
I am.

185
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:33,965
You're not.

186
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,597
Yes, you are.

187
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,016
Oh, my God!

188
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,436
I admit it's not
a good photograph, but--

189
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,606
But I saw your funeral on television.

190
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,150
Yes. Yes.

191
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,736
Even the pope was there.
Cheers.

192
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,740
But if you're not dead, who's dead?

193
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,995
A wandering transvestite
took my car...

194
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,750
and stole my clothes at gunpoint.

195
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:08,586
I have been working under the covers
tracking the killer.

196
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,173
- The killer's Douvier!
- What?

197
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,467
He wanted to impress the godfather.

198
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:19,348
What? You mean Douvier killed
a wandering transvestite...

199
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:22,184
just to impress his godfather?

200
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:24,896
The man's unthinkable.

201
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,773
The door.

202
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:30,319
- What's wrong with it?
- I saw the knob turn.

203
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,349
Hurry.

204
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,519
- I wonder whose apartment this is.
- I don't know.

205
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,693
The other one's probably upstairs
waiting in my room.

206
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,112
How do you know there's another one?

207
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,283
Because assassins always travel
in pairs. It's a company rule.

208
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,535
Do you know what
the Gannet Transaction is?

209
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,829
The Gannet Transaction? What is that?

210
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,292
It's a code name for
a 50-million franc heroin sale.

211
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,377
50 million francs?

212
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,547
Philippe's going to Hong Kong on Tuesday
to meet with the American buyer.

213
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,133
Hong Kong.

214
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,720
I don't know how it fits in,
but the Gannet's a boat.

215
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,606
What are you doing?

216
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,612
- I know why this place looks familiar.
- Why?

217
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,739
Chief lnspector Dreyfus lives here.

218
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:56,747
I think he has received a faint.

219
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,627
Wake up, Chief lnspector.
Wake up.

220
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,171
Chief lnspector?

221
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:07,175
Hello? Are you in there,
Chief lnspector?

222
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,469
Hello?

223
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:14,058
There's no reply.
It's no use.

224
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,060
We will have to go to Hong Kong
without him.

225
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,019
- We?
- Yes.

226
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,772
You, I and Cato,
who will translate for us.

227
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,735
Not me. I am not going to Hong Kong.

228
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:26,071
Are you kidding?
Douvier would shoot me on sight.

229
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:28,782
Not if he doesn't recognize you.
And he won't.

230
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,368
Why not?

231
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:36,915
We will leave that
up to the great Balls.

232
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,502
The great Balls?

233
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,381
At your service!

234
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,344
Please forgive the condition
of my establishment...

235
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,221
but as the lnspector knows--

236
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:52,224
- Chief lnspector knows--
- Auguste.

237
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,394
So sorry. I beg your pardon.

238
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,982
But as the Chief lnspector knows,
we were bombed.

239
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,816
Sounds like you still are.

240
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:04,529
Almost all my collection
was either destroyed or damaged.

241
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,824
Starting Monday,
I have to have a fire sale.

242
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,119
You could call it
"The Great Balls of Fire" sale.

243
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,122
A catchy suggestion.

244
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,666
Very good.

245
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,377
Cunny!

246
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:27,847
I can't tell you how good it is
to see that you are still alive.

247
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:31,141
It has been my privilege
to serve the good lnspector...

248
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:34,438
the Chief lnspector,
for, lo, this many years.

249
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,857
Thirteen, to be precise.

250
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:41,278
And his reported demise
was a real blow to me.

251
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,405
Something's coming.

252
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,325
Yes, Cunny, you are not dreaming.

253
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:50,455
Our friend, our customer,
is alive!

254
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,041
Hello, Cunny.

255
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,004
Now, how can I serve you?

256
00:19:57,046 --> 00:20:00,466
Through wind and mud,
snow and hail...

257
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:04,346
whether long or short,
dark or pale, remember...

258
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,057
that when duty calls...

259
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,309
you've got Balls.

260
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,315
I gotta sit down.

261
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,651
Yes, of course. Cunny! Quick.

262
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,361
Please, please, please.

263
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:20,780
Come along. That's right.
There you are.

264
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:25,494
- Sit. Come, come, come. Sit, sit.
- You're not serious.

265
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:28,205
There has been no time
to get new furniture.

266
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:31,500
Believe me, since the blast,
he's much more comfortable.

267
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,210
Please sit.

268
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,754
Matter of fact,
I've been sleeping on him.

269
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,385
Chief lnspector?

270
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:43,221
I'm leaving for Hong Kong
in the morning.

271
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,974
Hong Kong?

272
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:49,060
Could you pick me up
some cheap coolie hats?

273
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:52,815
My dear Auguste,
I need your best Hong Kong disguise.

274
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:56,986
Also, I will need something
extra special in the godfather line.

275
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:00,365
Doctor, please, you must help me.

276
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,659
Is Clouseau real...

277
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,662
or am I going mad again?

278
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:08,249
- What do you think?
- What do I think? What can I think?

279
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,085
If that nincompoop is really alive...

280
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:15,549
and the things I heard are true,
he'll probably be decorated again...

281
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,427
for rounding up
the biggest drug ring in France...

282
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,013
and I'll be a laughingstock.

283
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:24,725
That sounds reasonable.
What are you going to do?

284
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,854
What choice do I have?

285
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,566
I either commit myself and come back
to be locked up in here...

286
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:34,861
or...

287
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,157
I go to Hong Kong.

288
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,070
- I don't think I can do this.
- Of course you can.

289
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,489
Just think yellow and follow me.

290
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,529
"Mr. and Mrs. Low Key."

291
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:57,410
You stupid lunk! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

292
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,412
Absolutely ruined my suit!

293
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,540
Why the hell don't you look
where you're going?

294
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,254
I'm Mr. Algo. When Mr. Scallini arrives,
have me paged in the bar.

295
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,548
Certainly, Mr. Algo.

296
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:13,428
Who is gonna pay for my suit?

297
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,140
See that man there?

298
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,851
That's Guy Algo,
Philippe's right-hand man.

299
00:23:20,018 --> 00:23:22,437
This Scallini must be Mr. Big
from New York.

300
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:26,860
Listen, we'll go up to the room.

301
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,863
You stay here ten minutes,
then tell Mr.--

302
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,032
- Algo.
- Right, yes. Algo.

303
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:36,287
That Mr. You-Know-Who has arrived,
and bring him to the room.

304
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:40,457
- Mr. You-Know-Who?
- Right. I will be Mr. You-Know-Who.

305
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,459
Come, Ming Loy.

306
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,926
You got a reservation for Scallini?

307
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:36,812
Page Mr. Algo in the bar.
Tell him Mr. Scallini is here.

308
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:04,425
- What do you think you're doing?
- Mr. Scallini in lobby.

309
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,074
You heard what I said to him?
Dumb Frenchman.

310
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,534
"Cochon."

311
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:46,704
That means pig.

312
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:49,956
I tell Mr. Scallini you're here.

313
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,719
- Listen, boss--
- It's not boss. It's me!

314
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:02,262
Where is he?

315
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:04,264
In the bathroom getting into
his godfather disguise.

316
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:07,852
Algo's in the next room. Scallini's
down the hall in the Tang suite.

317
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:10,271
- Marvelous.
- We rode up in the same elevator.

318
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:12,273
Maybe I can reach him
before he contacts Philippe.

319
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:16,277
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not sure. Keep your eye on Algo.

320
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,058
- Ice?
- Please.

321
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,774
- Soda?
- Yes.

322
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,158
I hope it's not too strong.

323
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,451
I'm sure it will be fine.

324
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,793
Hey! Mama Mia.

325
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:10,922
Spaghettini du AI Pacino!

326
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:17,386
Carlo, Cato and me got a little business
to talk over.

327
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:20,098
We won't be long.
Have another drink.

328
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,519
Viva Zapata!

329
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:30,526
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

330
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:37,492
Get out--

331
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:40,537
Hello, Mr. Marchione.

332
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:44,125
- Hey. Come on in.
- Thank you.

333
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,419
- Thank you very much.
- Can I get you a drink?

334
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,421
No, nothing, thank you.

335
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:50,965
It's Simone.

336
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,092
You have a good memory.

337
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:56,138
I never forget a pretty face.

338
00:28:56,138 --> 00:29:00,392
Boss, this is Simone.
That's Douvier's personal--

339
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,853
Secretary. How do you do,
Mr. Scallini?

340
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:06,566
We never met before.
If we meet before, you call me Julio.

341
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:11,280
- That's a nice hand.
- Thank you. That's only the right one.

342
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:13,699
- You type, too.
- 100 words a minute.

343
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,700
I may faint.

344
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:19,455
Mr. Douvier has asked me to apologize.
He's going to be a little late.

345
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:21,999
If you like, I'd be happy
to keep you company until he arrives.

346
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:24,753
If I like?
Does my mother cook spaghetti?

347
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:27,130
To the Gannet Transaction.

348
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,141
Shall I tell Douvier
we're on our way?

349
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:41,354
Don't forget the money.

350
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:53,492
What?

351
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,161
Throat! Back!

352
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:59,207
Choking!

353
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,335
You want me to hit you on the back.

354
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,528
We're on our way.

355
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:30,533
- Mr. Douvier will meet us in the lobby.
- Yeah. Great.

356
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,369
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

357
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,413
50 million francs and no bodyguard?

358
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:39,083
Listen, buddy, I take care of my body,
my body takes care of me.

359
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,085
You know what I'm driving at?

360
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,972
I'll buy some cigarettes, huh?

361
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,393
Yeah, smoke a few. When Douvier shows,
I'll meet you in the lobby.

362
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:56,853
Right.

363
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,917
Be right with you.

364
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,957
What the hell is going on here?

365
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,145
Lee Kee shipyards.

366
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:00,865
- Where'd he go?
- I think to Lee Kee shipyards.

367
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:23,138
My cart!

368
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:27,185
You see this? I can tell by
your heart line you're a passionate man.

369
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,188
See how long this is?

370
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:32,483
Keep watching.
It's going to get longer.

371
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:38,490
- Hello.
- Lee Kee shipyards. Douvier.

372
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,034
It was Douvier!

373
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:45,622
The doorman heard him tell the driver
to go to the Lee Kee shipyard.

374
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:48,626
Something is caccuzza around here.

375
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:53,923
Your boss and a couple boys
just left the hotel.

376
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:56,218
Really? I wonder why they did that?

377
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:59,096
You got me.
Why don't we go ask him?

378
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:03,100
Yes. Okay, I understand.

379
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,230
Douvier left the hotel
about five minutes ago.

380
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,652
He was with two men. He told the driver
to go to the Lee Kee shipyard.

381
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:14,654
I'm sure it was that nincompoop.

382
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:22,495
I'm sure Mr. Douvier didn't intend
to be gone very long.

383
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:25,249
- We'll see.
- It doesn't make much sense.

384
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,418
If you leave,
and then he comes back--

385
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:30,379
Stop worrying.
You give yourself wrinkles.

386
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:40,140
What about this Lee Kee shipyard?

387
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,268
Perfectly legitimate
as far as I know.

388
00:34:42,393 --> 00:34:45,396
They build a line of
expensive power cruisers and sailboats.

389
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:48,149
Maybe Mr. Douvier
is just buying himself a yacht.

390
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:57,827
Lee Kee shipyards?

391
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:59,829
Yeah, that's what
the como si chiamare said.

392
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:20,184
Move it!

393
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,317
Come along!

394
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,313
This is Mr. Chow,
our Far Eastern representative.

395
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:20,192
- Mr. Scallini.
- It's an honor to meet you.

396
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:23,737
- You remember Mr. Algo. Shall we go?
- This way, please.

397
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,198
After you launch the boat,
we'll go to Mr. Chow's office.

398
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:28,617
You can sign the ownership papers.
Everything legal and aboveboard.

399
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,912
Above the board. Good, good.

400
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,167
- Where is it? You know--
- I understood you were told.

401
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:40,088
No. I was told.
But I'm checking, you know.

402
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:46,470
- In the keel.
- The old keel ploy. Yes.

403
00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:49,390
All you have to do is sail her
around the Caribbean for a while...

404
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:52,935
haul her out of the water,
take the midsection out of the keel...

405
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:56,231
and voila, 40 kilos
of the finest merchandise...

406
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,650
your experts have ever tested.

407
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:02,362
I'll tell you, it better hell be
the best merchandise...

408
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:05,825
'cause my experts
certainly have tested some.

409
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,661
- We have faith in our merchandise.
- That's good.

410
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,540
All right. Now, would you like
to launch her?

411
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,667
I would be delighted.

412
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:35,690
September. A good month for the vintage.

413
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,988
Congratulations!

414
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,175
He must be a cop!
Get him! Get him!

415
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:01,761
Hey, boss!

416
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,900
Look out, you are an idiot!

417
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,197
What are you doing?

418
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:23,560
Jesus Christ!

419
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:30,276
You crumb!

420
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:40,870
Get back here, you slob!

421
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,584
It's me!

422
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,002
I know!

423
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,559
Wait!

424
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:28,214
Hey, cancel the artillery!

425
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,350
I don't care! Get out of my way!

426
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,937
- Al, where are you?
- How do I know?

427
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:46,942
Wherever you are,
this is Chief lnspector Clouseau.

428
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:49,821
I'm warning you
that if you are not careful...

429
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,115
I will arrest you all
in the name of the law.

430
00:41:58,664 --> 00:42:02,669
You and your bright ideas.
Let me get my hands on you.

431
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:04,128
Clouseau?

432
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,214
Yes?

433
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:10,135
- Are you wounded?
- No.

434
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:13,555
Fortunately I was saved
by the darkness.

435
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,975
So what we need is more light.

436
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,442
Look what you did to my shoes!

437
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:59,772
Hello, Philippe.

438
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:03,318
Simone, what the hell
are you doing here?

439
00:43:03,443 --> 00:43:05,487
I'm waiting for the firecrackers
to go off.

440
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:09,032
- What firecrackers?
- The ones I stuck in your pants.

441
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:42,827
Hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

442
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,666
I had some important police business
to attend to, you know.

443
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,377
- Everything's all right?
- Yes, absolutely fine.

444
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:52,671
Allow me to let you in the car.

445
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:54,673
Please.

446
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:57,552
- It's beautiful.
- It's rather neat, isn't it?

447
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,554
I call it the Silver Hornet.

448
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,441
Yes.

449
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:15,821
It's a little overdue for service,
unfortunately.

450
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,996
Perhaps it's better
to leave that there.

451
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,249
It's a beautiful night.
Why don't we walk?

452
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:28,293
What an excellent idea.

453
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:32,130
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's quite all right.

454
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,299
You look ravishing tonight.

455
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,011
- Yes, I know that.
- You know that?

456
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,138
I knew that you knew that.

457
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,183
You did? I knew you knew
I knew that.

458
00:46:41,307 --> 00:46:43,602
What made you decide
to become a detective?

459
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:48,190
It's not something one decides
every day of the week, you know.

460
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,777
But in my case, it began
when my great aunt was kidnapped...

461
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:56,616
and held for ransom
by an unlicensed Armenian phrenologist.

462
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,785
An Armenian phrenologist?

463
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:03,332
Yes, you know. A man who reads
the "bimps" on the head.

464
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:05,918
- The "bimps"?
- What?
