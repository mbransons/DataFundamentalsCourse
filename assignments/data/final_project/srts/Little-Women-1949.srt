1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:52,563


3
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:46,482
Excuse me. I was looking
for the <i>Weekly Volcano</i> office.

4
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,149
I wish to see
Mr. Dashwood.

5
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,790
A friend of mine desired me
to offer a story by her.

6
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:56,892
She... She wrote it.

7
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:58,993
She'd be glad to write more
if this suits.

8
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,796
Not a first attempt,
I take it.

9
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,599
No, sir. She has sold
to <i>Olympic</i> and Scandal,

10
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,668
and she got a prize for a tale
at the <i>Blarneystone Banner.</i>

11
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,470
A prize?

12
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,038
Yes.

13
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,308
Sit.

14
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,553
We'll take this.

15
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:00,389
Oh, you will?

16
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:03,592
With alterations.
It's too long.

17
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,928
Um, but you've cut...

18
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:10,097
I took care to have
a few of my sinners repent.

19
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,099
The country just
went through a war.

20
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,571
People want to be amused,
not preached at.

21
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,606
Morals don't sell nowadays.

22
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,709
Perhaps mention that
to your friend.

23
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:26,147
What compensation...?
How do you...?

24
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,584
We pay 25 to 30
for things of this sort.

25
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,919
- We'll pay 20 for that.
- Oh.

26
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,391
You can have it.
Make the edits.

27
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,300
Should I tell my...
uh, my friend

28
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,904
you'll take another
if she had one better than this?

29
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,640
We'll look at it. Tell her
to make it short and spicy.

30
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,508
And if the main character's
a girl,

31
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:56,277
make sure she's married
by the end.

32
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,947
- Or dead. Either way.
- Excuse me?

33
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,249
What name would she like
put to the story?

34
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:06,088
Oh, uh, yes.
None at all, if you please.

35
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,923
Just as she likes,
of course.

36
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:10,224
Oh, well, heh...

37
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:13,829
Good morning, sir. Good day.

38
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,430
Yes!

39
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,820
My Beth would
like you very much.

40
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,288
I'd like a room for two.

41
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,590
Perfect. That's 4.50 a week.

42
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:00,292
And that's a good price.

43
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,993
Isn't that a little expensive?

44
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,463
This is a
boardinghouse, not a charity.

45
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,565
I need the rent on time.

46
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,473
Good
afternoon, Miss March.

47
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,542
Oh, good afternoon.

48
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,950
You're on fire.

49
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,385
Thank you.

50
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:30,656
You're on fire!

51
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,563
- Thank you.
- I have the same habit. You see?

52
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,399
Oh.

53
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,368
Kitty and Minnie are waiting.

54
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,604
- Oh, my students need me.
- Always working.

55
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:49,275
Money is the end and aim
of my mercenary existence.

56
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,543
No one gets
ink stains like yours

57
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:53,379
just out of
a desire for money.

58
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:54,879
My sister Amy's in Paris,

59
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:57,249
and until she marries
someone obscenely wealthy,

60
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,451
it's up to me
to keep the family afloat.

61
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:00,852
Goodbye.

62
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,477
The Decadents have
ruined Paris, if you ask me.

63
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,047
These French women
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

64
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,382
- Amy!
- Hm?

65
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,717
I said, these French women

66
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,118
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,788
Oh, yes. Very true,
Aunt March.

68
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,357
Oh, don't humor me, girl.

69
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,795
What do they write,
your troublemaking family?

70
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,332
Mother doesn't say
anything about Beth.

71
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:48,600
I feel I should go back.
They all say, "Stay."

72
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,936
You can do nothing
if you go back.

73
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,938
The girl is sick,
not lonely.

74
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:55,607
And you shouldn't go home
until you and Fred Vaughn

75
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,875
are properly engaged.

76
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,545
Yes, and until I've completed

77
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:01,513
all of my painting lessons,
of course.

78
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:05,184
Oh, yes, yes.

79
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:07,653
Of course.

80
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:17,296
- Stop the carriage! Laurie!
- What are you doing?

81
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,498
- Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!
- Amy!

82
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,400
- Laurie! Ha, ha!
- Amy!

83
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,068
Amy!

84
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,403
- How are you?
- Oh!

85
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,903
My, you've grown so much.

86
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,740
You wrote you'd meet me
at the hotel.

87
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,175
- I couldn't find you.
- You didn't look hard enough.

88
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,378
I didn't recognize you.
You're so beautiful.

89
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,911
- Oh, stop it.
- I thought you liked that?

90
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,748
- Where's your grandfather?
- In Germany.

91
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,250
He's still traveling.
I'm on my own now, relaxing.

92
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,353
- Flirting, gambling and drinking.
- Yes. Don't tell your mother.

93
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:44,189
Are you chasing
some young girl across Europe?

94
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:45,758
No.

95
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:50,596
I couldn't believe Jo
turned you down. I'm so sorry.

96
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:53,866
Don't be, Amy. I... I'm not.

97
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,835
Amy!

98
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,170
Amy March!

99
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,105
- Come back this instant!
- Oh, Aunt March.

100
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,574
Come. Come on.

101
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,576
- Aren't you looking grand?
- Get him off me!

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,311
We need to be somewhere.
Off you go!

103
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,946
Come to
the New Year's Eve party.

104
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,882
Everyone will be there,
including Fred.

105
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:12,084
Pick me up at the hotel
at 8, The Chavain.

106
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:15,421
Oh! And, Laurie,
dress for festivities!

107
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,055
Top hats and silks!

108
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,191
I will.
I'll wear my best silk.

109
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,732
It's Laurie.

110
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,635
I know.

111
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,813
Twenty yards of blue silk,
as well as pink.

112
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,448
Someone will be by for it later.

113
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,783
Oh, Meg, that would
look so lovely on you.

114
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,652
I know the dressmaker
to send you to.

115
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,620
You'll be the prettiest wife
in Concord.

116
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:51,123
Oh, I... John needs
a new coat for winter,

117
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:52,858
and Daisy and Demi
need new clothes.

118
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,860
And his wife
needs a new dress.

119
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,362
I can't. It's...
I just can't.

120
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,765
He'll be so pleased
with how you look,

121
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,834
he'll forget
all about the expense.

122
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,838
I don't suppose it's too much
of an extravagance.

123
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,906
Will 20 yards do?

124
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,576
- Yes.
- Very good.

125
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,416
Fifty dollars?
What was I thinking?

126
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,592
Mommy!

127
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,496
Oh, my loves.

128
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:34,366
Go play.

129
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:06,164
Beth!

130
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,667
Beth?

131
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,802
There lies your way,
due west.

132
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,704
Then westward ho!

133
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:16,208
Grace and good disposition
attend Your Ladyship.

134
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,911
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

135
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:23,549
Stay, I prithee,
tell me what thou thinkest of me.

136
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:26,585
That you do think
you are not what you are.

137
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,854
If I think so,
I think the same of you.

138
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,523
Then think you
right, I am not what I am.

139
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:01,119
Like, a big one.
Like, a big one... Like that.

140
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,792
Excuse me?

141
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:09,595
I only speak English.
I'm sorry, what?

142
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,129
- What did you say?
- Come dance!

143
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,764
Oh!

144
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,020
I know exactly
who I wanna dance with.

145
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:08,186
I'll take this off.

146
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,855
Who will you dance with, Jo?

147
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,423
You know I never dance.

148
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,625
Why can't we all go?
It's not fair.

149
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,495
- Wear your regular shoes.
- These fit last winter.

150
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,697
My nose will simply
not look refined.

151
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,999
I like your nose.

152
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,800
- Now, Jo.
- Don't touch me.

153
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,936
I feel ridiculous.
I don't wanna look it.

154
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,537
You could be pretty
if you tried.

155
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:27,539
- Don't want to. Won't.
- I don't want to go,

156
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,207
but I wish
I could hear the music.

157
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,110
I'll keep it in my head
and sing it for you.

158
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,845
- Ought they to smoke like that?
- It's the dampness drying.

159
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,982
What a queer smell,
like burnt feathers.

160
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:38,850
Now I'll take this off and
you'll see a perfect ringlet.

161
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,156
Why is her hair off?

162
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,557
- Meg, I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?!

163
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,893
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:49,428
You shouldn't have
asked me.

165
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,097
Marmee!

166
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,099
I can't go, I'm spoiled!

167
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,866
My hair!

168
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,202
Don't stare, don't put
your hands behind your back,

169
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:59,271
don't say "Columbus,"
don't say "capital."

170
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,772
- All right.
- Don't shake hands.

171
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,008
Don't whistle.

172
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,509
Meg March,
you look so pretty.

173
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,379
Well...

174
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,247
Meg.

175
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,099
Thank you.

176
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,334
No, it's so early. No.

177
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,003
Fine.

178
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,620
Ooh! Sorry. I didn't know
anyone was here.

179
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,256
- Not at all. Stay if you like.
- I won't disturb you?

180
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,258
No. I don't know
many people here.

181
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,260
I felt rather strange
at first, you know?

182
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,230
Mm, so do I. Heh.

183
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:59,331
Miss March, isn't it?

184
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,300
Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not
Miss March. I'm only Jo.

185
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,436
And I'm not Mr. Laurence,
I'm only Laurie.

186
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,343
Don't you dance?

187
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,311
I don't know
how you do things here yet.

188
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,148
I've spent most
of my life in Europe.

189
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,949
Europe! Oh, that's capital!

190
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,318
Shouldn't use
words like that.

191
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,321
- Says who?
- Oh, Meg.

192
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,390
She's my older sister. Here.

193
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,427
Hm...

194
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,164
Oh, that's her. See?

195
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,135
- The girl in the violet dress.
- Mm. It's very pretty.

196
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:38,837
She reminds me to be good

197
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,941
so Father will be proud of me
when he returns.

198
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,441
Where is he?

199
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,677
He volunteered
for the Union Army.

200
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,879
And I wanted
to go fight with him.

201
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,516
I can't get over my
disappointment in being a girl.

202
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,718
Jo, would you like
to dance with me?

203
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,487
I can't because...

204
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,956
Because of what?

205
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,827
- You won't tell?
- Never.

206
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:05,497
I scorched my dress.
See? There.

207
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,001
And Meg told me to keep still
so no one would see it.

208
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:12,238
You can laugh if you want to.
It's funny, I know.

209
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,373
I have an idea
of how we can manage.

210
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,522
Oh!

211
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,202
- What?
- My foot.

212
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:17,636
- I've hurt my ankle.
- Oh!

213
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,870
<i>How am I gonna get home?</i>

214
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,273
I don't see what you can do,

215
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:22,241
except get a carriage
or stay all night.

216
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,442
- Carriages are too expensive.
- Let me take you.

217
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,212
- It's right next door.
- No, thank you.

218
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:29,115
- We cannot accept.
- You must take mine, please?

219
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:31,783
No. It's so early.
You can't mean to leave yet.

220
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,919
I always leave early.
I do, truly.

221
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,022
What choice
do you have, hm?

222
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,892
Goodness gracious.
What have you done?

223
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:42,962
She's lame and can't walk.
She's hobbling.

224
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,864
Clear that chair.
You're supposed to be asleep.

225
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,067
Help your sister,
then back to bed.

226
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,202
Make room.
Meg is a wounded soldier.

227
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:52,972
- I sprained my ankle.
- Oh, Meg, you'll kill yourself

228
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,341
for fashion
one of these days.

229
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,777
Here. Hannah, we need ice!

230
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,147
- Oh, come in. Come in.
- Is it all right?

231
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,747
Apologies for the chaos.

232
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,816
I enjoy baking
in the middle of the night.

233
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,153
Don't mind the clutter,
Mr. Laurence. We don't.

234
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,354
Laurie, please.

235
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,855
- Can I call you Teddy?
- Yes.

236
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,092
You must be part
of their theatricals.

237
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,161
- They could use an extra player.
- I'm Amy.

238
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:16,628
- Hello.
- You'll have to fight Jo

239
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,697
for the male roles
or play a girl.

240
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,598
- Have a scone.
- Yes, thank you.

241
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,969
And ice.
Laurie, how are your ankles?

242
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,404
- Do you need ice?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

243
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,974
Just call me "mother" or Marmee.
Everyone does.

244
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,143
You wore those pink shoes?

245
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:33,511
Ah, It's cold.

246
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:36,614
- But they look so good, okay?
- Do you want more ice?

247
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:38,483
Feels like being
a fine young lady

248
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,453
to come home from a party
in a carriage

249
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,587
and have maids wait on me. Ah!

250
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,700
<i>For the writer in the attic.</i>

251
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,603
Because you enjoyed
the play so much tonight,

252
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,439
I wanted you to have this.

253
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:04,477
It will help you study character
and paint it with your pen.

254
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,646
<i>I would love to read
what you're writing,</i>

255
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,615
<i>if you'll trust me.</i>

256
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:13,254
<i>I promise honesty and whatever
intelligence I can muster.</i>

257
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,423
Yours, Friedrich.

258
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,679
- Fred, would you like a glass?
- I will. Thank you.

259
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:48,688
Would you excuse me
a second?

260
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,032
Laurie.

261
00:19:58,165 --> 00:19:59,333
Amy.

262
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,968
I waited an hour for you.

263
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,005
I feel caught.

264
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,208
Hm.

265
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,510
Amy, please. Amy.

266
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,480
Do you want to know
what I think of you?

267
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,148
- What do you think?
- I despise you.

268
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,083
- Why do you despise me?
- With every chance

269
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,717
of being good,
happy and useful,

270
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,887
you are lazy, faulty
and miserable.

271
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,721
- Ooh, interesting.
- Well, selfish people

272
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:23,656
- like to talk about themselves.
- Selfish?

273
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,326
- Yes, very selfish.
- Oh.

274
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,660
With your money, talent,
beauty, and health...

275
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,063
Oh, you think
I'm beautiful.

276
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:30,898
Yes, you like that,
you old vanity.

277
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:34,701
With good things to enjoy, you
find nothing to do but dawdle.

278
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:38,172
I'll be good for you, St. Amy.
I'll be good.

279
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,174
Aren't you ashamed
of a hand like that?

280
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,009
- I'm not.
- Looks like it's never done

281
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,744
a day of work in its life,
and that ring is ridiculous.

282
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,313
Jo gave me this ring.

283
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:51,352
I feel sorry for you.
I really do.

284
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,020
I just wish
you'd bear it better.

285
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,587
You don't have to feel sorry.

286
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,024
- You'll feel the same one day.
- No, I'd be respected

287
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:59,726
if I couldn't be loved.

288
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,031
What have you done lately,
oh, great artiste?

289
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:07,600
Perhaps you're fantasizing about
spending Fred Vaughn's fortune.

290
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,204
Fred Vaughn,
ladies and gentlemen!

291
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,081
Fred, I...

292
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:21,382
I'm so sorry.

293
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,200
Those are just stories,
of course.

294
00:21:42,195 --> 00:21:44,864
But I'm working on a novel.

295
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,767
And your novel...

296
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,234
it will be like this?

297
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,438
Yes. So far, anyway.

298
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,173
With plots like this?

299
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:59,429
- Duels and killing and...
- It sells, so...

300
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,297
Why don't you sign
your real name?

301
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,165
Oh, my mother
wouldn't like it.

302
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,135
It's too gory for her.

303
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:10,138
I wanna help with the money
I make and not worry her.

304
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,013
Mm.

305
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,019
You know, I...
I don't like them.

306
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,023
Honestly, uh...

307
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:30,760
I mean, I... I think
that they're not good.

308
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:38,166
Uh, but...

309
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:40,503
They're...

310
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:44,272
They're published
in the papers,

311
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,510
and people have always said
that I'm talented.

312
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:49,846
Oh, I think you're talented.

313
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:52,749
Which is why I'm being so...
So blunt.

314
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:58,354
Well, I can't afford
to starve on praise.

315
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,490
Are you upset?

316
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,425
Of course I'm upset.
You just...

317
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,159
You told me
you didn't like my work.

318
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,828
Jo, I thought
you wanted honesty.

319
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,965
I... Yes, I do.

320
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:12,835
Has no one ever talked
to you like this before?

321
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,804
Yes, I've been rejected
plenty of times.

322
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:17,740
Do you have anyone
to take you seriously, Jo,

323
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,376
- to talk about your work?
- And who made you high priest

324
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,011
of what's good
and what's bad?

325
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:24,847
- No one, and I'm not...
- Then why are you acting like it?

326
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,083
Your reaction indicates
there is some truth...

327
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:30,218
My reaction indicates
that you are a pompous blowhard.

328
00:23:30,353 --> 00:23:31,888
Shakespeare wrote
for the masses.

329
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,256
Shakespeare was the greatest
poet who ever lived

330
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,659
because he smuggled his poetry
in popular works.

331
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:38,895
- I'm no Shakespeare.
- Thank goodness.

332
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,363
We already have him.

333
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:41,831
If you know so much about it,

334
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,633
why don't you just
do it yourself?

335
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:46,035
Because I'm not a writer.

336
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,038
- I don't have the gifts you have.
- No, you don't.

337
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,808
You will always be a critic
and never an author.

338
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:54,677
And the world will forget
that you ever even lived.

339
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,212
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- But...

340
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:58,481
I... But I...

341
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,719
No one will forget Jo March.

342
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:08,424
I can believe it.

343
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,592
Listen.

344
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:10,927
We are not friends.

345
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,463
You are not my friend.

346
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,598
And I don't want your opinion

347
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:17,400
because I don't
like you very much.

348
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,702
So just don't talk
to me anymore. Thank you.

349
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:42,391
Oh, Josephine,
this came for you.

350
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:43,926
Oh, thank you.

351
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,537
Beth.

352
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,549
Merry Christmas, world.

353
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,189
Merry Christmas!

354
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,925
- Merry Christmas.
- Give me another orange.

355
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:51,494
- Jo, we've been up for hours.
- What have you been writing?

356
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,696
Oh, I got carried away
with our revenge play

357
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,797
last night, <i>Poison.</i>

358
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,666
No, no poison.
It's Christmas.

359
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,634
Won't be Christmas
without any presents.

360
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:00,870
- It's dreadful being poor.
- It's not fair.

361
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:02,772
How come some girls
have pretty things

362
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,040
and others have nothing?

363
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:05,942
We have Father, Mother
and each other.

364
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,611
We haven't got Father as
long as this war drags on.

365
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:10,680
I wish I had money
and plenty of servants,

366
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:11,881
so I never had to work.

367
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:13,916
Or you could be
a proper actress.

368
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,384
They aren't all fallen women.

369
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:17,653
- I can't be an actress.
- I have lots of wishes,

370
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:19,989
but my favorite one
is to be an artist in Paris

371
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,859
and do fine pictures and be
the best painter in the world.

372
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:25,228
That's what you want, Jo,
to be a famous writer?

373
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:27,331
Yes, but it sounds crass
when she says it.

374
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,698
- Why be ashamed?
- I'm not.

375
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:29,932
My wish is to have us

376
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,934
all be together
with Father and Mother.

377
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,270
- That's what I want.
- Beth is perfect.

378
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,340
- Amy.
- What about your music, huh?

379
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:38,608
I do that for us. I don't need
anyone else to hear it.

380
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,209
You must not limit yourself.

381
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:42,411
Mother proposed not having
presents this year

382
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:44,348
because men are suffering
in the Army.

383
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,982
We can't do much,
but we can make

384
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,884
our little sacrifices
and do it gladly.

385
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,686
Don't play mother
just because she's not home.

386
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,489
- Jo, that's so boyish.
- That's why I do it.

387
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:57,026
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- I hate affected little chits.

388
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,662
- Jo!
- My nose! My nose! Ow!

389
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,764
It's already no good!

390
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:03,099
Jo! Jo!

391
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:04,834
I know you don't care
what I think,

392
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,371
but you don't want your mother
to find you like this, do you?

393
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,771
We care what you think.

394
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,773
You're more family
than old Aunt March.

395
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:12,842
- Don't, Jo.
- Where is Marmee? I'm starving.

396
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,811
Goodness only knows. Some
poor creature came a-begging.

397
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:18,247
Your ma set straight off
to see what was needed.

398
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:20,983
I wish she could help others
at a time convenient to us.

399
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,985
Joanna and I
are very hungry.

400
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,454
- Dolls don't get hungry.
- I've rewritten the climax.

401
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:27,957
We need to set it to memory.
Amy, get the costumes.

402
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,059
I have made
the most divine crown,

403
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:33,129
and I painted my old shoes blue,
so she looks like a princess!

404
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,264
The melancholy piece
is pretty good.

405
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:36,999
Wait until
you see this new speech.

406
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,336
I don't see how you
write such splendid things.

407
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,338
- You're a regular Shakespeare.
- Not quite.

408
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,273
Miss Michelangelo, can you
rehearse the fainting scene?

409
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:46,442
- You're as stiff as a poker.
- I can't help it.

410
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:48,412
I never saw anyone faint.
I don't intend

411
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,246
to make myself
all black and blue.

412
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,081
If I can fall down easily,
I'll drop.

413
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,617
If I cannot, I shall fall
gracefully into a chair.

414
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,421
And I don't care if Hugo
comes at me with a pistol.

415
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,888
- Hannah?
- I'm not acting.

416
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:00,489
I didn't even say anything.

417
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,959
I knew what you were going
to say. I'm not acting.

418
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:15,938
I need both of you
to kneel right there.

419
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:18,007
- I need you to kneel.
- I don't want to.

420
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,176
This is supposed to be
our special scene.

421
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,312
- No one's gonna be looking at us.
- Smile.

422
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:23,980
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

423
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:25,715
I think Meg should be
the director.

424
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,850
So I think that
she'll need to kneel...

425
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:30,454
- But it's our scene.
- If you'll kneel and look...

426
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:31,988
Merry Christmas, girls.

427
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,156
- Marmee!
- Oh, merry Christmas!

428
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,793
I'm so glad to see you so happy.
How's your play?

429
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:40,730
Jo, you look tired. Were you up
again all night writing?

430
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:44,066
- Of course.
- Amy, come kiss me. Thank you.

431
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,735
Merry Christmas.
How are my girls?

432
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:47,437
- I'm so hungry.
- Look at this.

433
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,172
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't say that, Jo.

434
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,377
What?

435
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,612
What is it?

436
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:59,615
Not far from here lives
a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel.

437
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:02,551
Her five children are in one bed
to keep from freezing,

438
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:04,520
and there's nothing to eat.

439
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,356
Will you give them
your breakfast

440
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,190
as a Christmas present?

441
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:16,299
Is this where you say
that Father would want us to?

442
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,733
Yes.

443
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:29,912
Thank you.

444
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:33,417
And thank you, Mr. Laurence,
for including me.

445
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:34,583
You're welcome.

446
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:42,392
Perhaps you could tutor
my grandson in manners,

447
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:44,461
as well as mathematics,
huh?

448
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:53,537
Oh, girls...

449
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,507
Be careful.

450
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:02,446
Watch yourselves.

451
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,580
Out here with no sleeves.

452
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,764
It is good angels come to us.

453
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:28,904
Hello. I'm back.
And have food and blankets.

454
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,340
And sweaters.

455
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:32,174
And we brought some medicine.

456
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:34,009
So these are my girls.

457
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,177
Say hello.

458
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,314
He is not well.

459
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,815
Girls, why don't you
unpack the food?

460
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,518
Would you like some?

461
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:47,089
You want one?

462
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:49,326
- Yeah, have it all.
- Why don't we get some firewood?

463
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,693
It's good, isn't it?

464
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:55,831
That's nice, huh?

465
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:04,673
Marmee, we don't need our toes.
I think I've lost one.

466
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:06,909
Has anyone else
lost their toe?

467
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:10,580
- That was amazing.
- I can't feel my feet.

468
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,785
- Is it fairies?
- Santa Claus.

469
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,356
- It's Aunt March.
- Mr. Laurence sent it.

470
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:21,757
- The Laurence boy's grandfather?
- Yes.

471
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,125
- Why?
- He saw you

472
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,960
giving your
Christmas breakfast away.

473
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:26,463
He wanted you
to enjoy the day.

474
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,331
I thought he was a mean old man.

475
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:29,499
It's so generous.

476
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,699
His grandson, Laurie,

477
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,168
put the idea into his head.

478
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:34,703
I know he did.
We should make friends with him.

479
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:38,040
Boys scare me, and that
big old house scares me.

480
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:40,377
Jenny Snow says
Mr. Laurence disowned his son

481
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,345
after he went off
with an Italian woman.

482
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,079
Now his grandson
is an orphan

483
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:47,016
and spends his time in that
house locked up with his tutor.

484
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:49,352
He's a very kind man
who lost his little girl

485
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,921
when she was only a child.
Now his son as well.

486
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,756
- His daughter died?
- So sad.

487
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,492
Doesn't Laurie
seem so romantic?

488
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,394
- He's half Italian.
- What do you know?

489
00:31:57,527 --> 00:31:58,994
You've barely spoken
to him. Ow!

490
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:00,996
I'm not responsible
for this feast,

491
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,299
but I have got a surprise.

492
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,201
A letter from Father!

493
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,902
Don't I wish I could go?

494
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:09,071
Jo, we can't give up
our only brother.

495
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:11,341
It must be so disagreeable
to sleep in a tent.

496
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,577
Jo sits in back,
so we can't see her cry. Ow!

497
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,412
- What if I do?
- Will he be coming home?

498
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:17,846
He'll stay and work faithfully
as long as he can.

499
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,482
We won't ask
for him to come back

500
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,518
a minute sooner
than he can be spared.

501
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:25,522
"Give them all
my dear love and a kiss.

502
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:29,526
"Tell them I think of them

503
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,696
"and find my best comforts
in their affection at all times.

504
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:36,533
"A year seems a very long time
to wait before I see them.

505
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,602
"But remind them
that while we wait,

506
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,571
"we may all work,
so these hard days...

507
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:44,206
"need not be wasted.

508
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:47,042
<i>"I know that they will
be loving children to you.</i>

509
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,145
<i>"Do their duty faithfully.</i>

510
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:53,148
<i>"Fight their enemies bravely.</i>

511
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:57,721
<i>And conquer themselves
so beautifully."</i>

512
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:00,724
<i>The Witch's Curse,</i>
a play by Jo March.

513
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:05,027
Make it sweet
and swift and strong...

514
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,029
<i>"That when I
come back to them..."</i>

515
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:09,031
Spirit, answer now my song.

516
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:11,534
<i>"...I may be...</i>

517
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:14,069
<i>fonder and prouder
than ever..."</i>

518
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,540
<i>"of my little women."</i>

519
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:20,543
Brava!

520
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:26,616
Excuse me. Excuse me.

521
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,419
Excuse me.
Your stop, ma'am.

522
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:31,588
Oh, thank you.

523
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:33,623
<i>She's gone? Why?</i>

524
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:35,991
I don't know. She just left.

525
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,860
She didn't say
if she was coming back?

526
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,995
We didn't have
a heart-to-heart, professor.

527
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:43,533
Why are you just sitting there?
Please, go, go. Dust something.

528
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,833
And what about the girls?

529
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,770
She was the best teacher
they ever had.

530
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,003
I know.

531
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,711
<i>It is so hard to go back
to work after such good times.</i>

532
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,379
I wish it was Christmas
every day.

533
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,381
Or New Year's.
Wouldn't that be exciting?

534
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,182
We are a bunch
of ungrateful minxes.

535
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:09,783
Don't say
such despicable things.

536
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,919
I like strong words
that mean something.

537
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,289
I have to go back,
and I don't have any limes.

538
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:16,524
- Limes?
- Girls are trading pickled limes,

539
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,959
and I'm in debt.
I owe ever so many limes.

540
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:20,794
- Will this do?
- What'd you do that for?

541
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,763
- Meg, thank you.
- I know what it is

542
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,099
to want things
and feel less than other girls.

543
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,269
That and the drawings
will wipe out my debt.

544
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,403
- What drawings?
- Nothing.

545
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,937
I'm glad Mother
doesn't make me

546
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,439
go to school
with those girls.

547
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,674
Hurry. I'll be late.

548
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:34,342
Beth, after shopping,
I need you

549
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:36,444
to work through
the new sums and spelling.

550
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,747
- I'll check it when I get home.
- Oh, fine.

551
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,780
Bye.

552
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,968
Ooh!

553
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,571
- Josephine.
- Yes?

554
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,940
- Oh! Josephine.
- Yes? Here.

555
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:10,245
Is there a reason
you stopped reading Belsham?

556
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:12,514
I'm sorry.
I'll continue.

557
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,817
You mind yourself, deary.
Someday you'll need me

558
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,254
and you'll wish
you had behaved better.

559
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:21,356
Thank you, Aunt March,
for your employment

560
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,757
and your many kindnesses,

561
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,992
but I intend to make
my own way in the world.

562
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,628
Oh, well.

563
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,264
No. No one makes
their own way.

564
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,831
Not really.

565
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:34,068
Least of all, a woman.
You'll need to marry well.

566
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:36,970
- But you are not married.
- That's because I'm rich.

567
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:39,307
And I made sure
to keep hold of my money.

568
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:41,810
Unlike your father.

569
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:44,845
So the only way to be an
unmarried woman is to be rich?

570
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,980
- Yes.
- There are precious few ways

571
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:49,517
- for women to make money.
- That's not true.

572
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,386
You could run a cathouse.

573
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,588
Or go on the stage.

574
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:55,824
Practically the same thing.

575
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,991
Other than that,
you're right.

576
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,194
Precious few ways
for women.

577
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:03,498
- That's why you should heed me.
- So I can get married.

578
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:07,968
No. So you can live a better
life than your poor mother has.

579
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:13,073
- But Marmee loves her life.
- You don't know what she loves.

580
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:15,976
Your father cared more about
educating freedmen's children

581
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,145
than he did about caring
for his own family.

582
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:19,681
Yes, but he was right.

583
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:23,050
Well, it's possible
to be right and foolish.

584
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,519
Well, I don't think so.

585
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,987
Well, you're not paid
to think.

586
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,296
I know you don't care much
about marriage now.

587
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,966
Can't say I blame you.

588
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:43,872
But I intend to go
to Europe one more time

589
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:47,141
and I need a companion,

590
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:49,444
so how would you like to be
the person I take?

591
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:51,646
I'd like that
more than anything.

592
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,882
All right, then read.

593
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,484
And don't sneak around.

594
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:58,420
I don't like sneaks.

595
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:02,156
<i>President Lincoln.</i>

596
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,792
No, Father's fighting for him.

597
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:05,593
My father says
the war is a waste

598
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:07,629
and we should let
them keep their labor.

599
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,029
Susan, it is immoral.

600
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:10,732
Everyone benefited
from the system,

601
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,032
including you Marches.

602
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,902
Why should only
the South be punished?

603
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,470
Maybe we should
all be punished.

604
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:17,037
The Marches
love a cause.

605
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:19,139
Fine. Just do Mr. Davis.

606
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,478
- I don't know if I should.
- I'll wipe out your debt

607
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,814
and give you
five more limes besides.

608
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:29,116
...your spelling and, moreover,
your reading habit.

609
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:44,599
Miss March.

610
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:48,536
<i>Sit down.</i>

611
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,307
Sit down, Laurie.

612
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,107
Latin is a privilege.

613
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,844
Please,
you have to learn this.

614
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,679
I can't afford
to lose this position.

615
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,047
- Return to the Cicero...
- There's a girl out there.

616
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,717
- No, there is not.
- Yes, Mr. Brooke, there's a girl.

617
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,719
No, there is not.

618
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,826
I'll never get
to go home again.

619
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,362
- Oh, there is a girl.
- That's a girl.

620
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,998
Hello there. Are you hurt?

621
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,835
- I'm Amy.
- Hello, Amy. I'm Laurie.

622
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,471
I know. You brought my sister
back after the dance.

623
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,640
I would've never
have sprained my ankle.

624
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:28,510
I have lovely small feet,
the best in the family.

625
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:33,180
But I can never go home again
because I'm in such trouble.

626
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:34,983
Look.

627
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:37,519
Mr. Davis hit me.

628
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:43,992
Tell the servants I want this
painting purchased immediately!

629
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,594
- Amy! Are you in here?
- Meg! My hand. Look.

630
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,195
- Jo.
- What richness.

631
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,097
- It hurts so much.
- You ought to be

632
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:51,599
the happiest boy in the world.

633
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,368
A fellow can't live
on books alone.

634
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,035
- I could. What did you do?
- Nothing.

635
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,170
I did a drawing,
and then Mr. Davis hit me.

636
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,507
Oh, Christopher Columbus,
look at that.

637
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,876
That's my grandfather.
Are you scared of him?

638
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,912
I'm not scared of anyone.
He looks stern,

639
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,847
but my grandfather
was more handsome.

640
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,715
Jo, we do not
compare grandfathers.

641
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,384
You think
he's more handsome, eh?

642
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:12,754
Oh... No, actually,
you are very handsome.

643
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,557
- I didn't mean...
- I knew your mother's father.

644
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,659
You've got his spirit.

645
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,827
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

646
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,197
You are not to attend
that school anymore.

647
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:26,199
Good. That man
has always been an idiot.

648
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,836
- Jo will teach you.
- Me? I already teach Beth.

649
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,539
- You're a good teacher.
- Yes, women being taught at home

650
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,007
is more proper, I believe.

651
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,075
Only because schools
for women are poor.

652
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,711
Indeed. Quite right.

653
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,346
I wish all the girls
would leave

654
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:40,381
- and he would die.
- You did wrong.

655
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:43,318
- There will be consequences.
- I didn't even do anything.

656
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:45,253
- I just did a drawing.
- Thank you so much

657
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:47,622
- for taking care of Amy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

658
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:50,058
My girls have a way
of getting into mischief.

659
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,659
Well, so do I.

660
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:54,094
Then you'll run over
and we'll take care of you.

661
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,598
Come over whenever you'd like.
Invite Beth as well.

662
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,934
- Yes! Beth would adore the piano.
- Is she the quiet one?

663
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:01,336
Yes, that's our Beth.

664
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,005
Tell that little girl
to use our piano.

665
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,807
Jo, borrow whatever book
you'd like.

666
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,742
- Can I come look at paintings?
- Yes.

667
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,744
There's also
a lovely greenhouse.

668
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,413
We must go. Girls.

669
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:15,717
- Can you buy this painting?
- I'm going to take this one.

670
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,652
- If that's okay.
- I'll bring it back soon.

671
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:19,220
Thank you again.

672
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:20,622
Thank you for my hand!

673
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,256
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

674
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,729
Oh, uh, Miss Meg?

675
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,430
You forgot your glove.

676
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:40,341
Well, back to work.

677
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:41,609
Back to work.

678
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:02,030
Order! Order.
Order. Order!

679
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:05,500
A new play written
by Miss Jo March

680
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,301
will appear
at the Barnville Theater

681
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:10,371
in the course of the next
few weeks that will surpass

682
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:14,342
anything ever seen before
on the American stage.

683
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,210
Starring
the greatest actress

684
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:19,147
from here to the Mississippi
River, Miss Meg March.

685
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,216
- Yes. There we go. Very good.
- Excellent. Bravo, bravo.

686
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,953
- Weekly report. Meg good, Jo bad.
- Mm-hm.

687
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:29,290
Beth very good.
And Amy sort of middling.

688
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:31,459
- Very well done, sirs.
- Excellent.

689
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,628
- Excellent, excellent.
- Bravo.

690
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:35,530
Mr. President and gentlemen,

691
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:38,566
I wish to propose the admission
of a new member.

692
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,036
One who would be
deeply, deeply grateful

693
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:47,041
and would add immensely
to the spirit of the club.

694
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:48,710
I propose...

695
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:53,848
Mr. Theodore Laurence!

696
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:55,383
- Absolutely not.
- No.

697
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,519
- What? Come, now. Let's have him.
- He's a real boy.

698
00:41:58,653 --> 00:41:59,954
We don't want any boys.

699
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:01,556
- This is a club for ladies.
- Yes.

700
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:02,990
- I think we should do it.
- Why?

701
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:04,959
- Even if we're afraid, I say yes.
- Why?

702
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,527
- It's Laurie.
- What? No.

703
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:08,963
- It'll change everything.
- All right, I call a vote.

704
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:11,299
- Put your hands up.
- Don't put your hand up.

705
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:12,967
Put your hand up. It's Laurie.

706
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:14,235
Fine. Aye.

707
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:15,970
There is no time
like the present...

708
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,041
Ladies, ladies, please, please.

709
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,710
This is my stratagem.
I deserve the blame.

710
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:25,246
Jo only gave in to it
after lots of teasing.

711
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,415
Yes. I merely wish to say

712
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:30,618
as a slight token
of my gratitude that I...

713
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,055
- Yes, yes.
- Go on.

714
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,790
As a means of promoting

715
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,760
friendly relations
between adjoining nations.

716
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:41,796
And thus, I propose
this set of keys

717
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,601
for a little post office I've
made in the forest by the pond.

718
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:49,504
Yes, four keys.
They're for you, darling.

719
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:53,608
- Meg, yes, yes. And for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

720
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,677
This is for me. Without further
ado, thank you for your favor.

721
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,646
I will take my seat
as part of the club.

722
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:04,585
- Yes, well. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Bravo, bravo.

723
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,756
Welcome, Laurie.

724
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:24,505
- Three, four, five.
- You both got five.

725
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,841
- I asked the doctor.
- That's a draw, I think.

726
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:29,744
- It doesn't make sense.
- I can't believe it.

727
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,145
Hello.

728
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,613
Jo!

729
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,021
Daisy and Demi!
Can I have a hug?

730
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:41,923
Oh, you've gotten so big.

731
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,026
I wish you were here
to teach them.

732
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,427
I know. Well, I'm here now.

733
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:48,696
- So good to have you home.
- Take this off.

734
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,798
I think the
loneliness got to Beth,

735
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,567
though she ain't
said anything.

736
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,206
- Where is Beth?
- She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo.

737
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:01,175
We thought she was better, but
the fever'd weakened her heart.

738
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,545
Take this and find her
the best doctor you can.

739
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,248
You need this
to live in New York.

740
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,349
No, I'm not going back.
I'm using the rest

741
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,551
to take her to the sea
and get her strong.

742
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:15,507
When's Amy coming home?

743
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,778
- We didn't want to worry her.
- Does she not know?

744
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:22,956
Beth insisted
we not tell her

745
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:25,892
because she didn't want
to ruin Amy's trip.

746
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:30,665
Amy has always had a talent

747
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,767
for getting out
of the hard parts of life.

748
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,568
Jo, don't be angry
with your sister.

749
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,780
I can't seem to find anything.

750
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,682
Marmee, have you seen my glove?

751
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:49,650
When did you last see it?

752
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:54,187
Jo! Jo, where are you?

753
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:56,389
- I can't find my other glove.
- Take mine.

754
00:44:56,523 --> 00:44:58,626
- We're going to be late.
- Where are you going?

755
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,160
You're not invited.

756
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:02,062
You're going
somewhere with Laurie.

757
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:04,364
- I know it.
- Yes, we are. Now stop bothering.

758
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:06,232
- You have the tickets?
- Yes. Hurry.

759
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:09,502
- You're going to the theater.
- Meg, please, can I come?

760
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:11,538
- Sorry, you weren't invited.
- You can't go.

761
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:13,473
Don't be a baby
and whine about it.

762
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:15,975
I've been shut up here.
I never get to go anywhere.

763
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,579
- Beth has her piano. I'm lonely.
- I can teach you chords.

764
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:22,048
I don't want chords.
I want to go to the theater.

765
00:45:22,182 --> 00:45:24,685
I think you'd hate to poke in
where you're not wanted.

766
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:26,953
We already have to deal
with dull Mr. Brooke.

767
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:29,489
- I like him. He's kind.
- But I can pay for myself.

768
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,990
You will not come.

769
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:32,827
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but Jo is right.

770
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:34,394
- No! Please.
- Next time.

771
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:37,163
- Come, Meg. Stop petting her.
- Please, please, please!

772
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:39,532
Ugh, you'll be sorry
for this, Jo March!

773
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,535
- Amy!
- You will! You'll regret this!

774
00:45:45,538 --> 00:45:48,041
Stop looking at me like that!

775
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,357
Oh, um...

776
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:43,731
- I loved every second of it.
- Ow! Jo!

777
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:47,967
- I thought the actress was... Oh!
- She was very, very good.

778
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:51,571
- Yes, she was really good.
- She was. She was very good.

779
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:08,988
Bye!

780
00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:11,157
Oh, I love the theater.

781
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,694
Meg, you're a million times
better than she was.

782
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:15,528
Although she was
a terrific fainter.

783
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:17,765
I wonder how she managed
to turn so white.

784
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:20,333
That Mr. Brooke,
could he be any more obsequious?

785
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,135
I thought he was
very well-mannered.

786
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:24,672
Hold on. Let me
just get this idea down.

787
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,312
Beth, what's your
favorite eye color?

788
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:34,614
- Purple.
- Mr. Brooke has blue eyes

789
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:37,250
and an old soul, which is
more important than money.

790
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:39,252
Has anyone taken my novel?

791
00:47:39,385 --> 00:47:41,287
- No.
- No. Why?

792
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:53,701
Amy, you've got it.

793
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,368
- No, I haven't.
- That's a lie.

794
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,371
I haven't got it, I don't know
where it is, and I don't care.

795
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:00,073
- Tell me, or I'll make you!
- Ahh!

796
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:02,308
- I burnt it up!
- Marmee!

797
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:06,546
I burnt your book. I told you
I'd make you pay, and I did!

798
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,249
All right, Jo! Jo! Jo!
Please get off her!

799
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:10,918
- Jo. Amy.
- Ahh! Ahh!

800
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,352
- Get her off!
- I hate you!

801
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:21,896
I'm sorry, Jo.

802
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:24,330
Amy.

803
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:33,039
It's just the only thing
you care about is your writing.

804
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,808
It's not as if
I could've hurt you

805
00:48:34,942 --> 00:48:36,476
by ruining one of your dresses,

806
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,478
and I really did
want to hurt you.

807
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,183
I am the most sorry for it now.
I'm so sorry.

808
00:48:44,317 --> 00:48:46,352
Oh, Jo...

809
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:48,989
don't let the sun go down
on your anger.

810
00:48:49,122 --> 00:48:50,758
Forgive her.

811
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,225
Help each other.

812
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,094
And you begin again tomorrow.

813
00:48:57,196 --> 00:48:59,900
She doesn't deserve
my forgiveness.

814
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:03,737
And I will hate her.
I will hate her forever!

815
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:37,303
Morning. Brisk and brilliant
out. Last day at the river.

816
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:38,571
- Get your ice skates.
- Let's go!

817
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:39,807
Jo, you promised me

818
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,608
I could come last time. Jo!

819
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,279
Is she going to be
like this forever?

820
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:49,482
It was a very hard loss
for her.

821
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:51,819
Is there nothing I can do?

822
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:56,255
Go after her.
Don't say anything

823
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:58,324
till Jo has got good-natured
with Laurie,

824
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,426
and then just say
some kind thing.

825
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,630
I'm sure
she'll be friends again.

826
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:05,032
Jo, wait!

827
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:06,967
I'm coming!

828
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,703
You said
I could come last time!

829
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,207
Jo, Laurie, wait!
I'm coming!

830
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,609
Wait!

831
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:18,979
Jo!

832
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:20,313
Stay near the edge.

833
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:22,215
- It's not safe in the middle.
- Got it.

834
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:23,483
Jo!

835
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,322
Jo, I'm coming!

836
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:36,195
Jo!

837
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,298
Jo, let's go!

838
00:50:40,968 --> 00:50:42,102
Uh...

839
00:50:44,504 --> 00:50:45,773
Jo, wait!

840
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:54,715
Jo!

841
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:06,026
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

842
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,595
- Help! Help me!
- Amy. It's Amy.

843
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,231
- Come on. Come on, Jo.
- Ahh! Jo!

844
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:14,333
Ahh, Jo!

845
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:18,237
Jo, get a branch.
Get a branch.

846
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,773
- Amy.
- Jo!

847
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:21,742
- Amy. Amy.
- Ahh!

848
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,444
Help! I can't breathe!

849
00:51:24,577 --> 00:51:28,448
Jo, help me pull. Amy,
grab the branch. Grab it, Amy.

850
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:41,762
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my sister, my sister.

851
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,401
She's asleep.

852
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:53,907
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

853
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:57,510
She'll be fine.

854
00:51:57,644 --> 00:52:01,380
The doctor said that he didn't
even think she'd catch cold.

855
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,184
What is wrong with me?

856
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:07,087
I've made so many resolutions,

857
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:11,257
and I've written sad notes,
and I've cried over my sins...

858
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,294
but it just
doesn't seem to help.

859
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:20,968
When I get in a passion,
I get so savage.

860
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:23,603
I could hurt anyone,
and I'd enjoy it.

861
00:52:24,872 --> 00:52:26,840
You remind me of myself.

862
00:52:28,942 --> 00:52:31,344
But you're never angry.

863
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:34,280
I'm angry nearly
every day of my life.

864
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:37,483
You are?

865
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:40,888
I am not patient by nature.

866
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:44,323
But with nearly
40 years of effort,

867
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:47,094
I'm learning to not let it
get the better of me.

868
00:52:50,264 --> 00:52:52,232
Well, I'll do the same, then.

869
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:56,637
I hope you'll do a great deal
better than me.

870
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:03,609
There are some natures
too noble to curb

871
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:06,079
and too lofty to bend.

872
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:28,669
Jo.

873
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:31,537
Oh, Beth, my love. Oh!

874
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:36,910
- You didn't need to come.
- Oh, I never should have left.

875
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:39,646
Do you need anything? Here.

876
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,014
Take some water.

877
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:47,321
It's so good
to see your face.

878
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:50,224
We're going to the sea
to get you strong and well.

879
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:51,792
- The sea?
- Mm, I want you dancing

880
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:54,360
by the time
Amy gets back.

881
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:56,395
She's not cutting
her trip short, is she?

882
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:58,397
- No, no.
- Good.

883
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,968
Is there any news?
What does she say?

884
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:03,203
She writes
that Laurie is there.

885
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:05,339
I'm glad he's with her.

886
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:08,208
He won't respond
to any of my letters.

887
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:11,011
Do you miss him?

888
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:13,780
I miss everything.

889
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:16,917
I know.

890
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:22,890
Hurry up!
Meg's gonna be gone for a week.

891
00:54:23,023 --> 00:54:25,125
- We're coming!
- Take the other carriage, Laurie.

892
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:27,460
Spy on Meg. Make sure
she doesn't fall in love.

893
00:54:27,593 --> 00:54:28,896
- I will.
- It was nice of Annie

894
00:54:29,029 --> 00:54:30,596
to invite me
to her debutante ball.

895
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:33,867
- Thank you for letting me go.
- Just be who you are.

896
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:37,804
And wear this to the ball.
It was mine when I was your age.

897
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:40,573
I've never understood
saving jewelry until marriage.

898
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:43,076
You should have something
that's just yours.

899
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,078
Pretty things
should be enjoyed.

900
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:47,347
Yes, pretty things
should be enjoyed.

901
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:49,816
- Can I see it?
- Hannah!

902
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,752
I wish I could go
to the debutante ball.

903
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:54,688
Do you think this is a good
idea, her going away like this?

904
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:56,256
Girls have to
go into the world

905
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,292
and make up
their own minds about things.

906
00:54:58,424 --> 00:55:01,094
- Don't forget about us.
- I won't, Jo. It's only a week.

907
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:03,096
- It's beautiful.
- It's not yours.

908
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,563
It would look good on me.

909
00:55:04,698 --> 00:55:06,700
She needs to have
some decent shoes.

910
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,602
Thank you for the carriage,
Mr. Laurence.

911
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:12,139
- I don't know how to repay you.
- Nonsense, nonsense.

912
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:14,708
I said hi to the horses.
They're very nice.

913
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,243
Although
there is one thing.

914
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:17,778
It occurred to me today

915
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:20,647
that my daughter's piano
suffers from want of use.

916
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:23,116
Any of your girls
like to run over

917
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,753
and practice on it now and then?
Just to keep it in tune.

918
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:29,289
If they don't care to come,
why, then never mind.

919
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:32,326
Oh, sir,
they do care.

920
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,526
Very, very much.

921
00:55:34,628 --> 00:55:36,163
You're the musical girl, huh?

922
00:55:36,296 --> 00:55:38,832
I love it dearly.
And I'll come

923
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:41,768
if you are quite sure nobody
will hear me and be disturbed.

924
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:43,602
Not a soul, my dear.

925
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,142
- Miss you.
- Bye.

926
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,278
- Can I borrow your ribbons?
- No.

927
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:53,180
- Bye!
- Be good. Enjoy the ball.

928
00:55:53,313 --> 00:55:56,149
- Bye. I'll be back soon.
- Don't go and get married.

929
00:55:56,283 --> 00:55:57,317
Don't go fall in love.

930
00:55:57,451 --> 00:55:58,919
- Come back right now.
- I love you.

931
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:00,954
- Right this second.
- Right this second.

932
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:13,967
Whoa, there.

933
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:21,708
Oh, ha, thank you.

934
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:47,334
I'd be so excited about tonight.

935
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:51,705
- Of course.
- Oh, no, I don't actually...

936
00:56:53,606 --> 00:56:55,642
What dress will you
wear tonight, Meg?

937
00:56:55,776 --> 00:56:57,377
- I will wear this one.
- That one?

938
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:59,012
Can't you send home
for another?

939
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:00,814
- I haven't got another.
- Only the one?

940
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:03,083
- Oh, that's so funny.
- Not at all.

941
00:57:03,216 --> 00:57:05,519
There's no need
in sending home, Daisy.

942
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:07,654
I'm going to
call you Daisy now.

943
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:09,256
I've got a sweet dress
laid away.

944
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:11,758
You'll wear it to please me,
won't you, Daisy?

945
00:57:11,892 --> 00:57:14,828
- Um, if it's all right.
- Of course.

946
00:57:51,932 --> 00:57:53,567
Everyone's in love
with you, Daisy.

947
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,269
- You have to keep my dress.
- I can't keep your dress.

948
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:57,771
- You have to. Please.
- No.

949
00:57:57,904 --> 00:57:59,206
Everyone loves you in it.

950
00:58:01,842 --> 00:58:03,443
Have fun, little Daisy.

951
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:06,046
Laurie. I didn't know
you were going to come.

952
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,781
Supposed to be
a surprise.

953
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:10,750
And what
a lovely surprise it is.

954
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:14,254
- Why are they calling you Daisy?
- It's their pet name for me.

955
00:58:16,056 --> 00:58:17,924
Meg is a perfectly
good name.

956
00:58:18,058 --> 00:58:23,163
It's just like playing a part
to be Daisy for a little while.

957
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,102
What would Jo say?

958
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,643
You wouldn't actually marry
one of these men, would you?

959
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:40,447
I might.

960
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,449
You'll get
a terrible headache tomorrow.

961
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:51,324
- Do you like how I look?
- No, I don't.

962
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,027
Why not?

963
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,096
I don't like fuss and feathers.

964
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,299
You're the rudest boy
I ever saw.

965
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:33,126
Please forgive me
and come dance.

966
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,229
I'm afraid it would be
too disagreeable for you.

967
01:00:36,363 --> 01:00:41,434
I don't like your dress, but
I think you are just splendid.

968
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:45,740
- Really?
- Really.

969
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:53,513
I know it's silly,
but please don't tell Jo.

970
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,181
Let me have my fun tonight.

971
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:58,451
I'll be desperately good
for the rest of my life.

972
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,051
I'm sorry, John.

973
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:35,690
The silk was
the first real expense.

974
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:42,862
Ahem, $50, while a lot,
is not, I suppose,

975
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:45,532
too much for a dress
with all the notions

976
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:48,034
that are needed
to finish it these days.

977
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:55,408
It's not exactly
even a dress yet. It's...

978
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:59,045
It's just the fabric.

979
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:02,449
Oh.

980
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:04,617
I see.

981
01:02:06,186 --> 01:02:07,688
I know you're angry,
John.

982
01:02:07,822 --> 01:02:10,023
I don't mean to waste money,
but I can't resist

983
01:02:10,156 --> 01:02:11,891
when I see Sallie buying
all she wants

984
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:13,560
and pitying me
because I don't.

985
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:19,399
I try to be contented,
but it is hard.

986
01:02:19,532 --> 01:02:22,202
And I'm tired of being poor.

987
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:27,407
I was afraid of this.

988
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,309
I do my best, Meg.

989
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:30,845
Oh, John.

990
01:02:30,977 --> 01:02:34,080
My dear, kind,
hardworking boy.

991
01:02:34,214 --> 01:02:37,917
It was so ungrateful
and wicked.

992
01:02:38,051 --> 01:02:40,253
How could I say it?

993
01:02:40,387 --> 01:02:43,089
- Perhaps you meant it.
- No, I didn't.

994
01:02:43,223 --> 01:02:45,558
We'll work out a way
to get you your coat as well,

995
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:48,595
and then won't we be grand,
the two of us?

996
01:02:48,729 --> 01:02:51,231
I can't afford it,
my dear.

997
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:54,267
- John.
- I need to go to bed.

998
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,703
John.

999
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:01,876
And I really am very sorry
that you've had to do

1000
01:03:02,008 --> 01:03:04,010
without so many
beautiful things...

1001
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:06,212
and that you're married
to someone

1002
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:08,415
who can't give
them to you.

1003
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:20,460
Hello, Amy.

1004
01:03:20,593 --> 01:03:22,262
I don't want to see you.

1005
01:03:22,395 --> 01:03:25,031
Amy, don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry for how I behaved.

1006
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:27,802
- Have you been drinking?
- Why are you being so hard on me?

1007
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:30,103
- It's 4 p.m.
- Someone has to do it.

1008
01:03:31,872 --> 01:03:34,974
When do you begin your
great work of art, Raphaella?

1009
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:38,178
- Never.
- "Never"? What? Why?

1010
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:40,246
I'm a failure.

1011
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,015
Jo is in New York
being a writer,

1012
01:03:42,148 --> 01:03:43,316
and I'm a failure.

1013
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,452
That's quite a statement
to make at 20.

1014
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:47,187
Rome took all the vanity
out of me,

1015
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,589
and Paris made me realize
I'd never be a genius,

1016
01:03:49,723 --> 01:03:52,025
so I'm giving up
all my foolish artistic hopes.

1017
01:03:52,158 --> 01:03:54,427
Why give up? You have
so much talent and energy.

1018
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:56,262
Talent isn't genius.

1019
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:58,933
And no amount of energy
can make it so.

1020
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:01,167
I want to be great
or nothing.

1021
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:03,804
And I will not be
some commonplace dauber,

1022
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:06,139
and I don't intend
to try anymore.

1023
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:14,280
What women are allowed into
the club of geniuses anyway?

1024
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:20,153
- The Brontes?
- Hm.

1025
01:04:20,286 --> 01:04:21,988
- That's it?
- Yes, I think so.

1026
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:24,692
And who always
declares genius?

1027
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:26,927
- Men, I suppose.
- Cutting down the competition.

1028
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:29,964
That's a very
complicated argument

1029
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:31,197
to make me feel better.

1030
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:32,867
Do you though?
Do you feel better?

1031
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:36,035
I do think,
male or female,

1032
01:04:36,169 --> 01:04:39,005
- I am of middling talent.
- "Middling talent"?

1033
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:48,515
Then may I ask
your last portrait be of me?

1034
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:50,416
- All right.
- Now that you've given up

1035
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,687
- your foolish artistic hopes...
- Mm-hm?

1036
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:55,522
what are you gonna do
with your life?

1037
01:04:55,656 --> 01:04:57,390
Polish up all my other talents

1038
01:04:57,524 --> 01:05:00,197
and become
an ornament to society.

1039
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:02,730
Mm, that's where Fred Vaughn
comes in, I suppose.

1040
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:06,199
- Don't make fun.
- I said his name.

1041
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,868
- You're not engaged, I hope.
- No.

1042
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:15,275
But you will be if he goes down
properly on one knee?

1043
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:18,378
Most likely, yes.

1044
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:22,048
He's rich.
Richer than you, even.

1045
01:05:22,182 --> 01:05:24,951
I understand queens of society
can't get on without money,

1046
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:26,454
although it does sound odd

1047
01:05:26,587 --> 01:05:29,055
from the mouth of one
of your mother's girls.

1048
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:32,859
I've always known
I would marry rich.

1049
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:35,328
- Why should I be ashamed?
- Nothing to be ashamed of,

1050
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,130
as long as you love him.

1051
01:05:37,263 --> 01:05:39,567
I believe we have
some power over who we love.

1052
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,001
It isn't something
that just happens to a person.

1053
01:05:42,135 --> 01:05:44,505
I think the poets
might disagree.

1054
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:46,406
Well, I'm not a poet.

1055
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,007
I'm just a woman.

1056
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:54,280
And as a woman, there's no way
for me to make my own money.

1057
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:58,753
Not enough to earn a living
or to support my family.

1058
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:00,920
If I had my own money,
which I don't,

1059
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:02,757
that money would belong
to my husband

1060
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:04,357
the moment we got married.

1061
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,227
If we had children,
they would be his, not mine.

1062
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,330
They would be his property.
So don't sit there and tell me

1063
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:13,601
that marriage isn't an economic
proposition, because it is.

1064
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:18,104
It may not be for you,
but it most certainly is for me.

1065
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:24,010
Oh, that's Fred.
Can you unbutton me, please?

1066
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:42,996
Thank you.

1067
01:06:50,403 --> 01:06:51,839
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

1068
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:54,073
You look beautiful.

1069
01:06:57,478 --> 01:06:58,945
You are beautiful.

1070
01:07:08,622 --> 01:07:10,491
Fred!

1071
01:07:10,624 --> 01:07:12,125
I've missed you.

1072
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:32,746
This is Fred Vaughn
and his sister, Kate.

1073
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,347
Of course you know
Mr. Brooke.

1074
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:36,684
This is Meg, Amy,
Beth and Jo.

1075
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:40,186
- So pleased to meet you.
- Oh, how elegant. Heh.

1076
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,790
I'm Amy March.
You remember that name.

1077
01:07:42,923 --> 01:07:44,625
I'm gonna find you
one day in London.

1078
01:07:44,758 --> 01:07:46,059
Oh, I certainly will.

1079
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,852
- Oh, that missed a boat.
- That's very kind.

1080
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:16,222
- Well...
- Sorry.

1081
01:08:16,356 --> 01:08:18,358
I know
something you don't know.

1082
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:19,627
Tell me this second.

1083
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,462
Has Meg perhaps
mislaid a glove?

1084
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:24,163
- Mr. Brooke has it!
- Yes.

1085
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:25,499
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

1086
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:26,567
- Where?
- In his pocket.

1087
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,801
- All this time?
- Yes.

1088
01:08:27,935 --> 01:08:29,670
- Isn't it romantic?
- No, it's horrid.

1089
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:32,138
- I thought you'd be pleased.
- At the idea of anybody

1090
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:34,040
coming to take Meg away?
No, thank you.

1091
01:08:34,173 --> 01:08:36,810
You'll feel better when
somebody comes to take you away.

1092
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:38,211
I'd like to see anyone try.

1093
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:40,380
I would like to see
someone try as well.

1094
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,690
<i>"We could never have
loved the earth so well</i>

1095
01:08:49,823 --> 01:08:52,560
<i>"if we had had
no childhood in it,</i>

1096
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,294
<i>"if it were not the earth</i>

1097
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:57,698
<i>"where the same flowers come up
again every spring</i>

1098
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:01,367
<i>"that we used to gather
with our tiny fingers.</i>

1099
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:04,572
<i>"What novelty is worth
that sweet monotony</i>

1100
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:07,608
"where everything is known
and loved

1101
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:09,375
because it is known?"

1102
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:13,313
- How great is that?
- Mm.

1103
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:15,049
I love to listen
to you read, Jo,

1104
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:17,918
but I love it better when you
read stories you've written.

1105
01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:20,186
I don't have any new stories.

1106
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,421
Why not?

1107
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:26,694
Haven't written any.

1108
01:09:28,062 --> 01:09:29,563
You have a pencil and paper.

1109
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:31,364
Sit here
and write me something.

1110
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:34,568
I-I can't.

1111
01:09:35,836 --> 01:09:38,939
I don't think
I can anymore.

1112
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:40,373
Why?

1113
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:41,875
It's just...

1114
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:45,546
no one even cares
to hear my stories anyway.

1115
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,982
Write something for me.

1116
01:09:49,315 --> 01:09:51,085
You are a writer.

1117
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,621
Even before anyone knew
or paid you.

1118
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:55,689
I'm very sick, and you must
do what I say.

1119
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:00,761
Do what Marmee
taught us to do.

1120
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:03,262
Do it for someone else.

1121
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:06,467
If you're walking to Vermont,

1122
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,637
there's a Mrs. Sewall
in Keene, New Hampshire,

1123
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,337
who will give you
room and board.

1124
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:12,840
There you are.

1125
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:15,009
You should go home.
I can take care of this.

1126
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,343
No, I need to be here.

1127
01:10:17,478 --> 01:10:19,847
I've spent my whole life
ashamed of my country.

1128
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:23,017
No offense meant,
but you should still be ashamed.

1129
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:24,818
I know. I am.

1130
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:34,428
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am.

1131
01:10:34,561 --> 01:10:36,195
Do you have sons in the Army?

1132
01:10:37,397 --> 01:10:39,099
Yes, ma'am.
I had four.

1133
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:43,470
But two were killed,
and one is a prisoner.

1134
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,171
I'm going to the other,

1135
01:10:45,304 --> 01:10:47,608
who's very sick
in a Washington hospital.

1136
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,913
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

1137
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:58,351
I'd go myself if I was any use,
but as I ain't, I give my boys.

1138
01:11:01,722 --> 01:11:04,591
Sir, I'll get you a blanket...

1139
01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:11,098
to keep you warm.

1140
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:17,838
- Thank you. God bless.
- Bless you, sir.

1141
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:22,408
Mrs. March. Telegram
from Washington, ma'am.

1142
01:11:22,543 --> 01:11:26,212
- Is Jo back yet from Aunt March?
- No, I haven't seen her yet.

1143
01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:28,582
- I've got it!
- Want another pair of shoes?

1144
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:31,719
Thank you. I can't miss
the last train.

1145
01:11:31,852 --> 01:11:34,588
- Did you get Father's shirts?
- Yes, I did.

1146
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,389
What can I do to help, Beth?

1147
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:38,324
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course.

1148
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:41,327
- You find the blanket?
- If I may be of more assistance,

1149
01:11:41,462 --> 01:11:42,930
please tell me.

1150
01:11:43,063 --> 01:11:44,865
I'll look in on the girls
without fail.

1151
01:11:44,998 --> 01:11:46,734
Do we need
more books or cloth?

1152
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:48,869
- Thank you.
- I've always admired your husband.

1153
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:50,336
I pray for a quick recovery.

1154
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:51,872
I found these linens.

1155
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:54,307
- Hannah, medicine?
- The medicine is packed.

1156
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:56,409
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I came to offer myself

1157
01:11:56,543 --> 01:11:57,778
as escort to your mother.

1158
01:11:57,911 --> 01:11:59,913
Mr. Laurence has commissions
in Washington.

1159
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:02,983
It would give me satisfaction
to be of service to her there.

1160
01:12:03,117 --> 01:12:05,119
- Oh!
- Thank you.

1161
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,553
Of course.

1162
01:12:08,222 --> 01:12:09,757
All right, while I'm gone,

1163
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,958
Hannah is in charge.

1164
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:12,659
Remember to check
on the Hummels.

1165
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:14,828
It will be a difficult winter
for everyone.

1166
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:17,296
Will this be enough
for the train?

1167
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:19,099
Twenty-five dollars?

1168
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:21,300
That's not like Aunt March
to be so generous.

1169
01:12:21,435 --> 01:12:23,336
I didn't go to her.
I couldn't bear to.

1170
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:26,073
- Where'd you get the money?
- I only sold what was my own.

1171
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:29,243
- Oh!
- Jo! Your hair!

1172
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,377
- Your one beauty.
- You look like a boy.

1173
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:35,649
Well, it doesn't affect the fate
of the nation, so don't wail.

1174
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:38,152
Oh, I'm so proud
you're my daughter.

1175
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:40,621
I was just crazy
to do something for Father.

1176
01:12:40,754 --> 01:12:42,623
It'll be good
for my vanity anyway.

1177
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:44,290
- That could be nice.
- Never do that.

1178
01:12:44,423 --> 01:12:46,560
- Isn't what I wanted for her.
- Oh, Teddy.

1179
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:50,597
Oh, Jo.

1180
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:53,399
My girls,
I love you more than words can say.

1181
01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:56,603
Be good to each other.
Pray for Father's recovery.

1182
01:12:56,737 --> 01:13:00,007
And I'll be back as soon
as I can. Love you.

1183
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:09,216
Jo.

1184
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:13,453
What is it? Is it Father?

1185
01:13:13,587 --> 01:13:14,721
No.

1186
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:17,858
It's my hair.

1187
01:13:22,696 --> 01:13:25,364
I would feel the same way.

1188
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:27,201
I know you would.

1189
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,673
<i>Laurie, when are you
going back to your grandfather?</i>

1190
01:13:32,806 --> 01:13:34,308
Very soon.

1191
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:37,928
You've said that a dozen times
in the past month.

1192
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,295
Short answers
save trouble.

1193
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:40,931
Well, he is expecting you,

1194
01:13:41,064 --> 01:13:43,100
so why don't you do it?

1195
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:47,104
- Natural depravity, I suppose.
- Natural indolence, you mean.

1196
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:48,772
I'll only plague him if I go,

1197
01:13:48,906 --> 01:13:51,008
so I might as well stay
and plague you longer.

1198
01:13:51,141 --> 01:13:53,777
You can bear it. In fact,
I think it agrees with you.

1199
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:55,813
Stop it. Stop.

1200
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,719
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at you.

1201
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:05,656
I mean, what do you
intend to do?

1202
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:06,790
- With life?
- Yes.

1203
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:08,492
I've been writing an opera.

1204
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:12,029
- I would be the central figure.
- That's a waste of time.

1205
01:14:12,162 --> 01:14:14,330
What would you have me do?

1206
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:26,677
Go and work for your grandfather
and make something of yourself.

1207
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:29,446
You're not playing fair.

1208
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:35,552
Here.

1209
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:41,625
That's... That's very good.

1210
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:44,661
When did you do this one?

1211
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,165
It was the day at the beach.

1212
01:14:49,499 --> 01:14:51,401
First time I met Fred.

1213
01:14:51,535 --> 01:14:52,636
That's right.

1214
01:14:58,642 --> 01:14:59,810
What's he doing?

1215
01:15:02,713 --> 01:15:06,783
He's in London on business.
He'll be back in a few weeks.

1216
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:26,069
Don't marry him.

1217
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,939
What?

1218
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:33,510
Don't marry him.

1219
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,680
Why?

1220
01:15:36,813 --> 01:15:38,916
Why? You know why.

1221
01:15:43,153 --> 01:15:45,390
No. No.

1222
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:47,457
- Yes.
- No. Laurie.

1223
01:15:47,591 --> 01:15:49,059
- What?
- You're being mean.

1224
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:51,728
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What? How am I being mean?

1225
01:15:51,862 --> 01:15:55,632
I have been second to Jo
my whole life in everything.

1226
01:15:55,766 --> 01:15:58,135
I will not be
the person you settle for

1227
01:15:58,268 --> 01:16:00,137
just because
you cannot have her.

1228
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,939
I won't. I won't do it.

1229
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:09,746
I won't. Not when I've spent
my entire life loving you.

1230
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:24,661
I'm making a mold
of my foot for Laurie

1231
01:16:24,795 --> 01:16:26,697
to remind him
I have nice feet.

1232
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:31,935
Mr. Brooke writes that Father is
still very weak but improving.

1233
01:16:32,069 --> 01:16:33,804
Mr. Brooke also says
that Mother

1234
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:35,739
is the best nurse
a man could ask for.

1235
01:16:35,872 --> 01:16:38,642
I wish all the letters were
from Mother and not Mr. Brooke.

1236
01:16:38,775 --> 01:16:40,310
I'm grateful for any letters.

1237
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:42,913
I think the purple is
very fitting for Mr. Laurence.

1238
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:44,114
- Do you agree, Amy?
- Quite.

1239
01:16:44,247 --> 01:16:45,515
The design is very cunning.

1240
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:47,184
I had to thank him
for allowing me

1241
01:16:47,317 --> 01:16:49,353
to play the piano
at his house all the time.

1242
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:50,787
I'm going for groceries.

1243
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:52,789
- Jo, can you get more firewood?
- Mm-hm.

1244
01:16:52,923 --> 01:16:55,025
You haven't been to
the Hummels. We should go.

1245
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:57,160
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves.

1246
01:16:57,294 --> 01:16:58,795
I have to finish this story.

1247
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:00,864
- Marmee said...
- Marmee told us to do lots,

1248
01:17:00,998 --> 01:17:02,599
but we can't
possibly do them all.

1249
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:05,335
I always go myself. You haven't
kept up with your tasks.

1250
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:08,538
- We do. We work.
- Don't worry. We'll find a time.

1251
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:10,240
- But it's been weeks.
- We'll go soon.

1252
01:17:10,374 --> 01:17:12,342
My foot is stuck!
I can't get it out!

1253
01:17:12,477 --> 01:17:15,545
Stop it, Jo! I can't get it out!

1254
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,048
I'm going to lose my foot. Ow!

1255
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:19,883
Fine. I'll go myself.

1256
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,989
Hello. For Mr. Laurence.

1257
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:38,568
Oh! Here she comes.

1258
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:50,381
Beth, look what
they got you!

1259
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:51,948
A letter from
the old gentleman.

1260
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:54,017
Open the note.

1261
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:55,719
Oh, Beth, just look.

1262
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:03,727
Jo, read the letter.
I cannot.

1263
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,695
"Miss Beth March,
I have had

1264
01:18:05,829 --> 01:18:07,697
"many pairs of slippers
in my life,

1265
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:11,101
"but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours.

1266
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:14,004
"And they will always remind me
of the gentle giver.

1267
01:18:14,137 --> 01:18:17,508
"I like to pay my debts and hope
you will accept this gift.

1268
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:20,911
Your grateful friend and
humble servant, James Laurence."

1269
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:23,880
Oh, Beth!
So sweet. "Your humble servant."

1270
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:26,083
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Look how shiny it is!

1271
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:27,552
- Yes.
- It has gold that goes

1272
01:18:27,684 --> 01:18:29,686
- all the way around.
- All the way around!

1273
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,190
- His handwriting is beautiful.
- It's got a little drawer here.

1274
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:49,206
Sir, I wanted
to thank you for...

1275
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:02,886
You remind me...

1276
01:19:03,019 --> 01:19:05,055
so much of my little girl.

1277
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,492
Hm?

1278
01:19:08,758 --> 01:19:10,160
The piano is yours.

1279
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:12,597
I should have given it
to you long ago.

1280
01:19:12,729 --> 01:19:14,164
Thank you.

1281
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:16,601
My child...

1282
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:19,703
you're burning.

1283
01:19:21,271 --> 01:19:23,441
The Hummels
are very sick.

1284
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:34,985
She's resting.

1285
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:37,220
How is she?
Is there anything I can do?

1286
01:19:37,354 --> 01:19:38,955
- What is it?
- Scarlet fever.

1287
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:40,056
What's scarlet fever?

1288
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,324
I visited the Hummels.

1289
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:42,692
The baby has died.

1290
01:19:42,826 --> 01:19:44,529
Have you all
had it before?

1291
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:47,731
- Meg and I have, but Amy hasn't.
- She'll have to be sent away.

1292
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:49,199
I don't want
to be sent away.

1293
01:19:49,332 --> 01:19:51,636
- Aunt March can take her.
- I don't like Aunt March.

1294
01:19:51,768 --> 01:19:54,472
- It's for your own good, child.
- Should we send for Mother?

1295
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:56,039
Now, we shouldn't
worry her.

1296
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,308
I've never wished for money
more than now.

1297
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:02,513
Listen, we'll nurse her
and she'll get better.

1298
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:03,880
She will.

1299
01:20:06,016 --> 01:20:09,753
"The post office in the forest
was a capital little institution

1300
01:20:09,886 --> 01:20:11,354
"and flourished wonderfully,

1301
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:13,290
"for many things
passed through it.

1302
01:20:13,424 --> 01:20:17,060
"Poetry and pickles,
music and gingerbread,

1303
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:20,130
invitations, scoldings
and even puppies."

1304
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:24,569
- It's all about us.
- It is.

1305
01:20:26,136 --> 01:20:28,205
- I love it.
- Mm, it's just a little story.

1306
01:20:28,338 --> 01:20:29,973
Nothing like
what you usually write.

1307
01:20:30,106 --> 01:20:32,342
- Think it's too boring?
- No, it's my favorite one.

1308
01:20:32,476 --> 01:20:33,877
- Really?
- Write me another.

1309
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:35,413
- Yes, ma'am.
- Keep writing them.

1310
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:38,014
- I will.
- Even when I'm not here.

1311
01:20:42,018 --> 01:20:44,354
- Don't say that. Don't say it.
- I have to tell you.

1312
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:46,524
- No, you don't.
- I've had a very long time

1313
01:20:46,657 --> 01:20:48,593
to think about this, and...

1314
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:51,094
- And I'm not afraid.
- No.

1315
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:52,597
Nope.

1316
01:20:55,899 --> 01:20:57,267
It's like the tide going out.

1317
01:20:57,401 --> 01:20:59,670
It goes out slowly,
but it can't be stopped.

1318
01:21:06,243 --> 01:21:08,111
I'll stop it.

1319
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,761
I stopped it before.

1320
01:21:41,044 --> 01:21:43,748
You will get better,
Father will get better,

1321
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,016
and we'll all be
together soon, all right?

1322
01:21:47,317 --> 01:21:49,085
We...

1323
01:21:49,219 --> 01:21:50,787
We can't stop God's will.

1324
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,123
Well, God hasn't met
my will yet.

1325
01:21:53,256 --> 01:21:55,593
What Jo wills
shall be done.

1326
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:13,176
Amy.

1327
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,844
Come here.

1328
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:23,688
- Yes?
- Come, sit.

1329
01:22:31,395 --> 01:22:35,165
If you are very good, one day,
this ring will belong to you.

1330
01:22:37,901 --> 01:22:39,869
- Really?
- If you keep being

1331
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:42,105
a proper young lady,
just see if it doesn't.

1332
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:49,112
You are your family's
hope now.

1333
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:53,216
Beth is sick,
Jo is a lost cause,

1334
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:55,453
and I hear Meg
has had her head turned

1335
01:22:55,586 --> 01:22:57,621
by a penniless tutor, so...

1336
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:02,626
it'll be up to you
to support them all.

1337
01:23:04,428 --> 01:23:06,896
And your indigent parents
in their old age.

1338
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:10,066
So you must marry well.

1339
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:12,670
Hm?

1340
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:16,206
Save your family.

1341
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:20,711
All right, that's, uh...

1342
01:23:20,845 --> 01:23:23,848
That's all I wanted
to say to you.

1343
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:27,685
So you can go back
and do your little painting.

1344
01:23:36,092 --> 01:23:38,863
- Hello, Aunt March.
- Oh.

1345
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:41,565
That Laurence boy
was just here.

1346
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:43,933
- He was?
- What a disappointment

1347
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,870
he's turned out to be.

1348
01:23:46,035 --> 01:23:47,705
Must be the Italian in him.

1349
01:23:47,838 --> 01:23:49,906
Uh, when...
When will he be back?

1350
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:52,410
Mm, he's gone.

1351
01:23:52,543 --> 01:23:53,744
To London.

1352
01:23:55,513 --> 01:23:56,614
Why?

1353
01:23:57,947 --> 01:24:00,216
What do you need
to discuss with him?

1354
01:24:14,432 --> 01:24:18,402
I... I just told Fred Vaughn
I wouldn't marry him.

1355
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:43,326
Meg.

1356
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:52,268
<i>I'll come home to
help with the children.</i>

1357
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:54,337
I just... I'm so worried
for Beth.

1358
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:57,240
Stay. I asked for leave. I will
take care of the children.

1359
01:24:57,373 --> 01:24:58,576
Oh, John.

1360
01:25:01,277 --> 01:25:03,146
One other thing.
Send your fabric

1361
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:05,081
to the dressmaker
as soon as possible.

1362
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:07,250
- I can't.
- I don't want to hear a word.

1363
01:25:07,384 --> 01:25:08,853
I want you to have that dress.

1364
01:25:08,985 --> 01:25:11,287
My old coat will be fine
for the winter.

1365
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:12,623
- John, I...
- It's all settled.

1366
01:25:12,756 --> 01:25:14,925
John, I really can't.

1367
01:25:15,058 --> 01:25:17,126
I sold the fabric
to Sallie.

1368
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,431
You did?

1369
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:24,869
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

1370
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:27,070
I couldn't be.

1371
01:25:27,203 --> 01:25:30,741
John Brooke is my husband.

1372
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,409
And I am his wife.

1373
01:25:38,314 --> 01:25:39,717
Oh!

1374
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,653
Hannah! It's all right.
It's all right.

1375
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:48,659
What do we do?

1376
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:52,362
We should send for your mother.

1377
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:09,012
- Marmee!
- Bless you.

1378
01:26:09,145 --> 01:26:11,147
She's worse. I didn't know
what else to do.

1379
01:26:11,282 --> 01:26:13,249
- Jo, how is she?
- My girls.

1380
01:26:13,384 --> 01:26:14,418
My sweet Beth.

1381
01:26:14,552 --> 01:26:15,786
Hannah, make a clear broth.

1382
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,822
Jo, get ice.
We need to cool you.

1383
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:21,257
Who's with Father?

1384
01:26:21,392 --> 01:26:22,693
John stayed with him.

1385
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:24,628
We need to change
the linens.

1386
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,230
We're going to move you,
sweet girl.

1387
01:26:27,364 --> 01:26:28,566
- Oh, look at her.
- That's it.

1388
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:29,767
Hold on. It's okay.

1389
01:26:32,101 --> 01:26:33,571
I know.

1390
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:24,989
Please fight.

1391
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,263
Don't go quietly.

1392
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:35,699
Fight.

1393
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,936
Please, please, just fight
to the end and be loud,

1394
01:27:39,068 --> 01:27:41,605
and don't just
quietly go away, Beth.

1395
01:28:04,695 --> 01:28:05,796
Marmee?

1396
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,467
Marmee?

1397
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:12,101
Marmee?

1398
01:28:13,837 --> 01:28:16,640
Oh! Oh!

1399
01:28:16,774 --> 01:28:18,042
Jo.

1400
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,047
Jo.

1401
01:28:25,248 --> 01:28:26,650
Merry Christmas, Beth.

1402
01:28:26,784 --> 01:28:28,552
Popcorn. Make sure
it's in the middle.

1403
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:30,253
- I know.
- You're doing the sides first.

1404
01:28:30,387 --> 01:28:32,188
The sides aren't spaced
for my popcorn.

1405
01:28:32,323 --> 01:28:34,458
I'm making a popcorn garland.

1406
01:28:34,592 --> 01:28:37,394
You're wasting decorations,
and they're not dangling right.

1407
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:40,564
The sides are most important.
If you don't have the sides...

1408
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:43,300
Here's another Christmas gift
for the March family.

1409
01:28:44,501 --> 01:28:47,236
- Oh, my God! Father!
- Father!

1410
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:48,372
Father!

1411
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,242
My little women.

1412
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:57,047
How you've grown.

1413
01:28:57,948 --> 01:28:59,783
Oh, Beth.

1414
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,719
Merry Christmas, my dear.

1415
01:29:01,852 --> 01:29:04,788
- Merry Christmas to each of you.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

1416
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:05,990
Merry Christmas.

1417
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:10,494
Oh, thank God.

1418
01:29:10,628 --> 01:29:13,597
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God for you.

1419
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:16,100
Now I can be angry
with you in person.

1420
01:31:24,928 --> 01:31:28,198
I can't believe
today is my wedding day.

1421
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:30,100
Mm.

1422
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,902
What's wrong?

1423
01:31:32,035 --> 01:31:33,137
Nothing.

1424
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:34,972
Jo.

1425
01:31:38,475 --> 01:31:40,778
We can leave.
We can leave right now.

1426
01:31:40,911 --> 01:31:42,980
I can make money.
I'll sell stories.

1427
01:31:43,113 --> 01:31:44,982
I'll do anything.
I'll cook. I'll clean.

1428
01:31:45,115 --> 01:31:47,584
I'll work in a factory.
I can make a life for us.

1429
01:31:47,718 --> 01:31:49,753
- Jo...
- And you should be an actress,

1430
01:31:49,887 --> 01:31:51,822
and you should have a life
on the stage.

1431
01:31:51,955 --> 01:31:53,524
Let's just run away together.

1432
01:31:53,657 --> 01:31:56,160
- I want to get married.
- Oh, why?

1433
01:31:56,293 --> 01:31:57,795
Because I love him.

1434
01:31:57,928 --> 01:32:00,964
You will be bored of him
in two years,

1435
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:03,000
and we will be
interesting forever.

1436
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:05,335
Just because my dreams
are different than yours

1437
01:32:05,469 --> 01:32:07,504
doesn't mean
they're unimportant.

1438
01:32:09,139 --> 01:32:11,276
I want a home.

1439
01:32:11,408 --> 01:32:14,812
And a family. And I'm willing
to work and struggle.

1440
01:32:14,945 --> 01:32:17,948
But I want to do it
with John.

1441
01:32:22,786 --> 01:32:24,988
I just hate
that you're leaving me.

1442
01:32:26,423 --> 01:32:27,491
Don't leave.

1443
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:28,959
Oh, Jo.

1444
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:33,463
I'm not leaving you.

1445
01:32:33,597 --> 01:32:35,833
And besides...

1446
01:32:38,001 --> 01:32:40,437
one day,
it will be your turn.

1447
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:49,813
I'd rather be a free spinster
and paddle my own canoe.

1448
01:32:51,081 --> 01:32:52,382
I would.

1449
01:32:58,488 --> 01:33:00,657
Can't believe childhood is over.

1450
01:33:02,693 --> 01:33:05,729
It was going to end
one way or another.

1451
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:07,497
And what a happy end.

1452
01:33:09,933 --> 01:33:12,069
What excessive promises...

1453
01:33:12,202 --> 01:33:15,639
giving yourself away
to get the other.

1454
01:33:15,772 --> 01:33:17,241
What a gift.

1455
01:33:17,374 --> 01:33:22,646
Always given before is known
the cost or the reward.

1456
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:24,081
I pronounce you
man and wife.

1457
01:33:25,649 --> 01:33:27,584
You may kiss
the bride.

1458
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:06,391
<i>Oh, don't have to make a fuss.</i>

1459
01:34:06,523 --> 01:34:08,625
You don't need
to see me to the carriage.

1460
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:09,927
Oh, I'm happy to.

1461
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,763
I hope you will be
happy now...

1462
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:15,599
that you've ruined your life
the same way your mother did

1463
01:34:15,732 --> 01:34:17,467
by marrying your father.

1464
01:34:17,601 --> 01:34:19,937
My dear sister,
you're too kind.

1465
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,905
And thank you
for today's festivities.

1466
01:34:22,039 --> 01:34:23,073
You're most welcome.

1467
01:34:23,206 --> 01:34:24,508
Thank you, Aunt March.

1468
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:27,978
Oh, I don't like
to be, uh, kissed.

1469
01:34:28,111 --> 01:34:30,614
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, you will be sorry

1470
01:34:30,747 --> 01:34:33,750
when you've tried love in a
cottage and found it a failure.

1471
01:34:33,884 --> 01:34:36,787
It can't be worse than
some people find in big houses.

1472
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,024
Oh, I quite understand
your meaning, missus.

1473
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:42,693
I don't miss a thing.

1474
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:44,628
We know this.

1475
01:34:44,761 --> 01:34:47,731
And you're not
entirely wrong.

1476
01:34:47,864 --> 01:34:51,935
I may not always be right,
but I'm never wrong.

1477
01:34:52,069 --> 01:34:55,772
Oh, and here is the only
sane member of the family.

1478
01:34:57,207 --> 01:34:58,942
I really can't take
any more of this.

1479
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:01,346
- I know.
- You can imagine.

1480
01:35:08,952 --> 01:35:12,089
Marmee! Marmee!
Marmee, Marmee, Marmee!

1481
01:35:12,222 --> 01:35:14,157
- What?
- Aunt March is going to Europe.

1482
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,860
Oh, and she wants me
to go with her! Ha, ha!

1483
01:35:16,994 --> 01:35:19,196
That's wonderful!
Now I know why I spent

1484
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:21,098
all those boring hours
reading to her.

1485
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:22,699
No, no,
she wants me to go.

1486
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,136
As her companion.

1487
01:35:26,269 --> 01:35:29,106
- Europe, with you?
- Yes, she wants me

1488
01:35:29,239 --> 01:35:31,376
to work on my art
and my French, of course.

1489
01:35:31,508 --> 01:35:34,611
You don't really
like French though, do you?

1490
01:35:36,913 --> 01:35:38,316
That's wonderful, Amy.

1491
01:35:40,817 --> 01:35:43,520
- Father! I'm going to Europe!
- Oh, ha, ha!

1492
01:36:14,985 --> 01:36:16,421
Meg married.

1493
01:36:16,553 --> 01:36:18,622
Amy off to Europe.

1494
01:36:18,755 --> 01:36:23,461
And now that you're a graduate,
you'll be off on a long holiday.

1495
01:36:23,593 --> 01:36:26,763
I'm just not good like Beth,
so I'm angry and restless.

1496
01:36:26,897 --> 01:36:29,534
You don't have
to stay here, Jo.

1497
01:36:29,666 --> 01:36:32,069
Why? Should we run off
and join a pirate ship?

1498
01:36:38,175 --> 01:36:40,143
- No. No.
- It's no use, Jo.

1499
01:36:40,278 --> 01:36:41,546
- Don't.
- We gotta have it out.

1500
01:36:41,678 --> 01:36:42,712
- No.
- I have loved you

1501
01:36:42,846 --> 01:36:44,081
ever since I've known you.

1502
01:36:44,214 --> 01:36:45,316
I couldn't help it.

1503
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,552
I tried to show
and you wouldn't let me.

1504
01:36:47,684 --> 01:36:49,520
- No.
- But I must make you hear now

1505
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:52,222
and give me an answer because
I cannot go on like this!

1506
01:36:52,356 --> 01:36:53,924
- Please don't.
- I gave up billiards.

1507
01:36:54,057 --> 01:36:56,593
I gave up everything you
didn't like. I'm happy I did.

1508
01:36:56,726 --> 01:37:01,231
It's fine, and I waited, and
I never complained because I...

1509
01:37:01,365 --> 01:37:04,601
You know, I figured
you'd love me, Jo.

1510
01:37:04,734 --> 01:37:06,636
And I realize
I'm not half good enough

1511
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,972
- and I'm not this great man...
- No! Yes, you are.

1512
01:37:09,106 --> 01:37:10,774
You're a great deal
too good for me.

1513
01:37:10,907 --> 01:37:14,644
I'm so grateful to you, and I'm
so proud of you, and I just...

1514
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:17,881
I don't see why I can't
love you as you want me to.

1515
01:37:18,014 --> 01:37:19,950
I don't know why.

1516
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:21,118
You can't?

1517
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:23,421
No. I can't.

1518
01:37:23,554 --> 01:37:25,889
I can't change
how I feel, and...

1519
01:37:27,624 --> 01:37:30,260
it would be a lie
to say I do when I don't.

1520
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,897
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

1521
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:36,800
I'm so sorry,
but I just can't help it.

1522
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:39,136
I can't love anyone else, Jo.
I only love you.

1523
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:41,037
It would be a disaster
if we married.

1524
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:42,906
- It wouldn't be.
- We'd be miserable.

1525
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:44,941
- I'd be a perfect saint.
- I can't! I can't!

1526
01:37:45,075 --> 01:37:46,444
I've tried
and failed. I can't.

1527
01:37:46,577 --> 01:37:47,844
Why does everyone
expect it?

1528
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:49,813
Your family
and my grandpa expect it.

1529
01:37:49,946 --> 01:37:51,982
Why are you saying this?
Say yes.

1530
01:37:52,115 --> 01:37:55,286
- Let's be happy together, Jo!
- I can't say yes truly,

1531
01:37:55,419 --> 01:37:56,987
so I'm not going
to say it at all.

1532
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,357
And you'll see that
I'm right eventually,

1533
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,292
and you'll thank me for it.

1534
01:38:05,429 --> 01:38:07,331
I'd rather hang myself
than realize this.

1535
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:09,733
- Teddy.
- I would rather be dead.

1536
01:38:09,866 --> 01:38:11,168
Teddy, don't say that.

1537
01:38:12,336 --> 01:38:13,304
Teddy.

1538
01:38:15,038 --> 01:38:18,975
Listen, you'll find
some lovely, accomplished girl

1539
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:21,678
who will love you
and adore you.

1540
01:38:21,811 --> 01:38:23,246
She's gonna make
a fine mistress

1541
01:38:23,381 --> 01:38:25,516
for your fine house,
but I wouldn't.

1542
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,017
- Yes, you would, Jo.
- Look at me.

1543
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:28,985
I'm homely, I'm awkward,
and I'm odd.

1544
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,221
- I love you, Jo.
- And you'd be ashamed of me.

1545
01:38:31,355 --> 01:38:33,089
- I love you, Jo.
- And we would quarrel

1546
01:38:33,223 --> 01:38:35,258
because we can't help it
even now.

1547
01:38:37,894 --> 01:38:41,031
I'd hate elegant society,
you'd hate my scribbling,

1548
01:38:41,164 --> 01:38:42,400
and we would be unhappy.

1549
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:44,034
And we'd wish
we hadn't done it,

1550
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:46,236
and everything
will be horrid.

1551
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:50,006
Is there anything more?

1552
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,578
- No, nothing more.
- All right.

1553
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:55,346
Except that...

1554
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,985
Teddy, I don't believe
I will ever marry.

1555
01:39:03,287 --> 01:39:04,821
I'm happy as I am,

1556
01:39:04,955 --> 01:39:06,324
and I love my liberty
too well

1557
01:39:06,457 --> 01:39:07,924
to be in any hurry
to give it up.

1558
01:39:08,058 --> 01:39:09,259
- I think you're wrong.
- No.

1559
01:39:09,393 --> 01:39:10,561
I think you will marry.

1560
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,229
You'll find someone
and love them.

1561
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:13,830
You will live
and die for them.

1562
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:15,832
That's your way,
and you will.

1563
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,321
And I'll watch.

1564
01:39:58,376 --> 01:40:01,144
Oh. I don't want
to disturb your writing.

1565
01:40:02,245 --> 01:40:04,348
I don't do that anymore.

1566
01:40:05,982 --> 01:40:07,518
It didn't save her.

1567
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,304
You're much too
lonely here, Jo.

1568
01:40:28,038 --> 01:40:30,775
Wouldn't you like
to go back to New York?

1569
01:40:30,907 --> 01:40:32,443
What about your friend
Friedrich?

1570
01:40:32,576 --> 01:40:33,943
- Wasn't that his name?
- No.

1571
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,814
I ruined our friendship
with my temper,

1572
01:40:37,947 --> 01:40:39,350
just as
I ruin everything.

1573
01:40:39,483 --> 01:40:41,017
I'm sure I'll never
see him again.

1574
01:40:41,151 --> 01:40:44,154
I doubt that a sincere friend
would be deterred.

1575
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,957
I wish that were true.

1576
01:40:51,329 --> 01:40:54,665
If I was a girl in a book,
this would all be so easy.

1577
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:59,002
Just give up
the world happily.

1578
01:41:02,972 --> 01:41:05,343
Laurie's returning, you know.

1579
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,110
- Oh, he is?
- Mm.

1580
01:41:07,243 --> 01:41:10,013
There was a letter from Amy.
She's coming home.

1581
01:41:10,146 --> 01:41:12,982
She's devastated about Beth.

1582
01:41:13,116 --> 01:41:17,187
Aunt March is very ill,
so Laurie will accompany them.

1583
01:41:20,424 --> 01:41:22,360
- That's good of him.
- Mm.

1584
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,367
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1585
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,202
I've always been quite
content with my family.

1586
01:41:34,705 --> 01:41:36,072
Don't understand it.

1587
01:41:38,476 --> 01:41:40,378
Perhaps, um...

1588
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,912
Perhaps I...

1589
01:41:43,046 --> 01:41:46,517
was too quick
in turning him down.

1590
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:47,752
Laurie.

1591
01:41:50,186 --> 01:41:51,422
Do you love him?

1592
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:59,195
If he asked me again,
I think I would say yes.

1593
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,898
Do you think
he'll ask me again?

1594
01:42:02,031 --> 01:42:03,734
But do you love him?

1595
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,571
I care more to be loved.

1596
01:42:08,572 --> 01:42:10,808
I want to be loved.

1597
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,243
That is not the same
as loving.

1598
01:42:17,748 --> 01:42:18,816
I know.

1599
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:24,422
You know, I just...
I just feel...

1600
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,558
I just feel like...

1601
01:42:27,691 --> 01:42:29,660
women, they...

1602
01:42:31,762 --> 01:42:34,432
They have minds
and they have souls,

1603
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:36,132
as well as just hearts.

1604
01:42:36,266 --> 01:42:38,569
And they've got ambition
and they've got talent,

1605
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:39,969
as well as just beauty.

1606
01:42:40,103 --> 01:42:42,640
And I'm so sick of
people saying

1607
01:42:42,773 --> 01:42:45,276
that love is just
all a woman is fit for.

1608
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,177
I'm so sick of it.

1609
01:42:48,546 --> 01:42:51,582
But I'm... I'm so lonely.

1610
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:37,628
Couldn't let you travel alone
with Aunt March being so sick.

1611
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,298
Even if you despise me.

1612
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:44,668
I don't despise you, Laurie.

1613
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:54,278
Beth was the best of us.

1614
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,826
I'm not marrying Fred.

1615
01:44:12,296 --> 01:44:15,699
- I heard about that.
- And you are under no obligation

1616
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,736
to say anything
or do anything.

1617
01:44:21,956 --> 01:44:24,492
I just didn't love him
as I should.

1618
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,661
We don't need to talk about it.

1619
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:29,563
We don't need to say anything.

1620
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,581
<i>My dear Teddy,</i>

1621
01:44:47,715 --> 01:44:50,551
<i>I miss you more
than I can express.</i>

1622
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:54,989
<i>I used to think that the
worst fate was to be a wife.</i>

1623
01:44:55,154 --> 01:44:57,190
<i>I was young and stupid.</i>

1624
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:00,327
<i>But now I have changed.</i>

1625
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:04,765
<i>The worst fate is to live
my life without you in it.</i>

1626
01:45:04,899 --> 01:45:08,969
<i>I was wrong to turn you down
and to run away to New York.</i>

1627
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:15,843
Oysters!

1628
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:22,416
Lobsters!

1629
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:36,263
<i>Jo.</i>

1630
01:45:36,397 --> 01:45:38,197
<i>Jo. Jo.</i>

1631
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,234
Jo.

1632
01:45:41,302 --> 01:45:42,904
Wake up.

1633
01:45:43,037 --> 01:45:44,272
Wake up.

1634
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:52,347
- Teddy! Oh, you're back.
- Are you glad to see me, then?

1635
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,082
Yes.

1636
01:45:54,215 --> 01:45:56,583
Oh, I was worried.

1637
01:45:56,718 --> 01:45:58,419
Mm. Here, come sit.

1638
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:05,927
How's Amy?
Did she bother you

1639
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,996
all the way from Europe
with her preening?

1640
01:46:08,129 --> 01:46:10,198
Yes, but I like that.

1641
01:46:10,331 --> 01:46:12,967
- Where is she now?
- Your mother has her at Meg's.

1642
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:14,501
- We stopped on the way.
- Oh.

1643
01:46:14,635 --> 01:46:17,338
There was no getting my wife
out of their clutches.

1644
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,507
Your what?

1645
01:46:20,641 --> 01:46:22,810
I've done it now.

1646
01:46:22,944 --> 01:46:24,712
It was meant to be
a surprise.

1647
01:46:24,846 --> 01:46:26,814
We were engaged
and were hoping to wait,

1648
01:46:26,948 --> 01:46:30,018
but that is to say that
now we are man and wife.

1649
01:46:32,954 --> 01:46:34,322
You and Amy?

1650
01:46:34,455 --> 01:46:35,555
Yes.

1651
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,403
Are you in love?

1652
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:49,603
Yes.

1653
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:55,542
I want to say one thing
and then put it away forever.

1654
01:46:55,676 --> 01:46:57,845
I've always loved you.

1655
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:00,281
But the love I feel for Amy,
it's different.

1656
01:47:00,415 --> 01:47:02,083
And I think...

1657
01:47:02,216 --> 01:47:03,451
you were right about this.

1658
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,887
I think we would've killed
each other.

1659
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,257
Yes.

1660
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,292
I think it was meant this way.

1661
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:14,695
Oh, Teddy.

1662
01:47:14,829 --> 01:47:17,732
You're the only one that ever
calls me that, Jo. "Teddy."

1663
01:47:19,233 --> 01:47:20,768
What does Amy call you?

1664
01:47:20,902 --> 01:47:22,870
"My lord."

1665
01:47:23,004 --> 01:47:24,839
That sounds like her.

1666
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:30,845
Well, you look
deserving of it.

1667
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,349
Could we still
be friends, Jo, please?

1668
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,023
Of course, my boy. Always.

1669
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,069
She's a painter.

1670
01:47:55,203 --> 01:47:56,637
Are you excited?

1671
01:48:07,115 --> 01:48:09,616
- Laurie told you?
- Yes, yes.

1672
01:48:11,185 --> 01:48:13,121
Amy, I'm so happy for you.

1673
01:48:13,254 --> 01:48:15,456
This... This was meant to be.

1674
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:17,492
Oh, I'm so relieved.
Thank you.

1675
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:19,494
I wanted to write, Jo.
I wanted to write.

1676
01:48:19,627 --> 01:48:22,330
I wanted to explain, but
everything was happening so fast

1677
01:48:22,463 --> 01:48:24,432
and I was worried
you'd be angry at me.

1678
01:48:24,565 --> 01:48:27,335
- No. No.
- No, you're not angry at me?

1679
01:48:29,137 --> 01:48:31,472
Life is too short
to be angry at one's sisters.

1680
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:40,314
- I really miss her.
- I know.

1681
01:48:44,185 --> 01:48:45,486
Thank you.

1682
01:49:44,145 --> 01:49:45,546
Mr. Laurence.

1683
01:49:48,316 --> 01:49:50,384
Jo. Heh.

1684
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:52,887
Oh, Jo.

1685
01:49:55,223 --> 01:49:58,492
I couldn't bring
myself to, uh...

1686
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:06,367
The house doesn't seem right
without her, and...

1687
01:50:08,035 --> 01:50:10,438
Couldn't go in,
knowing she wouldn't be there.

1688
01:50:17,912 --> 01:50:20,815
I know I'm not half
so good as my sister,

1689
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:24,819
but you know I'll be a friend
to lean on, if you'll let me.

1690
01:50:32,193 --> 01:50:33,394
All right.

1691
01:53:59,033 --> 01:54:00,836
<i>Dear Mr. Dashwood,</i>

1692
01:54:00,968 --> 01:54:02,838
enclosed are
the first few chapters

1693
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:05,339
of a piece
I've only begun working on.

1694
01:54:05,473 --> 01:54:07,475
It could suit as a story
for young people,

1695
01:54:07,608 --> 01:54:09,845
but I think it is
probably quite boring.

1696
01:54:09,977 --> 01:54:11,979
<i>However, I'm sending it to you
just in case</i>

1697
01:54:12,112 --> 01:54:14,281
<i>it has something of value,
though I doubt it.</i>

1698
01:54:14,415 --> 01:54:15,684
<i>Jo March.</i>

1699
01:54:34,936 --> 01:54:36,638
I thought she hated me.

1700
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:39,139
She could still hate you
and leave you the house.

1701
01:54:39,273 --> 01:54:41,008
What about you and John?

1702
01:54:41,141 --> 01:54:44,345
We can't manage a grand house
like this. It's too big.

1703
01:54:52,787 --> 01:54:55,256
I should sell it,
but I'd love to do something

1704
01:54:55,389 --> 01:54:57,859
that would really make
Aunt March turn in her grave.

1705
01:54:57,993 --> 01:54:59,928
- I wouldn't mind that.
- A nice turning.

1706
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:01,897
Just a rotation,
nothing terrible.

1707
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:03,531
What will you do?

1708
01:55:05,533 --> 01:55:07,434
I'd like to open a school.

1709
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:08,904
We never had
a proper school.

1710
01:55:09,036 --> 01:55:10,839
Now there are
women's colleges opening.

1711
01:55:10,972 --> 01:55:12,841
There should be a school.
For Daisy.

1712
01:55:12,974 --> 01:55:14,208
And what will Demi do?

1713
01:55:14,341 --> 01:55:17,244
I'll open a school
for boys and girls both.

1714
01:55:17,378 --> 01:55:19,613
What about writing?

1715
01:55:19,748 --> 01:55:22,182
- What about it?
- What are you working on?

1716
01:55:22,316 --> 01:55:25,386
I started something, but
I don't think it's very good.

1717
01:55:25,519 --> 01:55:28,422
- Everyone likes what you write.
- No, they don't.

1718
01:55:28,556 --> 01:55:30,025
I do.

1719
01:55:30,157 --> 01:55:32,259
Well, it's just
about our little life.

1720
01:55:32,393 --> 01:55:33,662
So?

1721
01:55:33,795 --> 01:55:36,096
Well, who will be interested
in a story

1722
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:38,065
of domestic struggles
and joys?

1723
01:55:38,198 --> 01:55:40,001
It doesn't have
any real importance.

1724
01:55:40,134 --> 01:55:41,569
Maybe it doesn't
seem important

1725
01:55:41,703 --> 01:55:43,437
because people
don't write about them.

1726
01:55:43,571 --> 01:55:48,208
No, writing doesn't confer
importance. It reflects it.

1727
01:55:48,342 --> 01:55:50,110
I don't think so.

1728
01:55:50,244 --> 01:55:52,546
Writing them will
make them more important.

1729
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:57,084
- When did you become so wise?
- Hm-mm. I always have been.

1730
01:55:57,217 --> 01:55:59,186
You were just too busy
noticing my faults.

1731
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,088
Which were never
there, of course.

1732
01:56:17,672 --> 01:56:19,074
<i>Dear Miss March,</i>

1733
01:56:19,206 --> 01:56:21,042
<i>I read the chapters you sent</i>

1734
01:56:21,175 --> 01:56:23,812
and I have to agree,
they aren't very promising.

1735
01:56:23,945 --> 01:56:25,981
<i>But, please,
send more stories</i>

1736
01:56:26,113 --> 01:56:28,582
<i>of the scandalous variety,
if you have any.</i>

1737
01:56:28,717 --> 01:56:32,252
Or, shall I say,
your friend can.

1738
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:34,689
My apologies for the joke.

1739
01:56:34,823 --> 01:56:36,357
I couldn't help it.

1740
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:38,827
Jo, come down!

1741
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,095
Coming!

1742
01:56:42,596 --> 01:56:43,932
I'm starving.

1743
01:56:45,734 --> 01:56:48,003
Oh, uh, Jo,
you might wanna wait because...

1744
01:56:48,135 --> 01:56:49,269
I'm famished.

1745
01:56:49,403 --> 01:56:51,338
But, Jo, dear,
you have a guest.

1746
01:56:51,472 --> 01:56:53,041
Mm. I don't know anyone.

1747
01:56:53,173 --> 01:56:56,011
I'm sorry to intrude,
but...

1748
01:56:57,946 --> 01:56:59,146
It's you.

1749
01:57:08,823 --> 01:57:09,858
Oh, uh...

1750
01:57:12,761 --> 01:57:14,495
Hello.

1751
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:16,698
Hello.
I'm Josephine March.

1752
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:18,499
- I'm Jo.
- Josephine, is that you?

1753
01:57:18,633 --> 01:57:22,236
Welcome! Welcome.
This is Kitty and Minnie.

1754
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:25,372
And I see that you have
already met our professor.

1755
01:57:25,506 --> 01:57:27,709
And he's
a very accomplished man.

1756
01:57:27,842 --> 01:57:29,878
And your mother says
that you are a writer.

1757
01:57:30,011 --> 01:57:31,545
I keep a diary, you know.

1758
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,682
We have a lot of
interesting people here,

1759
01:57:33,815 --> 01:57:36,117
intellectuals
and Europeans...

1760
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:39,654
Jo, I hope it is all right. I
got your address from Ms. Kirke.

1761
01:57:39,788 --> 01:57:42,791
- Who's this? Who are you?
- I'm sorry to intrude.

1762
01:57:42,924 --> 01:57:45,860
I was close by,
and I thought I'd...

1763
01:57:45,994 --> 01:57:47,729
- But I'll be going.
- No, no.

1764
01:57:47,862 --> 01:57:49,864
Please stay.
We have more than enough room.

1765
01:57:49,998 --> 01:57:51,700
- Can someone tell me who this is?
- Shh.

1766
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:53,134
I don't want to be a burden.

1767
01:57:53,267 --> 01:57:54,535
You're not a burden
at all.

1768
01:57:54,669 --> 01:57:57,072
- Yes, of course. Please.
- I'm Laurie. Who are you?

1769
01:57:57,204 --> 01:57:58,539
I'm Friedrich Bhaer.

1770
01:57:58,673 --> 01:58:01,076
We were at the same
boardinghouse in New York.

1771
01:58:01,208 --> 01:58:04,079
Oh, Jo,
he's very handsome.

1772
01:58:13,387 --> 01:58:15,190
Do you intend
to stay in New York?

1773
01:58:15,322 --> 01:58:19,526
No. I've been offered
a professorship in California.

1774
01:58:19,661 --> 01:58:23,564
And, as I have
nothing keeping me here,

1775
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:26,167
I thought
I might go west.

1776
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:27,936
It is new there,
and they are

1777
01:58:28,069 --> 01:58:30,337
less particular
about immigrants.

1778
01:58:30,471 --> 01:58:32,539
Perhaps I should go west.

1779
01:58:32,674 --> 01:58:36,044
You're not an immigrant,
so perhaps you should stay home.

1780
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:40,949
I'm going!

1781
01:58:50,091 --> 01:58:52,326
- Jo!
- Joseph, not Josephine.

1782
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:54,162
I know Joseph.
Pretty well, actually.

1783
01:58:54,294 --> 01:58:56,898
Oh, wow!

1784
01:58:57,031 --> 01:58:59,734
This is a beautiful
instrument.

1785
01:58:59,868 --> 01:59:01,236
Which one of you plays?

1786
01:59:01,368 --> 01:59:03,671
Oh, it was
my sister Beth.

1787
01:59:03,805 --> 01:59:05,807
We all play a little, but...

1788
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,608
But none
so well as her.

1789
01:59:07,742 --> 01:59:10,812
It is very hard to lose
a sister.

1790
01:59:10,945 --> 01:59:12,113
I'm sorry.

1791
01:59:13,948 --> 01:59:16,751
- Do you play?
- Yes. I do.

1792
01:59:16,885 --> 01:59:19,419
It would make us so happy
if you'd play now.

1793
01:59:19,553 --> 01:59:21,823
She wouldn't want
the piano to sit silent.

1794
01:59:23,224 --> 01:59:24,626
I don't wish to offend.

1795
01:59:24,759 --> 01:59:26,293
Not in the least.

1796
01:59:54,055 --> 01:59:57,258
- It was so lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Goodbye.

1797
01:59:57,391 --> 01:59:58,993
It was a real pleasure,
Mr. Bhaer.

1798
01:59:59,127 --> 02:00:01,528
- Bye, Laurie.
- Goodbye.

1799
02:00:03,264 --> 02:00:05,633
- Thank you for everything.
- Lovely to have you.

1800
02:00:05,767 --> 02:00:11,039
If you ever come to California,
I would love to see you.

1801
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:15,143
I don't know that I will,
but thank you.

1802
02:00:19,247 --> 02:00:21,850
Well, goodbye.

1803
02:00:24,152 --> 02:00:25,053
Goodbye.

1804
02:00:39,968 --> 02:00:41,468
What?

1805
02:00:41,602 --> 02:00:43,403
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

1806
02:00:43,537 --> 02:00:45,773
What a wonderful man.
I hope he comes back.

1807
02:00:45,907 --> 02:00:47,709
He would make
a terrific friend for me.

1808
02:00:47,842 --> 02:00:50,278
- Father, he wasn't here for you!
- No?

1809
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:53,681
- Jo, you love him.
- What? No, no, I don't.

1810
02:00:53,815 --> 02:00:56,084
Yes, you do! I am half
as smart as you,

1811
02:00:56,217 --> 02:00:58,585
but I can see it
so plainly. You love him.

1812
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,855
- Doesn't she?
- Good instinct. You love him.

1813
02:01:00,989 --> 02:01:03,925
I have never seen you so happy.
What else is love?

1814
02:01:04,058 --> 02:01:06,227
You need to go after him.
Prepare the horses.

1815
02:01:06,361 --> 02:01:08,263
- We can catch him.
- I'm coming too.

1816
02:01:08,395 --> 02:01:10,365
- No, I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

1817
02:01:10,497 --> 02:01:11,699
- Amy is right.
- Exactly!

1818
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:13,467
Never thought
I'd prepare a carriage

1819
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,402
to help Jo March chase a man,
but I like it.

1820
02:01:15,535 --> 02:01:17,571
- He's moving to California.
- That was fiction!

1821
02:01:17,705 --> 02:01:19,941
He was practically begging
for a reason to stay.

1822
02:01:20,074 --> 02:01:22,210
- But it's raining outside.
- That doesn't matter.

1823
02:01:22,343 --> 02:01:24,411
- Come with me. I need to fix you.
- Jo!

1824
02:01:24,544 --> 02:01:26,247
Laurie, will you
stop standing there

1825
02:01:26,381 --> 02:01:28,316
and go get the horses ready?
Thank you.

1826
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:37,392
You never ask about my mother,

1827
02:01:37,524 --> 02:01:39,727
even when you know
I've seen her.

1828
02:01:39,861 --> 02:01:41,896
I assume
she's still alive.

1829
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:43,665
But I ask
after your mother.

1830
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:45,800
And I have no idea why.

1831
02:01:45,934 --> 02:01:47,601
You're willfully
missing the point.

1832
02:01:47,735 --> 02:01:48,602
That's true.

1833
02:01:49,771 --> 02:01:51,072
What do they want?

1834
02:01:51,205 --> 02:01:52,472
I have no idea.

1835
02:01:52,606 --> 02:01:53,942
Are you publishing this?

1836
02:01:54,075 --> 02:01:55,710
What happens
to the "little women"?

1837
02:01:55,843 --> 02:01:58,413
Tell me you have
the rest of this book.

1838
02:01:58,545 --> 02:01:59,881
What?

1839
02:02:13,695 --> 02:02:15,797
I'm just trying
to fix this hair.

1840
02:02:20,467 --> 02:02:22,303
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop the carriage.

1841
02:02:22,437 --> 02:02:24,005
- Stop!
- Stop the carriage!

1842
02:02:24,138 --> 02:02:26,941
Stop. All right, Go. Out. Out.
Go. Go, go, go.

1843
02:02:27,075 --> 02:02:28,242
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1844
02:02:28,376 --> 02:02:30,345
Kiss him with love!

1845
02:02:38,987 --> 02:02:42,657
Frankly, I don't see why
she didn't marry the neighbor.

1846
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:44,993
Well, because the neighbor
marries her sister.

1847
02:02:46,394 --> 02:02:49,030
Right, right.
Of course.

1848
02:02:51,032 --> 02:02:52,700
So who does she marry?

1849
02:02:52,834 --> 02:02:55,203
No one. She doesn't marry
either of them.

1850
02:02:56,304 --> 02:02:58,406
No.

1851
02:02:58,538 --> 02:03:00,908
No! No, no,
that won't work at all.

1852
02:03:01,042 --> 02:03:03,378
She says the whole book
she doesn't want to marry.

1853
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:04,979
Who cares?

1854
02:03:05,113 --> 02:03:07,348
Girls want to see women married,
not consistent.

1855
02:03:07,482 --> 02:03:09,150
No, it isn't
the right ending.

1856
02:03:09,283 --> 02:03:11,386
The right ending
is the one that sells.

1857
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,389
Trust me. If you decide

1858
02:03:14,521 --> 02:03:16,057
to end your delightful book

1859
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:17,825
with your heroine a spinster,

1860
02:03:17,959 --> 02:03:19,559
no one will buy it.

1861
02:03:19,694 --> 02:03:22,529
It won't be worth printing.

1862
02:03:22,663 --> 02:03:24,232
I suppose marriage
has always been

1863
02:03:24,365 --> 02:03:26,667
an economic proposition,
even in fiction.

1864
02:03:26,801 --> 02:03:29,536
- It's romance.
- Heh, heh, it's mercenary.

1865
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:33,274
- Just end it that way, will you?
- Heh, fine.

1866
02:03:33,408 --> 02:03:34,675
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1867
02:03:34,809 --> 02:03:36,444
Kiss him with love!
Go!

1868
02:03:39,247 --> 02:03:42,083
- You look so beautiful!
- Go, Jo!

1869
02:04:00,802 --> 02:04:01,702
Jo!

1870
02:04:09,744 --> 02:04:12,447
I... I don't want you to leave.
I want you to stay.

1871
02:04:12,579 --> 02:04:13,881
- You do?
- Yes.

1872
02:04:14,015 --> 02:04:16,017
I would never leave
if you wish me to stay.

1873
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:18,553
- No, I want you to stay.
- I have nothing to give you.

1874
02:04:18,686 --> 02:04:20,088
It doesn't matter.

1875
02:04:20,221 --> 02:04:21,588
My hands are empty.

1876
02:04:21,722 --> 02:04:22,857
They're not empty.

1877
02:04:30,832 --> 02:04:33,734
<i>I love it. It's romantic.</i>

1878
02:04:33,868 --> 02:04:37,405
It's very moving.
That's very emotional.

1879
02:04:37,538 --> 02:04:40,308
- Well, thank you.
- We could call the chapter...

1880
02:04:41,876 --> 02:04:43,411
"Under the Umbrella."

1881
02:04:43,544 --> 02:04:44,946
- That's good.
- Perfect.

1882
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:47,048
Now, there's the question
of the contract.

1883
02:04:47,181 --> 02:04:49,616
I'm prepared to give you
5 percent of the royalties.

1884
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,419
So I get 5 percent
of the profit.

1885
02:04:51,552 --> 02:04:54,789
Five percent of the net profits,
after I recoup.

1886
02:04:54,922 --> 02:04:57,624
Huh. Well, what about
a payment up front?

1887
02:04:57,758 --> 02:05:00,461
I'm the one taking the risk
in printing this book.

1888
02:05:00,595 --> 02:05:02,630
Yes, but it's my book.

1889
02:05:02,763 --> 02:05:04,799
And if it does well,
we'll both make money.

1890
02:05:04,932 --> 02:05:06,701
If not,
I can stay in business.

1891
02:05:06,834 --> 02:05:08,469
Oh, so I get nothing
if it fails.

1892
02:05:08,603 --> 02:05:12,507
No, I'll give you $500 right now
to buy out the copyright.

1893
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,842
- The copyright?
- That's the right for reprinting,

1894
02:05:14,976 --> 02:05:17,778
that sort of thing. Sequels,
characters for other stories.

1895
02:05:17,912 --> 02:05:19,280
Might that
be worth something?

1896
02:05:19,413 --> 02:05:21,816
Well, only if it's a success.

1897
02:05:21,949 --> 02:05:25,286
I see. It seems like something
I would want to own, no?

1898
02:05:25,419 --> 02:05:28,222
Didn't you say your family
needed the money immediately?

1899
02:05:28,356 --> 02:05:30,892
Yes, they do, which is why
I wanted up-front payment.

1900
02:05:31,025 --> 02:05:35,129
No. It's too risky. I'll only
pay for the copyright.

1901
02:05:42,103 --> 02:05:45,139
You keep your $500,
and I'll keep the copyright.

1902
02:05:46,774 --> 02:05:49,177
Also, I want 10 percent
of royalties.

1903
02:05:51,045 --> 02:05:54,682
Five point five percent.
That's very generous.

1904
02:05:54,815 --> 02:05:57,818
- Nine percent.
- Six percent, and that's it.

1905
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:01,622
Mr. Dashwood, if I'm going
to sell my heroine

1906
02:06:01,756 --> 02:06:05,459
into marriage for money,
I might as well get some of it.

1907
02:06:05,593 --> 02:06:07,195
Six point six percent.

1908
02:06:08,863 --> 02:06:11,065
- Done.
- And you don't need to decide

1909
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,701
- about the copyright right now.
- No, I've decided.

1910
02:06:13,834 --> 02:06:15,637
I want to own my own book.

1911
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:24,979
Where is she?
She's here, everyone!

1912
02:06:31,018 --> 02:06:32,353
Come on!

1913
02:06:40,494 --> 02:06:43,397
Now, see if you can make a B.
