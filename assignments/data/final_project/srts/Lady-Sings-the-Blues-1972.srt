1
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,371
All right, Eleanora.

2
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,066
Eleanora.

3
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,613
Miss Holiday.

4
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,843
You better haul
your little black ass in here.

5
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,285
Slow.

6
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,831
It's about time.

7
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,573
Girl, if you wants to lay around all day,
you is in the wrong end of the business.

8
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,481
When I give it away for the first time,
it ain't gonna be to no $2 john...

9
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,848
in East Baltimore. That's for damn sure.

10
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,979
At the rate you going, by the time
you decide to give it away...

11
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,820
you'll have to pay some john
$2 just to take it.

12
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,656
I's here, y'all. I got my $2.

13
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,286
That's dynamite.

14
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,032
And I see just the woman I want.

15
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,938
Come here, baby. Come to Papa.

16
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,841
Got a surprise for you.
I got a surprise for you.

17
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,411
I got a surprise for you, too,
if you don't leave me alone.

18
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,638
- Come here, sweetie.
- What?

19
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,112
Come over here.

20
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,309
Let me tell you something. Come on.
Come on. I know. I know. Listen.

21
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,976
I'm trying to talk to this...

22
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,786
Now, what do a fine man like you
want with a child like this?

23
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,955
She ain't 15 years old yet.

24
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,925
- What that got to do with anything?
- I know.

25
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,792
I come here to spend my money.

26
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,230
Suppose I take you over here
and show you a real woman...

27
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,928
who could give you your money's worth.

28
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,259
No.

29
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,371
No, that one's
plenty woman enough for me.

30
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,668
Don't try to give me no jive, broad.
I see what I want.

31
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,974
I come here to spend my money.

32
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,413
And I see what I want, and this is it.

33
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,009
- Come on. Come on, now.
- Well, you can't get what you see.

34
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,316
And since you don't want
what you can get...

35
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,620
then you know where you can go,
and this is it.

36
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,254
We don't need his kind, no way.

37
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,627
Imagine him making all that fuss
over one young kid.

38
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:44,833
- He must have been good and drunk.
- Yeah, drunk or blind. Shit.

39
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,599
All right, honey.
You can go now. That's enough.

40
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,833
Honey.

41
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,069
You are wearing this thing out
and me with it.

42
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,640
Now, why don't you take it with you
and make it a good home?

43
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,739
You mean, I can have it?

44
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,252
If you can get out of here with it
before I can count to 10. One...

45
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,847
two, three, four...

46
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,656
five, six, seven, eight...

47
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,655
nine, ten.

48
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,643
Eleanora. Eleanora.

49
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,543
The good Lord
give you two long legs to run with...

50
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,172
and He give me two strong hands...

51
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,184
to beat your black behind blue
the next time you slowpoke home...

52
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,847
when you know we got an all-night drive
before we get to Cousin Charlotte's.

53
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,686
- Sorry.
- Now, here.

54
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,658
You take these here keys
and make sure you use them.

55
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,162
I don't wanna come back here Sunday
night and find the house all cleaned out.

56
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,359
Talking about cleaning,
you didn't do the steps this week...

57
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,959
and the oven could use
a good scrubbing.

58
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,666
I didn't have time to make the beds,
and there's washing to be put out.

59
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,334
Wave goodbye to your cousin Eleanora.

60
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,811
I'm gonna call Reverend Jones and
make sure you get to church on Sunday.

61
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,215
Now, you be a good girl, Eleanora,
and next time you can come with us.

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,756
There's a letter inside
from your mama from New York.

63
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,121
And empty out the pan under the icebox.

64
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,123
Do

65
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,400
Want to anyway

66
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:13,442
I don't care what people say

67
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,518
If I should

68
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,488
Take a notion

69
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,156
To jump into the ocean

70
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,893
Ain't nobody's business

71
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,435
If I do

72
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,264
If I do

73
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,972
If my man ain't

74
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,739
Got no money

75
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,439
And I say take all

76
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,917
I's here. Got my $2.

77
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,419
It's dynamite. That's dynamite.

78
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,120
Come on. Come on.

79
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,525
Don't be afraid of me.

80
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,187
I'm not gonna hurt you.

81
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,094
I'm not scared of you,
'cause you handsome.

82
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,429
- You know what I mean?
- Come on.

83
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,868
- Okay, I...
- Come on. Come on.

84
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,270
Come on, sweetie, sweetie.
Let me take a look at you.

85
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,602
Oh, my goodness.

86
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,610
Why don't you sit down on the...

87
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,441
- Okay.
- Come on.

88
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,313
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sit down.
Can't do nothing standing up, now.

89
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,818
Come on. Sit down. Okay.

90
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,616
Now take your hat off,
and rest your coat.

91
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,967
Funny girl!
And then the missus woke up...

92
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,232
and saw
that he hadn't come home all night.

93
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,466
And then wouldn't she hit the ceiling!

94
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,702
Went running all over the place...

95
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,245
flopping that old yellow nightgown
of hers, you know...

96
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,713
and looking for him
and calling, "Charles?

97
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,812
"Charlee?"

98
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,114
I sure hope they get
their problems all settled...

99
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,987
before they get back here
in the morning. Uh-oh.

100
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,122
Got my polishing to do. See you, girl.

101
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,076
- This your kid, Sadie?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,675
You know she shouldn't be walking
around by herself in this neighborhood.

103
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,079
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,558
Guess you heard about what happened.

105
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,987
I came all the way from Baltimore
to see you, Ma.

106
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,030
My baby.

107
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,699
Thank you, Mama.

108
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,711
Sure is gonna be great
staying together again, ain't it, Ma?

109
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,643
Ain't it, Ma?

110
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,118
Honey, you know there ain't nothing
your mama wouldn't do for you.

111
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,021
Nothing in the world.

112
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,891
You can stay the night, but the madam's
coming home in the morning.

113
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,963
I understand, Mama.

114
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,837
Sister Edson.

115
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,968
I bet you, if I called her and asked her...

116
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:35,604
She's a lady from our church, and she's
always willing to help nice, young girls.

117
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,978
And since you're my daughter...

118
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,015
I bet she'd be willing
to let you do some housework...

119
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,282
for your room and your board.

120
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,520
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's all right, Mama.

121
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,730
Can't fault you for what ain't your fault.

122
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,336
I'll be all right.

123
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,526
Come in, missy.

124
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,040
Excuse me, miss.
Is you "Miss Lorraine Edson...

125
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,306
290139th Street, Harlem"?

126
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,781
Yes, honey, I sure am.
And you must be Sadie's girl.

127
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,113
Yes, ma'am. I am.

128
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,450
Well, the good Lord's
delivered you safe and sound.

129
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,423
My mama told me to say thank you
for taking me in.

130
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,992
And she told me also to tell you...

131
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,291
that you have
the best rooming house in Harlem...

132
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,694
and that I ain't supposed to be lazy
and I supposed to work real, real hard.

133
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,100
Well, now,
that's a fine spirit you got, honey.

134
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,337
And I want you to
just make yourself right at home.

135
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,500
Okay.

136
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,943
Rest your things. Look around.
I'll be right back.

137
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,710
That's a fine young girl.

138
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,331
Well, now, honey, I'll show you
my whole place, upstairs and down.

139
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,334
I don't want to see the upstairs,
Miss Edson...

140
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,303
'cause my Mama told me
you had a job for me as a cleaner.

141
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,305
And that's what I got, missy.

142
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,638
I mean, you're the one
with other things on your mind.

143
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,441
Wishful thinking, I call it.
'Cause, girl, let's face it...

144
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,615
you got a long way to go...

145
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,880
before you can earn $2
for just 10 minutes of your time...

146
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,949
or ain't you looked at yourself lately?

147
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,344
That lazy bitch.
She don't look where she's going.

148
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,149
Ain't it a shame how some
of God's children have it so easy...

149
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,725
and others have it so hard?

150
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,919
"Ain't it a shame?"

151
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,081
Last night, night before
Two different robbers at my door

152
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,251
Come on.

153
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,510
Kid, come on, beat it.

154
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,747
- Mister, is the boss around?
- You're saying goodbye to him. Bye-bye.

155
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,881
Okay, but look,
I work in the neighborhood already...

156
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,824
and I'd be willing to quit working
and come up here and work for you.

157
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,122
Yeah, I'd be very happy to quit, too.
Come on, honey.

158
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,697
- But I can sing. I really can.
- Yeah.

159
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,256
I can dance, and I know the words
to every song that's out today.

160
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,302
I mean, I've been really rehearsing
and everything.

161
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,268
That's very good. So do I.
But I tell you...

162
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,569
in order to be a showgirl,
you gotta have something to show.

163
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,142
Well, I got something. I really do.

164
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,838
All you have to do is push it up a bit
and put some lip rouge on.

165
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,380
I could do it, mister, give me a break.
Look, really, I'm good.

166
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,780
- All you have to do is give me a chance.
- Listen, girlie.

167
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,184
Listen to me. I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but no amount of slinky...

168
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,019
and makeup is gonna change you
into a female that looks...

169
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,192
like that.

170
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,454
Louis, so good to see you.

171
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,932
I'll get you a great table. How about
a nice table for Mr. McKay?

172
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,992
What you looking at?
Don't your mama make you wash steps?

173
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,498
Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west

174
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,269
Shake it to the one
that you love the best

175
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,910
- Now?
- No, not yet, don't you peek, Mama.

176
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,915
- Now?
- Not yet.

177
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,789
- Now?
- No.

178
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,521
Now come with me.

179
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,334
Surprise.

180
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,804
Jesus. Lord have mercy.

181
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,174
I ain't never,
in my whole life, seen such a fine hat.

182
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,571
Just like them fancy ladies
up on Sugar Hill.

183
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,610
Oh, Lord, and just to think
my baby give it to me.

184
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,488
Honey, I just loves it.

185
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,392
God bless Sister Edson.

186
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,864
I can see she's doing right by you.
Every time you come over here...

187
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,129
you're looking better and better. Still
cleaning and washing, no cooking yet?

188
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,033
No, not yet.

189
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,864
Hey, Mama, I gotta go. It's getting late.
I don't wanna miss my train.

190
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,672
Honey, I forgot.
I got a surprise for you, too.

191
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,478
I got me a new job starting next week,
and it's gonna be close by you...

192
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,519
and I'll be able to walk over
most evenings, won't that be nice?

193
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,144
And we can visit.

194
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,883
That'll be swell, Mama.
That'll be just swell.

195
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,459
- Just what we always wanted.
- Yeah.

196
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,758
We'll be able to
spend more time together.

197
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,996
That'll be real great.

198
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,895
Lord have mercy. My baby done
made me so happy this day.

199
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,685
Eleanora, you're late again. Girl,
you done missed two tricks already.

200
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,127
You better get the spirit, sister,
and get yourself on up them steps...

201
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,028
and quit your lollygagging.

202
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,727
Didn't you mama teach you
how to close doors?

203
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,827
If you don't want this job,
somebody else sure do.

204
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,919
You fine, young thing.

205
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,826
You're new in the neighborhood.

206
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,923
So, honey, I gotta love you real good.

207
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,735
Looky here
what Lorraine done sent to me.

208
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,899
I never accomplished any great feats...

209
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,999
but you know something, baby?

210
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,704
I'm something else under them sheets.

211
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,249
You see my father was a jockey,
and he taught me how to ride.

212
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,844
He said, Big Ben, you got to get it
from side to side.

213
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,249
Now, in case you don't know who I am...

214
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,190
I'm Big Ben, baby. Yeah, the lover-man.

215
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,223
We gonna have ourselves a ball tonight.

216
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,996
Lorraine done sent me this fine dinner.

217
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,804
Young and tender.
This is where her head was.

218
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,910
Won't be there when I get through.

219
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,511
'Cause, see, I'm from the city,
and I'm gonna kiss your little titty.

220
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,016
Young, and fine, and mellow.

221
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,490
Light as a feather.

222
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,185
Big Ben told all his men
Don't you take no numbers

223
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,262
After half past ten

224
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,888
What? What's the matter
with you, woman?

225
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,399
Ain't nothing personal, mister,
but I just quit the business.

226
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,534
Hell, bitch, you crazy?
Ain't this a killer?

227
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,733
Lorraine.

228
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,673
Hey, Lorraine. Lorraine.

229
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,177
What's happening?
Who's making all that noise up there?

230
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,339
- He said his name is Big Ben.
- Big Ben?

231
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,575
Ain't you supposed to be upstairs
with Big Ben?

232
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,346
- I ain't doing it.
- What you mean you ain't doing it, girl?

233
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,547
You give my place a bad name.
Big Ben's the best customer I got.

234
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,251
You can't do that.
All the girls love Big Ben.

235
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,351
He's my best customer, and I'm trying
to make something out of you.

236
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,158
I sent him up to you.
Now, what's the matter with you, girl?

237
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,723
You better get the spirit, sister, and
get on back upstairs and do your work.

238
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,236
- The Lord knows I'm trying to help you...
- Miss Edson, honey, I done quit.

239
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,636
Done quit?

240
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,940
Well, you get on away from around
here, then. 'Cause you ain't nothing.

241
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,842
You ain't never been nothing,
and you ain't gonna be nothing.

242
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,007
'Cause you don't go messing like that
with Big Ben.

243
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,608
- That's right.
- Get your ass back in the house.

244
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,185
- You looking for someone, Miss?
- Yes.

245
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,458
I noticed your sign in the window...

246
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,932
and I'm a featured dancer
at a club downtown.

247
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,904
And I don't have much time,
but I happen to live in the neighborhood.

248
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,999
And I'm looking
for something a little closer to home.

249
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,376
So you're a dancer now?

250
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,544
Okay, dancer. Dance.

251
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,869
Yeah, that's fine, girls. Take 10.

252
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,669
Thank you, honey. Just real nice.
Beautiful. Wonderful.

253
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,833
I tell you what,
watch your step as you leave.

254
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,877
You know the way out. Be careful.

255
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,570
Hey, baby, you know how to sing?

256
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,841
Yeah, I know how to sing,
but he wants a dancer.

257
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,043
You ain't got nothing to lose.
You better try to think up a song.

258
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,882
- I can sing anything. Shoot.
- All right, let's try something.

259
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,615
- What you know?
- But he doesn't like me.

260
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,352
He ain't got nothing to do. I can
handle him. What can you sing?

261
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,190
- I can sing All of Me.
- Jerry, I'm sorry, brother. Just go on.

262
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,628
All of Me, man,
you ain't never heard this like this.

263
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,131
- All Of Me.
- Church, take you home.

264
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,894
This a friend of mine, man, I didn't...

265
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,697
You gonna love it. Jerry,
you're a good person in your heart.

266
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,399
- You know you're gonna love it.
- Okay, okay, let her sing. Sing.

267
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,538
All of me

268
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,305
Ain't Miss Holiday something?

269
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,981
All of me

270
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,989
Why not take all of me

271
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,832
Can't you see

272
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,401
I'm no good without you

273
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,165
Take my lips

274
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,210
I want to lose them

275
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,014
Take my arms

276
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,843
I'll never use them

277
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,454
Your goodbye

278
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,820
Left me with eyes that cry

279
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,995
How can I
Go on without you

280
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,295
You took the part

281
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,633
That once was my heart

282
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:12,073
So why not
Take all of me

283
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,906
Yeah

284
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,176
Take all of me

285
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,420
Come on, you girls, come on,
you gotta get dressed.

286
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,118
We open in 15 minutes. And you...

287
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,391
Tonight, you get your chance.

288
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,760
Wait a minute.
What'd you say your name was?

289
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,924
- Eleanora.
- Ella... Ella who?

290
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,667
Billie. Billie Holiday.
Billie Holiday, that's my name.

291
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,765
Okay, Billie. One of the girls
will show you where you put your things.

292
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,970
Tonight, all you gotta do is watch
the other singers and do what they do.

293
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,341
Okay, you're an angel, Jerry.

294
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:53,645
Yeah, wait a minute. I'll be a bum
if you don't pull in $15 in tips tonight.

295
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,686
$15. Now, that's my definition
of a good singer.

296
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,880
Okay.

297
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,254
Go on, Billie Holiday.

298
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,010
What you frowning about, baby?

299
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,375
Don't worry about it.
What she miss on the top...

300
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,380
she can pick up on the bottom.

301
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,746
I hope that works both ways.

302
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,287
Don't worry about it.
One day, she picked the table up.

303
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,762
All right, Mama, go ahead.

304
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,561
Next time, you could pick up the floor.
We don't need a janitor.

305
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,033
Go on. Go on. Jerry's watching.
Right there, Jack.

306
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,833
Come on, baby.

307
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,431
That's a new girl just breaking in.

308
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,419
Some day he'll come along

309
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,651
Yes, sir.

310
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,122
The man I love

311
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,531
And he'll be big and strong

312
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,600
Pick it up.

313
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,498
The man I love

314
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,035
Pick it up. Come over. Come on.

315
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,901
And when he comes my way

316
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:02,007
I'll do my best to make him stay

317
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,407
You're pitiful.

318
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,976
He'll look at me and smile

319
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,651
I'll understand

320
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,687
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

321
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,230
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand

322
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,127
And though it seems absurd

323
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,327
- Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.

324
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,602
You think you're too good
to pick up money?

325
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,198
- Want me to put my foot in your ass?
- Would you shut up?

326
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:37,346
Maybe he'll come Sunday

327
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,544
Maybe Monday

328
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,552
You gotta do better than that, hon.

329
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,951
Maybe not

330
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,421
Go. Get it. Get it.

331
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,756
Still I'm sure he'll come one day

332
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:56,060
Maybe Tuesday

333
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,694
Will be my good news day

334
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,467
He'll build a little home

335
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,004
Just meant for two

336
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,979
From which I'll never roam

337
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,915
Take the money. Come on,
I can do better than that myself.

338
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,383
And so all else above

339
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,748
Go ahead, pick it on up.

340
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,518
I'm dreaming of

341
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,988
The man I love

342
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,710
Schmuck. Me and my big heart,
and you and your friends.

343
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,111
- Who does she think she is?
- A lady. With a hell of a voice.

344
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,445
We ain't gonna end up
with a quarter tonight.

345
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,178
Shit, you ain't paid me in two weeks...

346
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,254
what you bullshitting about a quarter?

347
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,193
Billie, Billie, go get it. Get the money.

348
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,799
Go on. Get it.

349
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,409
Do you want my arm to fall off?

350
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,063
Take it. Take the money. Take it, Billie.

351
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,705
I fell in love with you
The first time I looked into

352
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,215
Them there eyes

353
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,718
'Cause you have a certain little
Cute way of flirting

354
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,755
With them there eyes

355
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,552
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue

356
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,754
Take it.

357
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,589
I'm falling
No stalling

358
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,599
- Here's some money.
- Work it out, baby.

359
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,638
My heart is jumping
You've started something

360
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,105
With them there eyes

361
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,246
You'd better look out, little brown eyes
If you're wise

362
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,281
Sing like a lady. Come on, lady.

363
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,645
They bubble

364
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,686
Gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble

365
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,017
Ooh, baby

366
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,557
Them there eyes

367
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,889
Them there eyes

368
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,170
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

369
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,934
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

370
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,304
Thanks, Jerry. I like you, too.

371
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,802
Say, baby, that's beautiful.

372
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,971
Here, take some.

373
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,311
Get out. Come on,
you were beautiful tonight.

374
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,248
I just wanna tell you thank you.

375
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,149
I love you.
You were beautiful. Just pretty.

376
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,484
Thank you.
I really was scared, I'll tell you that.

377
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,081
You should have been scared.
Them niggers is dangerous.

378
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,160
- Billie.
- What you doing?

379
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,028
- Billie.
- Yeah? Yeah, Jerry.

380
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,565
These are for you.
There's a car waiting for you upstairs.

381
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,861
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Here's your money, Yvonne.

382
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,164
A car waiting for me upstairs.

383
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,800
Don't flash them moon eyes at me.
I didn't send you nothing.

384
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,400
There was never a doubt in my mind.

385
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,139
Besides, there's a card,
and you probably can't even write.

386
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,684
Don't have to know how to read, neither,
to know what that card's saying.

387
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,082
If he spent as much time
running his numbers...

388
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,315
as he does them damn gardenias,
he could have one hell of a business.

389
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,260
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Well, what do you know?

390
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,727
You got a great thing going in here.

391
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,799
Leave that nigger alone.
He is dangerous. You understand?

392
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:52,299
He pulls that bit on everybody,
got a room full of girls at home.

393
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,533
You just gonna be another one. You
wanna be that? You got too much going.

394
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,802
This is one face
that won't get that hungry.

395
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,207
I don't stand in no line for nobody.

396
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,370
All right.

397
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,244
Not even Mr. Louis McKay.

398
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,677
Jerry?

399
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,951
- Tell him the answer is no.
- No?

400
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,082
No.

401
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,990
That'll show him, 'cause he usually gets
everyone he wants.

402
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,001
He can get this one, too,
but not on the first night.

403
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,574
Good night, lady.

404
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,805
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night, Jerry.

405
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,249
What's the matter?
You don't like gardenias?

406
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,752
They're okay.

407
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,144
So?

408
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,957
So you don't put them on
just to go to someone's apartment...

409
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,994
for a late-night supper.

410
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,493
- So that's how it is?
- That's how it is.

411
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,602
Pardon me, lady, I must have
got you mixed up with someone...

412
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,868
who used to reside at Missus...
What's her name?

413
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,900
If that's what you thought, nigger,
why'd you give me them damn flowers?

414
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,946
Why didn't you
just give me some money?

415
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:15,911
I did.

416
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,956
Hey, Billie. Listen, listen, all right?

417
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,223
You don't mind
if I call you Billie, do you?

418
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,923
- Don't call me nothing.
- No, listen.

419
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,524
Listen, I know a place downtown.
It's open all night.

420
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,729
A fantastic place. You can eat.
You can have food. You can dance.

421
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,602
You can do anything you want.
Now, come on.

422
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,299
Just like the late-night-supper stuff?

423
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,207
No, no, this is for real, baby.
Listen, there's my car right there.

424
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,873
We can go on right down there
right now. Listen, I like you.

425
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,609
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

426
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,208
- I'm so thrilled.
- Really, seriously.

427
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,347
Please, Billie.

428
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,722
- Please? Pretty please?
- Pretty please.

429
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,325
All right?

430
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,528
Come on. You look so pretty.

431
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,373
What's been going on?

432
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,546
Good evening.

433
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,911
Mr. McKay, it's nice to see you again.

434
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,382
Paul, come stai?

435
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,419
- Bene. Bene. How are you?
- Good.

436
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,046
Gosh, you stayed away a long time.

437
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,580
A sound

438
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,845
UntiI that day
You came my way

439
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,582
With pleasure I never found

440
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,181
It all might have been

441
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,625
Had you been around

442
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,432
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

443
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,303
Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you, Janie.

444
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,467
She gets better-Iooking every day,
doesn't she, guys?

445
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,444
Well, how do you like this place?
Isn't this something?

446
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,176
I wanted to bring you here because
I thought you'd really enjoy yourself.

447
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:04,277
It ain't so hot. I been
to a whole lot of places like this before.

448
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,324
Is that so? Right. Well, where?

449
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,732
Huh?

450
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,171
- Where?
- Where what?

451
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,832
You said you've been
to a lot of places like this before.

452
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,674
- Where?
- Did I say that?

453
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,740
I heard you say that.
Maybe I misunderstood what you said.

454
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,209
What do you think you said?

455
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,587
I said, you ain't so hot.

456
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,624
Well...

457
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,118
I...

458
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,856
I just love the way you talk,
you know what I mean?

459
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,488
Well, you make me...

460
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,228
You know... I've never met
nobody like you before, you know?

461
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,201
You kind of make me speechless.

462
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,330
- Do, I really? I mean, really?
- I mean, yeah.

463
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,408
Right. I don't know
what to do with myself, you see.

464
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,206
I don't even know what to do with
my hands and everything, you know?

465
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,111
You sure have pretty teeth
when you smile.

466
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,808
Okay.

467
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,147
And that, you know...

468
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,891
That dress.
I want to tell you about that dress.

469
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,392
That dress brings out
the best tones in your skin.

470
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,031
Do you feel like dancing?

471
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,739
I don't know.

472
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,139
Well, I feel like dancing.

473
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,316
Go on and dance, then.
Ain't nobody stopping you.

474
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,147
You mean,
you want me to dance by myself?

475
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,414
Okay.

476
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,691
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

477
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,388
Yeah, you really a nice lady, you know?
Come on, now.

478
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,071
Mr. McKay...

479
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,804
I have a confession to make.

480
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,079
What's that?

481
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,517
This place is fantastic...

482
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,077
and so are you.

483
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,055
Yeah.

484
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,391
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

485
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,726
Can't you do it sleeping?

486
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,640
I really can't believe
I'm here with you, you know that?

487
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,404
If you don't go to sleep, you won't be.

488
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,815
That's what I get
for breaking a house rule.

489
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,717
I like to have breakfast alone,
you know what I mean?

490
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,667
What are you doing, woman?

491
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,013
You want me to leave, don't you?

492
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,551
Look, when I want you to leave,
I'll let you know, okay?

493
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,624
Okay.

494
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,383
Okay.

495
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,497
Just so you don't get any big idea,
you understand?

496
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,168
- We'll take this a day at a time.
- Okay.

497
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,005
All right.

498
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,739
Anything you say.

499
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,479
Louis?

500
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,652
Now what?

501
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,088
How do you like your eggs?

502
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,030
I want a pig foot

503
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,102
And a bottle of beer

504
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,750
Is she great? Is she beautiful?

505
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,955
Okay. Okay, folks,
we got a little celebration.

506
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,696
Our lady...

507
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,963
herself, Miss Billie...

508
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,833
appearing in this nightclub for one year.

509
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,608
And in honor of the occasion...
Bring that in, and be careful with it.

510
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,075
Everybody gets a piece.

511
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,615
I mean a hunk. A hunk of the cake.

512
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,149
Courtesy of the house. Yeah.

513
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,319
And everybody's gonna get
a glass of champagne...

514
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:43,120
courtesy of Mr. McKay over there.

515
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,465
Okay. Hey, Mr. Piano Man.

516
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,727
Come here.
You're the guy who discovered her.

517
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,427
How about you propose the toast?

518
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,471
Hey, I'm for that. Hey, Billie.

519
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,302
We got Old Cheapie
to spring for something.

520
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,175
You're beautiful, Jer. Damn, Jer!

521
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,241
Damn, but everything's beautiful.

522
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,612
He even paid the band, Billie,
since you been here.

523
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,686
Beautiful year. And everybody... Girls.
Look at the uniforms!

524
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,653
All right.
Look, even the hoes is making money.

525
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,949
That's only because
you're our biggest trick.

526
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,627
Anyway, Billie, we love you sincerely,
very much, in our hearts.

527
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,065
We sure do.

528
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,769
- You gonna play, Piano Man?
- Yeah.

529
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,340
Key a bar. Okay.

530
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,967
Break it.

531
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,237
For she's a jolly good lady

532
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,575
For she's a jolly good lady

533
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,117
For she's a jolly good lady

534
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,319
Which nobody can deny

535
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,158
Hey, Billie, I want you to meet
two friends of mine.

536
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,322
- This is Harry and Reg. Come on in.
- Yeah.

537
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,525
Come on in. There she is.

538
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,728
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi.

539
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,770
- Hi, Reg. How are you?
- Really nice to meet you.

540
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,308
I hate to interrupt you. I know you're all
celebrating and everything...

541
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,004
but I just sure appreciate meeting you.

542
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,775
My name is Harry Bradford.
That is, if you didn't get it.

543
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,613
- Over there, this is Reg Hanley.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

544
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,549
- Louis McKay.
- We...

545
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,316
We're just fans of yours.

546
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,255
And I need all the fans I can get.

547
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,486
Pull up a couple of chairs, fellows,
and join us.

548
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,720
Thank you.

549
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,631
Where do you fellows play?

550
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,567
Well, actually,
we're playing no place right now.

551
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,128
Fact is, we're trying to form a band
to take a tour around the country...

552
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,765
and we wanted to talk to you
about joining us.

553
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,366
Joining you? You serious?

554
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,672
Very.

555
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,480
A colored singer with a white band?

556
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,745
Yeah. Yeah.

557
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,145
Yeah?

558
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,186
You must want to keep playing no place.

559
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,260
Well, you see, that's exactly the point.

560
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,353
We wouldn't be just another band
with you singing.

561
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,763
We'd be something special
because, well, you're special, Billie.

562
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,334
Here.

563
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,394
There you go.

564
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,364
Thank you.

565
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,374
We'd go straight to the top. I know.

566
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,341
I don't know about no straight to the top.

567
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,105
I'm just trying to get to a club downtown.

568
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,237
We all are.

569
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,441
Of course, you don't understand, see,
the way you get downtown is...

570
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,542
I mean, you know, the way you do that
is that you go out on the road...

571
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,087
and you build up your name
in the sticks, and then, blam!

572
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,317
You get snapped up by network radio,
who're always looking...

573
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,863
for someone big with the hicks
to sell them soap or something.

574
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,625
Yeah, then you come back
to New York...

575
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,257
and besides radio,
there's records, club dates downtown...

576
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,201
- you name it, Billie.
- Just like that, huh?

577
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,568
Well, it works that way sometimes.

578
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,370
You mean to tell me that I have to travel
all the way to East Jesus and back...

579
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:51,504
before I can get in some club downtown
less than five minutes away from here?

580
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,640
- Well...
- They full of shit, ain't they?

581
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:02,584
I just think it'd be fantastic
if you just came with us.

582
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,361
- How about that?
- I'm sorry, fellows.

583
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,066
I think your band
is gonna have to start without me.

584
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,994
I'll tell you what.
Piano Man's got my telephone number.

585
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,367
If you give it some second thoughts,
give us a call.

586
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,539
How you like my timestep, Reg?

587
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,635
I think we might have a part for you,
Miss Holiday...

588
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,373
but we'll have to see your legs.

589
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,718
You know the last time
I saw fields and farm animals...

590
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,656
I was hitching up north from Baltimore
to see my mama.

591
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,490
Leader, I am trying to follow a rule
called "food three times a day"...

592
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,995
but I sense we are dangerously behind.

593
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,588
Let me explain to you.

594
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,793
This is only Tuesday,
and I only feed on Friday.

595
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,067
Stop complaining, Oklahoma.

596
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,297
That's a horrible-Iooking thing.

597
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,603
You mean we have all this fun,
and we still get paid?

598
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,473
Well, about $12 a week,
to do with what you will.

599
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,740
$14? Would you take $8?

600
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,509
Fantastic. I'll take
whatever you give me.

601
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,016
I get the chance to travel.
I get a chance to do everything.

602
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,020
I sense we're in for a lot
of candy stores and a lot of jelly beans.

603
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,420
Can you imagine
someone liking to tour?

604
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,355
Yes, some fun, Billie.

605
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:10,927
Miss Holiday...

606
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:11,518
Miss Holiday...

607
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,391
you're in the South now.

608
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,765
Jesus, look at this.

609
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,168
You got a half an hour, that's all.
Billie, let me help you out of there.

610
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,001
- A whole half-hour?
- Let me help you out.

611
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,631
Half an hour's all we got.

612
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,441
- Put your shoes on, man.
- Get on out here.

613
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,907
Billie, what'll it be? What do you want?

614
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,610
What do I want? What do I really want?

615
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,118
What do you really want?

616
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,551
Well, I'll tell you.

617
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,619
- What?
- I really want...

618
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,517
a steak smothered in onions.

619
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,097
And I really want
a big pot of collard greens.

620
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,222
Right.

621
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,027
- And I want some yams.
- Right.

622
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,329
- I want some black-eyed peas and rice.
- Right.

623
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,563
And I want...

624
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,202
potato pie.

625
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,140
One hot dog, coming up.

626
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,902
- Mustard?
- Oh, crap.

627
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,118
- Hey, Reg...
- Hello, I'm from the Board of Health.

628
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,122
Billie, you ain't missing a thing.

629
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,030
I cried for you

630
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,566
What a fool I used to be

631
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,307
Now I found two eyes

632
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,577
Just a little bit bluer

633
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,914
I found a heart

634
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,011
Just a little bit truer

635
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,057
And I cried for you

636
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:56,394
Now it's your turn
To cry over me

637
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,168
Still think it's fun, Billie?

638
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,672
Watch it, will you?

639
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,644
Sorry to say it's that time again.

640
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,343
This has been the Oasis Cosmetics
Hour from New York, New York...

641
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,250
featuring the new mellow sounds
of our Sweet Sam...

642
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,913
and His Society Swingers.

643
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,082
- So untiI tomorrow night...
- Man, did you hear that?

644
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,853
- Here we go again.
- Did you hear that?

645
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,485
- Yeah.
- Sweet Sam and His Society Sissies.

646
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,156
That's supposed to be us, man.
That should be our gig.

647
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,597
Do you want to be a sissy?

648
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,227
Man, here we are, riding our asses off
all over this cotton-picking country...

649
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,500
trying to win these hicks over,
and what do we got to show for it?

650
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,075
Zero. Nothing, man. Bullshit.

651
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,805
Where is that big radio cat
that's supposed to discover us, Reg?

652
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,608
Where is that son of a bitch, anyway?

653
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,343
Watch your mouth.
Can't you see there's a lady present?

654
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,318
That's right.
Show some respect, you motherfucker.

655
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,649
Billie.

656
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,757
Who is it?

657
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,322
It's Harry.

658
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,960
What do you want?

659
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,465
Can I come in?

660
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,761
Come on.

661
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,240
Gonna be a rehearsal downstairs
in 10 minutes.

662
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,969
Oh, boy.

663
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,472
We got a full day off next week.

664
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,343
I'll be dead by next week.

665
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,995
I'm taking the night off.

666
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,625
You take tonight off...

667
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,734
and, sure as hell, that'll be the night...

668
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:49,273
that Mr. Network Radio Scout
is sitting out front and all the things...

669
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,944
I mean, everything that we've been
doing goes right down the drain...

670
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,851
because, let's face it, Billie,
you are the cream in our coffee.

671
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,617
You got that the wrong way around,
don't you?

672
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,592
We are just another band without you.

673
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:07,823
Okay.

674
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,063
Give me a shot of that bourbon
in my bag, will you?

675
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,637
Well, how about a real...

676
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,008
A real what?

677
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:25,112
One shot and you'II...

678
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,147
be flying.

679
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:31,110
Look, Harry, like I've been telling you...

680
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,249
what you do is your business.

681
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,790
I may be tired, but I ain't dumb.

682
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,350
You're walking across a street. A truck
hits you. You're laying in the street.

683
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,363
They take you to the nearest hospital.
What's the first thing they do?

684
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:46,401
They give you a shot of morphine.
Now, morphine ain't an aspirin.

685
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,971
It's dope.

686
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,533
Do you think that makes you an addict?

687
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,278
One goddamn little shot ain't gonna...

688
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,809
make you a junkie,
but, you know, it keeps you flying.

689
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,410
Okay, Harry.
If I get hit by a truck, I'll call you, okay?

690
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,584
Now get out of here.

691
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,702
Reg, how much longer
before we get to the next town...

692
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,902
- or a gas station or something?
- Well, from the looks of things...

693
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,174
it's gonna be back roads
and cow pastures for quite a while yet.

694
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,442
Pull over to a clump of bushes
or something then?

695
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,915
- No.
- A hedge?

696
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,781
- Come on, please.
- All right.

697
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,753
You have but to ask, madam,
this vehicle is at your disposal.

698
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,120
- How about the lake?
- Come on.

699
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,522
All right.

700
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,594
You should take a look at it out here.

701
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,226
It's beautiful. Look at those trees.

702
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,171
Hey, Billie. Where you going?
You forgot the sheet music.

703
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,043
Just turn your head.

704
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

705
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,665
Come on, Billie.

706
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,707
Let's go. All aboard.

707
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:52,380
Southern trees

708
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,827
Bear a strange fruit

709
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:08,069
Blood on the leaves

710
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,972
And blood at the root

711
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:21,783
Here is a fruit

712
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:27,218
For the crows to pluck

713
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:34,058
For the rain to gather

714
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:40,095
For the wind to suck

715
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:51,106
For the sun to rot

716
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,575
For the tree

717
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:03,091
To drop

718
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:11,866
Here is a strange

719
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,228
And bitter

720
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:23,945
Crop

721
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:39,122
Now we're proud to present our
feature vocalist, Miss Billie Holiday.

722
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,533
You're mean to me

723
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,503
Why must you be mean to me

724
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,438
Gee, honey, it seems to me

725
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,238
You love to see me crying

726
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,574
I don't know why

727
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,615
I stay home
Each night when you

728
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:07,051
Left all alone
Singing the blues and crying

729
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:12,760
You treat me coldly
Each day in the year

730
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:17,228
You always scold me

731
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:22,604
Whenever you're mean to...

732
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,976
Ladies and gentlemen...

733
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,681
Miss Holiday has been experiencing
some dizzy spells.

734
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,486
I'm sure she'll be back with us
in just a little while.

735
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,061
We will continue
with an instrumental right now...

736
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,653
and I'm sure she'll be all right.
Thank you very much.

737
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,993
Thank you.

738
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,471
But if you treat me right, Daddy

739
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,503
I'll stay home every day

740
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,217
If you treat me right, Daddy

741
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,316
I'll stay home every day

742
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,556
But you're so mean to me, baby

743
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:23,928
I know you're gonna drive me away

744
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,835
Love is just like a faucet

745
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,768
It turns off and on

746
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,147
Love is just like a faucet

747
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,179
It turns off and on

748
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,157
Sometimes when you think it's on, baby

749
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,288
It has turned off and gone

750
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,435
How about singing
that Old Black Joe there, Billie.

751
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,233
Come on, now. Don't go.

752
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,103
Sing Old Black Joe.

753
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,071
Thank you. Thank you very much.

754
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,203
Thank you.

755
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,341
You know that ditty Old Black Joe,
don't you, honey, baby?

756
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:19,512
Now, I'd love to do them all for you.
I'd love to do it for you...

757
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,590
but we got something planned here.

758
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,422
A little number called
What a Little Moonlight Can Do.

759
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:11,068
You only shudder
'Cause your poor tongue

760
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,377
Just won't utter
The words

761
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,845
I love you

762
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,781
Miss Billie Holiday.
Let's give her another hand.

763
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,548
Hey, baby.

764
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,758
Baby, what you doing here?

765
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,166
Here, I've been trying
to get you on the phone. Oh, baby.

766
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,735
I missed you so much.

767
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,498
You look so good, baby.

768
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,299
How'd you get here?

769
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,173
Get your clothes off.

770
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,514
I like your style,
but I can't say much for your timing.

771
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,177
Why don't we wait till we get home,
get a nice hot bath?

772
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,275
No.

773
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,185
Whatever you say.
My, my, the man is ready.

774
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,023
Well, so am I.

775
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,795
We've been having a rough tour.

776
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,267
Baby, I'm so happy you're here.

777
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,903
Now, this is all I'm gonna do.

778
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,071
And I want you to do the rest.

779
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,048
You're hurting me.

780
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:30,878
Jesus.

781
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,754
All right, that's it. Come on, let's go.

782
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,518
- I know what you're thinking.
- This tour's over.

783
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,093
I'm the one who sent you here,
and I'm taking you back home...

784
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,162
so get your things, let's go.

785
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,729
Wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking.

786
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,230
I don't wanna hear about it.
Just come home.

787
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,560
I'm not hooked.

788
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,063
No, I ain't going.

789
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,939
I ain't going, Louis.

790
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:02,082
Billie, listen to me.

791
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:06,745
All right.

792
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:13,562
Billie, it...

793
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,794
Believe me when I tell you
that this is for your own good.

794
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,630
Don't preach to me, Louis.

795
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,967
All that I plan for you
is done with you in mind.

796
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,940
You affect my whole life, baby.
I love you.

797
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,503
- Lf you go down, baby. I go down, too.
- I'm not going down...

798
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,881
because there ain't no place down there
I wanna be.

799
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:41,145
Be going up, baby.
It'll just take a little time.

800
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,319
I love you, too. I love you.

801
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,392
Sure, I've taken a few shots,
but only when I needed it...

802
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,591
and I'm not hooked, Louis. Wait, baby.

803
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:56,228
Only when you needed it.
What do you think hooked is?

804
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:01,167
All I had to do is listen to your voice
on the telephone, and I knew.

805
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,471
Who do you think you're talking to?

806
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,172
One of those old fake cats
you be running around with?

807
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:09,445
I've been on those streets all of my life.
I know what that shit is.

808
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,385
It's good, ain't it?

809
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,420
Wait. Wait, wait.

810
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,159
We're going home, now.

811
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,965
Wait, hey, baby, wait.

812
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,058
See? You don't understand.

813
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,531
Now, you don't know how it is...

814
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:34,131
when people are looking down at you
and laughing at you...

815
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,438
and think that I'm a loser.

816
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,514
And if I go home now,
I'll think that I'm one, too.

817
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,175
I gotta prove it to them,
I gotta prove it to myself.

818
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,548
What're you proving with that needle?

819
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,214
That you're not woman enough
to make it without a crutch...

820
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,960
a magic way out
when the going gets a little too rough?

821
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,820
I want you to make it, too, baby,
but not this way. Not this way.

822
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,454
Okay.

823
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,631
Okay, I promise you
I won't take any more stuff.

824
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,969
I promise you. I gotta stay out here.
You're gonna let me stay?

825
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,668
- No.
- Louis, please.

826
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,371
I get it. I'll be big, and then I can work
at a good club, and we'll be together.

827
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,108
I promise you, I won't take
any more stuff. Come on, Louis.

828
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,910
Come on, Louis,
won't you take your clothes off?

829
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,719
Come on, Louis, please. I can't go now.

830
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,883
I gotta take you home, baby,
because I know...

831
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,255
I ain't going.

832
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:29,991
Hey, Crazy Maurice and Weird Lucille
want us to go out there with them.

833
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:33,125
Lady, what do you have this door
locked for? You cool?

834
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,135
I'm fine, Harry.

835
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,237
Come on in.

836
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:45,044
Well, there he is. How the hell are you?

837
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,212
He's fine.

838
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,481
I just dropped by to see
if you needed anything...

839
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,186
like a trip back to the hotel
or something...

840
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,730
but I guess you got it covered...

841
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,232
- so I'll catch you later, okay?
- See you at the hotel.

842
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,369
Bye. See you at the hotel.

843
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,375
Harry's a good friend.

844
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,817
That's what every little girl needs,
a good friend like Harry.

845
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,356
Okay.

846
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:36,662
I'm gonna get some gas for the car,
and I'll take you back to the hotel.

847
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,192
Louis...

848
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,034
I love you.

849
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,075
I promise you. No more stuff, okay?

850
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,074
I promise you.

851
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,221
Nine.

852
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,923
- Come on, Billie.
- Five.

853
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,933
- Eight.
- Seven.

854
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,159
Here we go, babe.

855
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,067
$2 she hits them.

856
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,540
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

857
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,617
Billie, get out of sight.

858
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,809
- Billie, come on.
- No, goddamn.

859
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,078
Billie, get out of sight.
