1
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,515
<i>- Americano.</i>
<i>- Ś, americano.</i>

2
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,075
<i>Ah! Pilota!</i>

3
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,991
Party, inward... turn!

4
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,631
Party... flag!

5
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,150
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself...

6
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,312
...the soul of our dear brother here departed...

7
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,233
...we therefore commit his body to the ground.

8
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,315
<i>Uno, due, tre!</i>

9
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,712
Detail, outward... turn!

10
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,869
Detail... quick march!

11
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,316
Major Fincham, will you now
please dismiss your men? Please.

12
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,951
- Where is your commandant?
- As I told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.

13
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,828
His orders are to disperse
immediately after the funeral.

14
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,796
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!

15
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,391
<i>Grazie.</i>

16
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,471
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.

17
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,269
What are they celebrating out there?

18
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,351
<i>Signor maggiore.</i>

19
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,750
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.

20
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,031
Don't you salute senior officers
in your army, Major?

21
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,108
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.

22
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,237
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,950
And add this: No wonder Italy's
losing the war, with officers like him.

24
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,111
Well?

25
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,712
Battaglia! Battaglia!

26
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,234
Battaglia! Battaglia!

27
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,915
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

28
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,673
Battaglia! Battaglia!

29
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,351
We have today buried
our commanding officer...

30
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,829
...Colonel Brian David Lockart!

31
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,436
The purpose of this parade
is to bear witness to his death...

32
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,557
...and charge the man responsible for it!

33
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,151
Major Battaglia!

34
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,996
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you
with the murder of Colonel Lockart!

35
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,152
Come forward and meet your accusers!

36
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,391
<i>Ś, signor maggiore.</i>

37
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,233
Battaglia! Battaglia!

38
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,309
Follow me, please.

39
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,632
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

40
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,912
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss
your men now, it will be out of my hands.

41
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,595
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.

42
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,791
You've shot one of my men!

43
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,069
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.

44
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,431
Dismiss.

45
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,878
Parade... dismiss!

46
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,029
Captain Stein! One moment.

47
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,237
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.

48
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,508
- American.
- Army Air Corps.

49
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,755
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?

50
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,832
We took Messina three days ago.

51
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,356
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

52
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,512
I'm still trying to get
what my boys have needed all along.

53
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,559
I'm afraid I still have the same answer
for you: There isn't any.

54
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,991
Easy, fellas. Easy.

55
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,431
Over here, Colonel.

56
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,074
The stool will do.

57
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,517
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, I'm afraid.

58
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,672
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.

59
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,035
Made worse by malnutrition.

60
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,908
- I've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.

61
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,552
How come you can't control
the malaria with drugs?

62
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,995
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.

63
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,152
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.

64
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,276
And clean up some of this filth.

65
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,999
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.

66
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,709
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's
punishment for escape attempts.

67
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,429
He's taken our soap and razors,
turned off our shower baths...

68
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,116
...issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross
parcels, and kept us on half rations.

69
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,988
But he can't break us,
and he can't stop us trying to escape.

70
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,514
Even with the way
the war is going for us now?

71
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,989
Are you suggesting
we should knuckle under?

72
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,709
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.

73
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,832
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion, fellas?

74
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,511
What do <i>you</i> think?

75
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,155
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir...

76
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,631
...I'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.

77
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,471
I can't expect you to understand this,
but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.

78
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,836
This regiment fought
with Mariborough in 1704...

79
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,957
...with Wellington against Napoleon,
and in the Crimea.

80
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,875
These men are all volunteers, professionals,
and they've come to fight a war.

81
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,196
It may come as news to you, Major,
but that's why we're all here.

82
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,432
Yes, but each in his different way. You
ought to know that. You're a professional.

83
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,399
Negative. I'm what they call at home
a 90-day wonder.

84
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,473
- I'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.
- Ours is soldiering.

85
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,636
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?

86
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,713
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.

87
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,870
Can somebody show me where I bunk?

88
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,757
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?

89
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,400
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,471
We dine at six, sir.

91
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,471
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.

92
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,553
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.

93
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,753
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.

94
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,433
The reason we didn't say anything to you
in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.

95
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,511
They've all gone to mess.

96
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,075
- Are you cold, son?
- It's that damn malaria.

97
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,312
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.

98
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,517
And, man, what dreams!
You know what I mean, sir?

99
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,909
- No. What?
- Well, they...

100
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,594
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?

101
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,118
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.

102
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,470
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.

103
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,792
And if we don't get some decent grub and
medicine, that's gonna double and triple.

104
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,156
That's tough. From what I've seen,
everybody's in the same boat.

105
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,073
Sure, because the guys running it
are section eight.

106
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,914
Those stir-crazy limey officers
are trying to fight the war from in here.

107
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,231
They got so many tunnels dug,
you could fall into one.

108
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,835
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.

109
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,074
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to
defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.

110
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,957
But if they'd let up, he would too.

111
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,989
With Sicily gone, our guys will come through
Italy like shoe polish through a tin horn.

112
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,197
All we gotta do is get healthy,
sit tight and wait.

113
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,796
These people have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.

114
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,271
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.

115
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,914
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo,
our regimental chaplain.

116
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,956
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.

117
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,828
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.

118
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,275
Colonel Lockart always sat here.

119
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,956
I'll be fine right here. Thank you.

120
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,273
Major, if you don't mind talking about it,
how did your colonel buy it?

121
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,749
He struck Battaglia with his stick.

122
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,715
Do you see that sweatbox there?

123
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,675
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.

124
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,752
Which makes you
the senior officer of this camp.

125
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,678
My regiment will await your orders.

126
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,274
It's still your regiment, Major.

127
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,351
Thank you, sir.

128
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,793
It's made from pumpkins, you know.

129
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,474
Just a little different, don't you think?

130
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,677
We couldn't help noticing
where you sat, Colonel.

131
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,070
It took 200 years to make officers
like those. It took me 90 days.

132
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,594
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their ball game.

133
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,274
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.

134
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,749
Now we got us a bird colonel.

135
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,916
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?

136
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,709
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

137
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,750
Bird is right. Chicken.

138
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,354
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.

139
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,478
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?

140
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,757
Dodging the lights, I mean.
It's pretty important.

141
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,433
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.

142
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,514
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold
two tons of it if we spread it around right.

143
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,432
Sorry to ask you to make this trip,
but I thought you ought to be here.

144
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,956
Your countrymen were caught
trying to steal supplies.

145
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,271
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.

146
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,192
These men are thieves.

147
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,239
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approval to punish them.

148
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,676
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parcels, sir.

149
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,639
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?

150
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,837
Perfectly. But these men are thieves
and should be punished.

151
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,391
Negative. These men are sick. You've also got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.

152
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,314
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.

153
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,834
Everyone in camp's been exposed to malaria.

154
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,471
The only way a man has a chance of escape is
for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.

155
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,439
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick,
get these men outta here. See me later.

156
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,511
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.

157
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,197
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?

158
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,480
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!

159
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,317
I'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver
those parcels tonight. Is that clear, mister?

160
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,230
You'd better know what you're doing,
unless you want a mutiny on your hands.

161
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,470
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?

162
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,712
Wellington and Mariborough would
spin in their graves, Major, what?

163
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,757
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.

164
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,434
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain...

165
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,229
...l'm assuming command
as senior officer of the camp.

166
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,428
That is, of course, between you.
I will inform Major Battaglia.

167
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,910
I'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?

168
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,755
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.

169
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,031
Stand at... ease!

170
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,111
Stand easy.

171
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,789
<i>Avanti!</i>

172
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,913
My major warns you that he has
no patience left with the prisoners.

173
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,993
By taking command, you have become
personally responsible for their actions.

174
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,832
Good.

175
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,153
And tell him that, from now on, things will be
much more different than they've been.

176
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,914
You have made a good impression
on the major.

177
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,596
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.

178
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,278
Ask the major to come with me now. I'll prove
how different things'll be around this camp.

179
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,310
What in heaven's name is he doing?

180
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,436
What does it look like?

181
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,556
Ryan!

182
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,232
Ryan!

183
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,438
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.

184
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,957
- I'm glad you could join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'll pay for it.

185
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,353
You're just in time to watch. Have the men
turn about face so they can watch too. Major?

186
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,870
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.

187
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,555
Parade... about... turn!

188
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,916
All right. Now hear this.

189
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,632
While I'm in command, anyone attempting
to escape will be held for court martial.

190
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,598
Clear?

191
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,399
Stand steady on parade!

192
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,194
You'll get the Nazi Iron Cross
for this, Von Ryan!

193
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,593
By order of the commandant, the showers
will be turned on at 1200 hours.

194
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,188
Razors will be provided
and delousing powder issued.

195
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,071
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels
will be distributed once a week.

196
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,878
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.

197
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,714
What about the clothing in the Red Cross
parcels in that storage house?

198
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,234
I advise you to forget this matter.

199
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,950
Sure, because Battaglia's got a black market
going in Red Cross clothes. Right?

200
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,669
You tell this man I trusted him
as a gentleman. I want those clothes.

201
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,312
I'm sorry. The major says
he cannot issue... wine.

202
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,951
Wine? Who the hell said anything
about wine? I'm talking about clothes.

203
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,951
It's for your own good, Colonel.

204
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,671
You let yourself be bought
pretty cheaply, didn't you?

205
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,149
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!

206
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,310
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.

207
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,518
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse,
and use anything else you might need.

208
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,999
Right, sir.

209
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,350
Major Fincham, you will give
an order for the men to strip.

210
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,159
Strip. Understand? Naked.

211
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,871
Parade... strip.

212
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,875
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!

213
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,512
And, Major, that goes for the officers as well.

214
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,390
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front
of the line and throw it in the fire!

215
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,708
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.

216
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,632
Sir, I take being
a member of the cloth literally.

217
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,871
I bow to your convictions, Captain.

218
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,673
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!

219
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,632
The major feels the fire
should be put out at once.

220
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,837
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.

221
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,834
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.

222
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,911
Now what about the clothing?

223
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,392
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.

224
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,199
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must follow me.

225
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,111
Good show, Colonel!

226
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,115
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.

227
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,034
We made it, Colonel. Our guys
landed at Salerno. Italy's surrendered.

228
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,033
That's great. Just great.

229
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,069
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but
these limeys back here are giving us trouble.

230
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,151
Hello, sir. Are you all right?

231
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,152
Could you come right away? There's trouble.

232
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,394
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.

233
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,029
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.

234
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,070
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer...

235
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,075
...Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.

236
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,030
If the court pleases.

237
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,671
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm still the senior officer in this camp.

238
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,639
We're holding a summary court martial
exactly according to regulations.

239
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,349
What happens when you find him guilty,
according to regulations?

240
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,989
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.

241
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,789
No, sir. We're still at war,
and the enemy is still the enemy.

242
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,713
I say hang him!

243
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,356
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.

244
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,193
The parade will stand at ease!

245
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,389
The major begs me to say that...

246
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,471
...he never meant you harm.

247
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,269
It was Mussolini and his Fascists
who forced him to be harsh.

248
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,034
Now it's all finished for Italy.

249
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,356
Let the killing be finished too.

250
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,430
You want your revenge with this?

251
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,636
I wantjustice.

252
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,555
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other
dead, but for those of us who are still alive.

253
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,437
We're 200 miles behind the lines.

254
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,038
I say not only military justice but military
sense dictates we cannot turn this man loose.

255
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,509
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.

256
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,830
- You all wantjustice?
-  Yes!

257
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,310
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.

258
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,391
- No!
- Yes!

259
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,358
You fool.

260
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,228
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.

261
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,474
Damn your rank. If letting that scum live
costs the life of one of my men, I promise...

262
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,395
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!

263
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,435
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.

264
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,830
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.

265
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,151
- I could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.

266
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,037
- I'll lead you.
- Why should you?

267
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,350
You think you hate the Germans
more than I do?

268
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,874
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.

269
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,952
But I'm in command here
and I say we move - now.

270
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,312
Halt!

271
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,190
German convoy! Everybody down!

272
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,556
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.

273
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,031
Let them rest there for the night
while I go ahead and contact the ships.

274
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,755
How much farther to the coast?

275
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,549
Five... perhaps six miles.
I should be back well before dawn.

276
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,474
That's as pretty a place for a trap
as I've ever seen.

277
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,155
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be
waiting for you. Now let's go.

278
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,389
<i>Kamerad.</i>

279
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,271
Face it, Yank.

280
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,591
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.

281
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,875
We're left in a box.

282
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,951
Colonel!

283
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,431
Something's moving!

284
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,999
Out! Out!

285
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,435
Germans! Scatter!

286
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,398
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!

287
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,031
OK. Now.

288
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,911
Hold it. Hold it!

289
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,715
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein
and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.

290
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,836
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.

291
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,914
They will remain behind so we can care
for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.

292
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,239
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani
led us to the railhead and turned us in.

293
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,914
It was that pig who betrayed us!

294
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,271
I'll kill you!

295
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,118
They've cared for our wounded properly now.
The poor bastards.

296
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,634
Just cos you let Battaglia live!

297
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,076
You'll get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.

298
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,751
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
It means we must still be headed north.

299
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,518
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's
got us all a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.

300
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,751
- Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.

301
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,434
Listen, I'll take you on any time you like!

302
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,231
We are coming in to Rome.

303
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,114
I am Major von Klement,
now in command of this prison train.

304
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,435
You will be in my charge
until we reach the final destination.

305
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,911
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief,
and there is food and water for all.

306
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,597
Major von Klement?

307
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,438
Captain Oriani is an Italian officer. He's not
a prisoner of war. He doesn't belong with us.

308
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,035
I have my orders.

309
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,032
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

310
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,509
The guards are on top again.

311
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,637
They're not needed here
as far as we're concerned.

312
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,309
No chance of our tunnelling
through <i>this</i> coop, Von Ryan.

313
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,478
Say, Doc, you got a knife
in that manicuring kit of yours?

314
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,879
Are you planning
to snip your way through it?

315
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,712
No.

316
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,314
I'm planning to <i>tunnel</i> my way through it.

317
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,311
Do you mind, Major?

318
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,476
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until...
until the wheels hit cross tracks.

319
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,199
It will cover the sound of the wood breaking.

320
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,559
It's impossible to get out
while we are moving.

321
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,031
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'll risk it.

322
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,750
- What about the rest? If one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?

323
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,434
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!

324
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,229
They have machine pistols
and we have bare hands.

325
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,199
If we could take one gun from one guard...

326
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,551
Oriani?

327
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,877
Turn around.

328
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,951
Go on. Just turn around.

329
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,512
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?

330
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,072
You got a better idea?

331
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,550
It would take you too long
to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.

332
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,428
The average Nazi would get impatient
while you were doing it.

333
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,511
Orde.

334
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,558
The knots smash his larynx, the knee
breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.

335
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,517
Thug garrotte - India.

336
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,114
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?

337
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,238
If you haven't the guts for it, I'll do it.

338
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,871
We're stopping again.

339
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,916
Something must have gone wrong.

340
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,037
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.

341
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,791
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.

342
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,678
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'll take.

343
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,558
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.

344
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,074
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.

345
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,754
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.

346
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,873
If you fail, the Germans
won't have to kill you. I will.

347
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,313
Shut up.

348
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,071
Shh. Shh.

349
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,198
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.

350
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,637
Let's turn 'em loose.

351
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,757
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.

352
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,230
- I can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.

353
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,711
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!

354
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,791
Get this stiff in the boxcar.

355
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,791
Get those bods in quick!

356
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,631
Move, you people! Come on, move!

357
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,109
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!

358
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,349
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'll be miles away.

359
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,474
Damn thing's right behind us.

360
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,751
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.

361
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,551
Come on. Come on!

362
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,756
All the comforts of home.

363
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,957
Please. I am Italian.
I have done nothing. Please.

364
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,671
- What on earth are you doing here, my child?
- Padre, you're priceless.

365
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,277
Don't you think she ought to
get dressed while we discuss it?

366
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,113
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.

367
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,357
Now, about some questions, Major.

368
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,431
- May I rise?
- Of course.

369
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,994
I will answer no questions, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>

370
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,910
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.

371
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,199
I want the schedule of when and where we're
gonna get that food you promised us. Clear?

372
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,996
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?

373
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,789
The train will stop in the rail complex
and the prisoners can dismount.

374
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,269
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!

375
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,630
Looks like we're headed for Innsbruck.

376
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,790
What do these circles mean, Major?

377
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,477
I am to receive instructions in those cities
from the dispatchers. I, myself. No one else.

378
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,791
Did you receive those instructions
through that radio there?

379
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,270
- No. It is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.

380
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,113
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.

381
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,437
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.

382
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,399
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?

383
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,472
In Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.

384
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,031
If you now wish to be sensible, I will see
that you are treated with respect in Florence.

385
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,317
We had a sample of your Nazi respect
when we boarded this train.

386
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,518
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.

387
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:48,433
Von Klement's identification papers and
railroad priority, good as far as Florence.

388
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,717
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.

389
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,916
I went to Breslau after Oxford.

390
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,390
Would the dispatcher in Florence
recognise the major by sight?

391
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,313
- He'd be an Italian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.

392
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,075
- And I think you're lying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a flap...

393
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,631
...the chances that the dispatcher
will ask for identification is pretty small.

394
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,156
Will ask whom? I mean,
you just said just now...

395
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,032
- Yes. It'll just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremely foolish!

396
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,112
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...

397
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,476
But... look at this picture!
I don't look remotely like this chap.

398
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,028
No, no. I won't do it.

399
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,111
I won't do it. Absolutely not.

400
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,912
- <i>Heil Hitler!</i>
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.

401
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,037
- It won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.

402
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,396
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.

403
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,789
Slap your gloves against your leg.

404
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,118
<i>- Heil Hitler!</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

405
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,111
<i>Gut. Sehr gut.</i>

406
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,794
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?

407
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,749
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to
check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.

408
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,308
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.

409
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,598
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- While we were passing over the last bridge.

410
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,912
The lieutenant wants our men down
from the top of the train, to be fed first.

411
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,878
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.

412
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,951
We've had it.

413
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,550
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?

414
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,391
Better check our lovebirds.

415
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,951
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

416
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,431
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

417
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,837
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

418
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,274
- Here they come!
- My God, they've done it!

419
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,395
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.

420
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,513
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.

421
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,078
They must be moving
a couple of divisions south.

422
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,879
From the map, we'll be away
from the main roads by dark.

423
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,791
The men could be gone in ten minutes.

424
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,270
How do we get ten minutes
with that troop train only five behind us?

425
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,069
- It could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.

426
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,278
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.

427
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:32,833
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by
an X on the map, I will be properly grateful.

428
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,913
At Verona, both the train crew and
guard detail is scheduled to be changed.

429
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,309
That's if we go to Verona.

430
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,152
Look here.

431
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,629
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we...

432
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,273
...we could pass it and go
to the left into Milano.

433
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,831
And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?

434
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,118
But this train is under the orders
of the German high command.

435
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,795
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train...

436
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,193
...requires a written order signed by
a member of the general staff, Colonel.

437
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,319
Major, yours is not the only army
that works in triplicate forms.

438
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,475
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.

439
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,038
- Does that mean general staff?
- It does indeed.

440
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,830
Well, now. We've got a pad full of blank forms
and we've got a typewriter.

441
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,993
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.

442
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,911
Quite.

443
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,470
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.

444
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,432
Upon arriving in Bologna,
he's told to go to Milan...

445
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,594
...where he is given confidential
instructions from Gruppenführer...

446
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,470
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.

447
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,758
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge
of a trainload of sealed boxcars...

448
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,833
...to be delivered to somebody...
big, important.

449
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,673
- Fatso Goering.
- <i>Der dicke Hermann.</i> Brilliant!

450
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,149
- Loot for the <i>Reichsmarschall.</i>
- Major?

451
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,074
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'll give you that.

452
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,438
And we have it signed by our good friend
from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.

453
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,875
<i>- Amerikanisch, nicht?</i>
<i>- Ja.</i>

454
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,594
<i>Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.</i>

455
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,837
<i>Danke sehr.</i>

456
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,911
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

457
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,911
Give this to the engineer.

458
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,351
Gestapo.

459
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,837
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 12 points.

460
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,911
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.

461
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,991
Leave it. Everybody stay low.

462
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,754
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.

463
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,031
<i>Gestapo.</i>

464
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,594
<i>Nylon.</i>

465
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,751
<i>Amerikanische Zigaretten.</i>

466
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,751
<i>Ja.</i>

467
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,117
That chap ought to be
reported to his superiors.

468
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,391
That's the end of ruddy that.

469
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,791
<i>Colonnello.</i>

470
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,990
- We have found it.
- Found what?

471
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,870
We have found a place to leave the train.
An abandoned branch line halfway to Milano.

472
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,076
Come on. Let's have a look.

473
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,511
Looks to be about...

474
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,431
...90 miles.

475
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,755
- We'll get there by 2100 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.

476
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,358
- That's better still. It'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.

477
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,558
We don't need him any more. Or her either.

478
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,269
Don't flinch. If you haven't
the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.

479
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,430
- I'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?

480
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,431
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.

481
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,114
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- I'm afraid not.

482
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,556
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!

483
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,269
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?

484
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,635
May I go to my compartment now?

485
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,711
Yes, of course.

486
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,798
You haven't had any food
since we took over the train.

487
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,873
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.

488
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:43,835
You cannot hide it. I know you will do
what the British major wants.

489
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,717
You mean to kill you both?

490
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,839
It is the right thing.
In your place, I would do it.

491
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,119
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.

492
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,794
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

493
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,391
Not to help me?

494
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,911
If I can, yes.

495
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,631
That is what all men say.

496
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,113
How old are you?

497
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,431
The first was the same man
who helped my mother.

498
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,431
I was not yet confirmed then.

499
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,312
Such things do not happen in America?

500
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,275
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.

501
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,989
- Is that all?
- There is a war, you know.

502
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,118
Yeah.

503
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,791
How did you say it?

504
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,631
Relax?

505
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,869
You think my legs are too thin?

506
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,108
Why don't you close the door?

507
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,390
I will.

508
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,471
On the way out.

509
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,468
-  We need water! We're hungry too!
- Knock it off in there!

510
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,678
- If they knew what was going on, they would.
- They'll just have to sweat it out.

511
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,349
What the hell are we waiting for now?

512
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,435
Come on!

513
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,791
They're gone. They're not here.

514
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,311
He's dead.

515
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,634
Back! Back! Get up on top!

516
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:00,714
- We can't leave them behind to talk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.

517
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,591
Get back!

518
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,231
All right. Let's move.

519
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,711
Get this train moving now!

520
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,634
Don't run away!

521
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,672
Get your hands off me
or I'll blow your head off!

522
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,993
These tracks have quite a shine
for not having been used.

523
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,833
Something's been running on this spur.

524
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:04,715
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.

525
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,189
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.

526
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,909
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.

527
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,031
All cars unload!

528
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,434
- Those are not German planes.
- American?

529
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,592
No. British. Lancaster, I think.

530
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,195
Sorry to turn you out in the middle
of nowhere, but it can't be helped.

531
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,430
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.

532
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,832
We'll form up again and have another crack
at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.

533
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,593
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!

534
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,231
Get back! Get back on the train!

535
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,070
Come on, move! Back! Get in!

536
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,559
Come on, move! Back!

537
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,392
Oriani!

538
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,473
Take this train outta here! Go! Go! Come on!

539
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,592
Let the coward go!

540
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,270
Stop the train!

541
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,071
Bostick! Bostick!

542
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:03,472
- Injured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!

543
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,790
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?

544
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:28,518
Three dead, and the rest need better help than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the line.

545
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,955
<i>Colonnello.</i>

546
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,554
This man thinks he can get us through.

547
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:37,269
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.

548
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,557
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.

549
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,750
Here. North of Milano, where the track forks.

550
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,478
Since the war, all traffic
goes right, into Germany.

551
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,155
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass
route, goes to Switzerland.

552
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,357
In a matter of hours
we could be over the border and free.

553
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,911
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.

554
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,312
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.

555
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:09,076
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower
at the beginning of the traffic complex.

556
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,072
This tower controls the whole Milano area.

557
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,438
If we can capture it and smash the signals,
the main station, here...

558
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,672
...will not know where we are until
they repair it, but by then it will be too late.

559
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,035
We can go through Milano without stopping?

560
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,509
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.

561
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,991
Let's move.

562
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,111
Come on! Come on!

563
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,871
Let's go!

564
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:49,511
Soon we cross back into the complex. If the
power is back on, we will show on the board.

565
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,957
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.

566
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,957
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.

567
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:55,430
From there it's downgrade
all the way to Switzerland.

568
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,990
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
If they've blocked the line ahead...

569
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,198
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.

570
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,271
Ryan.

571
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,355
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.

572
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,239
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.

573
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:43,151
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!

574
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:53,553
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.

575
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,678
Pepino! Pepino!

576
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:26,269
Messerschmitt!

577
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,594
He's trying to blow the engine.

578
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,831
Here comes his chum.

579
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,037
There's another one!

580
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,033
Oriani!

581
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,873
OK, let's go.

582
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:46,430
What the hell's he saying?

583
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:53,591
That footbridge leads around the mountain!
It's shorter than the tunnel to the other side.

584
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,390
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!

585
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,558
Move it! Move it!

586
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:35,116
- Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

587
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,158
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!

588
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,193
Back!

589
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,075
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.

590
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:17,030
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.

591
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,954
What about the German
troop train back there?

592
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,429
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?

593
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,308
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?

594
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,949
It's simple. Remove track
from behind the train - put it here.

595
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:43,433
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!

596
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,870
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.

597
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,714
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!

598
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,952
