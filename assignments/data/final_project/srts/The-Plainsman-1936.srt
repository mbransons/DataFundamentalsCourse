1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,920
Gentlemen,
the war is over at last.

3
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,752
The men are coming back.

4
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,520
The living are coming back.

5
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,630
We shall have
hundreds of thousands
of disbanded soldiers.

6
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,893
Idle men.

7
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,401
Men badly in need
of work, Mr. President.

8
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,995
Gentlemen, we have
the country to save fiirst.

9
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,236
But these men
have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.

10
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,212
Their return home
in such great numbers
might paralyze industry...

11
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,684
by furnishing suddenly a greater
supply oflabor than for which
there could be a demand.

12
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,050
Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.

13
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,056
I have read an editorial
in the Terra Haute Express...

14
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:16,585
written by Mr.John Soule,
in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''

15
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,961
Where there is
room for all.

16
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,298
Gentlemen, our land
stretches from an Eastern sea
to a Western sea.

17
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,033
Surely, in that vast territory,
there is a place for men
to live and work and be happy.

18
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,837
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.

19
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,574
I hope to attract our disbanded
soldiers to the hidden wealth
of our mountain ranges...

20
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,276
and to the wealth
that lies in the soil itself.

21
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,717
And to the grasslands
of the Great Plains.

22
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,986
The fields of Illinois,
the broken sod of Kansas,

23
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,994
the long furrows
of the West.

24
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,691
Yes, Mr. President,
but if only the frontier
could be made safe for the plow.

25
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,699
It must be made safe.

26
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,430
But during the war
hostile Indians massacred
our settlers there.

27
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,632
- Mr. Lincoln?
- Yes, Mary?

28
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,302
We'll be late
for the theater.

29
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:09,314
Gentlemen, I promised
to take Mrs. Lincoln
to Ford's Theater tonight.

30
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,680
We will continue this
tomorrow...

31
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,721
for the frontier
must be made safe.

32
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,086
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.

33
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,091
Good night, Mr. President.

34
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,218
I have never seen him
looking so well.

35
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,958
But the war is over,
and we have on our hands
order after order...

36
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,966
canceled by
the government.

37
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,002
Hundreds of thousands
of rifles unsold.

38
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,766
Once we were the saviors
of our country.
Now we're outcasts.

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,308
Our money invested
in an unsalable product.

40
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,708
But a good product, gentlemen.

41
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,975
A new repeating rifle would have
made short work of the war...

42
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,040
had it been introduced earlier.

43
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,418
But now the subject of guns
is an unpopular topic...

44
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,721
to those who needed them
so badly a short while ago.

45
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,819
We'll have to look to Providence
for a market.

46
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,126
Providence? Where?

47
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:04,067
I've been told that the Indians
hunt with bow and arrow.

48
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,231
Still, they obtain furs,
valuable buffalo hides,

49
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,605
otter, fox and beaver.

50
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,045
With our new repeating rifle--

51
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,877
Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?

52
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,680
I have every reason
to believe the Indians
will pay $1 00 for each rifle.

53
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:25,690
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece
for every cartridge.

54
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
But we can't sell rifles
to the Indians!

55
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,622
I think we can...
to peaceable Indians.

56
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,393
But how--
For hunting.

57
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,926
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,768
Won't they use those guns
against white men?

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,970
We'll get the Indians
to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!

60
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,343
But why?
It's bound to make trouble
on the frontier.

61
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,882
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right
to do it.

62
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,441
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.

63
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,818
They control trade
with the Indians.
They did, my friend.

64
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,950
But Indian affairs
have been taken out
of the hands of the army...

65
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,552
and given to
a civilian authority.

66
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,223
A civilian authority?
Yep,

67
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,894
in which we are to have
a certain participation.

68
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,598
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.

69
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:18,110
But who sells the rifles?
Ask Mr. Lattimer
to come in.

70
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,381
Perhaps not the most
personable gentleman...

71
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,748
but certainly
the man for our needs.

72
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,950
Gentlemen, this is
Mr.John Lattimer,
How do you do?

73
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,822
who will distribute our rifles
through St. Louis...

74
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,057
to Hays City and
all the Great Plains.

75
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,827
Right, Mr. Lattimer?
I said I'd do it.

76
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,835
Van Ellyn, if ever
Mr. Lincoln finds out--

77
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,064
It's a legitimate business.

78
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,403
The Ford Theater.!

79
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,772
Open that window!

80
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,108
Lincoln shot at Ford's Theater.!

81
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,082
The president is dying.!

82
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,246
Hear that?
Someone has shot the president.

83
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,585
They say he's dying.

84
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,649
Only yesterday afternoon
I was talking to him
at the Capitol.

85
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,525
Maybe it isn't true.
We must learn the facts.

86
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,258
A terrible thing,
Mr. Lattimer.

87
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,995
Yes, a national calamity.

88
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,597
You will leave at once
for St. Louis.

89
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,371
Dearie me.
Terrible thing.

90
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,219
Oh, there he is.

91
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,315
- Excuse me, soldier!
- Bull's-eye!

92
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,875
I didn't see ya.
That's all right, son.

93
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,718
Come here
and let me see your gun.

94
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,725
You haven't got
any notches on it.

95
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,132
What'd I kill?

96
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,171
Don't you see that great big
buffalo laying there kickin'?

97
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,436
Yeah. He's a big one,
ain't he?

98
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,535
Give me your knife,
and we'll skin 'im.

99
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:38,550
You better not.
You might find out
he's been eating potatoes.

100
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,748
Gee, whillikens.
I'll bet you could kill
a buffalo with this knife.

101
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,313
You can't kill a buffalo
with a knife.

102
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:49,225
Aw. I'll bet
Buffalo Bill could.

103
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,628
You know what
I saw him do once?
What?

104
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,893
First give me back
my Arkansas toothpick.

105
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,027
You give me
back my gun.

106
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:02,131
I saw Buffalo Bill
shoot at a whole herd
of them once.

107
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,768
At first I thought
he'd missed.

108
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,177
Then two of them started
coughing and fell down dead.

109
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,910
He'd killed 'em both and raised
a big cloud of dust a mile and a half
the other side of them.

110
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,283
And that isn't all.

111
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:19,313
That little cloud
of dust he raised
grew into a whirlwind,

112
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,123
turned itself into
a cyclone and wiped out
one-fourth ofTexas...

113
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,026
before they could stop it.

114
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,362
Jimminies!
That's the kind
of shootin' I aim to do.

115
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,812
That whistle's just
a half a minute wrong.

116
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,576
Listen.

117
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,777
Don't that beat all.
Cute, isn't it?

118
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,618
Say, you're dressed
like a scout there.

119
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,250
So's your sister.

120
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,726
That's not my sister.
That's CalamityJane.

121
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,320
Was she your best girl?

122
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,493
Son, one of these days
you're gonna grow up,

123
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,536
and you ought
to know about women.

124
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:09,234
You see, the thing is this,
women are, uh--

125
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,799
Well, they're, um--

126
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,107
Well, son--

127
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,341
I can tell you what an Indian
will do to ya,

128
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,849
but you never know
what a woman will do.

129
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,819
Why?
Well--

130
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,015
Let's go down and take a look
at that fire engine.

131
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,457
If you don't like her,
what do you carry
her picture around for?

132
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,725
It's the only good picture
of me I ever had taken.

133
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,461
I can't cut her off
without cutting off
my chin.

134
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,027
John Lattimer, 1 7.
I see a good mark.

135
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,336
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Wait. I see an easy mark.

136
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,342
Where?
John Lattimer, 1 9.

137
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,846
Oh, yes.
Hello, Virginia!

138
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,247
I'll be around shortly.

139
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,879
We hate to say good-bye.
When you comin' back?

140
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,755
When you come and see me.
I want you to take Hannibal.
He sings.

141
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,759
Oh, Will, look.

142
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:07,060
I see a good fighting man
who's been fool enough
to get himself married.

143
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,261
Ow!
What's the matter?

144
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,429
Oh, my hats!

145
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,803
Jiggers! Let's duck.

146
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,707
Here. Hold on, bub.
Come back here.

147
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,541
Hey, who do you think
you're--

148
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:25,482
Bill! You long-legged,
fugacious old gallinipper!

149
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,486
What are you doin' here?
Well, I, uh--

150
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,285
Here's somebody who wants
an introduction to you.

151
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,623
Boy, you wouldn't know him
in these tinhorn garments,

152
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,630
but this is the best scout
west of the Mississippi.

153
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,657
Shake hands
with Buffalo Bill.
Buffalo Bill!

154
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,226
Howdy, youngster.
Son,

155
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,603
this fellow taught me all
I ever knew about scoutin'.

156
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,733
Ah!

157
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,779
You mustered out yet,
Bill?
Yesterday.

158
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,610
Ya ain't losin' much time
gettin' up the Big Muddy.

159
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,616
He seems to have
met a friend.

160
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,879
Yes, a rather
strange friend.

161
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,353
How long have you been out?

162
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,720
Oh, about three months.

163
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,954
I see she hasn't
cut your hair... yet.

164
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,393
I don't know
what you mean, Bill.

165
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,162
You know what happened
to Samson when Delilah
opened her barbershop.

166
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,169
Has she tamed you yet?

167
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,173
That ain't fair.
She's different.
You're different.

168
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,210
Bill, she's
the finest little gal--
I know, I know.

169
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,872
You gotta meet her.
No, Bill.
Women and me don't agree.

170
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,748
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Come on! You'll like her.

171
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,878
All that's goin',
get aboard!

172
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,822
Don't be nervous.
He'll be here.
Come, Will!

173
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,418
Hurry.!
All right, Lou.

174
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,432
I want you to meet
the best friend--
We haven't time.

175
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,162
We must get on the boat.

176
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,238
All that's goin; get aboard.!

177
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,356
Bye, Buffalo Bill!
Bye!

178
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,954
Bye, Louisa.!
Good-bye!

179
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,126
Honey, we're on our way.
You're not frightened, are ya?

180
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,467
I'm not frightened
of anything after these
three wonderful months.

181
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,474
It's a big place we're
going to-- the West--
isn't it?

182
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,375
Good-bye, Buffalo Bill!
Huh?

183
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:37,245
What's the matter, boy?
Good-bye, bub. That's yours.

184
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,520
Gee! Thanks, mister!

185
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,580
Don't forget what I told ya
about women.

186
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,683
And here's your gun.

187
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,923
Good hunting!

188
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,525
I'm Jack McCall,
Mr. Hickok.

189
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,900
Tickled to death
to be traveling with you.

190
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,635
Pleased to meet you.
Hey, your toothpick's on fire.

191
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,167
This ain't a toothpick.
''Cigareetes,'' they
call them back East.

192
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,148
Oh, I see.
A new fad, huh?
Hmm?

193
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,664
Barkeep, bring me
an applejack, will ya?
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,264
You want one?
No.

195
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,503
I call ya.

196
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:43,378
I have ace, king, queen,
jack and a ten.
Sorry, mister.

197
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,525
Mr. Hickok.
I'd like to speak to you.

198
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,691
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Louisa Cody.

199
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,634
Will's told me how long
you've been friends...

200
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,467
and how you fought
for him once.

201
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,100
He says you don't
trust women.
Not as a rule, Mrs. Cody.

202
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,009
But in your case--

203
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,879
Mr. Hickok,
I'm going to help Will.

204
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,681
Don't you believe I can?
Well, I don't know, ma'am.

205
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,085
I'll open.

206
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,919
He killed his
first Indian at 1 2.
But he's not--

207
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,858
At 1 4, he was
riding Pony Express.

208
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,328
He's one of the
best natural scouts
on the frontier.

209
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,366
Will's promised
to give up scouting
and killing Indians...

210
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,628
and all that nonsense.

211
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,193
The West is in his blood.
You can't change that.

212
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,535
But you've been away
from it so long.

213
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,633
It is changing,
and why shouldn't
Will change with it?

214
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,907
We're going to start
a little hotel.

215
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,244
Cody?
Yes.

216
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:55,117
Someday you may be
one of our neighbors
with a wife of your own.

217
00:15:55,187 --> 00:16:00,716
Excuse me, ma'am,
but the hotel keeper
seems to be in trouble...

218
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,956
with his neighbors
right now.

219
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,088
I'll bet you $20.

220
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,066
Hello, Bill.
Don't play that hand.

221
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,194
- Why not?
- Maybe you can
trust one woman--

222
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,240
authorities differ--
but three?

223
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,367
Not on your life.

224
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,038
Your wife wants to talk to you.
She's outside.

225
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,638
Well, if you don't mind,
gentlemen.

226
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,877
It's all right.

227
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,351
How much money
did you lose?
About $48.

228
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,479
I'll sit in for you.
Any objections, gentlemen?

229
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,490
No, no objections
at all.

230
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,492
We've got new blood
in the game.

231
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,585
Heinie.
Yes, sir?

232
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,654
Take the gentlemen's order.
Take the order all around.

233
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,859
Rye for me.
Applejack, please.

234
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,198
Rye.
No, thank you.

235
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,464
Ante.

236
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,666
Cut.

237
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,425
Heinie?
Yes, sir.

238
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,969
Bring me something cool.
Yes, sir.

239
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,173
Well,

240
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,740
I'll bet you $50.

241
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:37,517
I'll see that
and raise you 1 00.

242
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,682
On that watch?

243
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,589
Yes, it's a
mighty fine watch.

244
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,993
Plays a tune whenever you press
that little spring. See?

245
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,797
It ain't worth $1 50.

246
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,702
It is to me.
I'll redeem that watch
anytime for a thousand.

247
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,832
All right, I'll take your word
on it, and I'll up ya 300.

248
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,809
And I'll call ya.

249
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,477
They're all blue, mister.

250
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,849
Watch yourself.
What's the matter?

251
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,626
I'm calling the hand
that's in your hat.

252
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,358
Take it off!.

253
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,832
Take a look,
Mr.Jayhawker.
The name is Hickok.

254
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,537
Hickok?
Not Wild Bill Hickok?

255
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,410
Mr. Hickok to you.

256
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,545
I'm calling this hand.

257
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,958
And I'm taking this pot.

258
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,463
Maybe I ought to shoot
a couple of holes through
your ears, so we'll know you.

259
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,695
Men like you
ought to be marked.

260
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,465
Maybe he'll do it too.
Wouldn't be
no trick at all for Bill.

261
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,973
He's my friend.
He can hit
a dime at 30 paces.

262
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,010
Four times out of five.
Five times out of five.

263
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,978
He killed the
whole McDaniels gang.

264
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,014
And he got 'em
alone too.

265
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,051
Does he kill like that?

266
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,053
Ain't a corpse maker
like him, honey.

267
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:20,114
Cash these in, Mr. Banker.
It's a pleasure,
Mr. Hickok.

268
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,788
Maybe I ought to take
Mr. Cody's losings too.

269
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,956
He's got a wife to support.

270
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,682
Whoa there!

271
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,781
Lizzie's two hours late.
Hustle your passengers off.

272
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,790
I'll pick the best of them
for you, Calamity.

273
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,190
My horses ain't
used to waitin'.

274
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,024
Back up there,Joe!

275
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,428
Mark three!

276
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,662
Look out!
Don't foul that hauser there!

277
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,363
Hey, there.!
Leavenworth landing!

278
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,406
All for Leavenworth
get off.

279
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,341
Hey! Aboard there!
Purser!
Watch the line.

280
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,780
My name's John Lattimer.
You got a bunch of freight
for me put aboard at St. Louis?

281
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,180
Yeah, lots of it
consigned to Hays City.

282
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,982
I got my own wagons here!
I want that stuff
shouldered off first up!

283
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,424
Right away! Hey, Tim!
Hustle that shipment
forJohn Lattimer off.

284
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,426
Come on, boys!
Get goin'!

285
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,698
Hi, Calamity.
Hi, yourself.

286
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,031
Keepin' company
tonight?
Yeah, me and my six horses.

287
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:42,062
Seven's a lucky number.
Count me in.

288
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,472
You sailors are all alike.

289
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,688
Hey, Bill!
Help me pack
this outfit ashore.

290
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,863
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
What is this? Feathers?

291
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,233
Hats.
''Hats''?

292
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,604
Lou, Bill will take you
off to the stage. I got
to go see about the trunks.

293
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,736
This going to be
the hotel orchestra, ma'am?

294
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,973
Bill, we're not joking
about that hotel.

295
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,178
I guess a hotel suits you
after all. Start with
a birdcage and expand, huh?

296
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,380
Lattimer, six.

297
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,720
Come on, boys.!
Get along here.!

298
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,919
Lattimer, seven.

299
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:41,125
Lattimer, eight.
Keep 'em on your backs there.

300
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,327
I'm sorry, boss.
Powerful heavy to tote.

301
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,964
- Shut your lip!

302
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,201
John Lattimer, nine.

303
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,436
Hey!
Take this box!
Yes, sir!

304
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,479
Get out, you!
John Lattimer, ten.

305
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,480
Lattimer, 1 1,
goin'to Hays City.

306
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,709
Don't that look like--

307
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,812
Farming tools.
You operate out of Hays City?

308
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,822
Sure! What of it?

309
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,257
Didn't have any use
for farming tools
the last time I was there.

310
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,093
I freight whatever
they send me, and I
mind my own business.

311
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,396
John Lattimer, 1 5.
That's a right good idea,

312
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,404
a right, good way
to keep out of trouble.

313
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,964
John Lattimer, 1 6.
Bill!

314
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,602
You mangy old coyote!
Ha!

315
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,148
John Lattimer, 1 8.

316
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,583
Bill, you're back.

317
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,522
Aw, you four-flushing mule.
You ain't wipin' it off.
You're rubbing it in.

318
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,525
Are you gonna stay
in Leavenworth?

319
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,323
Are you?
I could.

320
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,455
I'm going on to Hays City.

321
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,898
Why didn't you write me
any letters, Bill?

322
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,061
I didn't know you could read.

323
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,935
I could read
if you could write.

324
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,940
A woman who has a fellow
at every stage station...

325
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,000
and a beau in every
cavalry troop west
of the Missouri--

326
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,810
That woman doesn't need
any letters from me.

327
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,013
Those fellers didn't mean
nothin' to me.

328
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,056
They did to me.

329
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,560
Let's forget it.
Maybe I did make a mistake.

330
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,721
You won't get a chance
to make that mistake again.
Bill!

331
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,288
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm keeping a lady waiting.

332
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,265
I'm awfully sorry
to have put you to so
much trouble, Mr. Hickok.

333
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,640
That's all right.
I don't know what could
have happened to Will.

334
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:39,276
This is the Hays City stage,
ma'am. I'll fetch Will
and the rest of the outfit.

335
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,683
Thank you.

336
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,922
Is that chipmunk yours?
Did ya bring her with ya?

337
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,191
What if I did?
It's none of your business.

338
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,756
Ain't it, after
you run out on me?

339
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,632
You slab-sided,
bird-totin' rat!

340
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,969
You brung that
honky-tonk mopsy--
Shut up, Calamity.

341
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:24,217
Tip your hat when
you speak to a lady.

342
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,197
I will,
when I speak to a lady.

343
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,300
Aw, Bill.

344
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,645
Careful, Lou.
That's a big step.

345
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,843
Look out for Hannibal.
Will, isn't it exciting?

346
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,978
Have you got everything?
I've got you and
the parasol and Hannibal...

347
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,513
and boxes and hats and--

348
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,527
Hi, Calamity!

349
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,223
Well, Bill Cody!

350
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,232
What are you doin'
in them buzzard feathers?

351
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,700
Pretty fancy, huh?

352
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,170
Calamity, I want
to introduce you.
Lou, this is CalamityJane.

353
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,538
Everybody knows her.
Born and bred out yonder.

354
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:15,546
A dead shot,
rides better than a man,
drives stage.

355
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,548
Why, I've seen her flick
the rattles off a rattle--

356
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,609
Say, is she your mopsy?

357
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,885
She's Mrs. Cody.
Your wife!

358
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,758
Aw.

359
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,958
I'm certainly glad
to know ya, Mrs. Cody.

360
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,228
How do you do, Miss Calamity?

361
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,760
Canary's the name, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
I didn't know.

362
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,434
Not at all, ma'am.
Four passengers
for Hays City, Calamity.

363
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,500
Get going.
Suits me.

364
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,604
You'll find the backseat
easy ridin', Mrs. Cody.
Thank you.

365
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,173
Come on, Bill. Get in.
That's no way
to treat your passengers.

366
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,378
You ain't a passenger.
You're freight.

367
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,580
My name's Jack McCall.
I'm goin' to Hays City.

368
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:01,956
What are you smokin'?
Chalk?
Cigareete.

369
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,495
Well, get in anyway.

370
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,327
Another one
for Hays City, ma'am.

371
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,059
That river clipper's
sayin' good-bye
to you, ma'am.

372
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,265
Now you're gonna have
three long days
of this prairie clipper.

373
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,275
But tomorrow's Sunday.
Do we ride on Sunday?

374
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,074
There's no Sunday
west ofJunction City,

375
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,674
no law west of Hays City
and no God west of Carson City.

376
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,346
Hold tight, ma'am.
I'm holding tight.

377
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,890
Still travelin' together,
Mr. Hickok, huh?

378
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,524
What are you
doin' up here?

379
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,965
I'm drivin'.

380
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,601
Get! Get up there!

381
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,360
Get up there!

382
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,096
You've been driving
for three days.

383
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,227
You've changed horses
1 4 times.

384
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,330
Don't you ever change
those beads you're wearing?

385
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,637
I ain't wearin' 'em
'cause you give 'em to me.

386
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,643
I'm wearin' 'em
'cause I like beads.

387
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:35,082
Oh, Will, are all the roads
in Kansas like this?

388
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,714
No, honey!
Some of'em
are pretty bad.

389
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,688
What's the matter?

390
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,267
Clem?
Take these ribbons.
Yeah?

391
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:05,112
Stranger, I wonder
if you could--
Breezy!

392
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,409
Why, it's Bill Hickok.

393
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,751
I thought you was
off to the war.
The war's over.

394
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:16,522
Yeah? Just beginning
where I come from.

395
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:25,800
There's 2,000 or 3,000
Sioux Indians cayoodlin' around
Fort Piney with war paint on.

396
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,140
Wild Bill Hickok
to see General Custer.

397
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,404
I'll see him.
Yes, sir.

398
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,642
How do you do, General?
Oh, hello, Hickok.

399
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,480
I heard you were
coming to town.

400
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,487
I know of your
reputation as a killer,
and I want to warn you...

401
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,581
that we'll tolerate
no lawlessness
here at Hays City.

402
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,286
You better get that word
through to the Indians,

403
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,557
because they've just
wiped out half the garrison
at Fort Piney.

404
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,758
- How do you know?
- I was about to report to you...

405
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,133
before you became so interested
in my accomplishments...

406
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:03,402
that we've been
pulling arrows out of
Colonel Carrington's old scout.

407
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,807
Breezy?
Yes.

408
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:10,007
Colonel Carrington told him
if you didn't get ammunition
to Fort Piney, they're done for.

409
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,676
Find Captain Reed!
Yes, sir.

410
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,380
I'll get that ammunition
to Fort Piney somehow.

411
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,287
But I can't spare more than
one troop to take it.

412
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,316
Here at Hays City,
I'm faced by Satanta's Kiowas.

413
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,487
The whole Sioux nation's
up here.

414
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,794
And now Yellow Hand's
on the loose
with his Cheyenne.

415
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,497
I can't move from Hays City
until I find out where
that he-wolf s heading for.

416
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,940
He's an old friend of mine.
We used to hunt buffalo
together on the Cimarron.

417
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,137
He's hunting men now,
and I've got to locate him.

418
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,772
Maybe I can find him
for ya.

419
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,051
He ought to be
just about... there.

420
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,645
Hmph.

421
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,419
Oh, Captain Reed.
Yes, sir.

422
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,893
Hickok reports that half
of Carrington's command
at Fort Piney's been wiped out.

423
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,987
I'm sending 1 0,000 rounds
of ammunition.

424
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,363
Have Captain Woods
prepare to leave at once
with a wagon train.

425
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,868
Mules are right handy
animals, General.
What?

426
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,804
They can get by the Indians
much better than wagons can.

427
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,001
Yes, he's right.
Use mules.

428
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:16,035
They'll have to get by
about a thousand Cheyenne.

429
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,743
Why not send them
east of the trail
through Deep Valley?

430
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,686
Yes, and across the upper
ford of the Republican,
but who's going to guide them?

431
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,882
I haven't got a scout
who knows that territory.

432
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,723
I beg your pardon,
but Buffalo Bill Cody
just got in town.

433
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,786
Cody? Yes, he knows
the lay of that land.

434
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,492
And he's up to
all Indian tricks.

435
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,230
He's got himself a squaw.
You'll probably find him
knitting or washing dishes.

436
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:44,537
What do you mean?
He's married a ravishing
little woman from points East.

437
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,943
I don't care if
he married an Eskimo.
Tell him to come here.

438
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,244
His mind's set
on starting a hotel.

439
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,184
There's an Indian war starting.

440
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,814
Women lying on these plains
with Indian arrows in them.

441
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,858
Get Cody here.

442
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,194
- Suppose I go in his place?
- You're going after Yellow Hand.

443
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,756
Don't let him catch you.
He doesn't treat
his prisoners very well.

444
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:14,134
Tell Cody
that ammunition train
is leaving before sundown.

445
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,697
Yes, sir.
And he'll be leaving with them.

446
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,709
Orderly.

447
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,556
Oh, Will, there's
so much dirt blowing in.

448
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,560
It's got to blow
someplace, honey.

449
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,535
Tumbleweed, Lou.
They won't bite ya.

450
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,732
Oh, dear!

451
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
There's no use
fightin' the wind, Lou.

452
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,814
We have to bear
with this land.
Oh, I know, Will.

453
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,821
When are we going
to move into town
and take over the hotel?

454
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,857
I'm gonna see
Jeb Masters tomorrow.

455
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,325
He wants to sell
the Golden Rule House.

456
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,797
Here's your grub!
Why, come in, Miss Canary.

457
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,924
Hiya, Bill.

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,197
What'd you bring?
Well, I'll tell ya.

459
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,105
I got something to fry,
and I got something to boil.

460
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,406
And a jug of whiskey!
Oh!

461
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,742
He never misses, Mrs. Cody.

462
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,215
I'll take that.
You've got a lot to do.

463
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,378
That stove smokes,
and there's no mattress on the bed.

464
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,618
You haven't got
the lamps filled yet.
Look at this place.

465
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,183
This is a grand shebang.
Oh, Calamity.

466
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,492
You could stable
the queen of Sheba.
How can you say that?

467
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,965
It's so dusty,
and I haven't got
my curtains hung yet.

468
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:54,198
We'll help ya. Hey,
you long-legged two-spot,

469
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,604
give your wife a hand.

470
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,938
And here's the bodkin.
Hey!

471
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,309
Put it in that window.
Say! Look it.

472
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,372
That would make a pretty
dress, wouldn't it?

473
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,715
Calamity, do you
ever wear dresses?
I might if I had one.

474
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,550
You're going to look
awfully nice in one of mine.

475
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,921
That curtain
looks right pretty.

476
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:22,123
Bodkin Bill.
Have you had any experience
with a horse blanket?

477
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,760
Plenty.
Lou says I've had too much.

478
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,705
That's too bad.
There's a horse outside
waitin' for ya now.

479
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,299
You tryin' to trade, Bill?
Yes.

480
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,346
A hotel for the lives
of 48 men...

481
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,247
and 1 0,000 rounds
of ammunition thrown in.

482
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,119
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?

483
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,757
You and the bird
feel at home yet, ma'am?

484
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,763
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

485
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:57,631
Is Custer sending that
ammunition to Fort Piney?

486
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,636
He's hoping
they'll get through...

487
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,196
if 48 cavalrymen can dodge
about 1 ,000 Cheyenne.

488
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,299
Birds do not eat beans,
Mr. Hickok.

489
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,004
You think those swatties
can make it?

490
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,138
Depends which way
Custer sends 'em.

491
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,911
Through Deep Valley.
Through the upper ford
of the Republican.

492
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,284
Yeah. They might
get through that way.

493
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:22,088
They would get through
if Bill Cody showed them how.
There's no trail.

494
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,128
Better no trail
if they're dodging Cheyenne.

495
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,826
Will's not going.
He has nothing to do
with the army now.

496
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,428
He's promised.
That's just
what I told Custer.

497
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,405
What did you tell him?

498
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,875
That you wouldn't go.

499
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,774
You know that's a lie.

500
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,875
Mr. Hickok,
Will promised me.

501
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,944
You don't understand.
I can't let him go.

502
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,513
There are things that
have to be done, ma'am.

503
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,958
Lincoln set a goal
that we have to work toward.

504
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,155
He said the frontier
must be made safe.

505
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,391
Oh, but
Lincoln's dead.

506
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,991
What right have the dead
to tell the living
what to do?

507
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,437
His words are alive.
Bill Cody knows that
as well as I do.

508
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:13,603
If he refuses to go,
you'll think he's a coward,
and you know he's not.

509
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,613
The choice is his, ma'am.

510
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,740
Will, I was
afraid of this.

511
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,308
You can't leave me.
You can't--

512
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,549
You've never seen
the Indian tribes at war.

513
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,457
You've never seen men
killed and mutilated and
bodies of women burned...

514
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,428
and babies dragged
from their mother's arms
and dashed against--

515
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,795
That's enough, Bill!

516
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,006
Why is it you aren't
going, Mr. Hickok?

517
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,677
I have to pay a call
on an old friend.

518
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,860
You're goin' after Yellow Hand.
Bill, you're goin' out alone!

519
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,263
You cold decker,
ain't you got no sense?

520
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,791
Maybe I can get you
another string of beads.

521
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,240
Ya ornery coot!

522
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,973
Good-bye, my darling.
Oh, Will, please--

523
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,982
I've got to go, dear.
I know every foot of the way.

524
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,177
I have to do my part.
Here.

525
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,286
I'll look out
for you, Mrs. Cody.
He'll be back in a few days.

526
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,725
He'll be back with
nary a scratch on him.

527
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,958
Will! Will!
Come back!

528
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,233
Don't cry, honey.

529
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:50,240
I wanted to tell him
something.
What?

530
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:56,403
Maybe if he'd known,
he wouldn't have gone.

531
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,949
Oh.

532
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,316
Well, maybe it's just
as well you didn't tell him.

533
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,314
What is this, Louisy?
Cat?

534
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,317
It's sort of a Russian cat.

535
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,044
Say.

536
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,852
Look at that.

537
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,918
I don't know how I look,
but I feel like
the queen of Sheba.

538
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,488
You look lovely,
Calamity.

539
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,660
I want you to keep
that dress.

540
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,670
Ya do?

541
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,798
Say, that's
the first time a woman
ever gave me anything.

542
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,275
Why, I never even seen
clothes like these.

543
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,574
Now, if I just
had me a hat!

544
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,081
Here, try one of these.

545
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,677
Oh, say, ain't
that a pretty one.

546
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,852
Well, how do you do,
Miss Canary?

547
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,189
Hmph.

548
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:24,234
Hmph. Appears to me
your face is kind of
made out of rubber.

549
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,697
That old coyote's
got a toad in his gullet.

550
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,735
Couldn't be an Indian,
could it?

551
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,340
Honey, when you hear
something yelling at night,
it's just some varmint.

552
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,612
But when you don't
hear nothin', it's an Injun.

553
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,488
Calamity, I want you
to stay here with me.

554
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,195
I've never been alone before.

555
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,098
Now, stop worryin'
about him, honey.

556
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,195
He's got a whole troop
of cavalry ridin' herd
on him.

557
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:06,209
But my Bill plays it alone,
the big mule.

558
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,481
I bet if he could
see me in this outfit,
it'd be my weddin' dress.

559
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,951
I'd just as leave die
with my boots on,

560
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,045
but I ain't a-gonna
to get married in 'em.

561
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,953
Can I have some shoes?

562
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,128
Louisy, don't look
at the windows.

563
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,638
Don't let on
anything's different.
Listen to me.

564
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,640
Can you ride?
Yes.

565
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,371
My horse is outside.
Take that coffeepot
back to the stove.

566
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,436
Then open
that door and wait.

567
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,505
Make believe you're
helping me with my glove.

568
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,676
I'm gonna entertain
visitors. They're Injuns.
Injuns!

569
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:51,313
Shut up. When you
see them all in here,
sneak to the horse.

570
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,323
Ride to town.
Don't stop for nothin'.

571
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,417
Tell 'em there's Injuns
here with war paint on.

572
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,725
Make me some fresh coffee,
honey.

573
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,741
Come in, fellows.

574
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,849
Come on in.
Don't be afraid.

575
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,649
I-- I got
something for ya.

576
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,781
Look. I got
some presents for ya.

577
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,791
See? See
the pretty feather?

578
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,260
Sure. Sure.

579
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,854
It's a hat. See?

580
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,129
Here. Here, put it on.

581
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,933
Come on.
I'll show you.

582
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:46,170
Go look at the pretty feather,
you painted buzzard.

583
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,807
Here. Here, look.

584
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,714
Pretty?

585
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,378
You don't like it, huh?
Well, here. Take this.

586
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,015
I got something for all of ya.
Presents for all of you.

587
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,388
We've been savin' 'em.
Look.

588
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,191
Presents for my brothers,
the Cheyenne,
you red hyenas.

589
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,790
Here. Look. See?

590
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,301
Look. Here.

591
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,338
Come on in. Look.
See? Here.

592
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,398
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

593
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,740
Look. For papoose.
See? Papoose.

594
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,725
Uh, want a piece of cake?

595
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:44,191
Soldier.
''Soldier''?

596
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,229
Me no talk Cheyenne.

597
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:54,836
I'll never tell ya
where they've gone,
ya hairless coyote!

598
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,637
Hello there! Hey!

599
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,422
Bill.!
You get outta here.!

600
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,724
Go back, Bill!

601
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:30,563
These are Yellow Hand's men.!
You're crazy.!

602
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,078
Shoot your way out, Bill!

603
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,614
You'll get
a tomahawk in your brains
if you keep askin' for it.

604
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,451
Indians will sell anything.
They might sell you.

605
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,619
Wild Bill Hickok, walkin'
into the hands of a war party.

606
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,685
Custer sure picked himself
a great scout.

607
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,044
Aw, Bill, not your watch.

608
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,705
What's he saying, Bill?

609
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,613
He wants my guns too.
Don't give 'em to him.

610
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,151
Don't give up your guns!

611
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:10,189
What's he saying?

612
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,633
He says he's got to take us
to Yellow Hand first.

613
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,161
He can't let us go
unless Yellow Hand's willing.

614
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,266
Well, you done it,
didn't ya?

615
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,538
Yes, I ''done it,'' all right.

616
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:39,418
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?

617
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,863
You sure must
remember me.

618
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,867
How do you like me
in dresses?

619
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,563
Thought you were Mrs. Cody
at first, in that dress.

620
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,404
Oh. Mrs. Cody
give it to me.

621
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,909
Were you in Cody's cabin
when they caught ya?

622
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,946
Yeah, celebrating on account
of Bill Cody's kid.

623
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,677
Bill Cody
hasn't got a kid.
He's gonna have one.

624
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,719
He doesn't know it,
does he?

625
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,720
He would if he stayed home
where he belongs.

626
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,952
I'll tell him... maybe.

627
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,359
Say, Bill, you give up
your watch...

628
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,420
and your guns.

629
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,432
Couldn't have been
on account of me, could it?

630
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,870
No. I wanted him to take me
to Yellow Hand, so I can
find out what he's up to.

631
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,873
Oh.

632
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,373
What do you think
they'll do to us?

633
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,379
We'll soon find out.

634
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,373
You Hickok.
I know you.

635
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,418
Speak your own
language, Yellow Hand.
I'll understand you.

636
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,477
You, me,
speak white man tongue.

637
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,889
I must know you know
what I say.

638
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,087
Remember what I told you
last time we met?

639
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,653
I said one of us will
lift the other's scalp.

640
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,257
Which one?

641
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,861
It looks like
it's up to you to say.

642
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,168
What started you on
the warpath, Yellow Hand?

643
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,802
Where sun rise,
white man's land.

644
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,780
Where sun set,
Indian land.

645
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,909
White man come,
take our land.

646
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,681
Kill buffalo, our food.

647
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,588
White man promise us food.

648
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,684
White man lie.

649
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,289
Now Cheyenne buy
white man's thunder stick.

650
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:59,699
Soon war drums
sound in all Indian land.

651
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,137
All tribes ride
with Yellow Hand.

652
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:07,199
We drive white man,
like buffalo, away,

653
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,610
back to rising sun.

654
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,810
Yellow Hand has spoken.

655
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,945
Yellow Hand has spoken.

656
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,182
And you may be right.

657
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,385
But you can't drive
the white man away.

658
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,587
Yellow Hand know.

659
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:30,759
White man send bullet.
Many, many bullet. Where?

660
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,200
Somebody's
romancing Yellow Hand.

661
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,262
You tell where.

662
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,274
I don't know.

663
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:42,005
You tell where!

664
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,070
He's your friend, Bill.

665
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,913
Why don't you tell him
they're heading east
toward Leavenworth?

666
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,920
Yes, that's right.
To Leavenworth.

667
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,891
- Now I know soldier take bullet.
- They won't fit your guns.

668
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,827
Hickok, my friend,
speak with straight tongue.

669
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:04,799
Hickok, white man friend,
speak with forked tongue.

670
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:09,635
Now, you tell,
which way soldier take bullet?

671
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,844
Bill, what's
in that watch?

672
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,094
Bill! Bill, you got
my picture. You kept it.

673
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,359
I couldn't get it out
without scratching the case.

674
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,596
You've been actin'
like you didn't care,
and all the time--

675
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:43,605
Tie up that tongue of yours.
Look at their faces.

676
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,614
Let her go.
She doesn't know anything.

677
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,447
You too quick to say
she not know.

678
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:06,458
Hickok will not tell,
but Yellow Hand will know.

679
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,829
Now is hour
of Great Bear rising.

680
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,736
When moon in sky here,
Yellow Hand will know.

681
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,044
What's he talking
about the moon for?
What does he mean?

682
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,055
What are you
thinking about?

683
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,353
I'm thinking about
John Lattimer's farming tools...

684
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,394
that came up on the boat.
Oh, rifles.

685
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,589
Better rifles than we have.
Seven shot repeaters,

686
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,430
and each shot may mean
the life of a white man.

687
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:48,198
But what do you think
they're fixin' to do to us?

688
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,570
I think maybe you gave them
an idea what to do.

689
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:56,510
Hear them drums?

690
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,515
That's taps for us,
ain't it, Bill?

691
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:03,041
Won't be so hard,
goin' out together.

692
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,055
It'll be harder
than you know.

693
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,889
Calamity, there are
only two of us.

694
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,827
Two lives against
all those men on
the ammunition train.

695
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,662
But I don't want to die!
I don't want you to die!

696
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,601
Hang onto yourself.
You'll have to help me.

697
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,197
Just like you did
the first time
I saw you, remember?

698
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,641
I was just a kid and no more
sense than I got now,

699
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,838
headin' down the grade
with no brakes on.

700
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:34,509
I loved you then, Bill,
just like I do now.

701
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,314
Looks like that moon's
gettin' ready to show.

702
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:41,790
You never even gave me
a picture, but you kept mine.

703
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,385
I know you care for me a little.
Couldn't you say it just once?

704
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,396
Maybe they'll let us go
after all.

705
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,956
Bill Hickok!

706
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,502
You ornery son of a mule!

707
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,562
You wouldn't
give a bad dime
to a sick kid, would ya?

708
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,542
You may be right,
Calamity.

709
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,807
No, I ain't.

710
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,246
I know it.
I ain't worth a bad dime.

711
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:13,081
Bill-- Bill, every night
I talk to ya.

712
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:18,059
Wantin' ya.
I know you feel the same.

713
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:21,063
Won't you tell me?

714
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,156
What difference
would that make now?

715
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,259
If only I could hear ya
say it once.

716
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:30,204
It would give me
somethin' to keep...

717
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,639
like it was kind of holy,

718
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,805
like I could
keep it forever.

719
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,474
Calamity--

720
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,144
Yellow Hand find out now
which way soldier go.

721
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,463
Bill.

722
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:00,899
Yes, Calamity, I do.
I--

723
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,735
I love you.

724
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,345
You wait.

725
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:35,163
Yellow Hand
no want to kill Hickok...

726
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:39,140
but must know which way
soldier go with bullet.

727
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:44,670
When he know,you go free.
Hickok go free.

728
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,716
Don't talk to him,
Calamity!

729
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,879
Don't trust him!
Bill.!

730
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,285
Bill!

731
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:56,314
If you no tell which way
soldier go with bullet,

732
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,226
Hickok soon be dead.

733
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,665
Bill Cody's with
that ammunition train!

734
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,201
Forty-eight men
are there, Calamity!

735
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:09,033
Oh, Bill! I can't!

736
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,868
You tell?
No.

737
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,268
Which way?

738
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,757
Oh, no! No! Don't!
Don't let them do it!

739
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,559
Don't! Please! Don't!

740
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,395
Oh!
Which way?

741
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:41,801
Don't forget Cody--
And all those men!

742
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,600
Remember what I told you!

743
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:48,110
They're burning him!
They're killing him!

744
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,703
Put out the fire!
Put out the fire!

745
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,270
Oh.!

746
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:57,309
Put out the fire!
Which way soldier go
with bullet?

747
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:01,289
Deep Valley
through the upper ford.

748
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,471
Squaw no lie.
Yellow Hand no lie.

749
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:01,540
You free. Go.

750
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,130
I couldn't help it, Bill.

751
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,194
Won't you look at me?

752
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,241
I hope
I'll never have to
look at you again.

753
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,083
Look out, Bill!
Look out!

754
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,923
Thing ain't right here,
Captain Wood.
See anything?

755
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:49,055
No, but I feel it.
Things ain't right here.

756
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,727
We can halt over there
while you take a look around.

757
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,956
They're caught,
like rats in a trap.

758
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,187
They're all around us,
on both sides of the river!

759
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,891
- We'll hold this island!
Throw your horses!

760
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,616
Get those ammunition packs off.
Get them out of the line of fire!

761
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,925
I can't see nothin'
to shoot at but smoke.
Where are they?

762
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,006
They'll never get out now.
I gotta go down there.
You ain't goin' down there.

763
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,779
Get behind this tree
and wait.

764
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:50,141
You've got to reach
General Custer.
I'll get there, somehow.

765
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,517
Head down Prairie Dog Creek.

766
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,558
Get a fresh mount tomorrow
from the Pony Express
at Simpson's.

767
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,720
And if Custer finds out
you told Yellow Hand,
he'll give you the firing squad.

768
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,856
He won't find out.
I'm gonna tell him.

769
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,663
Tell him you brought
a thousand Cheyenne
against his 48 men!

770
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:13,933
Set up that barricade with those
saddles! Those saddles on
those barricades, and hurry!

771
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,309
Don't go too deep with
that hole or you'll get
that ammunition in water!

772
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,508
All right, sir.
Burned through the legs.

773
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,950
It feels like
it broke the bone.
Your knife, Bill.

774
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,580
Give me that scabbard
for the splint.

775
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,148
Watch 'em, men!
They may rush us!

776
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,127
Never saw
such rifle-fire
from Indians!

777
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,130
They haven't let up
for a minute.

778
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,996
There's either a million of'em,
or they're using those
new repeating rifles.

779
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,530
Look out!

780
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,041
They're firin' powerful fast.
It ain't like what
we had at Gettysburg.

781
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,670
Were you at Gettysburg?
I was on the other side in that.
Then you must've been--

782
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:54,877
- Stop talkin', you two!
- Get down there!
Aim well and fire slowly.

783
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,420
Hold your fire, men!
That's a white man!

784
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,085
Cover him, McGinnis!
Cover him!

785
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,236
What would a white man
be doin' out there?

786
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,002
Holy mackerel!
He hasn't got a chance!

787
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:24,479
He's still ridin'.
Drop some of them Injuns
back of him!

788
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:33,312
That fellow must have
nine lives!
He'll need every one of'em.

789
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,290
They got him!

790
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,989
No, they haven't!

791
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,763
Come on, Bill.!
Run for it.!

792
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,635
Keep those long legs goin'!

793
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,611
Hi, Bill.
Sufferin' cats!
Wild Bill!

794
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,512
I'll tell the captain
you're here.

795
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:03,609
Tell him I expect to
be here for a long time.

796
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,553
Hi, Bill.

797
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,820
You guidin'
for Yellow Hand?
Where's your feathers?

798
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,793
Captain Wood,
Wild Bill Hickok.

799
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,888
Touch 'em up in those trees.
Range about 200 yards!

800
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:19,025
Hickok?
Wild Bill Hickok?

801
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,935
Yes, sir. He just dropped
in from Yellow Hand.
Wha--

802
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:28,043
I thought Custer sent you
to locate Yellow Hand.
I located him, didn't I?

803
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,911
Him and a few Cheyenne.
You sure did a good job.

804
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,919
I notice you're using
his equipment.

805
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,682
You'll notice it's
better than yours too.

806
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:44,386
Where did you get that mark
on your wrist? Bracelet?
Ha. Squaw bracelet.

807
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,725
Takin' Bill Hickok prisoner
just don't sound right to me.

808
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:52,359
No? What about Bill Cody
following his nose
into a Cheyenne ambush?

809
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,528
Hmm.

810
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:59,241
Looky here.

811
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:03,711
These Injuns were waitin'
for us. They knew we
was comin' to this ford.

812
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,546
You didn't
tell 'em, Bill?

813
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,381
Then who did tell 'em?

814
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,987
I said,
who did tell 'em?

815
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,157
I've something more important
than that to tell you.

816
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,861
You're gonna be a father.

817
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,905
Huh?
A daddy.

818
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,964
Well, but, uh--
How did you know?

819
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:37,479
Mrs. Cody told Calamity.
Calamity told me.

820
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,941
Well, somebody
mighta told me.

821
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,453
Well, uh... the news
didn't leak out till
after we left.

822
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:53,985
Oh, well then how--
Where did you see Calamity?

823
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,893
Oh, uh... around.

824
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,994
Has she got rawhide marks
on her wrist too?

825
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,798
What's your guess it'll be,
a boy or a girl?

826
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,243
It's bound to be one
or the other, isn't it?
That's customary.

827
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:15,080
From what I've seen of you
lately, my guess is a girl.
Girls are all right.

828
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,314
If it's a boy,
I suppose he'll be a bellboy
in that hotel of yours.

829
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:22,756
If it's a girl,
we'll keep her out
of Yellow Hand's camp.

830
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,759
Oh!
Hey, Bill.

831
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,939
Hey, soldier.
Wait till I knock the tail
feathers off of that turkey.

832
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,809
Help me over
to the wagon with him.

833
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,790
They got Buffalo Bill,
Captain.

834
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,655
Keep down
or they'll get you.

835
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:02,395
Where's the doctor, Captain?
They got him
in the first volley.

836
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,957
Bandages are
in the box there.
Here's a fresh one.

837
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,105
Sort of parted your hair,
Bill. Flesh wound.

838
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,668
Looks like that little
stranger's gonna have a papa.

839
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,921
Never mind that.
We got plenty of water
in the river.

840
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:31,084
Hickok.
Yes, sir?

841
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,185
It's gonna be a siege.
Days of it.

842
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,198
After dark, I'll call
for volunteers to try to
get back to General Custer.

843
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,996
I've already sent word
to Custer.

844
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,970
Who'd you send?

845
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,668
Who'd you send?
- CalamityJane.

846
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,973
Calamity? Wha--

847
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:55,981
She oughta get through.
She'd better get through.

848
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,949
There you are.

849
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:05,616
I oughta have you
stood up and shot.
Why don't you?

850
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,995
If I had the authority to do it,
I'd like nothing better,
but I haven't.

851
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,368
I can't make you pay
for what you've done.

852
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,807
You won't have to.

853
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,639
Ten hut.!

854
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:28,946
Captain Wood.
Lieutenant Burke.
Sergeant Higgins.

855
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,112
Corporal Brannigan.
Here today
and gone tomorrow.

856
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,952
- Bugler Corry.
- Here, but not for long.

857
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:39,393
Seven days you been calling
that roll. Tomorrow there won't
be anyone left to answer it.

858
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,158
Then I'll answer 'em all myself.
Private Adams. Anderson.

859
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,564
Here, and I wish I wasn't.
I wish I had
two more like you.

860
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:49,695
Bingham.
Six nights I've been listenin'
to the wild talk of the wounded.

861
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,865
'Tis a sad lullaby.
Bronson.

862
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,533
Yo. What's left of me.
Cody.

863
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,406
- Here.
- He's up in his hotel.

864
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,106
Coleman.
Still here.

865
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,980
-Three days now since
the mule meat went bad.
- It's six, I tell ya!

866
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,451
Why tell the Indians?
They know about it.
Keep quiet, you baboons!

867
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,253
Seven. Do you think you're
the only one hearin' Rankin
in sick bay...

868
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:13,284
talkin'half the time about
that hole through his lung
and the rest about his kid?

869
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,490
He's so scared he can't count.
It's six nights.

870
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,398
This paper says
they're expectin' trouble
with the Indians.

871
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,493
Huh?

872
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,337
- No?
- Dalrymple?

873
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,937
Here, and hungry.
Try chewin' saddle leather.
That'll ease your stomach.

874
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,481
Aw.
Daniels. Dowden.
Yo.

875
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,983
Easton. Evans. Hickok.
No hits.

876
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,987
- They're savin' him
for a hangin'.
- Houston.

877
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,354
Yo.
Hadley. Hillman.

878
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:45,394
What are you makin'
that for?
Holliston.

879
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,521
Sure, and all the Indians
won't be makin'
no headstone for me.

880
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:53,193
Jenkins.
Seven days you been doin' this.
They don't answer anymore.

881
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,931
He's roll calling the dead!
It's six days!

882
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,473
What difference does it make?
''What difference
does it make''?

883
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,669
Makes a difference to Gillon,
Harry Ketcham and Bailey.

884
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,077
Ray Todd must think
it makes a difference
where he lies out there.

885
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:10,175
They might be alive!
Alive!
Easy, son. Easy.

886
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:14,052
They might be.
You never can tell
what'll happen.

887
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,718
I knew a fellow lived on
the Kaw River by the bridge.

888
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,387
He used to feed a fish,
a big catfish, by hand.

889
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,193
- What's that got
to do with it?
- Now wait a minute.

890
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,031
That catfish got to followin'
that fellow out of water
for his dinner.

891
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:32,370
Every day he'd follow him more.
And one night when the man was
walkin'home across the bridge,

892
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,740
not noticin'the catfiish
was followin'him.

893
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,178
Now that fiish had never
seen a bridge before.

894
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,649
He fell off...
and he drowned.

895
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:50,391
- Ah, fish can't drown.
- That must've been
a narrow bridge.

896
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,428
Holy thunder.!
Look at them Injuns.!

897
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,830
Every man up this way!
Hurry, men, hurry!

898
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:08,040
- Get the wounded out
to load the guns!

899
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,443
- Don't shoot till
I give the command.

900
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,779
- Hand me up another rifle.
- Keep your heads down
if you wanna keep them on.

901
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,782
Look like buffalo, don't they?
A volley'll stop buffalo.

902
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,790
Volley fire. Ready!
Not yet.

903
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:26,021
But, Bill!
Hold your fire, men.
Wait for the command.

904
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,956
- They're riding us down!
- Don't wait.! Let 'em have it.!

905
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,865
Not yet!

906
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,666
Now!
Fire!

907
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,246
Load faster.!
Gimme that.!
I'm doing the best I can.

908
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,086
Fire at the center!
Split that charge!
Fire!

909
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:11,670
- Who was that?
- Keep your barrels red hot!

910
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,231
Fire at will, men!

911
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,991
This one's mine!

912
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:43,470
- We've turned 'em!
- Now they're goin' down
both sides!

913
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:47,168
Houston!Jack!
Cover the left flank!
Where are you going, you idiot?

914
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,543
Hey, Bill, come back here!
Are you crazy?

915
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,208
- Hey, Dave, help me cover him.
- Cover the right flank!

916
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:10,021
Load your guns, men!
Load your guns! Remember,
you're still in the army.

917
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,862
Gimme some water.
I gotta have water.

918
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,528
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?
Load your guns.!

919
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:18,596
- What's the use? We can't
stand another charge.
- We may have to.

920
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,939
No.! We can't.
The dead can't fiight anymore.

921
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:27,142
Why don't you call roll now?
You're afraid? I'll call it
for you. Private Dowden.!

922
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,207
- You load your guns!
- Corporal Brannigan.

923
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,448
Load your guns.!
Why don't you tell
Brannigan to load his gun?

924
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:35,149
- I'm telling you.! Get up.!
- I won't!

925
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,317
Save that fighting
for the Indians!

926
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:40,191
You'll see.
Hold onto yourself,
fella.

927
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,662
There's nobody left.
You'll see.

928
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,165
Why don't you
tell your bugler
to sound assembly?

929
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,259
Stop blubbering
and reload your gun!
He can't answer.

930
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,136
Look at him.!
Look at him.!

931
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,010
Saints above.
He's answering
to his name.

932
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,881
Yes, it's the dead calling.

933
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:08,685
- Stop it, men!
Stop it. Listen.

934
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:15,223
It's Bugler Corry.
He's sounding the charge!

935
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:18,061
Come on, men,
it's a charge!
No, you fools! No!

936
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,431
What are you waiting for?
The dead want us.

937
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,062
McGinnis, hold 'em back.
Fall in men!

938
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:26,869
- It's the charge.
Don't ya hear it?
- Yes, I hear it.

939
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,103
Come on, follow me!
The boy's right.

940
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,612
It's horses.
They're charging.

941
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,944
Get ready, men!
We'll go down fightin'!

942
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,883
Come on.!

943
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:41,182
There they are, over there!
You can see 'em!

944
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:50,431
- Holy saints!
[ Bugle Playing ''Charge'' ]

945
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,299
They know we're alive.

946
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,946
We're okay.

947
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:33,171
Well, Yellow Hand didn't
get that ammunition
he was hankerin' for.

948
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:37,804
He would have,
if Calamity hadn't gotten
through to Custer.

949
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,487
She did a good job,
all right.

950
01:13:56,298 --> 01:14:00,029
- She must've told Yellow Hand.
- Let her alone.

951
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,435
She never was good.
Why don't somebody
do somethin'about it?

952
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,406
Only 1 8 come back
out of 48.

953
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,670
The Cheyenne must've paid her
plenty to tell 'em.

954
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,680
Paid this woman in money,
but our soldiers paid in blood.

955
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:16,309
What are you gonna do?
I'll show you
what we're gonna do.

956
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,650
Talk's cheap,
ya loudmouthed liar.
Hey, you.

957
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,451
Let me out!

958
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:30,023
All right,
you dirty mule-skinner.
If you want it-- Ow!

959
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,970
If she was a man,
we'd know what to do with her.

960
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,974
Go ahead, you crossbred rat!
If you was a man,
you wouldn't be here!

961
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:42,510
Run her out of town!
Get some tar.!

962
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,681
Tar and feathers
is too good for her.
That's the way to talk!

963
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,811
Get a rail.!
Here. Here's a rail.
Gimme that hammer.

964
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,789
Why don't somebody get behind
her and get that whip?

965
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,952
- Why don't you?
- Get the feathers and tar.

966
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:02,360
There's a rail.
What do you want
with a rail,Jack?

967
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:08,065
- Bill!
- We're gonna run her
out of town.

968
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,969
Why?
You know what she done?
She told Indians--

969
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,531
Well, she's a woman,
isn't she?
Keep out of this, Bill Hickok.

970
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,805
And women talk a little
too much sometimes.

971
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:20,440
This woman is gonna get
what's coming to her.
Let's ride her out of town.

972
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,612
And men talk a little
too much sometimes too!
Those men had wives.

973
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:32,991
I know what's on your minds!
Yes, there were soldiers killed.

974
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,427
I was there.
I saw them.
Huh?

975
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:39,729
And they were killed
with bullets-- bullets
from repeating rifles.

976
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,099
Who'd sell rifles
to Indians?

977
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:47,836
Lincoln said this country's
got to be made safe.
Those are his words.

978
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:51,573
And I'm on my way to settle
this matter with the man
who sold those rifles.

979
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:56,607
It wouldn't please me to be the
man Bill Hickok's goin' after.
Me neither!

980
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:00,416
I knew there
was monkey business goin'on.
You're right.

981
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:04,220
And there's liable to be
bullets flyin' around
this way any minute,

982
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:08,457
so I'd advise you
to get inside,
off the street.

983
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:11,761
Well--
I was goin' home anyway.

984
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,530
- I'll go with you,Jack.
- I got a long ways to go myself.

985
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:21,371
Lattimer's ''crookeder''
than a rattlesnake. You can't
go after him alone. His men--

986
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,935
I started this alone
and I'll finish it alone.

987
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:32,077
Why should I stake you
to go diggin' for gold?

988
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,248
They found gold and
plenty of it right there
in the Black Hills.

989
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:40,352
That's Sioux country.
That don't matter. There's
gold there at the grass roots.

990
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,830
So, you're goin'
on the dodge,
desertin' after gold.

991
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,890
You know what Custer
does to deserters.

992
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,334
I know what he'd like
to do to you.

993
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:51,861
He just got back and
he's boilin' mad about Cheyenne
Indians and repeatin' rifles.

994
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:56,707
He can't do nothin'. Let him
make his complaint to Washington
and he'll find that out!

995
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,111
The army's gettin' riled--
The army can't stop me!

996
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:04,312
There's bigger men than
the army in this with me.

997
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,354
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm busy, McCall.

998
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,481
I want to do you
a big favor, Lattimer.

999
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,355
What's on your mind?
Hickok's after you.
Wild Bill.

1000
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:19,696
He says you're the cause
of all these Indian massacres.
He's comin' in here now.

1001
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:22,498
All right.
You better get out.

1002
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,672
You won't forget
that I warned you?
Get out.

1003
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,141
Get in there, you three.

1004
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,916
Maybe I'll have
a job for you.

1005
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,027
Hello, Hickok.

1006
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,763
That's the name,
ain't it?

1007
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,898
Met you in Leavenworth.

1008
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:03,172
Hear you been doin'
a little scoutin' for Custer.

1009
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,406
Did you see anything?

1010
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,746
Yellow Hand's been farming
with your farming tools.

1011
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:13,254
You know what this is?
Skunk.

1012
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,119
Yes.
I'm not armed, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not armed.

1013
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,092
I'll give you
three minutes to fix that.
I'll be waiting outside.

1014
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:23,962
- I'm just leaving town.
- You're not leaving town
unless dead men can walk.

1015
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,815
Come in here, you fellows.

1016
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:47,713
Now. I'm gonna stake ya,
all three of you.

1017
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,984
I'm gonna stake you
to 50 Double Eagles.

1018
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,549
I've got
a wagon train leaving for
the Black Hills tonight.

1019
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:56,154
I'm gonna get you away from
Custer and safe out of town.
That's great, Mr. Lattimer.

1020
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,758
But first, there's
that little job I want
you boys to do for me.

1021
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:05,398
You're crazy. Lattimer won't
fight you fair. You ain't got
the sense you was born with.

1022
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,705
Ah, Bill, don't our love
mean nothin' to ya?

1023
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:10,904
Our love--
if that's what
you want to call it--

1024
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:14,039
all that died back
on that island where
everything else was dying.

1025
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,050
No, Bill, no!

1026
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,378
I'll go get Cody.
Maybe he can talk some sense
into you, ya big mule!

1027
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,391
Get off the street.

1028
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:48,742
You better take cover
for a few minutes.
You think you own this town.

1029
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,012
I'm just walkin'
through it.

1030
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:55,853
And us fellas can get
out of your way, can't we,
just like we was dirt?

1031
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:59,382
Suit yourself.
All right, Mr. Long Hair.

1032
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,521
You're too durn friendly
with Injuns to suit me.

1033
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,361
You shouldn't have
said that, soldier.

1034
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:08,197
What are you gonna do about it,
ya gun-totin' windbag?

1035
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:12,707
Oh, substituting
for Lattimer.

1036
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:16,642
I can't shoot at that uniform.
If you want action,
take it off.

1037
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,736
Yeah, and get a slug
while I'm doin' it.
Take it off.

1038
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,476
I'll give you
that much time.

1039
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,485
I never draw on a man
who isn't ready.

1040
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:39,229
- Bill.! Bill.!

1041
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,665
Come on, Bill,
let's get out of here.

1042
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:53,711
Sit here, Bill, out of sight.
Close that door, Lou.

1043
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,808
Easy, Bill.

1044
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,156
That bullet went clean through,
but it's bleedin' bad.

1045
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:07,127
Get some water, Lou, quick.
And some clean linen.

1046
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:11,256
You brought this man
to our house; a murderer.

1047
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,825
Lou!
When is this
going to stop?

1048
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,838
When will it ever stop?
This killing and killing!

1049
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:23,139
Why don't they kill him too?
Then you can be next
and then me and--

1050
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,907
Lou, he's my friend.

1051
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:32,086
I didn't mean to bother you,
ma'am. I'll be going.

1052
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:36,317
Can I take your horse, Bill?
You can have everything
I've got, Bill, but--

1053
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,258
You sit right down again,
Mr. Hickok.

1054
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:43,195
You can't go
bleeding like that,
whatever you've done.

1055
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:46,860
He's done plenty.
Those men were soldiers.

1056
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:52,134
He'll have every trooper of
the Seventh after him now.
Get some towels, Will.

1057
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:56,109
I'll be as quick
as I can, Mr. Hickok.
Thank you, ma'am.

1058
01:21:56,177 --> 01:22:00,045
Here you are, Lou.
There's hot water
on the stove.

1059
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,675
Hold this, Mr. Hickok.

1060
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,519
I never was a murderer.

1061
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,084
I never did fight
unless put upon.

1062
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,596
Thou shalt not kill.

1063
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,190
No ghosts ever come
bothering me.

1064
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,964
It was always the other man
or me... in a fair fight.

1065
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:29,275
What right have you to judge
who is to live or to die?

1066
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,972
Put away your guns,
Mr. Hickok.

1067
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:38,014
I can't do that, ma'am,
not till I find John Lattimer.

1068
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,989
Hey,Jake, gimme
some more light.

1069
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:54,201
Ready, boys?

1070
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:58,729
Yeah.
Which way, Mr. Lattimer?

1071
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,742
South, until we get out of town,
then we head north.

1072
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,540
Say, where are them
three soldiers we're takin'?

1073
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:08,343
They're staying
in Hays City,
but I'm goin'.

1074
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,010
Get on your wagon.

1075
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,886
It's dark enough now, Bill.

1076
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:20,223
You oughta head up north.
Hide out in the Black Hills.

1077
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:23,458
That's bad Indian country,
but it'll be safer for you
than here.

1078
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:27,092
I'm going
into town first.
You're crazy, Bill!

1079
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:30,467
I'd be crazier
if I didn't do what
I think I ought to.

1080
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:36,968
Bill, open up.
It's me.

1081
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,854
Did they hurt
you much, Bill?
I'm all right.

1082
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:51,085
I couldn't come till it
got dark. I was scared
they'd be watchin' me.

1083
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,686
I know you don't want
to see me, but I gotta
tell you somethin', Bill.

1084
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,231
Custer's ordered you
brought in dead or alive.

1085
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,858
The troopers have combed
every hidin' down by the river
and they're headin' this way.

1086
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:04,166
He's goin'to fiind Lattimer.
Lattimer's gone.
He pulled out with his wagons.

1087
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,003
Where?
Nobody knows.

1088
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,078
I'll find him.

1089
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:16,106
Of course you will. Someday
you're bound to, only don't
try to find his trail now.

1090
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:19,950
Just try to save yourself
from Custer's men. There's
no tellin' what they'll do.

1091
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,923
If Lattimer's pulled out
with his wagons,
those wagons are loaded.

1092
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,687
And I know what
I've got to do.

1093
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,460
That's a trooper.

1094
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:34,297
Hear his saber?

1095
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,564
Get in there, Bill,
quick.

1096
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:39,971
You might set the table
for three, Mrs. Cody.

1097
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,770
Who's there?

1098
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,835
Courier from
General Custer.

1099
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:52,284
General Custer's compliments.
You're to report to him right away.
How do you do, ma'am?

1100
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,686
Howdy, soldier.
Hi.
What's up?

1101
01:24:55,757 --> 01:25:00,558
Custer's been ordered to move
against Sitting Bull and the
Sioux up in Big Horn country.

1102
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,529
What does General Custer
want Will for?

1103
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:08,058
The General doesn't let me
in on all his secrets.
Come on, get a move on.

1104
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:09,865
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

1105
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:14,875
Grub's ready. Hustle them
dishes. I'm cavin' in all over.

1106
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,037
Light out, Bill.
I've got a pack all fixed
for you and I brought a horse.

1107
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,981
Good-bye, ma'am,
and thank you
for everything.

1108
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,921
Thanks for the coat,
Bill Cody. I'll take
good care of it.

1109
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:33,654
Take care of what's
inside of it,
you old bushwhacker.

1110
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,836
Will, what does
General Custer
want of you?

1111
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,553
Bill. Bill, you ain't fit
to ride far.

1112
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,182
Why don't you lay up someplace
and take care of that arm?

1113
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,523
That's what I'll do.
I'll need this arm
when I find Lattimer.

1114
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:11,122
Ah, forget it.
You ain't got a chance
against Lattimer's men.

1115
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,100
Hmm. I've got
nothing to lose.

1116
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,160
Nothin' but your life!

1117
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:20,435
When you talk like that,
I could bounce a rock
off n your bean.

1118
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,306
Why don't you try it
next time you see me?

1119
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,846
When'll that be, Bill?
Where?

1120
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:31,116
Oh, up around
Deadwood someplace.

1121
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,154
You can never tell.

1122
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:35,621
I gotta get out of here too
after what I done.

1123
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,558
Well, I guess
this is good-bye, eh, Bill?

1124
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:46,356
Where are you going?
Oh, up around Deadwood
someplace, I guess.

1125
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,028
I don't give a hoot
where I go.

1126
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,765
You're well-named.
A child of calamity.

1127
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:58,404
Always gettin' yourself
into trouble.

1128
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:04,710
Bill--

1129
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:08,517
Bill, I reckon
maybe you don't hate me.

1130
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,854
Do you?

1131
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:14,861
Maybe you're just bein'
nice to me because you think
you won't ever see me again.

1132
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:19,093
Sure. Sure,
I'll see ya again.

1133
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,761
This is a big country,
and trails cross...

1134
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,827
sometimes.

1135
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,198
Thought these
Big Horn Mountains
was full of Indians.

1136
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,205
Well, I ain't seen
any Indians yet,

1137
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,707
but I'll swear to Moses
there's somethin' followin' us.

1138
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:06,580
Git!

1139
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,450
Want your coat back,
Bill?

1140
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:56,361
No. I want some grub.

1141
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,365
Well, how do you
like your eggs?

1142
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,833
I like 'em very much.
You got any?

1143
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,370
No.

1144
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:07,238
I got some jerky
and a little bacon
and a little coffee.

1145
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:11,142
You must've been mighty frugal
over the last six weeks
since you been gone.

1146
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,146
I haven't any grub left.

1147
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:15,239
Well, you're welcome
to anything I got, Will.

1148
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,511
I know that, Bill.

1149
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:22,551
Build up a little fire
and we'll have coffee.

1150
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:29,162
Given up
ridin' a horse?

1151
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:32,131
Indians got it.
Mine too.

1152
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:37,334
I see you got holes
in your boots.

1153
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,510
That's from followin'
a long-legged man.

1154
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,068
Me?

1155
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,637
You.

1156
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,307
What were you
followin' me for?

1157
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,446
Did you have something
you wanted to tell me?

1158
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,252
I reckon I did.

1159
01:29:57,325 --> 01:30:00,055
I thought you were
off with Custer.

1160
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,498
Custer sent me
to bring you back.

1161
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,945
Slice up some of
that bacon, Bill.

1162
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,920
Have a piece of jerky.

1163
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,515
Thanks, Bill.

1164
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:39,296
Well, I guess we got
a few coffee beans left.

1165
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:43,895
Enough for about two cups
if we make it weak.
How's Lou?

1166
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,905
I ain't seen her, Bill,
for weeks.

1167
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:49,932
She went home to St. Louis
the day after you left.

1168
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:54,072
She wanted to be
with her mother when--

1169
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,416
And what have you
decided to call it?

1170
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,718
I guess Lou
will decide that.

1171
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,951
Yeah. She's
a fine woman, Bill.

1172
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,457
She fixed my arm,

1173
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:11,464
so I can pull a gun
as quick with my left
as I can with my right.

1174
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:16,965
Well, that's fine,
Bill.

1175
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,666
It might come in handy
for you.
It will.

1176
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,566
This is
a hostile country.

1177
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,374
If you get some water,
we'll get this coffee
goin' quick.

1178
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:35,189
Can't understand
why Custer sent you.

1179
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:41,522
He says I'm the only man
you wouldn't kill.

1180
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:47,261
Seems to me Custer's takin'
a whole lot for granted.

1181
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,068
Well, there it is.

1182
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:56,269
I have an order from
the United States Army
to bring you back.

1183
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:59,336
So I gather.
Dead or alive.

1184
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:02,640
Which way do you
aim to do it?

1185
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,275
Alive.

1186
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,685
No, Bill.

1187
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:10,724
It's too bad they had to
send you. I'm sorry.

1188
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,190
But they did, Bill.

1189
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,926
Did you hear that?

1190
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,161
What's that Indian doing with
that Seventh Cavalry stuff?

1191
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:56,002
That flag's
shot to pieces.

1192
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:27,967
- Where'd you get that flag?

1193
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,332
That's an officer's coat,
and there's a bullet hole
through it.

1194
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:28,752
Do you understand him?
He says
Custer's dead!

1195
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,763
Wiped out
with his whole battalion.

1196
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:38,569
He says Yellow Hand's
comin' up from the south
with his Cheyenne...

1197
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,870
to join Sitting Bull.

1198
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:46,613
He says there'll be
no more white man.

1199
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,445
If the Cheyenne
reach Sitting Bull,
he's right.

1200
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,451
Where's
the nearest regiment?
Merritt.

1201
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,817
He's moving up
to join Crook.
You know
his line of march?

1202
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:57,119
He's coming up
through Deadwood.
Find him.

1203
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,684
He says the white man friend
is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull.

1204
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:05,823
- That's Lattimer.

1205
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,528
To the new village
in the canyon.
That's Deadwood.

1206
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:11,730
You go for Merritt
and tell him to get between
Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne.

1207
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:16,275
Remember, Bill,
you're my prisoner.

1208
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:20,771
I'll see ya in Deadwood.
We'll settle it there.

1209
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:27,780
[''Oh.! Susanna'' On Piano ]

1210
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:34,423
- I seen it myself.
- One nugget?

1211
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:36,554
Yes, sir.!
Twenty-three ounces.

1212
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,860
The biggest nugget I seen
in Deadwood yet.

1213
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:42,960
Dave, the biggest liar
I've seen in Deadwood yet
is you.

1214
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:44,971
I ain't tryin'
to sell you the claim.

1215
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,269
I'm caught.

1216
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,815
Now, Calamity,
what did you
wanna do that for?

1217
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:59,819
Drinks ain't free, Dave.

1218
01:35:59,887 --> 01:36:03,323
If you was a man,
Calamity--
I ain't,
so plunk down four bits.

1219
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:09,361
You're a good barkeep,
Calamity, but you're
awful ornery.

1220
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,591
Hello, Calamity.
Sherry and egg.

1221
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:16,330
Eggs are
a dollar apiece.
I said egg
and sherry.

1222
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:20,773
You'll get whiskey
and egg.

1223
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:23,605
Would you like
to try runnin' me out
of this town too,Jack?

1224
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:27,636
No, Calamity.
I don't bear you a bit
of hard feeling anymore.

1225
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,115
Well, that's just fine.

1226
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,117
'Cause I bear you a-plenty.

1227
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:37,749
Now, say, Calamity.
You oughta be
makin' up to me.

1228
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:41,623
I'm gonna be
a big man
in this country.

1229
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:44,061
You'll have to grow
about a foot, won't ya?

1230
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:48,363
When I get hold of a pile
of money-- which I aim to,
and soon--

1231
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,403
you'll be
treatin'me right.

1232
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,735
So, you staked a claim?

1233
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,401
Nah, not me.

1234
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:59,310
Those fellas are lookin'
for gold in the ground.
I aim to find it on top.

1235
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,473
If it ain't in the ground,
where is it?

1236
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:05,007
I ain't sayin'!
[ In Normal Voice ]
I ain't sayin'.

1237
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:09,317
All I'm sayin' is
I'm gonna be a big man
in this Black Hills country.

1238
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:13,224
Yes, sirree, a big man,
like Wild Bill Hickok.

1239
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:18,129
Say, whatever
become of Bill?

1240
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,462
I couldn't tell ya.

1241
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:24,561
For all I know,
he may be dead.

1242
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:29,701
[ Whistling ]
The man that killed him
must be ridin' high.

1243
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:33,144
The man don't live
that could kill him.

1244
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:37,548
Though you done your best.
You told Lattimer, Bill
was looking for him in Hays City.

1245
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:40,451
Hickok don't know that,
does he? It ain't true.

1246
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,455
There ain't a word
of truth in it.

1247
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,514
Lucky for you
Bill ain't here.

1248
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,768
You can throw this old outfit
away or burn it.

1249
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,469
I don't think
they'll burn.

1250
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,172
Hey.
You like-a the haircut?

1251
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,249
No, no haircut.

1252
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:14,783
Have you seen any freighting
or hauling around here?

1253
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:16,948
No, no freighting.
No hauling.

1254
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:20,255
Everybody got a mine.
Everybody dig and a-dig.

1255
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:22,352
Nobody got-a time
for Tony no more.

1256
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:24,420
Nobody take
a bath no more!

1257
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:30,234
Hey, don't you ever put
tobacco in that pipe?

1258
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:32,772
Smells like an octopus.

1259
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:41,109
Hello,Jack.

1260
01:38:45,486 --> 01:38:47,454
What's that army horse
doin' here?

1261
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:50,615
There ain't been any soldiers
around here in weeks,
Mr. Lattimer,

1262
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:52,488
but the Fifth Cavalry's
comin' in.

1263
01:38:52,559 --> 01:38:54,686
We'll be gone
before they get in.

1264
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,890
My wagons oughta be
here in a few minutes.

1265
01:38:57,965 --> 01:39:00,433
I need some barberin'.
I ain't seen
no Indian guide.

1266
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:03,026
Give him time.
Sitting Bull said he'd send him.

1267
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,833
Take it easy.

1268
01:39:05,906 --> 01:39:07,771
Mr. Lattimer.

1269
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:10,105
I'm gettin' kinda jumpy
about those wagons.

1270
01:39:10,177 --> 01:39:13,340
I'll buy ya one.
That's nice of you,
Mr. Lattimer.

1271
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:15,314
A drop of rye will
set me up just fine.

1272
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:19,178
You don't happen
to have seen any wagons
going through...

1273
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:21,312
loaded with
farming tools?

1274
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:24,186
Now what does anybody
want-a with-a farming tools?

1275
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:26,226
They got no time
to farm.

1276
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:29,285
Hey. Why don't you want
to get the haircut?

1277
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:31,297
Short hair makes
the Indians mad,

1278
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:33,424
and they're
mad enough already.

1279
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,094
Thank-a you too much.

1280
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,137
He's-a fine fellow.

01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:50,673
Bill!

1282
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:54,650
Hello, Calamity.
Ah, Bill.

1283
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:57,350
Gee, you're back.

1284
01:39:57,424 --> 01:40:00,052
I been watchin' and askin'
and nobody's seen ya.

1285
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:03,460
Nobody's heard.
I haven't been out
in what you call society.

1286
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,862
I had one caller,
though. Bill Cody.

1287
01:40:05,933 --> 01:40:07,901
He found you, then.

1288
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:10,766
Say, Bill,
you didn't--
No.

1289
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,102
No, he's all right.
I'm meetin' him here.

1290
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:15,073
I'm sure glad of that.

1291
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:17,736
Wasn't your fault,
them three soldiers gettin' killed.

1292
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:20,644
Say, Bill. You won't
have to move on, will ya?

1293
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:23,239
No, I got a hunch
this is gonna be
my last camp.

1294
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,911
You're settlin' down?
You're gonna stay here?

1295
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:29,319
I got a feelin'
I'm gonna stay here.

1296
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:35,324
Bill, you need a drink.

1297
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,095
I been thinkin'.

1298
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:44,433
The West is gettin' to be
a new kind of place.

1299
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:48,498
Bill Cody's
done the right thing.
He's changed.

1300
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:52,102
What room
is there gonna be for
a two-gun plainsman?

1301
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:55,342
You're talkin' crazy.
You're the best man
in this country.

1302
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:59,986
I don't know
who thinks so.
I think so, Bill.

1303
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:05,387
If you think Cody done right
settlin' down and all,

1304
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:07,393
maybe that's what
you'd like to do.

1305
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:10,396
I mean, have a home
and things...

1306
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:12,864
and have somebody
to cook your meals
for ya and--

1307
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:15,629
Doesn't sound
so bad.
Oh, Bill--

1308
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:18,865
Calamity, now you
gotta listen to me.

1309
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,132
I didn't do nothin',
Mr. Hickok.

1310
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:25,144
- I didn't do nothin'.
- What's he talkin' about?

1311
01:41:25,212 --> 01:41:28,204
He sneaked and told Lattimer
you was lookin' for him
back in Hays City.

1312
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:32,116
She's lying, Mr. Hickok.
She's lying.

1313
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:35,212
McCall, a year ago I'd have
shot you dead on sight.

1314
01:41:38,892 --> 01:41:40,883
But now--

1315
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:42,986
Go buy yourself a drink.

1316
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:46,462
You're the luckiest rat alive.

1317
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,269
I'm beginnin' to think
Mrs. Cody was right.

1318
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:59,403
Who am I to decide
whether a man's
to live or die?

1319
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:03,817
You feelin'
all right, Bill?

1320
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,560
No Injun guide yet,Jake.

1321
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:25,264
No? Well, if you
don't mind, then I'll
go put down a drink.

1322
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,432
All right.

1323
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,601
Go ahead, boys.
Wet your whistles.

1324
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,108
Mr. Lattimer.
Hickok is in town.

1325
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:38,481
Hickok? Where?
In the Bella Union.

1326
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:42,020
Get the boys back, quick.

1327
01:42:42,089 --> 01:42:44,683
Hey,Jake!
Mr. Lattimer wants you--
Shut up, you fool!

1328
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:54,592
Lattimer.

1329
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:57,159
Stay in here,
Calamity.
Oh, Bill.

1330
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:01,200
This is the only thing
I have worth keeping.

1331
01:43:01,275 --> 01:43:04,438
If you got a wrong hunch,
don't go out there.

1332
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:07,739
Don't forget to wind it.

1333
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:12,047
You're a mule-headed man,
Bill Hickok!

1334
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:15,054
Get on your wagons,
boys.

1335
01:43:15,122 --> 01:43:17,090
Just a minute.!

1336
01:43:32,339 --> 01:43:35,467
I wanna talk to you.
Any objections,
gentlemen?

1337
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,608
Where you goin'
with the wagons?

1338
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:43,172
Goin' out of town.
What you got 'em
loaded with?

1339
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,617
Buffalo hides.
You can see, can't ya?

1340
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:50,515
Your wagons are headed north,
Lattimer.

1341
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:53,082
You're not selling buffalo hides
to Sitting Bull's Indians?

1342
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:07,196
Take off the top hides.
I wanna see
what's under 'em.

1343
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:11,370
Jake.
NotJake.
You.

1344
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:15,006
Oh. All right.

1345
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:23,614
I don't know
what you're lookin' fer,

1346
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,851
but if you want it,
you're gonna get it.

1347
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:33,465
Keep your hands
off your guns,

1348
01:44:33,533 --> 01:44:36,798
or there'll be more
dead men than this town
can afford to bury.

1349
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:41,533
You gentlemen
also sell farming tools?

1350
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:44,543
Get on ahead of me,
inside the Bella Union.

1351
01:44:56,857 --> 01:45:00,190
Wait a minute.
Don't you belong
to this outfit,Jack?

1352
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,660
Huh?
Oh, no, Mr. Hickok.

1353
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:06,028
I just know Mr. Lattimer.
You knew
Mr. Lattimer,Jack.

1354
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:09,500
Better get inside too.
Oh, sure.
Sure, Mr. Hickok.

1355
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,503
Whatever you say.

1356
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:13,038
- Who was that fella he shot?
- Never saw him before.

1357
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,203
He oughta know better
than to pull a gun
on Bill Hickok.

1358
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:26,046
Cody and the Fifth Cavalry
are on their way.
Keep an eye out for 'em.

1359
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:29,919
The rest of you, keep out!
[ Man ]
I'm not going to go in there.

1360
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,117
Gentlemen, we're gonna stay
right here for a while.

1361
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:34,683
What'll it be?
Name your poison.

1362
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:37,059
Jack, how about
tending bar?

1363
01:45:51,845 --> 01:45:54,109
We may be here
for quite a long wait.

1364
01:45:55,549 --> 01:45:57,983
What are we waitin' for?

1365
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:02,988
Jake, don't reach
for anything but your glass.

1366
01:46:03,056 --> 01:46:04,887
That goes for
the rest of you.

1367
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:07,017
Keep your hands away from
your guns unless you want...

1368
01:46:07,094 --> 01:46:10,222
fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood
instead of one.

1369
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:13,755
We're waiting till
General Merritt gets here
with the Fifth Cavalry...

1370
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:16,166
and takes over
Sitting Bull's rifles.

1371
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:19,467
Any objection?

1372
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:23,302
May be an hour,
may be a day.

1373
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,242
When I have to wait,
I believe in entertainment.

1374
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:28,179
Furthermore,
I'm short of funds.
Cards, bartender.

1375
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:30,773
Find some fresh ones
and some chips.

1376
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:34,952
Proceed, gentlemen,
over there.

1377
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:38,354
You first, if it's
all the same to you.

1378
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:52,436
I'll take the one
without arms.

1379
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:02,740
Keep your hands
on the table, all of you.

1380
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,168
You bank.

1381
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:26,304
I don't hear no shootin'.
It's powerful quiet
in there.

1382
01:47:26,373 --> 01:47:28,500
Wonder what they're doin'.
Best way to find out
is to--

1383
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:31,669
You keep out of this!
Let Bill Hickok
play his own hand.

1384
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:34,009
That's-a just
what he's a-doin'.
He's a-playin' cards.

1385
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,105
Playin' cards?
Tony must be crazy.

1386
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:39,346
- Let's go in and find out.
- No, no.
I see him so plain.

1387
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:41,512
He's a-sittin'down
with his back-a this way.

1388
01:47:41,588 --> 01:47:43,715
His back?

1389
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,726
Cut for deal.
Looks like we're being
played for suckers.

1390
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:55,600
Your deal.
Any sign
of the cavalry yet, Calamity?

1391
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:57,432
Not yet, Bill.

1392
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,343
I hope my prisoner
hasn't escaped.

1393
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:12,111
General Merritt,
if he's done the job
he set out to do,

1394
01:48:12,185 --> 01:48:14,312
do you think the government
would be a little lenient
with him?

1395
01:48:14,387 --> 01:48:18,221
Mr. Cody, in matters
where its sympathies
are concerned,

1396
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:21,021
the government
has been known
to bend a little.

1397
01:48:24,364 --> 01:48:28,130
- You better not go in there.
- Bill, there's an Injun
comin' in the door.

1398
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:31,466
Hello, Charlie.
Come in.

1399
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:36,532
- Charlie's a friendly Injun.
- Yes, I know Charlie.

1400
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:39,044
How many?
Gimme two.

1401
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:41,046
Three to me.

1402
01:48:41,114 --> 01:48:44,174
Sit over here, Charlie,
where I can keep
an eye on you.

1403
01:48:50,724 --> 01:48:52,692
Charlie took a shot
at me once.

1404
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,794
I was too far away.

1405
01:48:57,831 --> 01:48:59,628
Too bad you
wasn't closer.

1406
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:02,566
He got my horse.

1407
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:07,765
Charlie'd been the biggest man
in the West if he'd have
killed you, Hickok.

1408
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:10,571
Injuns understand
things like that.

1409
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:13,841
Kill a big man
and that makes you
a big man.

1410
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:17,145
Killin'you, Hickok,
is an honorjust waitin'
for somebody.

1411
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:21,581
You,Jake?
Not me, Bill,
not me.

1412
01:49:21,655 --> 01:49:25,819
I'm facing you. Only way
to down a man like you
is from the back.

1413
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,497
Raise ya five.

1414
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,466
Seein' that
and up five.

1415
01:49:34,534 --> 01:49:38,300
Get your foot off my chair,
Calamity. It's bad luck.

1416
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,641
Don't go against
your luck, Bill.

1417
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:45,804
Your say,Jake.

1418
01:49:45,879 --> 01:49:49,076
The soldiers! That means
a rope necktie for us!

1419
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:52,846
Sit down!
We'll play out this hand.

1420
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:56,013
- All right.
- This game ain't over yet.

1421
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:58,853
It's almost over.

1422
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:02,190
Calamity, find Cody
and General Merritt.
Bring 'em here.

1423
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:10,365
- Play your hand.
- I'm callin'ya, Hickok.!

1424
01:50:14,874 --> 01:50:17,001
Black aces and eights.

1425
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:20,069
Your luck's changed.
Three queens.

1426
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:22,410
I'm afraid
you lose, Hickok.

1427
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:26,680
A man's bound to lose,
sooner or later.

1428
01:50:31,491 --> 01:50:33,652
Bill? Bill!

1429
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,820
Let's get outta here!

1430
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:47,196
Those fellas just shot
Bill Hickok!

1431
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:49,332
Arrest those men!

1432
01:50:58,218 --> 01:51:00,152
Come on, you.
Get up.

1433
01:51:01,755 --> 01:51:03,848
Where is he?
Where's Bill?

1434
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:29,613
There's your prisoner,
General Merritt.

1435
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:33,119
We won't forget
what Bill Hickok
has done, Cody.

1436
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:35,780
We'll remember.

1437
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:39,916
All of us will.
All of us.

1438
01:51:55,008 --> 01:51:57,670
That's one kiss
you won't wipe off.

1439
