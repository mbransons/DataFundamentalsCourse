1
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,326
Gregorio. Gregorio!

2
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,057
They're all dead!

3
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,519
Oh, God, they're all dead!
Massacred!

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,688
The Alamo has fallen!
They're dead, all of them!

5
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,942
They're all dead at the Alamo!

6
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,735
Did you hear what he said?

7
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,906
The Alamo!

8
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,982
Take the oath for militia duty,

9
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,861
and you will receive 640 acres...

10
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,823
640 acres of your own...

11
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,616
of your own choosing.

12
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,954
640 acres of your own choosing.
That's better.

13
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,795
Smooth.

14
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,757
If it doesn't burn going down,
how can you be sure it's bad for you?

15
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,801
I'll be interested to see you gentlemen

16
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,138
when you arrive in Texas
and have your first taste of mescal.

17
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,142
Is it true that men and women
imbathe together out in the open?

18
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,145
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

19
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,065
Yes, well... excuse us.

20
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,906
Invest now, gentlemen,
or lament later.

21
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,451
I'm a screamer.

22
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,454
I got the roughest racehorse,
the prettiest sister,

23
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,166
the surest rifle and the ugliest dog
in the district.

24
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,169
My old man could lick
anybody in Tennessee,

25
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,296
and I could lick my old man.

26
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,298
I can outgrin a panther

27
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,467
and ride on a lightnin' bolt,

28
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,511
tote a steamboat on my back

29
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,804
and whip my weight in wildcats.

30
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,184
Whip my weight in wildcats.
Whip my weight in wildcats. Whip...

31
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,478
- What is it?
- He's here.

32
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,189
- Who's here?
- He is here!

33
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,316
Five minutes!

34
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,361
I'll tell you, these old bones
could sure use a respite.

35
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:42,491
'Course, the good citizens of Tennessee
may grant me that wish come next election.

36
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,826
- No!

37
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,079
- Excuse me one moment.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

38
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,584
Sam Houston.

39
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,753
Makin' friends wherever you go.

40
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,131
- To Tennessee.
- Oh, to hell with Tennessee.

41
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,592
To Texas.

42
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,845
It's sad, isn't it?

43
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:07,307
A year ago, we'd be looking at two men
with their caps set for the White House.

44
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,851
Now...

45
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,395
What you peddlin', Sam?

46
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:16,108
Somethin' a certain Congressman
might need before long.

47
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,193
Are you sellin' rockin' chairs?

48
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,195
I'm sellin' Texas.

49
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,739
And what would I want with Norte Mexico?

50
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:27,369
David, you remember
what Tennessee was?

51
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,371
You come to Texas.

52
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,000
Timber, water, game, cattle,

53
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,460
more land than you can possibly imagine.

54
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:42,134
You take the oath for militia duty, you will
receive 640 acres of your own choosing.

55
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,928
- My own choosing?
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,811
Sam! You figure this new republic's
gonna need a president?

57
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:10,120
Before we begin tonight's performance,

58
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,498
I should like to acknowledge
the presence of the man

59
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:18,086
whose life inspired our humble play.

60
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,466
Good evening, Mr. Crockett.

61
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,770
Good evening, Mr. Crockett.

62
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,366
You want to call me an opportunist?

63
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,201
Hell, yes, call me an opportunist.

64
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,703
But taking the Alamo
changed everything.

65
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,789
- We're in control now.
- Yes!

66
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,544
We swore allegiance to Mexico
under the Federalist Constitution of 1824.

67
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,839
Santa Anna tore that document up
personally, did he not?

68
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,007
Named himself supreme dictator?

69
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,678
Well, I, for one, ain't swearin' allegiance
to no son-of-a-bitch dictator.

70
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,805
Yeah!

71
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,932
Neither am I.

72
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,861
Time to go, General.

73
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,281
They are talking crazy.

74
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,326
Drunk back sober.

75
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,079
It's a miracle of the first order.

76
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,138
Seguin, why'd they put me in charge
of the army if they won't listen to me?

77
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,893
We need to muster and train troops here,
not send soldiers all over Texas.

78
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:01,440
Idiots. They think Santa Anna's just gonna
hand over part of Mexico without a fight?

79
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,862
They are gonna want you humble,
General.

80
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:10,490
I humble myself before God,
and there the list ends.

81
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:15,204
To march an expedition
between here and Matamoros

82
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,081
- is lunacy!

83
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,709
You do not split an army
into vagabond militias

84
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,547
that march off on the slightest pretext
like bloodthirsty rabble.

85
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,091
Do you really believe this war is over?

86
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,553
You opposed Bexar, but victory was ours!

87
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,596
Yeah!

88
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,641
And now you oppose Matamoros,
where victory will be as sweet.

89
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,934
No.

90
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,269
Perhaps, sir, you simply
oppose fighting.

91
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,438
Fighters shall lead the new country
of Texas, sir.

92
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,107
The council will now consider
the removal of General Houston

93
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,859
from command of the regular army.

94
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,445
- All in favor, show of hands.
- Aye!

95
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,282
The late, great Sam Houston,
former governor of Tennessee

96
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,035
and now former general
of the Texian army.

97
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,955
- Scottish catamite.
- What did you say?

98
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:02,167
I called you a Scottish catamite, Grant.
One step down from associate pederast.

99
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,086
- All right.
- Remain clothed!

100
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,922
Come for me! Come! Come!

101
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,890
Any excuse to start removin' your clothes,
is that right, Houston?

102
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,600
This is not your concern, Mr. Bowie.

103
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,812
Indeed. This is between me
and the Scottish catamite.

104
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,859
Wanna borrow mine, Grant?

105
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,403
'Cause I'll surely give it to ya.

106
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,216
Buy you a drink?

107
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,511
I didn't know you drank.

108
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:07,191
You marked the coat as single-breasted,
with a four-inch stand collar?

109
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,736
- As you desired, Mr. Travis.
- Lieutenant Colonel.

110
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,156
And the epaulets are gold bullion?

111
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,074
Should be quite a sight.

112
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,744
Where would you like the uniform sent?

113
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,704
San Antonio de Bexar.

114
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,748
I'll be there defending the Alamo.

115
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,837
Defend against what? The Mexican army
left there with their tail between their legs.

116
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,716
Mr. William... she here.

117
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,345
In your office, waitin'.

118
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,349
Your wife.

119
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,191
Mr. Bowie!

120
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,247
- Colonel.
- Buck.

121
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,416
Drunken Hottentot.

122
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,418
Two-bit dandy.

123
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,847
Well, the choices are
abandonment, adultery,

124
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,724
or cruel and barbarous treatment.

125
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,768
I think abandonment's most accurate.

126
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,313
Any of the choices would be appropriate.

127
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,255
You sure you want to do this?

128
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,467
Well, we-we signed the papers.

129
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,636
I meant Charlie.

130
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,975
I don't intend this harshly, but
he should have a male example in his life.

131
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:10,105
I've already made arrangements for him
to stay with a fine family while I'm away.

132
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,527
Well, we have a long way to travel.

133
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,999
Your father's becoming a rich man,

134
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,127
and he'll be able to see to your education.

135
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,817
You're makin' a jackass
outta yourself, Sam.

136
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,491
Vindictive sons of bitches.

137
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,869
Texas... wasted on the Texians.

138
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,207
They'll come back.

139
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,003
The Mexicans.

140
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:19,383
A well-trained army,
against all this handful of amateurs.

141
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,512
Only chance we have
is to fight 'em out in the open.

142
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,597
Forts, they're useless,

143
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,266
useless to us.

144
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,935
What is it about
that damn place, anyway?

145
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,603
What place?

146
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,438
The Alamo.

147
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:38,360
Every time a sour wind blows through,
everybody runs there and hides inside.

148
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,404
Ain't nothin' but mud.

149
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,407
A caved-in church.

150
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,535
And cannon.

151
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,872
Cannon.

152
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,166
Protects my home, Sam.

153
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,669
You don't have no home,

154
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,965
any more than I have.

155
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,767
It's a damn shame about your wife, Jim.

156
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,943
Am I still your general?

157
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,655
You know you are.

158
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,497
I want you to return to the Alamo,
fetch the cannon back.

159
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,791
Will you do that for me?

160
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,962
Will you promise that you'll do that for me?

161
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,967
Yeah.

162
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,935
Now, you mind Mr. and Mrs. Ayers.
Don't go causing any fuss.

163
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,438
When I return,
we'll get a home of our own.

164
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,191
I promise.

165
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,031
"One crowded hour of glorious life

166
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,742
is worth an age without a name."

167
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,086
Jim Bowie's here!

168
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,548
- Know which one he is?
- Right there.

169
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,342
Welcome to San Antonio, Bowie!

170
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,682
- Welcome home, Jim.
- Welcome home, Mr. Bowie.

171
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,976
Welcome home, Jim.

172
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,309
You all right, Mr. James?

173
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,150
I have a home.

174
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,028
Sir?

175
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,975
We know you guys
from somewhere?

176
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,397
Whoo, that one's
pretty dandy, that one.

177
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,192
Halt!

178
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,570
- Have the quartermaster secure billeting.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:35,365
- Where you going, sir?
- I'd like to see what I'm fightin' for.

180
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,451
Dismount!

181
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,528
It was founded as a mission 100 years ago.

182
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,906
The Bexarenos called it the Alamo,
after Alamo de Parras,

183
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:19,159
a Spanish cavalry unit
that moved in 30 years ago.

184
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,579
As you can see, it is not designed
with military intentions.

185
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,373
She's well armed.

186
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,126
Most cannon of any fort
west of the Mississippi.

187
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:34,091
I placed our largest, the 18-pounder, on
the southwest corner, so it fronts the town.

188
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:38,720
The north wall is in ruins, so I have
two batteries with five cannon to defend it.

189
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,724
What was the original convento
is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary.

190
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,561
Major Jameson, our engineer,

191
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:49,481
is emplacing a palisade
between the main gate and the church.

192
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:53,527
- What was here before?
- Nothing. An indefensible flank.

193
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,904
It still appears indefensible.

194
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,950
Good riflemen and a 12-pounder
should hold it.

195
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,287
The church itself wasn't built till 1756.

196
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,331
It has no roof.
Was it destroyed in battle?

197
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,126
The Catholics never quite finished it.

198
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,963
Saints Dominic and Francis.

199
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,923
Francis had two gifts:

200
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,592
prophecy,

201
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,970
and the ability to inspire
passionate devotion.

202
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,769
This fort is the only thing

203
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,148
that stands between Santa Anna's army
and our settlements.

204
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,484
As goes the Alamo...

205
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,948
so goes Texas.

206
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,954
If the need arises, I recommend you take
my personal quarters on the west wall.

207
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,874
They're isolated,
yet near the primary defenses.

208
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,335
I'm afraid I don't understand, sir.

209
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,630
I have personal matters
to attend to in Mina.

210
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,673
I'm leaving you in command.

211
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,636
I know you fought this posting, Travis.

212
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,348
Forting up is not exactly
a cavalryman's dream.

213
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,185
I'll defend it with my life, sir.

214
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,648
Your biggest task will be keeping
the volunteers and the regulars

215
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,567
from killin' one another out of boredom.

216
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,654
The Mexican army would have to cover
300 miles in the dead of winter

217
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,031
to get here before I return.

218
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,860
I got one guy around my neck,
I got another guy takin' off half my ear

219
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,362
- with his one good tooth.

220
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:05,492
The two that I knocked out are now
wakin' up, realizin' who knocked 'em out.

221
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,578
But I'm fine. I'm fine.

222
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,206
'Cause I know I got my trusty, loyal Ward
right next to me.

223
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:14,376
So I turn over my shoulder,
and who do I find?

224
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,129
Tortilla lady
and her 13-year-old hound dog.

225
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,673
Where were ya?

226
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,718
I hate to tell you this, Jim,
but you were in the wrong.

227
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,596
Exactly. That's when I need you the most.

228
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,312
Oh, God. I love this place.

229
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,897
I love it, too.

230
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,940
Colonel?

231
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,818
You look terrible,

232
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:43,697
almost yellow right around
the cheeks and forehead.

233
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,783
You a doctor now,
along with everything else?

234
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,081
I've heard rumor that you plan to destroy
the mission and remove the cannon.

235
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:57,586
- Where'd you hear that?
- Men tend to prattle on when they drink.

236
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,630
Your men tend to drink.

237
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,258
It would be a great mistake.

238
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,304
I agree.

239
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:10,641
And any further discussion on this
will be between myself and Colonel Neill.

240
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,977
Colonel Neill left Bexar this morning
on personal business.

241
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,854
It's my command now.

242
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:22,486
Well, my, my, my.
That is a swift rise, Billy.

243
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:27,491
Might as well break out
those long britches.

244
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,409
Your men exhibit no discipline.

245
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,538
If matters don't change, it will become
my duty, as colonel of this post...

246
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,998
Lieutenant colonel.

247
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,918
Restrain your men... or I will.

248
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,700
Habla ingles. muchachos?

249
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,705
We got 'em, David.

250
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,303
It appears to me
that we're all on the same side here.

251
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,223
What you doin' out here?

252
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,435
My name is David Crockett.

253
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,355
Crockett of Tennessee?
Davy Crockett?

254
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,900
He prefers "David."

255
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,696
Now, there was this little detail
of a re-election back home.

256
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:48,780
Aww!

257
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,283
It's all right. It's all right.

258
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,952
- 'Cause you know what I told them folks?
- What'd you tell 'em?

259
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:57,039
- I said,"You all can go to hell."

260
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,625
- "I'm goin' to Texas!"
- Yeah!

261
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,919
- Welcome to Texas, Davy.
- Thank you, sir.

262
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,464
- Put your mark on it, Mr. Crockett?
- Look out. Let me through here.

263
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,757
Absolutely.

264
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,718
"I'm half alligator, half snappin' turtle."

265
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,597
"I can slide off a rainbow and
jump the Mississippi in a single leap."

266
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:17,226
Tell 'em, Davy,
how you can whup your weight in wildcats.

267
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,102
I seen you onstage.

268
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,938
Well, that wasn't me.

269
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,941
Why... Why, sure it was.

270
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:28,779
No, sir, that was just an actor in a play.
He was performin' a character.

271
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,781
Aw, come on, Davy.
Say the lines.

272
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,617
Davy Crockett, the Lion of the West.

273
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,454
I dare San-tanna to show his face
now you're here.

274
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,792
Well, I understood the fightin' was over.

275
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,003
Ain't it?

276
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,953
iAlto!

277
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,269
iFuego!

278
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,733
Well done.

279
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:20,117
You don't have the sand to even talk
to two of my men, much less arrest them.

280
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,035
I told you I intended
to restore order.

281
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,997
You've got no command
over my volunteers. None.

282
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,832
I have absolute command.

283
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,918
Break 'em out, boys.

284
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,671
Yeah.

285
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:36,925
'Cause it's gonna be a cold day in hell
anybody takes orders from a debtor

286
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,012
who leaves his pregnant wife
in the middle of the night.

287
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:43,182
How about a land swindler
who marries a girl, God rest her soul,

288
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,017
for her father's money?

289
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,478
Whoa, whoa, fellers!
Hey, hey, hey, fellers, now, listen.

290
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,148
Just 'cause we ain't got nobody to fight
don't mean we need to fight one another.

291
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:54,484
Congressman Crockett has a point.
We should do this democratically.

292
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:58,822
A vote.

293
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:03,327
- What about Colonel Crockett leadin' us?
- No, I'm with you fellers, not above you.

294
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,503
All for the lieutenant colonel,
raise your hand.

295
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:24,014
Now, come on, men. No repercussions.

296
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,143
All in favor of me commanding.

297
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,023
And all for me?

298
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,368
All right.

299
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:51,792
You can command the militia only.
Regulars can't be led by a volunteer.

300
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,710
It's illegal.

301
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:04,263
You don't like the outcome,
you change the rule?

302
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,390
Is that it, Buck?

303
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:12,104
Aw, don't fret about it, Jim.
We all know who's in charge.

304
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,176
You know, I don't know why
we had to tent up outside of town

305
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:47,181
when there are so many fine houses
with big corn-husk beds just sittin' empty.

306
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,974
Why are they empty?

307
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:53,103
Apparently some of the folks hereabouts
seem to think the Mexicans is comin' back.

308
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:58,942
Most of the boys think they wouldn't be
here till late spring if they come at all.

309
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:05,449
- Figure they know something we don't?
- Mijito. cierre la puerta y ven para aca.

310
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,412
Tell me what is going on!

311
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,385
We'll never be able to defend the town.

312
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,846
Orderly withdrawal
into the Alamo.

313
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,389
- Greys fall in!
- Close up!

314
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:14,142
Shoulder arms! Forward! Forward!

315
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,769
Orderly withdrawal!

316
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,731
Please proceed to the Alamo in an orderly
manner. Don't run. You're fine.

317
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:22,860
- Almeron!
- One, two, one, two.

318
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,570
Almeron!

319
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,196
Susanna!

320
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,231
Let's go, men!

321
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,567
Come on! Follow me!

322
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,534
Come on!

323
00:33:55,494 --> 00:34:00,499
Colonel? I'm sorry to disturb you,
but we got quite a mare's nest out here.

324
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:03,669
I have to get couriers out
while there's still time.

325
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:07,130
You and your men
will defend the palisade.

326
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:11,385
The palisade? You talkin' about
that little old bunch of sticks over there?

327
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:14,346
You prefer a different assignment?

328
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,810
No, that's the one
I was gonna put in for.

329
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,604
If you could oversee manning the walls,
it would be a help.

330
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,815
We should have six men to a cannon,
18 tubes,

331
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,442
- which works out to...
- 108 men.

332
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:31,613
And we should have a man with a musket
every four feet of wall.

333
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,657
We're gonna need more men.

334
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,775
iViva Santa Anna! iViva Mexico!

335
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:18,178
To Gonzales, and
to Colonel Fannin at Goliad. Godspeed.

336
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:19,555
Sir.

337
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,099
Colonel, you should see this.

338
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:10,189
We're gonna need a lotmore men.

339
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,323
What is Colonel Bowie doing
on the bridge?

340
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,575
Tryin' to talk us out of the spot we're in.

341
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,577
Fire the 18-pounder.

342
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,831
- Sir?
- You heard me.

343
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,875
Fire the cannon.

344
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,710
Prime the gun.

345
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,179
Fire!

346
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:53,273
Lo siento. Manuel.
I had nothing to do with this.

347
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,207
You out of your mind?

348
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,292
- I'm trying to get us a truce!
- A truce?

349
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:16,129
If we broker a cessation, we will do so
from a position of strength, not weakness.

350
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:20,133
- Goddamn!
- We don't turn belly up and beg.

351
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,679
Otherwise, we have said nothing,
and this conflict means nothing.

352
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,640
Dyin'for nothin' means shit to me.

353
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:32,187
- Their response?
- Shit!

354
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:35,065
David.

355
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:43,323
Surrender at discretion... Buck.

356
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,410
Perhaps, Colonel,
they'll only execute the officers.

357
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:49,204
I think we all just got promoted.

358
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,792
Looky here.

359
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,735
Within a few days
all of Texas will know our situation.

360
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,486
Tell me, Buck,

361
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,488
in Alabama,

362
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:26,867
precisely how many is "a few"?

363
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,273
No. Excelencia.

364
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:08,992
Ah.

365
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,207
Crockett?

366
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,335
Si. Alteza.

367
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,587
iExcelente!

368
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,705
You know, personally, David,

369
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:57,791
I'd just as soon take my chances
fightin' out in the open.

370
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:02,004
Hell, I don't like being hemmed in
any more than you do, but here we sit.

371
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,673
Avoid cluster at all times.

372
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,300
Keep your eyes set for crossfire.

373
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,136
Pack plenty of grease wrap balls,
put 'em in your blocks.

374
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,680
You may be a-firin' fast, but not yet.

375
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:15,184
Load all your muskets and stack 'em,
but don't powder 'em.

376
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:19,563
Ten minutes in this, they'll be
nothin' but sticks, understand? Oh...

377
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,149
And no more of this, by anybody.

378
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,234
Go to it, boys.

379
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,698
- Here we go, sir.

380
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:33,493
Come on, let me help you.
That's right.

381
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,913
- Take it in.

382
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,585
It burns.

383
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,462
- But, sir...
- That's it.

384
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,966
I smell like a skunk's ass.

385
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,389
Jim, what ails you, exactly?

386
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,558
Consumption.

387
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,393
Typhoid. Pneumonia.

388
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,270
One or all.

389
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,064
Exactly.

390
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,254
She's a dandy, all right.

391
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,554
That knife fight you got into,
sand bar over in Natchez...

392
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,098
It was the one that got you written up.

393
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,101
That all true?

394
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,314
You believe everything you read now?

395
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,193
I didn't read it, I heard it.

396
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:51,697
And the way I heard it,
he put a sword cane and two shots in you.

397
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,283
I don't remember.

398
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,589
Figure ol' Sam will be
down here pretty soon.

399
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,552
When he gets here,
we'll have a good ol' time.

400
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,811
It was three shots.

401
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,856
Sword came through my lung
and went through my hand,

402
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,399
and then I cut his heart out.

403
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,488
Those ain't bears out there.

404
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,618
Do you understand that... Davy?

405
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,585
Why in the hell do you suppose
they don't just attack us?

406
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:55,677
I seen vaqueros spend all day long
just killin' one bull.

407
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:22,079
You bring a band, you're countin' on
havin' something to celebrate.

408
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,640
Mighty nice of'em to serenade us like this.

409
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:46,520
It's a cavalry march, but I'm told
Santa Anna fancies it for other uses.

410
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:50,065
He borrowed it from the Spaniards,
the Spaniards from the Moors.

411
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,987
- It's called "Deguello."
- Kinda pretty.

412
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:58,115
Deguello means "slit throat."

413
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:02,119
Now, ain't that pretty.

414
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,304
Get down! Get down!

415
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,141
iFuego!

416
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,525
iFuego! iFuego!

417
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,152
Fire!

418
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:43,785
Watch the north wall!

419
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,997
iFuego! iFuego!

420
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,876
Keep your heads down, boys!

421
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,127
iFuego!

422
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,510
iFuego!

423
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,346
iFuego!

424
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,598
iFuego!

425
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,352
Mornin'.

426
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:35,314
Mornin'.

427
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:36,607
Yes, sir.

428
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,902
Lieutenant, check the main gate for me.
I need a head count for Jim Bowie.

429
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:40,944
Yes, sir.

430
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:07,262
Notice how you can't really hear it

431
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,515
until it stops?

432
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:15,521
Until they decide to attack, I suspect
we'll be bombarded on a nightly basis.

433
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,940
Deprive us of sleep.

434
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:23,904
They want you to
start seeing ghosts everywhere.

435
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:29,952
Colonel, I became a little heated with you
in front of your men.

436
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,621
It was ill-advised
and not terribly professional.

437
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:34,998
Don't worry about it.

438
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:40,087
Most of my men didn't even understand
the words you were usin'.

439
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:45,133
It's important that you and I agree.

440
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:50,347
For me, though we are poorly supplied,
surrender is not an option.

441
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:55,519
I submit that we engage and delay
until reinforcements arrive.

442
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:06,738
Sometimes, it's just the way
you say things, Travis, that's all.

443
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:11,785
I swear to God.

444
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:18,250
Bring it down! Down! Down! Down!

445
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,376
Down!

446
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,879
Down! Down!

447
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:24,298
To the left. To the left.

448
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,799
In.

449
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,388
Do you notice anything different
about them cannon?

450
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:39,062
They moved 'em closer last night.

451
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,982
This will be the spot.

452
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:43,942
As our well is dryin',

453
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:47,279
anytime you find yourselves
not busy with other matters,

454
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:50,490
I need you to be diggin' a new one here.

455
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:59,499
Ain't bad enough we got to fetch 'em
the water. Now we got to find it for 'em, too.

456
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:06,465
David, you said you wanted to see him.

457
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:07,841
There he is,

458
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:10,761
the Napoleon of the West.

459
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,346
Which one?

460
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,267
- That's Santa Anna?
- Yeah.

461
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,395
He's quite the peacock, isn't he?

462
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,889
Wind kicked up.

463
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,769
ilnfanteria! Saquen sus canones.

464
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,201
iFuego!

465
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,136
Go back! Take cover!

466
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:21,099
Take that ball to Captain Dickinson.

467
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:27,356
We can reuse it.

468
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:30,734
You'll be pickin' that up yourself.

469
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,435
Well, I'll be.

470
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,488
- Cut it to shot and send it back to 'em.
- Yes, sir.

471
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,328
Fire the cannon.

472
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,623
Fire!

473
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:38,677
Fire once from each cannon!

474
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,237
You heard the colonel.

475
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,994
Lieutenant colonel, Colonel.

476
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,504
- You heard the man. Let's give 'em a taste!
- Let's give 'em hell!

477
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,362
Come on, get up here!

478
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:39,863
And fire!

479
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,369
Fire!

480
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,707
- Fire!
- Fire!

481
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:59,132
At this very moment our soldiers are held
in the Alamo against a force of thousands.

482
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:02,302
They put their hopes in Colonel Fannin.
who. despite his pedigree.

483
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:05,305
has proven himself ill-equipped to lead.
much less march. an army.

484
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,349
This is from Colonel Travis.

485
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,228
"I call on you in the name of liberty

486
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,106
to come to our aid with all dispatch."

487
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,275
"If this call is neglected,

488
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,945
I am determined to sustain myself
as long as possible

489
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,572
and die like a soldier,

490
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:26,577
who never forgets what is due
to his own honor and that of his country:

491
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,954
victory or death."

492
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,340
Gentlemen...

493
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,972
I will raise an army.

494
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,933
We will relieve the Alamo.

495
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:53,270
But only after
we have declared independence

496
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,398
and created a government
that can be legally recognized

497
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,651
by all the nations of the world.

498
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:06,533
That... is what every besieged man
in the Alamo is fighting for.

499
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:10,245
We have no idea
if any of our couriers made it out.

500
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:14,666
- You know the land and the language.
- You are asking me to leave my men.

501
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,795
I'm asking you to deliver a message
to Houston and return with a response.

502
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:21,924
I'm ordering it.

503
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,227
Don't give him too much water.

504
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,730
He's just like me.
He drinks too much, he ain't worth a damn.

505
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,524
I'll bring him back to you, Santiago.

506
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:39,900
You bring yourself back.

507
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,237
Captain... go with God.

508
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,032
Makes a man ponder
the possibilities, don't it?

509
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,036
What happened to your cap?

510
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:35,873
Crawl away?

511
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,503
No. I only wear it when it's extra cold.

512
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:51,847
The truth is,
I only started wearing that thing...

513
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,434
because of that feller
in that play they did about me.

514
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,275
People expect things.

515
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:07,321
Ain't it so.

516
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:13,911
- Can I ask you something?
- All right.

517
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,459
Now, which was tougher,

518
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:25,005
jumping the Mississippi
or riding that lightning bolt?

519
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,516
Can you catch a cannonball?

520
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:46,527
If it was just me,
simple old David from Tennessee,

521
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,240
I might drop over that wall
some night and take my chances.

522
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,706
But that Davy Crockett feller,
they're all watchin' him.

523
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:06,004
He's been on these walls
every day of his life.

524
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,895
He's burning with fever.

525
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,481
Try to get him to drink
something not whiskey.

526
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:27,818
Sam, get me some sheets
and cold mud.

527
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,991
I have issued orders for Colonel Fannin
to retreat from Goliad.

528
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,660
John Forbes is mustering more men
throughout South Texas

529
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,370
and bringing them to Gonzales.

530
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:41,123
I expect 1500 men
to be there when I arrive.

531
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:44,626
We will march out,
circumventing Santa Anna's army,

532
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,171
and relieve the Alamo from the west,

533
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:50,007
withdrawing back to the Colorado

534
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,970
and establishing on a line southeast
from Beason's Crossing to Brazoria.

535
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:57,014
You will have command
of the regular army.

536
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,349
The militias will have their own command.

537
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:03,478
No. I will command all or none.

538
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,825
You do your calling, and I shall do mine.

539
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,660
I will lead an army.

540
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,083
You will birth a nation.

541
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:27,169
Gentlemen, to Texas!

542
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:29,379
To Texas!

543
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:50,901
Here they come! Here they come!

544
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:53,695
Position the cannon!

545
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,366
Muster!

546
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:12,339
Move back! Move back!

547
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,595
They're measuring our strength.

548
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:22,057
Prepare yourselves.

549
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,517
Fire at will, gentlemen!

550
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,914
Captain Dickinson!

551
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:48,584
Aim! Fire!

552
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,686
Run, you rabbits, run!

553
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:14,193
Them jacales out there
offer pretty good cover.

554
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:17,196
I wouldn't mind stretching my legs.

555
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:28,332
- Burn 'em down.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

556
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:31,460
Get that first one, right there.

557
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:50,604
Agh!

558
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,648
Arrgh!

559
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,571
What's your name, boy?

560
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:03,719
Oh, yeah, Davy. Thatta boy!

561
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,103
Fine shootin', boy.

562
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,148
Muy bien. Muy bien. Muy bien.

563
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,763
Watch the north wall!

564
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,867
Over there.

565
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:51,910
What are they working at?

566
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:13,724
When they come over those walls,

567
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:17,436
I want you to throw up your hands
and holler,

568
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,732
"Soy negro. No disparo."

569
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,275
What's that?

570
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,570
Mexican law said
there ain't no slaves, right?

571
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:29,990
- Yeah.
- And contract or no, that's what you is.

572
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:34,119
Now, the Mexicans see your color, you
tell 'em,"Don't shoot." They pass you by.

573
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:36,413
But Mr. William,
he gonna give me a gun, and I'll...

574
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:40,959
You clean up their shit, you take care of
their horses, you wash 'em, you feed 'em.

575
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:44,213
Damn if you ain't gonna die for 'em, too.

576
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:00,020
Where is everybody?

577
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:03,273
30 men from here in Gonzales
have already left for the Alamo.

578
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:04,983
Assemble the men that we have.

579
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,454
We need more men.

580
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,084
If they arrive every day,
soon we will have enough.

581
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,461
But for now, we wait.

582
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:27,422
If we can't run, we walk.
If we can't walk, we crawl.

583
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:30,592
But we gotta go to the aid of those boys.
It's only right.

584
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,886
General, I'm the man who left Travis there.

585
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,764
I do not enjoy waiting
any more than the next man,

586
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:38,559
but I will not sacrifice Texas.

587
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:44,731
These 124 men cannot pierce
an army of thousands.

588
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:49,236
Colonel Fannin is en route from Goliad
with 400 men.

589
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,698
These troops need training.
