1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,216
Order in the court. Quiet, please. No talking.

3
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,454
Divorce court,
city of Chicago, is still in session.

4
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,521
Michael Robert Gilhooley, plaintiff,
versus Edna Mae Gilhooley, defendant.

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,032
That's you, Harrigan.

6
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,430
That's us.

7
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,166
- Just leave everything to me.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,708
Order in the court. Quiet down.

9
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,168
Michael Robert Gilhooley
brings suit for divorce

10
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,512
against and asks damages from
Edna Mae Gilhooley, his wife of five years.

11
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,951
- Go ahead, Harrigan.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,319
It should please the court to know,
that my learned colleague,

13
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,325
Mr. Morgan, has informed
me that his client, Mrs. Gilhooley,

14
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,657
has finally responded to subpoena

15
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,028
and is at this very moment
waiting in the waiting room.

16
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,593
- Well, why don't you call her, Harrigan?
- Yes, I will.

17
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,638
So as not to waste
the court's time, Your Honor,

18
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,367
I would like at this juncture
to call Edna Mae Gilhooley,

19
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,571
who has inflicted such cruel
and inhuman punishment upon my client

20
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,046
and lay bare all the sordid facts.

21
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,447
Cruel and inhuman?

22
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,248
- Any objections, Morgan?
- None whatsoever, Your Honor.

23
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,385
Call Mrs. Gilhooley.

24
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,019
Mrs. Gilhooley.

25
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,120
Do you, Edna Mae Gilhooley,
solemnly swear to tell the truth,

26
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,383
the whole truth,
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

27
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,981
I do.

28
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,651
Get going, Harrigan.

29
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,930
Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.

30
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,932
- Mrs. Gilhooley.
- Yes, sir?

31
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,511
Your Honor.

32
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:40,477
I have not as yet discussed this
with my client,

33
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,056
but I'm going to recommend to him
that he drop his charges

34
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,493
and throw himself on the mercy of the court.

35
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,499
That, Mr. Harrigan, is a wise,
if not very lucrative, decision.

36
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,899
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Hey!

37
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,629
You forgot your hat.

38
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,197
The bailiff will now attempt to assist
Mr. Harrigan as he runs from the courtroom.

39
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,733
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Case dismissed.

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,850
- Hey, Leo, what are you doing?
- Practicing law.

41
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,475
Hey, little rat!

42
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:29,092
- Hey! I'm gonna get you this time.
- I'm sorry.

43
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,464
Dirty son of a...

44
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,758
We'll murder you in court, Cobb.

45
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,061
Come around here again
and I might lose my temper.

46
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,101
Did you say court? As it happens, I'm a...

47
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,488
- Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,926
Excuse me.

49
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,344
Yeah, well at least
they didn't get the camera.

50
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,143
How? What I want to know is how.

51
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,846
- A spy!
- A spy!

52
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,684
- Seize that man.
- Seize that man!

53
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,950
No, I'm not. I was just looking...

54
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,925
- Please, you're making a terrible mistake.
- Lousy, maggoty Patents Company spies.

55
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,553
You bastards ain't going to force
H.H. Cobb out of pictures.

56
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,029
Saw what happened
to your hired thugs, didn't you?

57
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,963
I'm a lawyer. I have a card.

58
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,398
- Where are my writers?
- Writers!

59
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,868
- Tell him how tough I am!
- You're making a terrible mistake.

60
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,461
- What's the matter, Mr. Cobb?
- Tell him.

61
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,438
- Tell him what?
- How tough he is.

62
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,237
- Please, I can explain.
- I hear a trolley. Steve.

63
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,641
- Steve!
- H.H. Cobb's so tough he eats nails.

64
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,303
- And spits battleships.
- Quiet!

65
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,904
Why, you're not from the Patents Company.

66
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,642
- No, sir.
- You don't look dangerous enough.

67
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,842
I'm a lawyer, sir.

68
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,385
We're heading into the bush country, men.

69
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,352
- Get my snake-bite puttees.
- Puttees!

70
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,218
L. Taylor Harrigan, sir, attorney at law.

71
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,417
Get it figured out, boys.
Come on, I'm falling asleep.

72
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,652
- My card.
- Here, Chief.

73
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,125
We just can't get past
the jail scene, Mr. Cobb.

74
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,025
Well, get past it.
Tell me how she loses her teeth.

75
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,188
Does she have to?

76
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,198
- That's what I have to know.
- Lose her teeth?

77
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,528
Of course, she has to lose her teeth.

78
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,796
If she doesn't lose her teeth,
the story has no bite.

79
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,770
Teeth, bite. That's pretty good.
Write that down, somebody.

80
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,567
- Got it.
- Wanna get in pictures, I suppose?

81
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,631
Me? No, sir. I'm a lawyer.
I couldn't help noticing

82
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,438
that little altercation you had back there.

83
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,106
Well, the first thing that came into my head
is, "There's a man in need of counsel."

84
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,842
- First thing, eh?
- Yes, sir.

85
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,645
Now, what about those
pictures you were talking about?

86
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,083
Pictures? Moving pictures.

87
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,621
Galloping tintypes, Muldoon.
Haven't you ever been to a nickelodeon?

88
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,350
- Harrigan.
- Nickelodeon.

89
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,688
Ah, yes. And this Patents Company?

90
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,561
It's not one company, Horace.

91
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,565
It's all these big motion picture companies,
ganged up together against us little ones.

92
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,691
Ah, yes.

93
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,326
Claim that they've got
a patent on all the cameras.

94
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,701
The truth is, they don't
want us blanket companies making pictures.

95
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,205
- The trolley's waiting, Mr. Cobb.
- Blanket companies?

96
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,040
- Independents, Clancy. Pay attention.
- Harrigan, sir.

97
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,806
- What?
- Harrigan, sir.

98
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,643
H-A double R-I-G-A-N.
Like the man in the song.

99
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,380
What song?

100
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,921
By George M. Cohan, sir. It's a big hit.

101
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,890
We don't need singers, O'Halloran,
this is war.

102
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,327
- We don't need singers.
- Come on, we're going after him.

103
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,991
- Hold this a second, will you, kid?
- Yeah. Say, where are you people going?

104
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,865
How's this? The old lady faints dead away
when she sees her nephew?

105
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,905
- He shouldn't be her nephew.
- Mr. Cobb...

106
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,065
- What should he be then?
- Mr. Cobb, it sounds to me...

107
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,700
- Why do you ask me?
- ...as if a trust has been formed.

108
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,007
- You're darn right, it's a trust.
- Involving these patents.

109
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,979
- He could be an Indian.
- No Indians.

110
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,538
- You just said the guy was Indian.
- You just said he was!

111
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,516
I'm prepared to take the position

112
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:42,079
that this Patents Company is an
unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade.

113
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,085
I've had three lawyers, son,
and they all told me the same thing.

114
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,718
But I like the way you announce it.

115
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,463
Hold everything!
I think the Wild Man's got something.

116
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,500
- He's turning blue again.
- I beg your pardon?

117
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,001
Come on, Waldo, spit it out.

118
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,563
He's on a...

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,235
- Yes, yes. Get this down, quick!
- I'm getting it, sir.

120
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,007
...ledge, 20 stories up, with...

121
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,946
Come on, Waldo, you're doing great.

122
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:14,647
...his pajamas on, and...

123
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,714
Just a little more, Waldo. Squeeze it out.

124
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:24,527
And a live crab in his pants!

125
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,860
He's done it again.

126
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,458
God, why can't I get writers
to think like that?

127
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,004
- I wouldn't know.
- What's he doing on the ledge?

128
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,596
- Don't nitpick!
- And who is he?

129
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,163
- Nitpick!
- Yeah. Who is he?

130
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,974
Drama! What we've got is laughs and drama,
an irresistible combination.

131
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,741
Thank you, Waldo. Take a rest.

132
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,342
- I don't like the crab.
- He doesn't like the crab.

133
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,285
- Well...
- That crab is pure genius.

134
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,219
All we gotta do is
figure out how it got there.

135
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,417
- And who he is.
- Yeah, who is he, H.H.?

136
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,982
That's for you to tell me.

137
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,858
Come on, for heaven's sake.
This is embarrassing.

138
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,591
He could be a ranger.

139
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,557
What did you say?

140
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,969
- Oh, nothing.
- Yes, you did. You said ranger.

141
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,666
- I'm sorry.
- That's it!

142
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,607
- Is it?
- What is he to the girl?

143
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,702
He could be the girl's cousin.

144
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,610
- She's his cousin?
- He's her cousin.

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,444
- Better yet.
- Isn't that the same thing?

146
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,814
Don't interrupt. The man is inspired.

147
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,012
Go on, McDougall. Don't stop now.
You're hot.

148
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,918
- They're in love, of course.
- Of course.

149
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,217
- Madly.
- Madly.

150
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,521
I like it! Keep it coming, kid.
What's he do about it?

151
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,464
What does he do about it? He...
He kidnaps her.

152
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,261
And the old lady can't stand the thought!

153
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,270
He's a forest ranger. That's how he gets
the crab in his pants in a river.

154
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,171
Forget the crab a minute.
Then what happens?

155
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,905
- Then what happens?
- This is it, last stop.

156
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,468
That's us, Mullins.
Now, write it all down, figure out the finish,

157
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,980
- and I'll pay you ten for it.
- $10?

158
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,711
All right, $15. Start writing, don't delay.
Now, make it juicy, print legibly!

159
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,312
Go on, get going. What are you waiting for?
You're working for Kinegraph.

160
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,383
Make it seven or eight scenes.
Two for the beginning,

161
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,328
three in the middle, two for the finish.
Three if it's a real lollapalooza.

162
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,958
- Three if it's a real... $15 cash?
- On the barrelhead!

163
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,797
Last stop. Everybody out!

164
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,729
- Mr. Cobb, where...
- Drop it by the office.

165
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,367
But... Oh. Oh, dear.

166
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,092
- I beg your pardon.
- Oh, that's all right.

167
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,718
I beg your pardon.

168
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,026
Two for the beginning,
three for the middle... Excuse me.

169
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,298
- Say, are you all right?
- Three if it's a real...

170
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,394
- What?
- Lollapalooza.

171
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,630
- Hello.
- Hello.

172
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,166
- You fell down.
- I do all the time. I'm blind as a rat.

173
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,907
- Why didn't I help you?
- You were talking to yourself.

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,970
All aboard.

175
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,815
- Do you live here in Chicago?
- Not anymore. I'm going to New York City.

176
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,909
When?

177
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,614
- Now.
- Now? Wait!

178
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,021
- What's your name?
- Kathleen Cooke. What's yours?

179
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,822
- Leo Harrigan. H-A double R-I...
- Like the man in the song.

180
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,490
Yeah.

181
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,271
Beg your pardon. I beg your pardon.

182
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,825
- I beg your pardon.
- Sorry.

183
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,225
- No, I beg your...
- No, it's my...

184
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,957
...pardon.

185
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,054
...fault.

186
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,065
Are you with the Chautauqua?
I'm looking for the Chautauqua.

187
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,628
No, ma'am.
I'm just off the train from Sopchoppy.

188
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,230
- China?
- No, ma'am. Florida.

189
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,572
Everybody thinks that though.
Can I help you up?

190
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,612
Aren't you kind.

191
00:12:58,678 --> 00:12:59,873
Who's that Indian fellow you're looking for?

192
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,107
- Indian fellow?
- Chickawa?

193
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,273
- Chautauqua.
- Yeah.

194
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,613
It's a theatrical tour
and we're all leaving on the train tonight.

195
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,084
Oh, that's too bad.
Let me help you find him.

196
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,054
You're very considerate.
I hope I'm not taking you out of your way.

197
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,215
Not at all, ma'am.

198
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,522
I couldn't find my glasses, so I'm late.
It's my first real job in the show business.

199
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,725
Do you ride in the circus?

200
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,320
- Why would you say that?
- Your suit.

201
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,491
Oh, no, ma'am. I don't ride at all.
I hate horses.

202
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,898
- But you are in show business, aren't you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,369
I used to run all the alligator fights
down in Sopchoppy.

204
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,373
- You fought alligators?
- Holy sailor, no, not me.

205
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,467
I used to introduce the alligators
to the Indians, then get out of the way.

206
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,138
I come up north here to make my fortune
in the clothing business.

207
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,875
Cooke! Kathleen Cooke!
Come on, you're late!

208
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,883
There they are. Well, thank you, Mr...

209
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,613
Tom Greenway, but everybody
down in Sopchoppy calls me Buck.

210
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,918
- Okay, Buck, what do you want?
- Goodbye, Mr. Greenway.

211
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,390
So long, Miss Cooke. Hold on a second.

212
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,188
Look, I'm trying to locate a fellow
who lives here

213
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,855
that goes by the name
of Mr. Hoot de Longpre.

214
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,091
- No, he doesn't.
- Ain't this the Hotel Rialto?

215
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,533
No, it's the Rialto, and Mr. de Longpre
left last week for the rodeo.

216
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,799
But, see, this fellow
down in Yeehaw Junction gave me $20

217
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,933
to deliver this here saddle
to Mr. Hoot de Longpre at the Hotel Rialto.

218
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,443
Now, what the heck am I going to do now?

219
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,380
- Oh, Mr. Greenway, good luck. Break an arm.
- She means break a leg.

220
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,648
- Why I got to break anything?
- Obviously not in show business.

221
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,822
- Cowboy, you working?
- What?

222
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,795
- You working, cowboy?
- You Mr. Hoot de Longpre?

223
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,355
No, I'm with the Clansman Company
over at the New Amsterdam Theatre.

224
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,197
- Hey, can you ride a horse?
- Why?

225
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,964
'Cause we got a show on right now
and our only horseman

226
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,201
got drunk last night and broke his leg.
Can you ride or not?

227
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,208
- How much does it pay?
- $10.

228
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,403
$10? In advance?

229
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:43,041
- Okay. You better know how to ride a horse.
- Mister, that's my middle name.

230
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:50,250
- What on earth are you going to do, sir?
- Find the fiend who did this crime.

231
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,258
- But there's no trace of him there.
- We shall see.

232
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:56,057
I believe a glass of sufficient power
will reveal on the retina of those dead eyes

233
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,031
the image of the killer
as though etched in fire!

234
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,500
- You mean...
- Yes! Impressions remain on the brain

235
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,231
like words written on paper
with invisible ink!

236
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,795
The fire-etched record...

237
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,967
- Mr. Dinsdale, Louie found a rider.
- Don't shout. Be quiet.

238
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,236
What? Speak up.

239
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,641
- Louie found a rider.
- Where? Bring him in.

240
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,906
- He's coming.
- Can we make it?

241
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:13,969
- There he is.
- Barely.

242
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,344
- Get ready for the ride.
- Ready to ride.

243
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,610
- Double time.
- And double it.

244
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,446
- Howdy, fellows.
- What are you, in the circus?

245
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,951
Ever ride in a show before?

246
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,009
Put me on the animal
and point me the right way.

247
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,180
50 seconds, Mr. D.

248
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,917
- 50 seconds.
- Hey, this must be my costume, huh?

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,619
If you fall off or get hurt, Circus,
don't expect no extra pay.

250
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,661
And if you get killed,
we don't supply the funeral.

251
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,663
- Get him on!
- That's mighty encouraging, sir.

252
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,132
- Climb on, hurry up.
- Yes, sir. Here I go. Howdy, old stinker.

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,327
- Cyclone.
- Cyclone?

254
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,166
- Hey, mister, other side!
- The other side?

255
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,435
- Oh, left-handed horse, huh?
- Where did you find this dude?

256
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,702
Hurry up, boys, get him on.

257
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,676
- Riding's his middle name, sir.
- What I got to do?

258
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,576
- Just stay on that treadmill.
- Wait a second.

259
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,275
- The horse knows what to do.
- Hold it a second. What treadmill?

260
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,977
- On the stage.
- How do I see out of this contraption?

261
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,077
- Cross. Cross.
- Cross. Cross.

262
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,712
- Cross?
- Through the eye-hole, stupid.

263
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,882
- Hold on a second.
- Wave it around!

264
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,619
- Hold on a second!
- Horse!

265
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,962
How do you get off this thing?

266
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,903
Stop, horsey.
Blizzard, stop. Hurricane. Rain.

267
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,144
For you.

268
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,737
Howdy, ma'am.
A fellow gave me this here card last night.

269
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,274
And a person wrote on the back of it that I...

270
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,243
I could come over to this here bakery
and earn some money,

271
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:29,772
if I was to ask for a German bagel.

272
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,732
We're going in the back and have a bagel.

273
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,188
In. In. In.

274
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,857
In.

275
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,231
You are here what? Your name is why?

276
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,403
My name is Buck Greenway, sir.
And a fellow gave me this here card.

277
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,773
- What you all doing here, anyway?
- Bread-baking.

278
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,829
Look, I'll just be on my way.
No hard feelings.

279
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,457
- Hold it!
- Don't move!

280
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,441
You will ride for us. $10.

281
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,272
$10?

282
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,312
Let me get this straight.

283
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:10,874
You all want me
to deliver your bread on a horse for $10?

284
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,885
- No, no, horse in pictures.
- Pitchers?

285
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,147
- Yeah.
- Pitchers of what? Milk?

286
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,415
- Milk?
- Milk pitchers.

287
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,684
No, no. Movie pictures.

288
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,588
Bang! Bang!

289
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,193
You don't understand English?

290
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,958
- You want me to ride a horse?
- Yes.

291
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,624
Well, okay, that's my middle name.

292
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,329
No, I ain't feared of nothing.
And I can shoot real good, too.

293
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,202
Hey, you all are German, ain't you?

294
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,472
Why you wearing that suit,
stupid Mr. Horse?

295
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,569
Well, these are just my dress clothes.

296
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,581
I got my working clothes over here.
I'll show 'em to you.

297
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,881
Yeah.

298
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,716
These ain't my clothes.

299
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,124
Out of the way. Hit it again. Out of the way.
Now get in there.

300
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,286
Miss Cooke.

301
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,796
- Let's go. Come on.
- Find the damn cameras!

302
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,525
Smash these tanks.

303
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,864
Come on, tear the place apart, here.
Smash these tanks.

304
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,200
- You Patents Company bastards!
- Get out of the way!

305
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,099
Now, those are my clothes.

306
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,803
Hey, wait a minute!
That saddle don't belong to me.

307
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,579
Come on, tear the place apart, here.
Smash these tanks.

308
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,545
- Check that closet out there.
- I think I found it.

309
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,824
The man killed a box.
I'm gonna get out of here.

310
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,207
- What was that?
- Good job, sport.

311
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,887
That takes care of everything.
The place is wrecked. Let's go.

312
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,582
Mike, help this man with his things.

313
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,351
Come on boys, wake up.
Fellow, you're swell.

314
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,916
- Let's go before things get out of hand.
- You the law?

315
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,427
We're the Patents Company, fellow.

316
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,827
- This your saddle?
- This your suitcase?

317
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,660
- Is that your hat?
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

318
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,755
These are my clothes.

319
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,597
Come on, we might got a place
in our organization for a big guy like you.

320
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,263
- You like to travel? Can you shoot?
- That's my middle name.

321
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,007
Stop, this is terrible.
My mother could do better.

322
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,808
- I've got another one.
- Bring her in then.

323
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,007
You're just used to it.

324
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,448
The hell I am.
What's it look like to you, Harrigan?

325
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,578
- What? I wasn't watching.
- Ah, you see? It smells.

326
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,848
I tell you what you do, Herbert.

327
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,890
Take the first sequence,
put it where the second one is,

328
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,357
and take the third sequence,
put it where the first one was.

329
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,791
But that won't make any sense.

330
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,728
No, but it'll get a laugh.
And that makes sense. Dollars and cents.

331
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,164
Call it <i>The Tell-Tale Knife,</i> kid, better title.

332
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,293
- Lights! Go on.
- Whatever you say.

333
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,669
Don't sulk, Herbert. It's not manly.
Everybody's temperamental.

334
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:50,232
Watch out what you say about my mother!
Now, give me drama with pathos.

335
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,938
Give me a story with heart-throbs.
Shatter the nerves.

336
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,447
I said pastrami, not spaghetti!

337
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,538
Albert, H.H.

338
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,517
<i>- H.H. How are you, Boss?</i>
- Make it snappy. I'm writing a scenario.

339
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,714
Feed Waldo and give me a ginger beer.

340
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,154
- How'd you hear?
<i>- Telegram.</i>

341
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,556
- Telegram? Who sent it?
<i>- Oh, that's Chauncey Wheelock.</i>

342
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,685
- Wheelock.
<i>- Yeah, the director, Wheelock.</i>

343
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,094
I knew I never should have sent
that Irish son of a bitch out there.

344
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,791
- No offense, kid.
<i>- What do you want me to do about it, Boss?</i>

345
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,630
Oh, let me chew on this. I'll get back to you.

346
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,000
He's turning blue, Mr. Cobb.

347
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,906
Not now, Waldo,
I can't do two things at once.

348
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,809
- I'm choking.
- Not now!

349
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,983
I sent those idiots out to California so
they could capture on moving picture film

350
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,487
scenes of historical association
and natural loveliness,

351
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,421
so they'd be free of these
goddamn Patents Company hooligans

352
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,355
that I have to put up with every day.
And what happens?

353
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,552
- What happens?
- What happens?

354
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,562
I'm telling you, for Pete's sake.
Keep your shirt on.

355
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,565
What happens is that for three weeks

356
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:50,797
we have received no film from California,
not one foot.

357
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,971
- I have made a decision.
- You hate the story.

358
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,339
- You!
- You hate me.

359
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,605
How would you like to make 30 a week,
plus expenses?

360
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,614
- Thirty dollars?
- All right, 35. Not a penny more!

361
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,979
Mr. Cobb, I'm a little...

362
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,783
I should've known better than to trust a man
who calls himself Chauncey Wheelock.

363
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,416
Claims he's a playwright and a director.
Claims he's another Griffith.

364
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,859
He's another Griffith, all right.
Max Griffith, the butcher down the block.

365
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,556
- Who's Griffith?
- What?

366
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,828
- I was just wondering...
- Who is Griffith?

367
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,665
You mean to say that
you don't know who David Wark Griffith is?

368
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,705
- D.W. Griffith?
- Well, I think I've heard the name.

369
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,205
You think you've heard?

370
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:31,802
Why, he's only the greatest
film director in the world. God damn him.

371
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,779
Man, D.W. Griffith is the best thing
that's happened to pictures

372
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,509
since the invention of the camera.

373
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,279
- And this fellow Wheelock?
- Is the worst!

374
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,287
I sent him out to California
to take advantage of the sunshine,

375
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,255
to run my West Coast company.

376
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:48,522
Now I get a telegram which says,
"I've lost stories. Send more."

377
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,927
Lost stories? Where? In the toilet?

378
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,856
- Harrigan, stand up!
- Yes, sir.

379
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,061
Harrigan, I want you
to take the train to California.

380
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,763
- Me, sir?
- Take five of your best stories.

381
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,929
- Have you got five?
- Five?

382
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,199
- Well, I think maybe I...
- Take 10!

383
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,572
Take them out there and
if you see anything fishy, if you smell a rat,

384
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,544
if it ain't kosher, I want you
to consider yourself fully empowered.

385
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,411
But get that camera turning.
Remember, it's war.

386
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,179
Give them hell, boy.

387
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,311
- I'll do my best.
- God be with you.

388
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,890
Last call for dinner. Last call for dinner.

389
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,126
What's all that?

390
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,294
We're pulling into Kansas City, Mr. Harrigan,
and it's the last call to dinner.

391
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,304
- Oh, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

392
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,867
Last call for dinner.

393
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,341
Okay, let's see.

394
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,976
Okay, let's go, Reese.
We'll be here all day if we wait for her.

395
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:50,716
- Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Kathy, let's go.
- I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

396
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,221
Oh, heavens!

397
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,503
- My goodness!
- Miss Cooke!

398
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,237
- Mr. Mulligan.
- Harrigan.

399
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,744
Oh, goodness, there they are.
Okay, I'm coming, Mr. Duncan.

400
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,579
- Goodbye, I have to go now.
- Goodbye? No, wait.

401
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,881
- I can't. Where are you going?
- California.

402
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,184
- We're going to California.
- You are? When?

403
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,350
Oh, I don't know exactly. It's so confusing.

404
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:29,520
They said whistle-stop tour
and they weren't fooling.

405
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,723
Is there any place
I could write you, Kathleen?

406
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,959
- Oh, you remembered my whole name.
- Allow me.

407
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,492
And I called you Mulligan.
I can't get anything right.

408
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:43,572
- You can call me anything you want.
- Then, goodbye, Mulligan.

409
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,236
Come on, Miss Cooke,
come on, Miss Cooke.

410
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,802
No fraternizing, fellow.

411
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,974
- But... What?
- All aboard, Mr. Harrigan.

412
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,984
Come on, the train's leaving.

413
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,987
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

414
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,614
- I hope so.
- So do I.

415
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,454
- Good luck.
- You mean, break an arm.

416
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,687
What?

417
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,773
All out, Kansas City. Kansas City, all out.

418
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:26,285
"The Virginian's pistol came out,
and his hand lay on the table.

419
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,325
"He issued his orders to the man Trampas.
"'When you call me that, smile.'

420
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,753
"And he looked at Trampas
across the table."

421
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,589
Front of the car! Front of the car!
Put your bonnet on, put your bonnet on.

422
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,725
Advertise, advertise!

423
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,826
Will you get to the front of the car,
Miss Cooke?

424
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,637
Miss Cooke! I got you.

425
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,271
- Oh, Mr. Greenway.
- Howdy.

426
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,141
- I tripped.
- I'm glad.

427
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,875
Front of the car, girls. Front of the car.
Come on, Miss Cooke.

428
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,473
- I'm coming, Mr. Duncan.
- No fraternizing, fellow.

429
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,381
Oh, porter, wait.
I have your suitcase, Mr. Greenway.

430
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,749
And I got yours, Miss Cooke.

431
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,549
I don't know how it happened.
Probably my fault.

432
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,884
I'm blind as a rat, you know.

433
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,425
And all sorts of people standing around
when I first opened it.

434
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,927
- It was very embarrassing.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

435
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:13,022
- I hope you're not going to shoot me.
- No, no. It's just a new job I got.

436
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,122
Shooting?

437
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,395
No. Sort of law enforcement,
I guess you could call it.

438
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,733
- I was hoping I'd run into you.
- So was I.

439
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, dear. I have it.

440
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,476
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

441
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,710
Thanks to you, I finally get a chance
to change my clothes, now.

442
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,083
These are about to walk away on me.
Whoops.

443
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,884
- Those aren't your clothes?
- Nope.

444
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,890
- Well, whose clothes are they?
- Can't say.

445
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,722
- Somebody doesn't have their clothes.
- Yes, ma'am. Me.

446
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,022
Mulligan.

447
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,859
- My name's Greenway, ma'am.
- Yes, I know.

448
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,331
- Miss Cooke!
- Mr. Duncan.

449
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,958
Would you like to have
some supper, ma'am?

450
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,663
- Oh, gee, I'd love to. Except we...
- Miss Cooke, go to your room.

451
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,831
Yes, sir, Mr. Duncan. Yes, sir.

452
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,137
Stay away from my girls, dude.

453
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,540
- You all right, miss?
- I'm fine.

454
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,340
- You in the circus or what?
- No, I ain't.

455
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,067
- Sir, where are we?
- I just announced it, Mr. Harrigan.

456
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,363
Cucamonga.

457
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,733
- Right on time.
- What?

458
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,272
But the porter was supposed to wake me.
Why didn't he wake me?

459
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,831
Well, sir, he's only human.

460
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,072
You'd better hurry up.
The train's right on time.

461
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,277
These aren't my clothes.

462
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:45,583
Cucamonga. I'm not ready.
If I had my own suitcase. I should...

463
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,688
Go away.

464
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:20,917
Stop it.

465
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,962
- Did you see that dog?
- What dog was that, Mr. Harrigan?

466
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,262
- Oh, look at that.
- What?

467
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,963
- Your jacket's ripped, Mr. Harrigan.
- Thank you very much.

468
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:35,769
Oh, don't mention it, Mr. Harrigan.
Goodbye now. All aboard.

469
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,548
Hello, little girl. Pleased to meet you.

470
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,382
I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago,
looking for one Chauncey Wheelock.

471
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,486
Have you seen an ugly little dog
running around here anywhere?

472
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,326
Yes, as a matter of fact, it bit me.

473
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,423
- Good. Where'd he go?
- Off that way.

474
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,867
- Your jacket's ripped.
- Yes, I know. But could you just...

475
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:05,487
- 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
- 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

476
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:23,171
...three, four, five,

477
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,413
six, seven, eight.

478
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,013
Hello.

479
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,550
Good morning.

480
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:40,459
- Your jacket's ripped, mister.
- Yes, I fell off the train.

481
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:46,062
Yes, sir, that's what happened, all right.

482
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,936
Say, I was wondering,
would you by any chance

483
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,908
know the whereabouts
of a fellow named Chauncey Wheelock?

484
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,880
He's a moving picture director.

485
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,681
He's supposed to be
around here somewhere. I need to find him.

486
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,187
Why?

487
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,623
- Did someone say something?
- I said, why?

488
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,459
Hello. I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago.

489
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,371
You're not, by any chance, Mr. Wheelock,
are you?

490
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,541
- Don't let him get away.
- Wait, stop!

491
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,211
Stop it! Stop it!

492
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,846
He's laughing.

493
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,923
Well! I never!

494
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,819
- That was assault.
- You a snake-oil salesman, mister?

495
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,864
- Those are not my clothes.
- How's that?

496
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,763
I mean, those are my clothes.

497
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,860
- You L. Taylor Harrigan?
- Yes.

498
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,236
He's okay, boys.
Here's a card from old Corny Cobb.

499
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,138
Well, what an interrogation!

500
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,042
Sorry, Mr. Harrigan, but we're all
a little touchy about those Patents guys.

501
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,942
- Oh, you thought that I...
- I'm Frank Frank.

502
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,310
- What?
- Frank Frank.

503
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,542
You didn't look dangerous,
but we can't take chances.

504
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,675
No, of course.

505
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,185
And this is the crew.
Jimmy, John, Dobie, Jack.

506
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,551
And Mr. Reginald Kingsley.

507
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,850
- Charmed.
- He's the actor.

508
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,912
And Sally there, he owns the place.

509
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,219
- What about Wheelock?
- That drip.

510
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,193
He went on a bender
and we ain't heard or seen him for weeks.

511
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,127
Four weeks.
And we ain't been paid in that long, neither.

512
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,028
Yeah, he took most
of the last payroll with him.

513
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,657
- Son of a bitch.
- Well, that's just awful.

514
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:26,034
- Then you've been stranded here.
- Yeah, and it ain't exactly Paris, France.

515
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,362
Right.

516
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,807
Yes, of course. I better send a telegram.
Where can I send a telegram?

517
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:34,972
- Anywhere you want.
- No, I mean where from? From where?

518
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,311
Over to the depot, Mr. Harrigan.

519
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,851
Oh, thank you very much.
Call me Leo, won't you?

520
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,820
I'm Margaret Reeves.
Everybody calls me Marty.

521
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,753
Very pleased to meet you, Marty.

522
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,126
- Good to meet you, Leo.
- Same here, Frank Frank.

523
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,459
Well...

524
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,601
- I believe this is yours.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

525
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,997
Gentlemen, telegram.

526
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,084
I would like to telegraph Chicago.
It's an emergency.

527
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,054
If it's an emergency, why don't you try
that there new public telephone?

528
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,682
See if it'll work.
Ain't nobody called as far as Chicago yet.

529
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:23,490
The telephone. Good idea. Get fast results.

530
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,490
Hello, hello, hello. Central.
I would like to call Chicago, Illinois.

531
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,593
That's Kinegraph. K-I-N-E graph.

532
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,900
Yes, and can you bill
it to them there, please?

533
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,269
- Right.
<i>- Can I have your name, please?</i>

534
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,807
My name is Harrigan. H-A double R-I...

535
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,537
<i>- Like the man in the song.</i>
- Yes, just like the man in the song.

536
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,908
By George M. Cohan, yes.

537
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,312
- I hear it, it's ringing.
- Son of a bitch!

538
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,010
<i>- Kinegraph.</i>
- Mabel?

539
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,518
This is Leo Harrigan.
May I speak to Mr. Cobb, please?

540
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,645
She's got the money.

541
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,188
She's going to try and get him.
He's in three meetings.

542
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,587
- Sounds right.
<i>- Is that you, Harrigan?</i>

543
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,716
- Mr. Cobb? It's him.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

544
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,023
- Mr. Cobb, I'm in Cucamonga.
<i>- Is Wheelock there?</i>

545
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,359
No, Wheelock's not. He went on a bender.

546
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,659
- He disappeared.
<i>- Disappeared?</i>

547
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,723
- He's yelling now.
<i>- Drunken Irish son of a...</i>

548
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,530
He took the last payroll with him.

549
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,127
<i>- Took the payroll!</i>
- He's yelling again.

550
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,933
<i>I'm going to have him decapitated.</i>

551
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,668
Well, I suggest that you
send some money to these people,

552
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,642
so that they can be paid and...

553
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,942
And then, I think that...
That you should disband the company.

554
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,811
- No.
- Disband the company?

555
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,076
Out of work.

556
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,449
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
You will send money immediately.

557
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,914
And you want me to take my stories.
Yes, they're ready.

558
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,653
And you want me to what?

559
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,661
- Oh, no, Mr. Cobb, I don't think that's...
<i>- Don't argue with me!</i>

560
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,960
No, really. Yes, I know, but that's not... No.

561
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,933
He's fading out. Don't fade.
Hello, Mr. Cobb...

562
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,027
Hello, hello, hello...

563
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,944
He wants me to direct.

564
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,988
Good morning, Sally. Good morning.

565
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,358
Hello, little girl.
I see you got your dog back.

566
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,693
- Quiet, Leo.
- I beg your pardon.

567
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,461
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Leo.

568
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,300
The dog's name is Leo.
Good morning, everyone.

569
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,463
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

570
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,565
Well, it certainly is a beautiful morning.

571
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,371
- Who's that?
- That's the director.

572
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,412
That's the director?

573
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,512
- Frank Frank.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,643
- Could I speak to you for a minute, please?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,254
We'll be right back.

576
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,653
What's the matter?

577
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,721
Frank, to be quite frank,
I don't know how to do it.

578
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,630
- Do what?
- Direct.

579
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,066
- You don't?
- No.

580
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,159
Gee!

581
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,796
Well, don't just say gee.
I'm a nervous wreck.

582
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,432
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Do you always wear your clothes so big?

583
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,771
These aren't my clothes.

584
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,004
- Well, whose are they?
- I don't know.

585
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,137
You don't know how to direct...

586
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,444
And I don't know whose clothes,
that's right. Anything else?

587
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,280
Hey.

588
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:11,449
- Well, didn't you ever see Cobb direct?
- No, I was writing. God, this is humiliating.

589
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:15,984
Hey, look, take it easy. It's real simple.
You'll have no problem.

590
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,393
- I won't?
- Hell, no. Any jerk can direct.

591
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,625
Now, you see over there?

592
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,559
- Marty and Kingsley?
- Yeah.

593
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,126
- Putting on their white makeup?
- Yeah.

594
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:28,605
- Those are the actors.
- Thank you very much.

595
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,166
Okay. Now, you see over there,
that box on the sticks?

596
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,212
- Yes.
- John's putting a blanket over it right now?

597
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,407
- Yes.
- That's the camera.

598
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,609
Well, the first thing you do
is tell me where to put it.

599
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,083
I'm about to.

600
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,518
No. I'm the cameraman.

601
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:43,782
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, sir.

602
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,289
- Well, hello.
- Hello, sir.

603
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,585
- Leo.
- Frank.

604
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,059
- No, I'm Leo.
- Yes, I know.

605
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,151
Go on.

606
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:54,461
Okay. Then you tell the actors what you
want them to do in front of the camera.

607
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,194
You tell me to crank it.
And when you've had enough,

608
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,701
- you just tell me to cut.
- Cut.

609
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,365
Then you do the same thing all over again
with the next scene and that's it.

610
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,566
- That's it?
- That's it.

611
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,235
- That's all D.W. Griffith does?
- Sure, more or less.

612
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,974
They tell me Griffith doesn't say "cut,"
he says "cease."

613
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:13,747
- Griffith says "cease." Well, I can do that.
- Then you can direct. Let's go.

614
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,887
All right, let's go.

615
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,151
Good morning, everyone.

616
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,521
Good morning.

617
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,457
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

618
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,926
Good morning.

619
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,923
All right...

620
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,860
- Dobie, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

621
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:35,532
- Oh, you don't have to call me sir.
- Oh, well, we always call the director sir, sir.

622
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,372
Oh, you do. I'm sorry.

623
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:42,107
The story we're doing today is called
<i>Luke's Revenge.</i> Could you be Luke?

624
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,671
Excuse me, Mr. Harrigan,

625
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,946
I am Reginald Kingsley
of the New York stage.

626
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,750
I normally play the leading roles.
I would be Luke.

627
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,314
- Oh, yes, of course.
- What happens to me?

628
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,951
Well, in the first scene,
Luke's horse throws him and he gets killed.

629
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,495
Luke gets killed in the first scene?

630
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,326
- That's right.
- Then I do not play Luke.

631
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,267
- Oh, well, perhaps he only gets hurt then.
- I do not fall from horses.

632
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,167
I see. Well...

633
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,937
Does anyone have any ideas
how we could kill Luke?

634
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,910
- He could get shot.
- Yeah, except it should be an accident.

635
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,377
He could shoot himself.

636
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,576
Well, that does not have quite
the dramatic impact we're searching for.

637
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,017
He could get bit by a rattlesnake.

638
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:27,389
- Did you say something, little girl?
- I said, he could get bit by a rattlesnake.

639
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,485
A rattlesnake.
Yes, that's a very good idea, little girl.

640
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,496
Except, we haven't got a rattlesnake.

641
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,000
- Now does anyone else have...
- I've got a rattlesnake.

642
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,702
- You've got a rattlesnake?
- Yes.

643
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,800
- A little toy rattlesnake or something?
- A real rattlesnake. His name is Robert.

644
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,071
Robert the rattlesnake?

645
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,080
- Yes. It'll cost you $5.
- Five dollars? For the day?

646
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,445
For two hours.

647
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,507
- All right, little girl.
- Alice.

648
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,712
All right, Alice, can we have a look,
or is there a price for that too?

649
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,586
You can look for free.

650
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,285
She's got a rattlesnake.

651
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,295
- Yeah. Ain't that something.
- Son of a bitch.

652
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,181
- Here he is.
- Ah, that was fast, little girl.

653
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,648
- Alice.
- Alice. Let's have a look.

654
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,011
It bit me.

655
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,716
My God,
you can die from the bite of a rattle...

656
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,487
- I could die from this.
- Holy smoke, he got bit by a rattlesnake.

657
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,466
Little girl, your rattler bit that young man.

658
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,532
Don't worry. Robert's poison sac's
been removed for years.

659
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,137
He can't hurt a fly.
They do this to all the directors.

660
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,442
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

661
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,245
- We got it, we got it!
- Just drink this down, sir, quick.

662
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,047
- What? What is it?
- It's old Injun remedy.

663
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,246
- Chipawau.
- Chipa what?

664
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,447
- Chipawau.
- But...

665
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,820
Just chug-a-lug it down, sir,
so it can beat the poison to your heart.

666
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,452
If it gets there first, it disinfects the heart
and the poison can't get in.

667
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,359
- Hurry.
- Oh, mother of mercy.

668
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,733
- Frank Frank!
- Sir, sir!

669
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,335
Aim the camera at Ronald.

670
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,879
- Robert.
- Robert.

671
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,608
- Aiming.
- Kingsley?

672
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,343
Mr. Harrigan.

673
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,875
- Stand next to it.
- I do not play scenes with reptiles.

674
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,512
- Well, what do you do?
- I emote.

675
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,523
Then never mind.

676
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,389
- Just photograph Roger.
- Robert.

677
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,326
- Robert.
- All set, Boss.

678
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,923
- All right, Frank, crank.
- Cranking.

679
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:25,959
We're going to make pictures.
I said, we're going to make pictures.

680
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,365
Pictures with drama and heart-throb.

681
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,208
Pictures with comedy and pathos.

682
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,040
Pictures with thrills and romance!

683
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,355
And if any Patents Company son of a...

684
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:48,486
I said, if any Patents Company son of a...

685
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,894
- Where is he? Where is he?
- On the roof.

686
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,955
There's the son of a bitch.

687
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,024
- On the roof.
- Give me a gun.

688
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,535
Get him!

689
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,440
Who is he? Don't kill him.

690
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,500
- The camera okay?
- Yeah, just barely.

691
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,238
Don't kill him!

692
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,538
Patents bastards.

693
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,244
Patents? But don't kill him. Let me kill him.

694
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,357
Goddamn Patents bastards didn't tell me
they were going to shoot back!

695
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,333
You're doing great, sir.
Come on, boys, let's get him.

696
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,839
- We're with you, Dobie.
- Now, you stay here, Marty.

697
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,375
- Staying?
- Where's Leo?

698
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,534
- I'm right here.
- Not you.

699
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,077
Don't let him get away.

700
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,145
Hey, wait for me!

701
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,578
Whoa, horsey. Whoa.

702
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,212
Don't shoot. You might hit the horse!

703
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,197
- Ain't no use in going after him now.
- Nope, that's Hurricane.

704
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,068
- He's a...
- Goner.

705
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:11,598
- Son of a bitch.
- Hello? Where is everybody?

706
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,443
- Stop this...
- Look at him ride.

707
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:19,477
Come on, now. Please.

708
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,281
Get down off that horse immediately,
young man.

709
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,083
I want to have a word with you.

710
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,382
Look out!

711
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,925
He tried to kill me.

712
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:39,163
Get, pluckies. Get!

713
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,674
- Hey, you, wait a minute.
- He's gonna need help.

714
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,801
- Oh, hell.
- Oh, come on.

715
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,040
Come on, folks.
I think there's gonna be a fight.

716
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,118
- I got him.
- I don't want to fight.

717
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,178
We got him!

718
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,223
- Now, hold still.
- Oh, he's feisty!

719
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,027
You're doing great.

720
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,933
I don't like fighting women and children!

721
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:14,234
- Quit wriggling.
- You kicked me.

722
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:20,936
You shot at my camera,
you Patents Company son of a bitch.

723
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:24,005
One thing I hate, it's a sloppy drunk.

724
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,379
Well, that settles it.

725
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,842
Hold these, please.

726
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,281
Get up. Get up, you skunk.

727
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,024
You got a lot of help, mister.

728
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,155
Don't anybody help me! No matter
what happens, don't anybody help me!

729
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,961
That sounds like a bad idea, Leo.

730
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:45,265
Not at all. I was boxing champion
of my class at the University of Chicago.

731
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,500
I am trained in fisticuffs.
Get up, you coward.

732
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,540
That's the way it's going to be!

733
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,911
Put me down!
This is not the Marquis of Queensbury rules.

734
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,510
I knew it was a bad idea.

735
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,847
- Come on.
- I don't want to fight you.

736
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,581
- Come on, you coward. Let's box.
- I don't want to fight you.

737
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,680
Look, I'm warning you,
I got an alligator farm.

738
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,588
- What?
- I got an alligator...

739
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,990
I warned you...

740
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,052
- Say, he can...
- Box.

741
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,496
- Son of a bitch.
- That Harrigan's a pretty good fighter.

742
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,358
It's not over yet.

743
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,502
You kicked me! You kicked me!

744
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,335
- Hey, no kicking.
- Yeah, no kicking.

745
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,000
That's not fair. Did you see that?

746
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,908
- Kicking is fair!
- No biting.

747
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:39,620
- I wasn't ready.
- You ready now?

748
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,283
Yes.

749
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,351
Are we observing
the Marquis of Queensbury rules?

750
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,759
Sure.

751
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,923
We are not observing the Marquis...

752
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,898
That's it, Leo! Punch him!

753
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,114
No kicking.

754
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,157
Time out. Hold it. Hold it!

755
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:30,968
Hit it, stranger!

756
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,011
- Do you mind?
- All right, all right.

757
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,605
- Don't you trust me?
- No, I don't.

758
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,480
Marquis... Queens Marquis rules,
you know. Go ahead.

759
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,922
Has anybody got any water?
I'm dying of thirst.

760
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,099
Stop it! Let go!

761
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,370
Hey, you're doing great, Boss.
Leo, get away from there, will you?

762
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,934
Leo, he's on our side.

763
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:14,079
- Well, I guess you give up now, don't you?
- I most certainly do not.

764
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,887
- Get up. Come on, coward, get up.
- Now I'm getting mad.

765
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,690
Hey, he's dancing like Leo.

766
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,075
Come on, stranger.

767
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,805
Give me a hand, will you?

768
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,331
Don't let them get away!

769
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,011
You give...

770
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,143
- No.
- No. No.

771
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:25,381
- You thirsty?
- Very.

772
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:26,890
Oh, good.

773
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,215
Well, it looks like my place
is the only thing left standing,

774
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:04,694
so folks, follow me.
The drinks are on the house.

775
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,757
Never seen a fight like that before.

776
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,168
Here you are, Boss.
You're doing great. Just great.

777
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:22,873
I believe those are my pants you've got on.

778
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,880
I'm a suck-egg mule if they ain't mine.

779
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:27,941
- These?
- Yeah.

780
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,487
- You wear these?
- Purty, ain't they?

781
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:34,855
How in the world did... Wait a second.
Did you meet a girl?

782
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,992
- Blind as a rat?
- Tells you to break your arm.

783
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,759
- Falls down a lot.
- Kathleen.

784
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,026
Cooke.

785
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,534
- My God.
- Glory be.

786
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,729
- I got to hand it to you, Dan.
- Leo.

787
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,671
You got a mean left for a Northern boy.

788
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,606
- And you, too.
- Thanks.

789
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,870
- And you know what?
- What?

790
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,003
I like your looks.

791
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,172
You ain't funny, are you?

792
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,238
No. Did you ever think
about getting in the picture business?

793
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,339
Thought about getting out of it!

794
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,908
- Oh, get out of that damn Patents Company.
- It ain't worth it, Dan.

795
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:06,356
- Listen, you sure can ride a horse.
- Well, it's sort of my middle name.

796
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,655
Well, why don't we have us a snort
and see if we can work it out.

797
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,424
Okay, if you can get me up out of here.

798
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,901
I'll tell you what, Dan.
Just tell me about when you met my girl.

799
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,768
What do you mean your girl?
When did you meet her?

800
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,068
Springtime, New York City.

801
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,133
Well, then I saw her first, Dan,
back in Chicago.

802
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,839
Long before she ever thought
about going to New York City.

803
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,608
- Is that a fact?
- Nothing but a fact.

804
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:34,743
- Why we used to go sailing on Lake Erie.
- Well, I took her down to my alligator farm.

805
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,787
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a new leading man.

806
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,982
- Yeah.
- That big lug.

807
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,662
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

808
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:28,570
Miss Cooke, you're supposed to be
a clod dancer, not a clod hopper.

809
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,199
- Well, I'm trying.
- I thought it was nice.

810
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,800
- What?
- Didn't you, Jim?

811
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,368
- Real nice.
- Who the devil are you?

812
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,506
We telephoned about your balloon
for the moving picture company.

813
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,573
- You Duncan?
- Oh, yeah.

814
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:45,021
Well, girls, girls, take a break, girls.
Yes, the balloon'll cost you $50 for the day.

815
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,853
- Give you 30.
- I said 50, little girl.

816
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:48,290
- Give you 25.
- I said 50.

817
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,350
- Give you 20.
- You just said 25!

818
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,020
- That's a deal.
- What?

819
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:54,565
- Is that your kid, fellow?
- Hell, no.

820
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,122
My name's Alice. What's yours?

821
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,828
- Kathleen.
- I like that name.

822
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,767
- Well, I like yours.
- I hate it.

823
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,032
But why? It's a good name.

824
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:03,165
Nah, it ain't,
'cause you can't make a nickname out of it.

825
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,075
Except Al or something stupid like that.
Everybody's just gotta call you Alice.

826
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,305
Hey, kid! Kid!

827
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,405
- That dog's got a mean streak.
- Here's your money.

828
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,212
- Do you belong to that mutt, kid?
- Come on, Leo.

829
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,444
Nice talking to you.

830
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:18,182
Hey, Alice should live in a palace.
Can't do that with my name.

831
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,780
Hey, this is only 25 bucks.

832
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:23,191
- That's what you said. So long, Kathleen.
- Bye, Princess.

833
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,662
- Princess? Where'd you get that?
- Well, who do you think lives in palaces?

834
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,198
Oh, yeah.

835
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,626
Now you just hold on a minute, there,
young lady.

836
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,331
I don't care what you say, Dan,
I ain't going to do it.

837
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,633
Have I ever lied to you, Dan?

838
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,698
- Yeah, you have, several times.
- I have not.

839
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,437
<i>Luke's Revenge,</i>
<i>Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder...</i>

840
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,878
I've only tried to make you comfortable
in uncomfortable situations.

841
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,381
- Don't try to sweet talk on me, Dan.
- That is a director's job.

842
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,849
I don't like being up off the ground.

843
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,715
What are you when you're on a damn horse?

844
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,948
Okay, fair enough.
I'll go as high as my horse.

845
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,785
Fine. How high's a horse, 10, 12 feet?

846
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,882
- Six. A horse is six feet.
- A short horse.

847
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,224
Short or tall, that's as high
as this explorer's going. Six feet.

848
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,161
Do you want everybody
to think you're scared?

849
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:06,192
I am scared. Look, a horse is human.
That thing is full of hot air, just like you.

850
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,466
- All right. Dobie.
- Don't go no higher than six feet.

851
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,974
- Take it up to six feet and hold it.
- It's as high as I'm going.

852
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,634
- Six feet!
- Marty, Marty!

853
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,702
- Yes, Leo.
- Oh. You run in when I yell.

854
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,645
- Yes, Leo.
- Well, go on, Dan.

855
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:21,116
- Get in the damn thing.
- I'm getting, I'm getting.

856
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,318
- Did you see that?
- Hold it steady, boys.

857
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,881
- We don't want to lose the leading man.
- I gotcha, don't worry.

858
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,392
Everything all set, Alice?

859
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,018
- Princess.
- What?

860
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,791
- Princess.
- Alice should live in a palace.

861
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:38,427
- Has everybody gone crazy today?
- Not crazy enough to go up in that thing.

862
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,597
- What'd he say?
- I'm getting a lot of help today.

863
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,664
Okay, let him up 30 feet.

864
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:54,848
No, no, no, no! Miss Cooke!
Please, take it from the top again.

865
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,546
Now listen, I can change that

866
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,885
to <i>Three Dutch Damsels</i>
in five minutes, you know.

867
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,925
Well, you do that, you big poop.

868
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,756
Poop? What did you call me?

869
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:08,265
Poop! As in poop-deck. As in stern.
As in rear end.

870
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,730
Wave farewell, Dan.
Give us that confident grin.

871
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:18,469
The world is our oyster. Be natural.

872
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,534
That's not six feet.

873
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,942
New horizons, Dan.
All the arrogance of youth.

874
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:30,215
- Harrigan, I'm gonna kill you.
- That's good. Smile.

875
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,755
I swear I'm going to strangle you.

876
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:35,122
- Watch out.
- What?

877
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,888
- Help!
- My God, it's her.

878
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,759
- Jesus Christ.
- What happened? Where am I?

879
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,389
Grab her, Jack.

880
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,861
- Kathleen! Kathleen!
- You know her, too?

881
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,996
- Miss Cooke.
- Everybody knows her.

882
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,937
- What do I do? Cut?
- Are you kidding? Keep turning.

883
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,101
- They're drifting!
- Alice, get the truck.

884
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,804
Everybody, onto the truck, now!
Bring that camera. Let's go.

885
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,404
On the truck? I've never done that before.

886
00:56:57,481 --> 00:57:00,508
Don't be scared, miss. Stay right there.
I'm gonna help you.

887
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,943
I'm gonna help you, miss.

888
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,719
Don't be scared. Here comes a rope.

889
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,626
- Grab the rope.
- Where is it?

890
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,822
By your head. Stop wiggling.

891
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,592
- That don't help none.
- I see it.

892
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,691
- I've got it.
- Now hang on.

893
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,532
Now hang on, hang on, miss.

894
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,538
Cooke, you're fired, damn it!

895
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,007
- Get the truck, you fools. That's our balloon.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

896
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,005
Take off, Alice. Follow them.

897
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,605
We'll miss the rescue.

898
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:36,620
Hang on, miss. Hang on, I almost got you.
Here we go. Hang on now. I got you.

899
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,356
Grab my hands, grab my hands.

900
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:42,120
- Grab my hands, grab my...
- I'm trying.

901
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,285
- Okay, I got you.
- Okay.

902
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,862
I almost got you.
Here we go, come on in now.

903
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:46,988
Okay.

904
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,702
Why, Mr. Greenway,
you've grown a mustache.

905
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,367
- Miss Cooke.
- I tripped.

906
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:04,973
- Stand up, stand up. We can't see you.
- Harrigan, I'm gonna pulverize you.

907
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:08,815
- Did you say Harrigan? Not Leo Harrigan?
- I think I'm going to be sick.

908
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:12,049
Do that again where it almost tipped over.
That was good.

909
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:14,819
I swear I'm gonna strangle you!

910
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,987
Don't look into the camera, you big oaf!
Be natural.

911
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:22,191
- If I just had my rifle. Oh, God!
- Don't look down, Mr. Greenway.

912
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,530
I can't see a thing, so I'm not scared at all.

913
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,400
- Then you're as crazy as he is.
- Just don't look down.

914
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:29,064
- Don't look down?
- That's right. Don't look down.

915
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,973
- I won't look down.
- No, take your hands away from your face.

916
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,567
- Play the scene.
- What's he doing? Keep looking at me.

917
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,908
- He's directing a picture.
- A moving picture?

918
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,039
How exciting. I've never even seen one.

919
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,175
Well, Miss Cooke,
it's just possible you never will.

920
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,414
Be debonair. You're an explorer.

921
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,953
- For Pete's sake, Alice, come on.
- I can't help it. There's no road here.

922
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,790
- Well, be careful. How is it, Frank?
- Swell between bumps.

923
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,591
They're going toward the railroad tracks.

924
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,097
- Well, so what? Follow them.
- There's a train coming.

925
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,360
What?

926
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,297
Should I try to beat it?

927
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,600
- Yes, beat the train.
- Hang on.

928
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,400
- No, maybe not.
- I can beat the train.

929
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,672
Don't beat the train, Alice.

930
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,236
- I can beat it!
- Don't beat it.

931
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:13,283
- I can!
- Alice, don't!

932
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,376
Hail Mary, full of grace.

933
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,188
Too bad it didn't hit them.

934
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:29,631
- Do you hear a hiss?
- What? What kind of hiss?

935
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,065
- Like air escaping.
- That ain't funny.

936
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,932
Okay, take off, Alice. Follow them.

937
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:35,404
Oh, my God, I think you're right.

938
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,308
Did you see that, for God's sake?

939
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,449
- I don't believe it.
- Still turning.

940
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,247
Keep turning. Alice, stop on the tracks.

941
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:59,227
What a shot!
Kiss her, kiss her, for God's sake!

942
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,630
- He says I'm supposed to kiss you, ma'am.
- Yes, he did.

943
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,998
Well, he's the director.

944
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,507
Perfect.

945
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,377
Hold it a little longer, Frank.

946
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:21,817
Slow Iris to black. And cease. Cut. That's it.

947
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:26,288
Okay, wrap it up, everybody. Get them off.
Now bring the train back.

948
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,525
Oh, God,
how are we going to get them back?

949
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,603
That's damn good, Leo, as far as I can tell.

950
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,663
- Thanks, Sally.
- Here, have a beer.

951
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,141
Good? It was great.

952
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,610
Not even Mr. Griffith
gets stuff like that, Leo.

953
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:49,805
Not by accident anyway.

954
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,372
How about a hand for the cameraman?

955
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:56,952
I don't see where my role fits in.

956
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,819
Oh, come on, Kingsley, you wouldn't know
a good film if it bit you in the nose.

957
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,018
Reggie's got a point.
That's what's been bothering me.

958
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,152
What are we going to do with this stuff?

959
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,459
I mean, what's the plot?
Why is that girl in a silly Dutch costume?

960
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:10,126
- And who is she?
- You got me.

961
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,169
- That's...
- Kathleen, ain't it?

962
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,636
- Kathleen Cooke.
- Yeah, but who is she in the story?

963
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,970
- Oh, yeah.
- I didn't think of that.

964
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,067
- That's a...
- Problem.

965
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,771
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

966
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,778
The boy and the girl
are madly in love with each other,

967
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,343
but they're from two old Dutch families
who've been feuding for years.

968
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,686
They're told they must never
see each other again, ever.

969
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,783
So the boy decides to take off in his balloon

970
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:40,923
and explore the vast unchartered
regions of Africa and forget his only love.

971
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,489
But at the very last minute, though,
she defies her father

972
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:45,627
and rushes off to be at his side.

973
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,967
She trips and ends up in the balloon,
which lands on a train

974
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:51,668
and takes them to Africa
where they live happily ever after.

975
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:55,379
You can call the picture <i>Romeo's Balloon.</i>

976
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,106
Alice, that's terrific.

977
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:02,175
Whoa, Alice you just fixed the whole...

978
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:06,656
I'll play the father.
Never darken my door again, young man.

979
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,816
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

980
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,451
What about the stuff
we've already shot with Buck and Marty?

981
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:14,020
She could play his sister.
You just change the titles.

982
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,533
- I like it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

983
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,195
You don't mind playing the sister?

984
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,465
Well, I can't be the brother.

985
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,999
And about the money...

986
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,336
That'll be $15.

987
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,141
Fifteen dollars? Why, you stole
the whole thing from William Shakespeare.

988
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,672
So what? You steal everything
from the <i>Saturday Evening Post,</i>

989
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,446
and they pay you.

990
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:40,851
- Feel better now?
- Except for one slight problem, yes.

991
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,790
They'll be back, Coach.

992
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,762
- They've only been gone two days.
- A day and a night and a day.

993
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,231
Hey, Chief, looky here.

994
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:52,360
The train just brung in
<i>The Gazette</i> and we're in it.

995
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,562
- Picture and everything.
- Look at that.

996
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:57,301
There's you and there's me, I guess.
Big as life.

997
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,398
Big as life.

998
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:02,003
- I don't see my likeness anywhere.
- I don't either.

999
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,445
Now those Patents bastards
are going to know Buck lied to them.

1000
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,073
- About not finding us here, you mean?
- Yeah.

1001
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:10,143
- Oh, they don't read the <i>Gazette.</i> Do they?
- Leo's right, we better get out of town.

1002
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,086
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

1003
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,145
Well...

1004
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,385
- Where we going to go?
- I don't know.

1005
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:21,092
- We could go use the ostrich farm.
- I thought you said ostrich farm.

1006
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,861
That's 'cause I did say it.
I got one over at La Mesa.

1007
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:27,062
It's pretty deserted now
except for five ostriches and Aunt Lula.

1008
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,161
I could use the rent.

1009
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,537
That's the tallest damn horse
I've ever been on in my life, Harrigan.

1010
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:34,772
- You owe me for two train tickets.
- What did you do to your mustache?

1011
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:35,812
Don't you try to change the subject.

1012
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,413
Well, Dan, I guess he was
a bit taller than I expected.

1013
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,352
Hello, Miss Cooke, long time no see.

1014
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,981
- Mr. Mulligan.
- Harrigan.

1015
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:51,722
You got any idea
how hard a horse that tall can kick?

1016
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:54,594
Well, I think I'm going to find out.

1017
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,930
- How was that damn stuff?
- It was great. Glad to have you back.

1018
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:01,494
Great, except for one
petrified Florida cracker.

1019
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,699
I heard that. I heard that.

1020
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:04,866
Hello, I'm Marty.

1021
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:06,807
Anyway, you were covered
by the new leading lady.

1022
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,903
I hope you'll be the new
leading lady, Miss Cooke.

1023
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:14,542
Well, Mr. Harrigan, as it turns out,
I am presently at liberty.

1024
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,486
- This here's John.
- Hello.

1025
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:23,425
- Jack.
- Hey, Buck, how are you?

1026
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:34,131
- What? What did I, what, do?
- Alice, tell them how the story ends.

1027
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,636
Princess.

1028
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,675
<i>- Romeo's Balloon.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

1029
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:41,405
It's got a happy ending. They get married.

1030
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:44,209
Married? What a great idea.
An African tribal wedding.

1031
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,509
Sure is, that's what I was going to say next.

1032
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:46,982
- We're getting hitched.
- I just said that, Dan.

1033
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,313
I just said it.

1034
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,981
Yeah, but you're talking about a picture.
I'm talking about reality.

1035
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,718
We are going to get hitched,
just as soon as I can rustle up a padre.

1036
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,157
Ain't we Kathy-o?

1037
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,957
Well, looks like tomorrow
I'm going to lose a lot of good customers,

1038
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,826
so for right now,
the drinks are on the house.

1039
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,126
Come on.

1040
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,167
Look out. Look out. Look out.

1041
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:14,643
<i>I'll take you home again, Kathleen</i>

1042
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:19,877
<i>Across the ocean wild and wide</i>

1043
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,474
Go on, Buck.

1044
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:26,214
<i>To where your heart has ever been</i>

1045
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:32,161
<i>Since first you were my bonnie bride</i>

1046
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,692
Everybody!

1047
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,291
<i>The roses all have left your cheeks</i>

1048
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,893
Come on, Leo.

1049
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,737
<i>I've watched them fade away and die</i>

1050
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,936
Sure, I'd like one, Jack. How you been?

1051
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:51,106
<i>Your voice is sad when e'er you speak</i>

1052
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:55,778
<i>And tears bedim your loving eyes</i>

1053
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,445
Up, up, up.

1054
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,983
<i>I will take you back, Kathleen</i>

1055
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:08,225
<i>To where your heart will feel no pain</i>

1056
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,995
Oh, thank you.

1057
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,334
- You moved in on me didn't you, pal?
- You got to be fast on the draw, counselor.

1058
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:22,345
<i>I'll take you to your home again</i>

1059
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:29,014
And will you love her and keep her,
forsaking all others,

1060
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,247
in sickness and in health
till death do you part?

1061
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,755
- Sure do.
- "I do."

1062
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:33,846
I do, too.

1063
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:37,451
And you, my dear,
will you promise to love...

1064
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,052
Oh, no, no. Cut.

1065
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,324
- Cut. Cease.
- Ceasing.

1066
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,889
Alice, will you tell Matilda
to get out of the shot, please.

1067
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,868
- That's Randolph.
- Well, tell Randolph.

1068
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,301
He's supposed to be in the next shot.

1069
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,499
- Aunt Lula.
- Why didn't he tell Randolph himself?

1070
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,668
- He's the big director.
- You're very helpful, Aunt Lula.

1071
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,268
- Reloading.
- Bring it in a little closer.

1072
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,369
Moving closer.

1073
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,937
Randolph, why don't
you go stick your head in the sand.

1074
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,539
- Get going, I said.
- Are we really married yet?

1075
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:00,640
Not yet.

1076
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,049
I lost track five hours ago.

1077
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,713
Put it back, please. Not yet.

1078
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:05,982
- Not yet?
- Not yet.

1079
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,217
Anybody got any water?
It's hot here in Africa.

1080
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,192
Maybe he'd settle for some tall ducks.

1081
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,785
- Here he...
- Comes.

1082
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:16,026
Jesus, Dobie, can't you just
grab him by the neck and pull him back?

1083
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,694
Well, hell, Boss,
he spits and kicks something awful.

1084
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,828
He's fierce. Have you seen his toes?

1085
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,133
Mean, too.

1086
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,003
- Son of a bitch.
- It's only a bird.

1087
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,167
- Excuse me, Mr. Harrigan.
- Just a moment, Father.

1088
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,473
Well, do what you can, boys, will you?

1089
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,438
What is it, Logan?

1090
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,278
When are you going to be telling
these people that I'm an actor, not a priest?

1091
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:36,786
- They keep asking me to bless them.
- Well, bless them, Father, bless them.

1092
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:40,290
Just shut up about it.
Any moment, Father, any moment.

1093
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:43,855
Dan. Would you ask Alice
to be a bridesmaid?

1094
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:45,759
We need one
and she won't put on the blackface.

1095
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,854
Well, I don't blame her.
They all look ridiculous.

1096
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,025
Why would you say that?

1097
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,694
I can't help it.
Cobb will not send any money for extras.

1098
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,931
He says, "Burn some cork
and black up the crew."

1099
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,132
Mr. Harrigan,
couldn't we put in a bit of <i>Othello?</i>

1100
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,505
It was my greatest triumph
in the legitimate theater.

1101
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,943
"Damn her, lewd minx! Oh, damn her!"

1102
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,310
- All right, Reginald, we will.
- Fine.

1103
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,374
- Go on, Dan.
- All right, all right.

1104
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,883
Let's get going.

1105
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:10,614
The wedding's taking so long,
I ain't gonna have time for my honeymoon.

1106
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:13,054
I'm heartbroken.

1107
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,387
- Miss Cooke.
- Kathleen.

1108
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,950
Miss Cooke,
are you familiar with Mulligan's law?

1109
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:22,055
- I don't believe so.
- It goes like this, Miss Cooke.

1110
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,963
It's never too late.

1111
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:29,233
- Oh, Mulligan.
- I carry a hell of a torch.

1112
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,511
Hi, beautiful.

1113
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,948
Shakespeare. French, huh?

1114
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,615
What you so sore about?

1115
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,719
Do you hear me?

1116
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,418
- I ain't.
- What?

1117
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,120
- Sore.
- Yeah, you are.

1118
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:53,993
Spit it out.

1119
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,691
You said you'd teach me to ride.

1120
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,097
- I will.
- You won't.

1121
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:01,262
I will, too. As soon as we get around
some four-legged critters again.

1122
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,771
Might be riding better than me.

1123
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:05,070
- Which ain't that hard.
- I won't.

1124
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,133
Now why do you say that?

1125
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,179
You're getting married.

1126
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:13,779
Well, I'm stuck on her.

1127
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,046
- Only known her a week.
- Well, it only takes a second.

1128
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,112
The first time I saw her,
I thought my teeth were going to sweat.

1129
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,350
Besides, I ain't that good a rider nohow.

1130
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:25,623
- Thought it was your middle name.
- No. My middle name is "Liar."

1131
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,225
- Well, if you do teach me...
- Ain't no if about it.

1132
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:34,828
- Can we go alone?
- Well, could we take the horses?

1133
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,100
- I guess so.
- Fair enough.

1134
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:42,337
- Come on, Dan needs a flower girl.
- Okay.

1135
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,329
Hi, honey.

1136
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,160
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1137
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,426
Food any good?

1138
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:07,061
Nope. But the Father likes it fine.

1139
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:11,340
Well, it's been a long wedding day.

1140
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,036
Do you know what day of the week it is?

1141
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,045
It's Friday, ain't it?

1142
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:21,841
Correct me if I'm wrong, but what is it
that Catholics don't eat on Friday?

1143
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,216
Is he eating meat?

1144
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:30,818
That's right. Just like a starving actor.

1145
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,694
- Wouldn't you say, Father?
- What? Excuse me?

1146
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,858
- Marty, I smell a rat.
- Do you?

1147
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:39,630
- All ready, everybody. Places.
- An Irish rat.

1148
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,500
Father Logan. Bride, groom.

1149
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,597
Father, I got a confession for you.

1150
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,539
- Do you want to hear it?
- Later, my son, later.

1151
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,940
Do you ever confess, Father?

1152
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,841
Of course, my son.
Now bless you, bless you.

1153
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,746
All right, quiet, everybody.
Buck, now all we need is the kiss.

1154
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,011
All right, camera. Father, you're not in this.

1155
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,885
All right, hurry up, let's go.
Come on, well, what are you waiting for?

1156
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:02,824
Cut it, cut it. Look, she is supposed to be
playing your wife, not your sister.

1157
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,155
All these people watching...

1158
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,493
Take her in your arms, see?
Bring her to you.

1159
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:13,970
- Thanks a lot. You could've just told me.
- All right, camera. Be natural.

1160
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:22,042
Okay. Perfect. Hold it, hold it, a little longer.

1161
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,307
Slow fade to black and cut.

1162
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,940
- Light's perfect for the finish, Leo.
- All right then, everybody to the truck!

1163
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,042
Let's go. Come on. We're losing our light.

1164
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,178
Thank you very much, Father.
It was a wonderful wedding.

1165
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,449
I'll get to you later.

1166
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:34,718
- Are we married, totally married, yet?
- Don't worry about a thing, Kathy.

1167
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,692
- What are we doing, now?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute. Aunt Lula!

1168
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,749
Aunt Lula, ready.

1169
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:40,592
- Just hurry up. I gotta go cook!
- Okay, quiet, everybody!

1170
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,892
- Jump in.
- Jump in.

1171
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,058
In with your spears,
dancing and waving around.

1172
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,967
Come on, come on.
Then take off for the sunset.

1173
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,631
Jimmy, a little romantic
hurry music, come on.

1174
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,697
And camera.

1175
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,878
- How's this?
- Too much black and take your glasses off.

1176
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:01,440
You said blackface.

1177
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,783
Never mind. Kiss the bride.
A hug and a kiss. Be natural. Quick.

1178
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:08,222
- Says I'm supposed to hug you.
- Okay, go ahead.

1179
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,226
- Good luck!
- Kathleen, throw the bouquet!

1180
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,387
- Okay!
- Buck, take off!

1181
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:21,269
Very pretty. Okay. Slow Iris to black.
And cut.

1182
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,102
Okay, great. We got it. Come on back.

1183
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,972
We're going to find a real parson,
you sorry son of a bitch.

1184
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:29,444
Excuse me, honey. See you Monday.

1185
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,693
Come on in! It only costs a nickel.

1186
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,497
- Five cents.
- Oh, nickelodeon!

1187
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,405
And if you don't like the show,

1188
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:59,636
don't worry about it,
because it only lasts 15 minutes.

1189
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:06,314
- Makes you feel real welcome, don't it?
- Well, at least that rules out both Leo's.

1190
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,749
Lot of picture companies moving here.

1191
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:10,878
Somebody's trying
to give you guys a bad name.

1192
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,081
Oh, who wants to be respectable anyway?

1193
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,680
Hey, Harrigan, we found a picture house.

1194
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,623
- I do.
- Don't worry, it'll never happen.

1195
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,285
- Where?
- Down the street.

1196
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,660
- Well, well.
- I love my husband.

1197
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,823
Oh, you kids.

1198
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,424
If y'all going to make fun of me,
I'm going to turn these clothes back in.

1199
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,661
Nope, nope, not me.

1200
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,398
Makes me feel real festive.
Sort of continental.

1201
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:31,339
That's right. H.H. Cobb
comes all the way to Los Angeles,

1202
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,773
we're going to look sharp.

1203
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:35,209
- Hey, Dan...
- Frank?

1204
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,374
Excuse me.

1205
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:44,251
My second Christmas away from home.

1206
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,448
You miss Chicago?

1207
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,991
- The trolleys?
- They got trolleys out here.

1208
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,390
We ought to make a Christmas picture.

1209
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:51,586
- Yeah.
- There ain't no snow.

1210
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:52,788
I'm forgetting what it's like.

1211
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:55,058
It melts.
Come on, let's go to the picture show.

1212
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,155
Gonna be late for Cobb's party.

1213
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:57,962
- He'd never notice.
- Merry Christmas.

1214
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:02,597
- Come on in. Who's got the money?
- Who's got the money? Yeah, 30 cents.

1215
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:14,046
Get the heck out of here, kids.
It costs a nickel. Get out and stay out!

1216
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,388
- It's true. It's true.
- Oh, shut up and sing, Dan.

1217
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,062
It smells like a zoo in here.

1218
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,139
- Look, it's Cobb.
- What?

1219
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:52,411
Yeah, that's funny.
What's he doing in a Patents House?

1220
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,354
- Look, it's...
- Me.

1221
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,919
- Look, it's Robert.
- Yeah.

1222
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,430
We never did one called <i>Tuttle's Muddle,</i>
did we?

1223
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,994
No, no, it's from...

1224
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,336
<i>- Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder.</i>
- Yep.

1225
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:13,273
<i>- Romeo's Balloon.</i>
- That's right.

1226
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,040
I look real brave there, don't I?
Hey, look at you, honey.

1227
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,183
- I never made this.
- We shot it, though.

1228
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,651
But the titles are all wrong.

1229
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,052
- Quiet down there.
- Oh, no, look.

1230
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:28,949
There's Matilda.

1231
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,823
- No, that's Randolph.
- No, that's Randolph.

1232
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:34,029
- Isn't that...
<i>- The Pasha's Pride.</i>

1233
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:38,163
- That's from <i>Caves and Clubs.</i>
- Yeah.

1234
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:39,463
- That's me.
- That's us.

1235
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,561
Sure is. There's me.

1236
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,600
- It's not making much sense, Harrigan.
- Oh, yeah, it does. Dollars and cents.

1237
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,009
Now what?

1238
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,209
Harrigan, this is a mess.

1239
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,551
That son of a bitch Cobb
has re-cut our stuff.

1240
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,134
- I remember this one.
<i>- The Gunman's Guilt.</i>

1241
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,411
- Where are you going, Leo?
- Leo?

1242
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:29,577
- You looked wonderful, Buck.
- Didn't look bad, did I?

1243
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,443
- Alice?
- Where's that film you just ran?

1244
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,045
Where is it?

1245
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,348
Don't hit me, mister, I got a sick mother.

1246
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,485
I don't know zip about it, fellow.
We only run Patent pictures here.

1247
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:41,497
And this kid came by on his bicycle
peddling some independent junk.

1248
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:43,055
You show them all the time!

1249
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,930
Shut up, both of you,
and just give me my picture.

1250
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,366
- Your picture?
- He directed it.

1251
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,926
- She wrote it.
- And I'm in it.

1252
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,972
You're gonna be in it
all right, if you don't give me my film...

1253
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,302
Look out!

1254
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,267
It ain't loaded. It ain't even loaded.

1255
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,743
- Don't hit me, sister, I got a sick mother.
- I found it!

1256
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,012
- Harrigan!
- All right, go get everybody.

1257
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,680
I'll meet you at the truck. Hurry up.

1258
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,347
It's happening on the inside.

1259
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,087
What are you doing out here?
It's happening inside.

1260
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,154
- This place is sure getting a lot of nickels.
- You ain't kidding.

1261
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:26,031
Buck, I think we're being followed.

1262
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,476
Oh, no,
they're just probably going our way.

1263
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:48,395
- Nope, they're following us.
- Let's get out of here.

1264
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,262
Harrigan!

1265
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,099
What did you do?
Bring the whole town with you?

1266
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,800
You're the one that stole the picture.

1267
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:04,136
- What do you all want?
- It's our picture.

1268
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:07,411
We have to show it to the boss, see?
It's all cut wrong.

1269
01:18:07,483 --> 01:18:08,781
We'll give it back later.

1270
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:12,447
- What the devil's going on here?
- They're movies? Ain't you?

1271
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,683
- What?
- Ain't you in the pictures?

1272
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:17,750
Yes, ma'am. Afraid we are.
Can you get arrested for that?

1273
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,726
- Hey, what's your name?
- Me, ma'am? Buck Greenway, ma'am.

1274
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:25,461
- Don't tell her your name.
- Why not? I didn't steal the picture.

1275
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,661
What's your name, miss?

1276
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,135
- Mine?
- No, no, the other one.

1277
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,435
Me? I'm Kathleen Cooke. Who are you?

1278
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:32,475
- Me?
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1279
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,635
I seen you in <i>Romeo's Balloon,</i> miss.

1280
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,769
- You did?
- Yeah.

1281
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,813
We love you in the pictures, Mr. Greenman.

1282
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,610
- Yeah.
- Do you?

1283
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:45,587
- Thanks, miss. It's Greenway. Buck.
- I direct their pictures. I'm Leo Harrigan.

1284
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,987
- I never seen yours, mister.
- You been in a lot of them, too?

1285
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,855
No, I'm not in them, I make them.

1286
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,190
- Oh, he just makes them.
- Just makes them?

1287
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,696
- You heard the lady, Dan.
- Could you give us something, Buck?

1288
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:58,859
- Give you something?
- Yes, so as our friends will believe us.

1289
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,733
Ah, see, we'd love to, folks,
but see, these ain't our clothes.

1290
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:04,535
- They're rented.
- Oh, who's going to care about one tie?

1291
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:07,509
- Here's his tie, Beth.
- Let's get out of here.

1292
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:13,679
- I got his collar, Morgan.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1293
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,411
Give me my hat.

1294
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,945
Come on, Leo, let's get them.

1295
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,656
Kathy, Kathy!

1296
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,702
- What's your name again?
- D.W. Griffith. Now get that down.

1297
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,430
- Kathy.
- D.W...

1298
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,405
- They're all crazy!
- Leo, stop.

1299
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:41,043
Get back.
Mr. Griffith, you'd better get out of here.

1300
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,578
- These are fanatics!
- You're telling us?

1301
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:46,207
Movie fanatics. I heard this happened down
at Cahuenga just last week.

1302
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,513
- Go on, get out of here.
- Come on, Alice! Let's go.

1303
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:52,179
All right, folks. It's all over.
These people got appointments.

1304
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,223
Now get away! Stop it.

1305
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,351
Space, I said space.

1306
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:02,398
That's what we need in this business.
More space.

1307
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,298
When this racket began, nobody
in his right mind would give it a month.

1308
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,233
But like Flopsy, it just growed and growed.

1309
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,737
- Like Topsy, Boss.
- Her, too.

1310
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,602
- Space!
- Six years ago,

1311
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:12,437
there were 4,000 nickelodeons
in this country,

1312
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:14,477
now there are three times that many.

1313
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,705
And they're multiplying
faster than guinea pigs.

1314
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,271
And what is it that these
five cent halls of amusement require?

1315
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:20,611
- Guinea pigs. Product.
- Product!

1316
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:24,176
- You said it, Mr. Cobb. That's what we need.
- Damn right I said that.

1317
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:25,846
How are we doing
on that desert story, boys?

1318
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:28,755
Come on, I'm falling asleep.

1319
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,055
Irish! Just the man I need.

1320
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,119
Steve, get their coats.
Waiter, give 'em some of that hooch.

1321
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,324
- Take your coat?
- No, thank you, it's a little brisk in here.

1322
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,559
- You, sir?
- I'll just keep 'em on.

1323
01:20:37,633 --> 01:20:38,931
All right, Harrigan, think fast.

1324
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,266
Two guys in the desert,
no food, no water, no horses.

1325
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,363
- What happens to them?
- They die.

1326
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,374
- In a comedy.
- Mr. Cobb, I...

1327
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,603
- It's Chicago, H.H.
- I'll take it over here.

1328
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,669
- Mr. Cobb, sit down.
- That's okay, I ain't tired.

1329
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:52,681
You're going to be.

1330
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:54,512
- You guys drunk or what?
- No, I'm going to talk.

1331
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,553
And for once in your life you're going
to listen to one thing at one time.

1332
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,953
Now for two years, I have been wandering
around the great southwestern wilderness

1333
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,185
of this country,
faithfully making pictures for you.

1334
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:06,023
I have done this with my associates here
through wind and rain,

1335
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:08,257
- boiling heat and icy cold.
- Icy cold.

1336
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,855
- And have we ever complained?
- Sometimes.

1337
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,127
- Never.
- Never.

1338
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,463
- Never.
- Day after day,

1339
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,003
diligently turning our camera,
shooting each week as much as...

1340
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,869
- Three or four thousand feet.
- Jam-packed with thrills and chills

1341
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,169
and sending it faithfully off to you

1342
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,732
- in Chicago.
- In Chicago.

1343
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:23,005
Trusting you
with our blood, sweat and tears.

1344
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,173
- My blood, my sweat and my tears.
- Right. And so, today... No, thank you.

1345
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,581
And so today we chance
to pass a nickelodeon,

1346
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,949
decide to while away
an hour in innocent pleasure,

1347
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:34,148
and what do we see, Mr. Cobb?
What assaults our innocent eyes?

1348
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,589
One of my own goddamn pictures.

1349
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,424
Not just one of our own goddamn pictures,
but 10 of our own goddamn pictures.

1350
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:42,659
Ten of our best, most exciting dramas,
cut by you, sir.

1351
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,792
Butchered into a single
jumbled-up, truncated, foreshortened,

1352
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,632
all but incomprehensible mess.

1353
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:49,831
And here it is, exhibit A.

1354
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,430
<i>Tuttle's Muddle!</i>

1355
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:53,669
- Did they laugh?
- That is beside the point.

1356
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,335
- They laughed.
- Look, we're famous.

1357
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,039
Thirty-five dollars a week.
That's slave wages.

1358
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,672
- What we want is more money.
- We want a guarantee in writing that says

1359
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,274
you're not allowed to cut our stuff
to ribbons any time you feel like it.

1360
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:05,116
A contract that says you ship them
out the way you get them. Our way.

1361
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:08,453
- And more money.
- Okay, that's it. I rest my damn case.

1362
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,789
And we'd like some more money.

1363
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:24,968
Well, children, it's Christmas Eve.
Peace on Earth. Good will to men.

1364
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,272
You're all fired. Nothing personal.
Have a drink.

1365
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,136
- We're all fired?
- Mabel, pay them all off.

1366
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:32,237
- Steve, Steve.
- Sir?

1367
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,180
Send a wire to the home office
and have our B company

1368
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,343
sent out here to replace
these departing friends.

1369
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,286
Clyde, tell me about these acres
you want to unload here in Hollybush.

1370
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,686
Hollywood.

1371
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:46,057
Still got the farm.
Ostriches could come back anytime now.

1372
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:51,657
- That was great, Harrigan.
- Fired, for Pete's sake.

1373
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:55,002
- Fire, Leo!
- He said that.

1374
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,562
- Oh, my God.
- My film!

1375
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,131
Smother it, smother it!

1376
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:04,277
Oh, God.

1377
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:08,241
Here you go, Marty, hold this.

1378
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,286
We'll have to leave now.
This room is on fire.

1379
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,581
Bring the furniture and the food.

1380
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,817
Reassemble in the hall
and summon the red boys.

1381
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,951
- You all right?
- Let's get you out of here.

1382
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:19,119
Hey!

1383
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,928
Fire drill. Everybody out.

1384
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,665
- Princess, do you see Kathy?
- Leo's got her.

1385
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:31,767
- You!
- Oh, hi.

1386
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,242
- You still got our rifle!
- Leave him alone.

1387
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:38,077
And our money.

1388
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,175
Why, it's Greenway.

1389
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:44,846
Fellow, you were a knockout
in <i>Tuttle's Muddle.</i>

1390
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,149
I was?

1391
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:49,521
Don't worry, folks.
This hotel is made of pure steel.

1392
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:51,150
Strike up the band.

1393
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:56,323
Marty, can I have... Excuse me. Marty.

1394
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,730
Well, Mr. Harrigan, goodbye.

1395
01:23:57,799 --> 01:23:59,165
- It's been a barrel of laughs.
- What?

1396
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,203
She's sore, Leo.
I can't seem to say the right thing.

1397
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,294
That's nothing new.

1398
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,738
Boy, you had to
burn the place down to wake me up.

1399
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,138
We're all out of work, for Pete's sake.

1400
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,609
Franklin, you'd rather be out of work
with him than in work with me,

1401
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:09,940
any time of the day or night.

1402
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:11,207
Now wait a second, Marty, that's just...

1403
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,340
Send my things care of Kinegraph Chicago,
will you, Kathy?

1404
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:15,407
- Okay, Marty.
- You're going back to Cobb?

1405
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:18,977
Damn right.
He'll know a good deal when he sees one.

1406
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,818
So long, kiddo.

1407
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,155
- Don't take any wooden nickels.
- Okay.

1408
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:27,853
Bye, Alice. So long, Buck.

1409
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:30,229
- Marty, where are you going?
- Let's talk turkey, Greenway.

1410
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:33,326
We're Atlantic Pictures
and Atlantic's going to the Pacific.

1411
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,428
- Let's talk about things.
- H.H. Cobb.

1412
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,666
Yeah, damn blanket company from Chicago.

1413
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:39,674
Hey, I don't like that outfit's music.
I don't want to hear it.

1414
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,370
- You know what I mean?
- Harrigan, come here.

1415
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:52,587
We're prepared to offer you each 50 a week
if you can report to work Monday morning.

1416
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:53,644
Yeah, what do you say to that?

1417
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:55,122
- Fifty?
- Nope. You're right, Leo.

1418
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,853
- What? Who owns this kid?
- We're independents, mister.

1419
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,693
Cobb's insane, boy. Wise up. Louder.
Drown them out.

1420
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,493
250 a week is just too much.
We don't want to hold you up.

1421
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,093
Wait a minute, he didn't say 250, he said 50.

1422
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,832
- How much did you say?
- Fifty.

1423
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:10,998
- And you?
- Fifty.

1424
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:14,305
- Fifty, 50 and 50. 150, that's fine.
- What?

1425
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:17,244
You mean you people each want
150 a week to leave Cobb?

1426
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,304
- We'll give it a serious thought.
- No, we won't.

1427
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:21,714
- What?
- Did she say yes to 150?

1428
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,411
- 150?
- Yes.

1429
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,953
- Yes, sir, you got a deal.
- Parker.

1430
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,513
Leo, shake the man's hand.
150 smackers a week.

1431
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,320
I wonder where their studio is at,
Fort Knox?

1432
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:33,055
- Anybody get the address?
- Hollywood.

1433
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,835
That's very good. Now, don't forget,
it's freezing cold, now. It's cold.

1434
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:48,843
Tex, do you hear me?
Tex, do you understand what I'm saying?

1435
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:53,572
Don't look at me, you'll ruin the shot.
Help them out, give them some snow.

1436
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:56,084
Frank, you've got to talk to that joker
photographing Kathleen.

1437
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,380
He's making her look like an elephant.

1438
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,284
How can I? They got me in bondage here.

1439
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,720
You really ought to shave
that thing off, Leo.

1440
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:03,384
Harrigan, will you leave
my cameraman alone?

1441
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,986
Let those pebbles drop like a rain.
And stop chewing gum.

1442
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,524
Princess.

1443
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:10,327
Did you see those scenes
they've written for Kathleen?

1444
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:11,628
She can't do those.

1445
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,498
Don't worry about Kathy.
Wait till you see Buck.

1446
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:15,093
They got him dressed up just like a fluff.

1447
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,969
Quiet over there, Forsyte.
Leave her alone, Harrigan.

1448
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,942
She's writing for me, if you don't mind.
And quiet that dog.

1449
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,639
- He'll quiet as soon as I leave.
- Harrigan. It looks better on Buck.

1450
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,079
All right, dear, look up!

1451
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:30,916
Atta girl, look up. Look terrified. Terrified.
Lean out a little bit.

1452
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:32,420
Lean out. Now scream.

1453
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,985
- Cut. Cut. Cut.
- I'm all right.

1454
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:37,356
No you're not, you're awful.

1455
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:39,691
You can't have her doing
her own stunts, Stickley!

1456
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:43,254
- Falling out of stagecoaches.
- She isn't supposed to fall out.

1457
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,966
- What's going on here?
- Oh, he's making a fool out of her.

1458
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,093
What's going on here?

1459
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:48,364
- You all right, honey?
- Sure, I'm fine.

1460
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:51,134
- I got her. No, I got her.
- I got her. I got her.

1461
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:55,769
Hey, will you two guys get out of here?
I'll do the directing. Out, out, out!

1462
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:58,871
- Come on, Greenway, off my set!
- Take it easy, will you? Take it easy.

1463
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:02,008
- Look, I'll talk to you later, Kathy.
- I'll talk to you later, darling.

1464
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:04,918
You won't see her later. You take care
of yourself and I'll take care of my wife.

1465
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:09,014
You can't even take care of yourself.
Look at you. You look ridiculous.

1466
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:11,219
I know I look ridiculous. I look like a twit.

1467
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:13,023
Okay, come on, Greenway,
we're all waiting.

1468
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,587
Nobody can act in these socks.

1469
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:17,656
At least it didn't take me
nine months to grow a mustache.

1470
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,827
Now daintily.

1471
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,530
- Well, it's about time.
- Okay, camera.

1472
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:25,601
Okay, boys.

1473
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:30,771
No, no, no, no.

1474
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:32,246
Harold, if you're going to kiss her,

1475
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:35,375
you take her in your arms,
you kiss her on the mouth.

1476
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,852
But, my dear sir,
this young lady is playing my daughter.

1477
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,479
What? Let me see the script.

1478
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,615
- I gotta start reading these things.
- It might help.

1479
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:44,660
Well, they throw them
on the lawn like a newspaper.

1480
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:47,059
How do you expect
to get anything prepared?

1481
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,738
Drinking your lunch again, Harrigan?

1482
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:01,538
Maybe that's why
you're a day behind schedule.

1483
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,079
Give me my own people,
I'll bring them in on time.

1484
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:08,049
Atlantic wants product, not excuses.
And we want it fast.

1485
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:12,520
And as for the scenario you submitted,
<i>The Half-Breed Kid,</i> it's a stinker.

1486
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:15,455
We want entertainment,
not so much of junk about Indians.

1487
01:28:15,524 --> 01:28:18,756
Christ, it's so long
it took me almost an hour to read it.

1488
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:20,523
How many pages a day
am I supposed to shoot, Mr. Blacker?

1489
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:25,761
- Five. At least, Harrigan, and you know it.
- I remember. May I see the script, please?

1490
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,861
- Thank you very much. Five, was it?
- Five.

1491
01:28:28,937 --> 01:28:33,739
One, two, three, four, five.

1492
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:39,277
Here we are.
And we're right back on schedule.

1493
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,983
You're on the verge, Harrigan.
Right on the goddamn verge.

1494
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:47,181
Six months you've been here
and never once you been in line.

1495
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:50,020
Neither you or any of your goddamn friends.

1496
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:54,961
You're nothing but a troublemaker.
A goddamn, shoddy, Irish hooligan!

1497
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,124
Well, sir. I wouldn't want to make you a liar.

1498
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,964
- No, sir. I sure wouldn't.
- Hey, hey, Harrigan.

1499
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:14,605
Don't throw your problems on me, Dan.

1500
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:18,552
You're through. Washed up. Get out!
Get out!

1501
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,886
Pick up your pay and out of here
or I'll have you arrested for trespassing.

1502
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:25,193
Do you hear? This is private property!

1503
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,238
Let's go.

1504
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:43,734
Come on.

1505
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,115
Here we go.

1506
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:51,214
What are you so jumpy about?

1507
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:52,754
Yeah, what?

1508
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:54,881
I, I, I...

1509
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,050
We came back
to pick up Mrs. Greenway's wardrobe.

1510
01:29:57,125 --> 01:30:00,289
- She forgot it this afternoon.
- Who said that?

1511
01:30:00,362 --> 01:30:01,489
What do you want?

1512
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:04,965
- My, my, my...
- Her wardrobe trunk.

1513
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:08,501
Better put on your glasses.
Might need to see something.

1514
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,402
Oh, good idea.

1515
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:18,112
- I left my trunk when...
- Where?

1516
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,580
- Wardrobe, where else?
- Keep your eye on the pipsqueak.

1517
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:23,710
I left my wardrobe trunk when...

1518
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,651
- What are you so nervous about?
- I'm hot.

1519
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,990
- It's 50 degrees.
- I'm cold.

1520
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:35,826
- Don't seem to know what you are.
- I'm hot and cold.

1521
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:42,061
Let's go. That way.

1522
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:43,765
- It ain't gonna work.
- Yes, it is.

1523
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,672
Well, just don't anybody
leave any fingerprints. I read that in a story.

1524
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,767
- What did you say, Buck?
- Fingerprints.

1525
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:49,867
Fingerprints?

1526
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,709
Little grease marks
on the end of your fingertips.

1527
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,908
Well, I don't know about you, Buck,
but my fingers aren't greasy.

1528
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:56,213
Everybody's are.
That's how the police tell it was you.

1529
01:30:57,252 --> 01:30:58,481
Look out.

1530
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:01,581
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

1531
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:10,821
- Good going, Greenway.
- I ain't no damn robber is why.

1532
01:31:17,372 --> 01:31:19,068
You want to play cards?

1533
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:23,037
Where are you going? Here it is.

1534
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:33,649
- Well, it says camera department.
- Come on, Buck.

1535
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:39,024
There is the door.

1536
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:44,831
- Well, this one's locked.
- Frank will take care of it. Frank.

1537
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,094
Taking.

1538
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:00,412
You want to pick one
of these cameras, Leo?

1539
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:01,541
Just throw this blanket over it,

1540
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:03,414
'cause that's the kind of company
we are again.

1541
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:04,509
- A blanket company.
- Yes, sir.

1542
01:32:04,586 --> 01:32:06,919
- Oh, hurry up, you hear?
- Buck, strike one of these, will you?

1543
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:10,516
- Yeah, come on, Dan. Make yourself useful.
- I should've stood at home.

1544
01:32:10,592 --> 01:32:13,221
- How much film we need, do you think?
- Enough for a four-reel feature.

1545
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:15,058
<i>- The Half-Breed Kid?</i>
- You know what, Leo?

1546
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,598
- A four-reeler?
- You really are loco.

1547
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:19,600
- Maybe five.
- That's over an hour long.

1548
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:20,862
Long pictures are coming in.

1549
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:22,870
Ain't nobody stayed
in a theater over an hour.

1550
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,702
Sarah Bernhardt's done one.
D.W. Griffith's working on two, I hear.

1551
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:28,243
- Come on, let's go.
- Not with stolen film, they ain't.

1552
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:36,542
Looks like it might rain.

1553
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:41,317
- I wouldn't know. I can't see a damn thing.
- I think so.

1554
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,751
Now!

1555
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:46,920
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.

1556
01:32:57,372 --> 01:32:58,431
Gin.

1557
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:14,219
- How am I doing?
- Better than me. I hate horses.

1558
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:16,758
How come we didn't come out here
in the damn truck?

1559
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:19,351
Because it couldn't cross this pass.

1560
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,128
"Beware of jealousy, my Lord.

1561
01:33:22,197 --> 01:33:24,928
"'Tis the green-eyed monster
that mocks the meat it feeds on."

1562
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,832
That's from <i>Othello.</i>

1563
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,735
- What fellow?
<i>- Othello</i> by William Shakespeare.

1564
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:31,898
Oh, yeah, I've heard of him.

1565
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:41,443
That's good, yelling and shooting.

1566
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:46,112
Now ride up to him, Kathy.
Ride, catch up to him. Good.

1567
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,756
Kathy! Oh, God, is she all right?

1568
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:49,813
- Kathy!
- Cut?

1569
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:51,359
No, no. Keep turning.

1570
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:54,419
That's right, save her, Dan. Keep going.
Tell them to keep coming.

1571
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:58,597
- Jump?
- Jump.

1572
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,726
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1573
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:02,031
- How was it?
- Are you kidding?

1574
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:04,299
- Are you kidding?
- Go on, Dan! Shoot at them.

1575
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,840
Elmer, tell them to fall.

1576
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,149
Cut. Perfect.

1577
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:17,242
- Oh, Dan.
- Kathy, you all right?

1578
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:18,445
- That just couldn't have been better.
- Yeah, I'm great.

1579
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,920
Oh, that ain't acting.

1580
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,083
Well, tomorrow starts the Indian part.

1581
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,287
- Off goes the mustache.
- Oh, his mustache.

1582
01:34:26,361 --> 01:34:28,762
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Hey, babe.

1583
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:32,824
- Think you could do that fall again?
- I didn't fall, the horse did.

1584
01:34:43,578 --> 01:34:45,638
Elmer, tell them we cut!

1585
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:53,110
Four reels, Kathy, almost an hour.

1586
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:56,022
And I'm gonna tell a story
with enough punch to put us all on the map.

1587
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,754
L. Taylor Harrigan's <i>The Half-Breed Kid.</i>
And this one is from the heart,

1588
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:02,888
because you know, the Indian,
he's like the Irish, the way I see it.

1589
01:35:02,964 --> 01:35:05,900
He's been robbed and pillaged,
he's been starved off his homeland.

1590
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:08,266
It's a blot on our escutcheon,
for Christ's sake.

1591
01:35:08,336 --> 01:35:11,500
And it's the stuff of great drama,
don't you see?

1592
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:15,240
Well, you know, cowboys and Indians.

1593
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:21,041
Hey, Leo!

1594
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,641
The sun does go down around here,
you know.

1595
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,186
We're ready.

1596
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:31,384
Elmer, bring the cowboys...
I mean, bring the Indians over here.

1597
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:35,021
- No go. Devil Mountain.
- I need them in the shot.

1598
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,962
What's the matter, Alice?
They want more money?

1599
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,055
I don't know.

1600
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:40,761
Elmer, all they've got to do
is walk into the shot.

1601
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:43,168
No go. Devil Mountain.

1602
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:47,272
- Jesus.
- Light's going, Coach.

1603
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:48,867
Harrigan!

1604
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:53,775
Is this the way you want me?

1605
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,510
- Perfect.
- Perfect?

1606
01:35:56,351 --> 01:35:57,979
I look like a damn girl.

1607
01:35:58,052 --> 01:35:59,645
- I look like Theda Bara.
- All right, here we go. Princess.

1608
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:01,451
- Yes, sir.
- Elmer, you have the Indians stand guard.

1609
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,649
Grab the mirror and bring the powder.

1610
01:36:02,724 --> 01:36:04,955
Come on, Frank,
let's get a little closer to Hiawatha.

1611
01:36:05,026 --> 01:36:07,359
The Indians are afraid
of the damn mountain or something.

1612
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:11,229
- I heard that. What do you mean, afraid?
- How should I know? Superstitious.

1613
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,859
They probably think
the mountain is bad luck or something.

1614
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,233
Now, I've sent Kathy to the top.

1615
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:17,932
All you've got to do
is climb up there and rescue her.

1616
01:36:18,006 --> 01:36:19,099
Rescue her?

1617
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:21,506
- Who's going to rescue me?
- Well, pretend you're rescuing her.

1618
01:36:21,576 --> 01:36:23,738
You can pretend, can't you?
What you getting paid for?

1619
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,939
I ain't getting paid, 'cause crime don't pay.

1620
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:28,074
- I should've known that.
- Oh, cut it out, Dan. It's gotta look real.

1621
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,139
Now when you get to that bush there,

1622
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:31,448
Elmer's gonna let off
a little dynamite charge.

1623
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,920
- Dynamite?
- Just a little, to look like a bullet hit.

1624
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:36,116
It's buried right by that bush there.

1625
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,886
Well, I ain't gonna do it,
how do you like that?

1626
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,053
Okay, swell. Well,
we won't have any cowboys in the shot.

1627
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,858
We won't have any bullets.
We won't have anything.

1628
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:45,331
- Well, just forget it. Let's go home.
- Okay, okay, stop acting.

1629
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,303
- You're a lousy actor. Where do I stop?
- You don't. You let the dynamite stop you.

1630
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,498
Elmer won't let you get too close
before he sets it off.

1631
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:54,940
- Here I am. I'm ready.
- Kathy, put some clothes on.

1632
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:57,410
- This is my costume.
- Well, where's the rest of it?

1633
01:36:57,478 --> 01:37:01,279
- Let's go, Dan. We're losing the light.
- Okay. Let's get her over with.

1634
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:05,150
All right, here we go. Be natural.
And camera.

1635
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,282
Good, fine. That's fine.

1636
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:12,452
Now make it look near impossible.

1637
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:15,190
- I don't have to act.
- All right now, Elmer.

1638
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,262
Get ready with that charge.

1639
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,563
That's right, good. And...

1640
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:21,034
Now.

1641
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,062
No, no, no. Cut it.

1642
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:26,767
No good, no good. You anticipated.
You flinched.

1643
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,865
I did not.

1644
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,434
- Buck, you okay, Buck?
- He flinched.

1645
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:34,846
Well, who wouldn't flinch from dynamite?
That's a pure sign of intelligence.

1646
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:39,012
Flinching probably saved my life 200 times
since I met you, Harrigan.

1647
01:37:39,087 --> 01:37:41,921
Well, by the time Elmer resets,
the damn light will be gone.

1648
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:44,618
- About gone now, Leo.
- That ain't my fault.

1649
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,217
Oh, who the hell said it was?

1650
01:37:46,294 --> 01:37:49,128
I swear, Harrigan,
one of these days I'm gonna kill you.

1651
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,723
Well, just don't scalp me, Chief.

1652
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:54,869
That ain't funny.

1653
01:37:54,936 --> 01:37:57,098
- Sure it is.
- It ain't funny.

1654
01:37:57,171 --> 01:38:00,164
Oh, Buck, he was only just fooling.

1655
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:02,972
Yeah, that's what you always think.
He was only fooling.

1656
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:06,446
Well, I'm tired of being the butt of it.
I'm tired of being made a fool of all the time,

1657
01:38:06,514 --> 01:38:08,278
risking my neck,
and never getting paid for it.

1658
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:09,612
Oh, come on, Dan, what is it?

1659
01:38:09,684 --> 01:38:10,879
- What's the matter?
- Don't "Dan" me.

1660
01:38:10,952 --> 01:38:12,818
I'm sick of this pipe dream.

1661
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,847
Sneaking around like a common thief,
making this great damn feature.

1662
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:19,325
Well, who the hell cares?
It's just another western.

1663
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,953
- Now, come on, be careful.
- Only longer.

1664
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:23,327
Now watch it! I've been
working on this thing for two years.

1665
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:24,696
No, you watch it.

1666
01:38:24,766 --> 01:38:27,702
We could be working for some
legitimate company now and be paid for it

1667
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:30,568
and treated with some kind of respect.
I ain't a damn kid no more.

1668
01:38:30,638 --> 01:38:33,198
You don't mean that, Buck.
You know it wouldn't be the same.

1669
01:38:33,274 --> 01:38:35,266
No, it'd be better.

1670
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,175
And if you're gonna keep
sticking up for him all the time,

1671
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:40,215
maybe you'd be happier with him
and his lot of goddamn hooey.

1672
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:42,648
You don't need to curse, nor yell, neither.

1673
01:38:42,717 --> 01:38:45,084
- We can all hear all right.
- Maybe so.

1674
01:38:45,153 --> 01:38:47,588
But you can't see
he's been after your skirt from the start.

1675
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:50,750
If you're gonna stick up for him all the time,
as far as I'm concerned, he can have it.

1676
01:38:50,825 --> 01:38:52,123
Buck!

1677
01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:55,964
I don't need your darn permission,
Tom Greenway.

1678
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,023
No, well, you got it, ma'am.
And welcome to it.

1679
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:03,030
I quit.

1680
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:08,175
Hey, come back here. Where are you going?
You can't quit on us.

1681
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:14,072
Devil Mountain.

1682
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,583
- You look terrible.
- Thank you.

1683
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:29,783
Well, don't you notice anything?

1684
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,291
- What?
- It's gone.

1685
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,988
- Oh, yes.
- Frank found him.

1686
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:35,529
I was going to take a bath.

1687
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:38,088
- Good, I'll keep guard.
- What?

1688
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:39,690
I need a glass.

1689
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:46,273
How's <i>The Half-Breed Kid?</i>

1690
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,674
- Half-baked.
- Poor Mulligan.

1691
01:40:50,645 --> 01:40:53,205
I remember the first time
you ever called me that.

1692
01:40:53,281 --> 01:40:55,614
Now don't get mushy. Where is he?

1693
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:59,913
<i>I'll take you home again...</i>

1694
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,384
I thought you were
the prettiest thing I ever saw.

1695
01:41:03,457 --> 01:41:05,483
- Leo.
- On the trolley.

1696
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,052
In my Pullman, hanging by your foot.

1697
01:41:08,129 --> 01:41:11,293
- Oh, God, remember that?
- Bloomers out.

1698
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:17,032
He's at the Alexandria. Drink your wine.

1699
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:22,742
- I'm very boring when I'm drunk.
- Very boring.

1700
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:35,422
My bath.

1701
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:40,893
- Oh, that's perfect.
- What a mess.

1702
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:43,925
- Here, I got it.
- Oh, that's okay, I got it.

1703
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:45,489
I got it.

1704
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:57,144
- Kathy.
- Leo.

1705
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,643
- Kathy.
- Now, Leo.

1706
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,382
It's just about right.
Not too hot, not too cold.

1707
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,115
Give me a hand.

1708
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:15,055
- Did you hear something?
- Just a crash.

1709
01:42:17,732 --> 01:42:21,191
- What?
- I thought I heard something by the shack.

1710
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:24,102
- Isn't Leo out there?
- I don't know, maybe.

1711
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,754
Nothing.

1712
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:44,189
Leo says those Patents guys can smell
a blanket company five miles away.

1713
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:45,590
- Three.
- Three?

1714
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,856
I heard it was only three.

1715
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:50,625
Leo. Come here, Leo. Leo.

1716
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,970
What are you thinking?

1717
01:42:57,571 --> 01:43:01,064
I was thinking, what would happen
if Buck came home now?

1718
01:43:01,142 --> 01:43:02,633
Why? Nothing happened.

1719
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:06,909
Well, here I am in his house, in his robe,
on his bed, with his wife.

1720
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:11,310
No jury in the world would convict him
if he shot me.

1721
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:13,149
Leo.

1722
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:17,191
- It's not that I don't love you.
- Yeah, yeah?

1723
01:43:17,258 --> 01:43:19,022
It's just that I can't.

1724
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:22,458
Now what if I'd been
in that balloon instead of Buck?

1725
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,520
Yeah?

1726
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:26,761
Would he be here now
and I'd be in some hotel?

1727
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:30,100
- That's hard to say.
- Yeah, but I'd shoot him.

1728
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:39,703
- Do you hear that?
- It's going to go by.

1729
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:46,817
- It's the neighbors.
- I'm the neighbors.

1730
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:49,548
- Kathy-o!
- I don't believe it.

1731
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:52,092
- You upstairs, honey?
- Get out the window, quick!

1732
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:55,027
- I don't believe it. My clothes.
- Oh, my God.

1733
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:59,330
- Honey.
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

1734
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:05,134
- You up here, honey?
- Be natural.

1735
01:44:05,206 --> 01:44:07,038
Okay, okay, okay.

1736
01:44:07,108 --> 01:44:09,839
I'll be right out, Buck. Just a second.

1737
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,339
Honey.

1738
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:16,316
I had me a long thinking.

1739
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:18,875
I was afraid
you might even change the locks.

1740
01:44:18,953 --> 01:44:21,286
I'll be right out, Tom.

1741
01:44:27,528 --> 01:44:29,121
I know I've been kind of wrong.

1742
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:32,492
- What was that?
- Must be that old cat.

1743
01:44:33,968 --> 01:44:34,958
Stay here, Kathy.

1744
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:37,630
- It's them Patents bastards.
- Buck, wait.

1745
01:44:43,144 --> 01:44:45,807
- Don't shoot, it's me. You're back.
- Did you see him?

1746
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,849
That's where he fell, I guess.

1747
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:51,613
See the trail? Goes behind the garage.
I think he's cornered.

1748
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:52,709
What is it, Frank?

1749
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,312
- Stay right there, Alice.
- Buck, you're back.

1750
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:56,084
All right, come on out, mister.

1751
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,719
You can't get away, so don't try.

1752
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:03,356
I got a rifle here
and the sorry end's pointing your way.

1753
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:16,971
These aren't my clothes.

1754
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,174
Yeah.

1755
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:39,758
- Frank, go after him.
- Take my car.

1756
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,360
- He'll hurt himself.
- The keys are in it.

1757
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:51,839
Alice!

1758
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,547
Alice!

1759
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:02,249
- Jesus, God!
- Alice!

1760
01:46:02,323 --> 01:46:04,588
- Alice, for God's sake!
- I'm all right.

1761
01:46:04,658 --> 01:46:06,183
- You sure?
- Sure.

1762
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,286
They got the camera, too.
They got everything.

1763
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:11,127
- Some guard, Frank.
- Some friend, Leo.

1764
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,030
- Nothing happened.
- What are you talking about?

1765
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,729
- Don't be such a saint, Frank.
- Okay.

1766
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:17,601
Frank, wait.

1767
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,267
I'm sorry.

1768
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:26,370
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1769
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:35,480
- Yeah, what is it?
- Telegram, telegram for Mr. Greenway.

1770
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:48,691
- Telegram?
- Well, more like a package.

1771
01:46:48,769 --> 01:46:51,261
See? It says here, "Deliver at 10."

1772
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:56,799
Well, that could be a mistake.

1773
01:46:56,877 --> 01:46:58,345
It was.

1774
01:47:01,482 --> 01:47:05,214
- Don't even tell me about it.
- There's nothing to tell, Tom.

1775
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,398
They gave me the damn bridal suite.

1776
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,731
I'd love to see it.

1777
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:23,699
Come on in.

1778
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:03,504
- Are you just going to climb in that bottle?
- Maybe.

1779
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:13,447
- Go say you're sorry.
- For what? They wouldn't listen anyway.

1780
01:48:15,422 --> 01:48:17,653
You were getting pretty good, you know.

1781
01:48:17,725 --> 01:48:21,753
Yeah, I'm particularly good
without a camera or film or actors.

1782
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:25,823
- What's the matter with me?
- I give up, what's the matter with you?

1783
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:29,165
They like little girls in pictures, you know.
Look at Mary Pickford.

1784
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:32,934
- Mary Pickford is 20 years old.
- See? And I'm younger even.

1785
01:48:36,443 --> 01:48:39,538
- Not bad. You could be in them, too.
- Thank you very much.

1786
01:48:39,613 --> 01:48:42,048
I've got some money saved up.
And we can get Frank to help us.

1787
01:48:42,116 --> 01:48:43,209
I don't think so.

1788
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:45,775
- What?
- I don't think so.

1789
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:48,186
Well, maybe Dobie and the boys, then.
They'd do it.

1790
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:49,883
And then we can sell the ostrich farm.

1791
01:48:49,957 --> 01:48:53,894
- Aunt Lula will never forgive us.
- We'll let her keep Randolph.

1792
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:23,155
- Here we are. Smile, honey.
- I'm smiling.

1793
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:24,816
Hey, it's the Greenways.

1794
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:40,831
Leo, stop it.
Stop barking at Leo all the time.

1795
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:42,809
That's all right. He's just excited.

1796
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:45,846
- Mr. Harrigan.
- Hey, Leo. Alice.

1797
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:47,404
Keep an eye on the dog, will you?

1798
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:54,618
- You are pretty.
- Yes, she's pretty. Come on, honey.

1799
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:33,257
Boy, I sure hope it's better than the play.

1800
01:50:33,327 --> 01:50:36,491
- I hear he's changing the title for New York.
- Yeah? To what?

1801
01:50:36,563 --> 01:50:38,429
<i>The Birth of a Nation.</i>

1802
01:53:15,222 --> 01:53:17,214
Griffith! Griffith!

1803
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:20,851
Griffith! Griffith!

1804
01:53:22,329 --> 01:53:24,764
Griffith! Griffith!

1805
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:26,424
Griffith!

1806
01:53:29,036 --> 01:53:32,632
Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith!

1807
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:19,181
Here, hold this.

1808
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,161
Honey, hold my hat.

1809
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:40,268
- Are you all right?
- What's going on?

1810
01:54:41,141 --> 01:54:42,803
Harrigan. Greenbush.

1811
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,538
Where the hell have you been
when I need you?

1812
01:54:44,611 --> 01:54:47,012
- How's that?
- I'm inspired, but damn it, I'm stumped.

1813
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,049
- I beg your pardon.
- I want a war story. A big one.

1814
01:54:49,116 --> 01:54:50,243
Civil war, I suppose.

1815
01:54:50,317 --> 01:54:52,218
The war in Europe, Irish. Pay attention.

1816
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:54,516
- What war in Europe?
- What war in Europe?

1817
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:56,147
- Marty!
- What? Oh, yes.

1818
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,852
I want you all to meet my bride,
Mrs. H.H. Cobb. Everyone calls her Marty.

1819
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:01,394
- Mr. Cobb...
- What? What? What?

1820
01:55:01,762 --> 01:55:02,923
Hello, gang.

1821
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:04,931
- Marty.
- Hi there, Marty.

1822
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:06,899
- Marty.
- Hi, kiddo.

1823
01:55:06,967 --> 01:55:09,835
Buck. Hello, Frank.

1824
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,438
Hello, Marty.

1825
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:14,534
Well, where was I, Bertha?

1826
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:16,008
- Come on, boys.
- Mr. Cobb...

1827
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:18,101
- If you don't...
- Did you see what I saw tonight?

1828
01:55:18,178 --> 01:55:19,737
Now, this thing
is going to change the business.

1829
01:55:19,813 --> 01:55:21,111
The Patents Trust is wiped out.

1830
01:55:21,181 --> 01:55:23,650
The greatest motion picture
of all time has just been unfurled,

1831
01:55:23,717 --> 01:55:25,982
and it was made by a blanket company.
That's the magic.

1832
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:28,988
That's the mystery.
There's no stopping this business.

1833
01:55:29,055 --> 01:55:33,425
The time of the nickelodeon is over.
A new day has dawned.

1834
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:35,655
The epoch of the picture palace.

1835
01:55:35,729 --> 01:55:38,597
Big pictures. Big theaters.
Six reels. Eight reels.

1836
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:40,634
Look at this thing tonight, fifteen reels.

1837
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,134
- Twelve.
- See what I mean?

1838
01:55:42,202 --> 01:55:45,536
Look, I don't want to go that far.
Griffith's a genius, but he's a little crazy.

1839
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:47,699
- He's a little crazy?
- He's a little crazy. You said it.

1840
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:51,108
Harrigan, how long is that Indian script you
used to keep shoving in people's faces?

1841
01:55:51,178 --> 01:55:53,238
<i>- The Half-Breed Kid?</i>
- Four or five reels. Why?

1842
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:54,337
Make it seven!

1843
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:57,043
What are you all standing around here for?
This is the beginning of the world.

1844
01:55:57,117 --> 01:55:59,484
- Mr. Cobb, don't you see...
- Think of it.

1845
01:55:59,553 --> 01:56:04,457
All those people going to see the pictures.
And a lot of them can't even talk American.

1846
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:08,489
Then they don't have to
because pictures are a language

1847
01:56:08,562 --> 01:56:13,523
that everybody understands.
It's like music for the eyes.

1848
01:56:15,435 --> 01:56:20,999
And if you're good, if you're really good,
then maybe what you're doing

1849
01:56:21,074 --> 01:56:27,639
is you're giving them
little tiny pieces of time

1850
01:56:29,349 --> 01:56:31,284
that they never forget.

1851
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,184
Miss Forsyte, your motorcar.

1852
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:41,194
The child owns this? The end is near.

1853
01:56:41,261 --> 01:56:44,129
Shorty, if you're interested in a salary
twice your size, raise your mitt.

1854
01:56:44,197 --> 01:56:45,790
Mr. Cobb, you're trying to bribe us.

1855
01:56:45,866 --> 01:56:47,664
You can't bribe somebody
who doesn't trust you, Irish.

1856
01:56:47,734 --> 01:56:50,226
Get in the car, before they arrest
your husband for assault and battery.

1857
01:56:50,303 --> 01:56:52,499
- What?
- Take a ride, make a getaway,

1858
01:56:52,572 --> 01:56:54,404
- have a script conference.
- Don't pay him no mind, honey.

1859
01:56:54,474 --> 01:56:57,034
What are you waiting for?
Opportunity knocks but twice.

1860
01:56:57,110 --> 01:56:59,375
- For Pete's sake.
- Harrigan, I want a feature.

1861
01:56:59,446 --> 01:57:02,041
A big one. Now whatever you're paying
yourself, I'll double it.

1862
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:04,141
That goes for all of you. Call me tomorrow.

1863
01:57:18,265 --> 01:57:20,063
Where am I driving?

1864
01:57:21,268 --> 01:57:23,567
Okay, that's where I'm driving.

1865
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:49,360
Script conference?

1866
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:52,194
I'd rather quit
than have to work with you again.

1867
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:54,166
- I'd rather quit, period.
- Good.

1868
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:55,862
We finally agree on something.

1869
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:59,066
Might as well quit.

1870
01:57:59,139 --> 01:58:02,906
The best damn picture that's ever
going to be made has already been made.

1871
01:58:02,976 --> 01:58:05,912
You sure as hell
ain't gonna make one better.

1872
01:58:22,696 --> 01:58:24,528
I'm sick of this racket anyway.

1873
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:28,968
Get up at dawn, work all day,
every night, six days a week.

1874
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:31,266
So bushed on the seventh
you can't get out of bed.

1875
01:58:31,338 --> 01:58:34,240
- No family.
- No home or nothing.

1876
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:41,705
And these directors you work with today,
they don't know their left from their right.

1877
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:43,340
Yeah, well, I hear
you've been directing them yourself,

1878
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:45,647
so that doesn't surprise me.

1879
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:49,349
I've seen your acting.
I wouldn't be talking if I was you.

1880
01:58:51,925 --> 01:58:54,554
Yeah, the fun's gone out of it, sure.

1881
01:58:57,964 --> 01:58:59,364
Look at that.

1882
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:03,393
<i>Bring the camera over there.</i>

1883
01:59:04,104 --> 01:59:06,232
They're shooting a picture.

1884
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:25,922
<i>Half-Breed Kid,</i> huh?
Well, I ain't much of a kid no more.

1885
01:59:28,128 --> 01:59:30,723
You could shave your mustache.

1886
01:59:30,797 --> 01:59:33,232
Oh, his mustache?

1887
01:59:33,299 --> 01:59:37,361
- Give me 10 years.
- Give us all 10 years.

1888
01:59:37,804 --> 01:59:39,432
<i>Music.</i>

1889
01:59:39,506 --> 01:59:41,338
Well, I'm getting sick.

1890
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:43,943
I got a real great idea for the finish.

1891
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:46,570
Hey, Leo, remember what Cobb said,
he wants a seven-reeler.

1892
01:59:46,646 --> 01:59:49,138
That finish is my idea, Harrigan.

1893
01:59:50,283 --> 01:59:51,876
<i>Camera.</i>

1894
01:59:55,055 --> 01:59:56,216
<i>Action!</i>

1894
01:59:57,305 --> 02:00:57,747
