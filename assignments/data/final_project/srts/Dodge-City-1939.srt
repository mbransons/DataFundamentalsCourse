1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,468
There's the 23rd marker, sir.

3
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,103
Twenty-three miles
in one hour and 14 minutes.

4
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,908
Gentlemen, that is moving.

5
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,609
Our engineer is trying to set a record
on the first run.

6
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,142
But I doubt if we can maintain this speed
on our regular schedule.

7
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,281
Why not? If this train can do it,
the rest of them can.

8
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,758
Providing Col. Dodge's new town
is worth speeding to reach.

9
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,385
Worth it? You wait and see.

10
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,987
Now it's just the end of the line,
but in a few years...

11
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,330
it'll give your railroad more business
than any town west of Chicago.

12
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,303
I hope you're right, Colonel. You've stuck
to that argument for five years.

13
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,498
Why shouldn't I?

14
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:24,134
I've raised that town
from two hog pens and a buffalo waller.

15
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,902
How big is it now, Colonel?

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,440
Well, at the last census, gentlemen,
they had three buffalo wallers.

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,081
Look, there goes the stagecoach
from Wichita.

18
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,318
We'll be carrying the mail from now on.

19
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,323
Listen to that snorting teapot.
She's already winded.

20
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,423
By Jove, we'll run her into the ground.

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,526
Better put your whip to them.

22
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,339
- Willie?
- Yes, sir, boss?

23
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,140
You go up and tell our engineer...

24
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,205
if that stagecoach beats us
to the end of the line, he's fired.

25
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,717
Yes, sir. And if this train go any faster...

26
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,343
I'm gonna get off and walk...

27
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,911
'cause I don't like this zest of the Lord.

28
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,374
By George, he's making a good showing,
you know it.

29
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,078
- We'll get him.
- We'd better get up some speed here.

30
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,491
- There he goes.
- We've got him.

31
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,932
Gentlemen, that's a symbol
of America's future: progress.

32
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,906
Iron men and iron horses.
You can't beat them.

33
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,031
Lucky devils.
Nothing to do, but eat and sleep.

34
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,566
That's right, hardhead.

35
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,626
The only difference between you and them
is a pair of horns.

36
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,830
Hush.

37
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,101
Say, Wade, let's cut out a couple of them.

38
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,837
No. We've killed our last buffalo, boys.

39
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,641
The railroad's finished
and so is our contract.

40
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,842
Besides, we've a little appointment
to keep, you know.

41
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,145
Come on.

42
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,312
Here comes our meal ticket
for the last six months.

43
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,785
So that's what a steam engine looks like:
a coffeepot on wheels.

44
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,550
Come on,
let's pay our respects to the Colonel.

45
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,942
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Fine, son. See you soon.

46
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,308
We'll be there.

47
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,545
By golly, Dodge,
you know everybody in Kansas.

48
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,989
Not quite.
Those boys have been working for us...

49
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,254
hunting buffalo
to feed our construction gang.

50
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,126
The young Irishman is Wade Hatton.
I met him during the war.

51
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,358
He fought for the rebels
in Jeb Stuart's cavalry.

52
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,561
Been everywhere, done everything.
Sort of a rover.

53
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,469
Well, it takes all sorts of men
to build a railroad.

54
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,337
No, sir. Just a couple of us Irishmen.

55
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,410
On your toes, men!
We're gonna start moving.

56
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,313
Watch those hides they don't slip.

57
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,545
Keep on your toes.
We're gonna start moving.

58
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,645
You drivers keep close together.

59
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,222
Ready to start whenever you say, Jeff.

60
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,421
All right, let's move fast!

61
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,591
- Which one of you men is Jeff Surrett?
- I am. Why?

62
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,924
I'm John Barlow, Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, from Kansas.

63
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,192
- You're under arrest. All three of you.
- For what?

64
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,063
For the illegal killing of buffalo
and selling their hides.

65
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,865
We got those buffalo on free land,
just the same as he did.

66
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,101
He has a government permit
to kill buffalo for the railroad workers.

67
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,699
- You got any such permit?
- No.

68
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,270
- Is this some of your business, Hatton?
- I made it my business.

69
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,748
As soon as I found out you were
shooting buffalo on Indian territory...

70
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,479
stealing the hides,
and letting the meat rot in the sun.

71
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,545
When any Indians protested,
you shot them down in cold blood.

72
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,147
This has been going on all winter.

73
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,022
It took you till now to catch up with us?

74
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,961
We didn't want to. We just watched you
and counted the animals you killed.

75
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,363
You're lying. You'd have made them
stop us before, if you'd known.

76
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:25,768
Why? It seemed a better idea to let
you and your pals work your head off...

77
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,239
packing and curing those hides
until they caught you.

78
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,538
So that's why you waited so long?

79
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,103
The Indians might just as well
get the hides in good salable condition.

80
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,580
All right, Hatton.

81
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,018
But I hope you stick around Kansas
for a long time...

82
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,487
because we're gonna collect
for every one of those hides in full.

83
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,616
Right. If you're ever around our way,
look us up.

84
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,384
All right, boys.

85
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,668
- Congratulations, Colonel.
- Thanks, Rusty.

86
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,373
Wade, you've been a great help
in building this railroad.

87
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,848
Now the real work begins.
We've got to make it pay.

88
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,009
That's up to you.

89
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,612
No, it isn't. I've got other work to do.
We're looking further westward.

90
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,351
I want you to take charge here,
help build up this town.

91
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,757
- Organize trade for our road.
- No, thanks, sir.

92
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,490
We're on our way back to Texas.
We'll drive cattle up to meet your railroad.

93
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,330
If we keep hanging around here,
these two galoots are gonna get civilized.

94
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,132
We better leave here before old fog head
starts eating with a knife and fork.

95
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,729
A knife, anyway.

96
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,741
You couldn't keep Wade here, Colonel.

97
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,004
He's the most moving-on man
you ever saw.

98
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,512
First off, he was in the English Army
over in India.

99
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,107
Then he got mixed up in some kind
of a hooray revolution down in Cuba way.

100
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,314
Then he started punching cattle in Texas.
That was before he enlisted in the war.

101
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,982
So he's either the greatest traveler
ever lived...

102
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,048
or else he is the biggest liar.

103
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,429
And now, it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

104
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,832
the man who made this progress possible:
Col. Dodge.

105
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,572
Ladies and gentlemen...

106
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,735
today a great chapter of history
has been written...

107
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,404
and we take justifiable pride...

108
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,382
in bringing this railroad to the terminal
furthest west in this country.

109
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,851
Someday, and I believe
it will be in the near future...

110
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,958
a great city will spring from this very spot
upon which we now stand.

111
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,031
A city which will represent
all that the West stands for:

112
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,236
honesty, courage, morality, and culture.

113
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,402
For all the noble virtues of civilization.

114
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:20,544
I can see a great metropolis of homes,
churches, schools.

115
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,081
A fine, decent city, which will become
the flower of the prairie.

116
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,985
A city whose name...

117
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:41,023
Yeah, Colonel. Just what do you aim
to call this here perfect metropolis?

118
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,930
What are we going to call it?

119
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,496
Why not call it after the man
who made it possible? Dodge City.

120
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,134
That's right. Dodge City it is.

121
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,593
Be sure to give those cattle plenty of salt.

122
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,122
The more water, the more weight.

123
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,239
Cattle is sure some business.

124
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,999
They must come to Dodge City
from all over the world, don't they, Pop?

125
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,170
Almost, son. Hold my horse.

126
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,358
Wait, Surrett. You can't ship those cattle.
Where's my money?

127
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,620
You'll get it, Cole.
Why don't you stop worrying?

128
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,185
You've got no right to ship those cattle
until I'm paid.

129
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,721
$15,000 dollars, cash in hand.
Those were the terms we agreed on.

130
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,463
Take it easy. I can't be running to the bank
every time a train leaves town.

131
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,869
If you don't trust me,
other cattle brokers will.

132
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,532
Maybe they used to, Surrett...

133
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,066
but not since what happened
to Sam Chapin and Kit Sproull.

134
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,073
They trusted you, too, didn't they?
But not me.

135
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,117
I'm coming to your place tonight
to collect for these steers.

136
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,847
You have the money waiting for me,
or I'm slapping a warrant on you.

137
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,086
You gotta get what's yours
when dealing with men like that.

138
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,426
They're no good.

139
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,524
Sure, Pop, but we can handle them.

140
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,377
Hold my horse, son.
I won't be but a minute.

141
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,609
Take your time, Pop,
but get all that's coming to us.

142
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,379
- Come along, boys, this is the place.
- Here's the Texan!

143
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,414
You look great tonight, Ruby.
I sure like that new dress.

144
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,888
- Thanks, darling.
- Just for luck.

145
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,323
You don't need any more luck.

146
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,020
That's right, I don't,
not as long as I've got you.

147
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,426
That's me.

148
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,506
- Hello, Surrett, I was looking for you.
- Hello, Matt.

149
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,706
You ready to see me?

150
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,341
- I was on my way up to get your money.
- I'll go with you.

151
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,942
Mind waiting a few minutes?
I got some business first.

152
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,386
I don't mind.
But don't try and run out on me.

153
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,185
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

154
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,589
Don't worry. I'm gonna
take care of you in a minute.

155
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,491
Come on over and wet your whistle.

156
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,621
- Hey, Jack.
- Yes, sir?

157
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,029
Give Mr. Cole anything he wants,
on the house.

158
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,863
Yes, sir. What'll it be, Mr. Cole?

159
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,062
- A glass of beer, please.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,174
Nice-looking bunch of steers
we shipped today, Cole.

161
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,876
Yeah. They'd look a lot better
if I'd been paid for them.

162
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,851
What do you mean?
Haven't we always paid?

163
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,409
Not from what I've heard.

164
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,752
Maybe you've been listening
to too much talk.

165
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,155
Maybe. Maybe not.

166
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,260
Are you calling me a liar?

167
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,796
I'm not calling you anything, Yancey.
In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all.

168
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,130
- Keep your hand off that gun!
- Why, I...

169
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,844
"... in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection of the dead.

170
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,408
"Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

171
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,479
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
as in heaven, so in earth.

172
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,560
"Give us day by day our daily bread,
and forgive us our debts...

173
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,687
"as we also forgive everyone
that is indebted to us.

174
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,860
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen. "

175
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,445
To have him go this way.

176
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,545
It's so cruel, so useless.

177
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,115
You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom.

178
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,703
John, will you look after Mrs. Cole?

179
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,832
You don't have to, Mr. Orth.
I can take care of her.

180
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,934
That's right, Harry.
You're the man of the family now.

181
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,747
Funeral's over.

182
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,215
There's your man, Marshal.
Serve your warrant.

183
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,412
It's about time those guerrillas
were taken in hand.

184
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,618
What are you waiting for? Go on.

185
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,818
Don't push me. I know my duties.

186
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,725
Hello, Marshal.

187
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,133
Yancey, I've got a warrant here
to arrest you for the murder of...

188
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,469
Matt Cole.

189
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,440
Why don't you go ahead and serve it?
What are you waiting for?

190
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,274
- Mind riding back into town with me?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,043
That's all right, Yancey.
You go ahead and ride in with the Marshal.

192
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,277
Why, sure, Marshal. Come along.

193
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,281
Come on, boys. Come on, Al.
After all, the law's the law.

194
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,089
Now, just a minute, Marshal.

195
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,062
- This is your...
- Now, hold on there, boys.

196
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,190
- Wait a minute.
- Get him in there, boys. Hurry up.

197
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,639
Come on, boys.
We'll ride him out of town in style.

198
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,083
What's the use of trying to make
an honest town of Dodge City?

199
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,025
Surrett's crowd scares off the honest,
law-abiding settlers.

200
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,790
They're all going on to Wichita
and Kansas City.

201
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,430
I tell you, Ellen,
we're the public disgrace of America.

202
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,629
You know what the New York newspapers
are saying?

203
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,573
There's no law west of Chicago,
and west of Dodge City, no God.

204
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,710
I'm afraid they're not far wrong.

205
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,179
It's becoming unsafe for a woman to walk
on the streets in this town.

206
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,715
And as for children...

207
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,877
I almost wish Lee and Abbie
weren't coming to live with us.

208
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,787
They'll be all right, unless
they're as bullheaded as their father was.

209
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,689
We haven't had a word from them
since they reached Texas.

210
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,989
When do you suppose
they're gonna get here?

211
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,893
I kept a record somewhere.

212
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,091
- I always used to...
- They're on the table.

213
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,463
Yeah, the dates.

214
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,561
They left Fort Worth three weeks ago
with a cattle-drive party.

215
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,172
Now, let's see.

216
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,704
Yeah, they must have crossed
the Red River about here...

217
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,543
then on up the Chisholm Trail
into the Indian territory.

218
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,947
I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain
by now.

219
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,379
Tex.

220
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,848
- Have you seen my brother?
- Yes'm.

221
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,386
He's over yonder somewhere
hotfooting it around.

222
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,981
He swiped one of the boss's horses
and I reckon he sure is drunk again.

223
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,390
I consider that a very impertinent remark.

224
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,429
Yes'm, I guess maybe I shouldn't have said
he's drunk...

225
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,089
even if he is drunk.

226
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,638
I don't know what I'm going to do
about you.

227
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,678
Broad Plain, huh?

228
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,678
This is where the Indians
are supposed to be?

229
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,724
Yes. If you keep up the fuss
you're making...

230
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,555
you'll have them right on our doorstep.

231
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,151
I wish they would attack us.

232
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,288
It's dull plugging along like this
day in and day out.

233
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,528
It's dull, but that's no reason
for you to act like a lunatic.

234
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,162
Maybe they don't even know we're here.
Let's tell them.

235
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,463
Stop it!

236
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,783
Was that you who fired those shots,
Mr. Irving?

237
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,219
- Sure it was him.
- Sure it was. What about it?

238
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,224
Nothing, except it seems like
a silly waste of ammunition.

239
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,988
He won't do it again. He was just bored.

240
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,893
Faith, now, that's a great shame.

241
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,899
- So am I.
- Really? Well, I'm sorry.

242
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,869
Perhaps things will get enlivened for you
if that shooting stampedes the cattle.

243
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,838
Since you seem to know
what troubles him...

244
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,999
I'd suggest you see he drinks less.

245
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,107
Them two youngsters is more trouble
than they're worth.

246
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,745
I'll certainly be glad to hand them over
to their uncle in Dodge.

247
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,482
She sure is pretty, though.

248
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,357
Yes. I'd still trade the two of them
for one good cigar.

249
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,606
All right, this is it! Tex! Rusty!

250
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,675
Tex, get the steers watered.

251
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,338
Rusty, line up the wagons
at the bottom of that slope.

252
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,939
- Get moving, flat neck.
- Hush, I'll get moving.

253
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,300
All right, folks, we're bedding down.

254
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,894
Watch your cook fires, now.
The grass is awful dry.

255
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,963
- Don't you wander off.
- Ma, I'm hungry.

256
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,724
All right, get your teams hooked up.
We're pulling out.

257
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,531
- Move as soon as you're ready.
- Tex, get the herd started.

258
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,595
Wade, you better watch
old bullet head here.

259
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,607
I caught him riding
in the wagon yesterday.

260
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,608
- Hush. I was...
- Hush up.

261
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,176
Good morning, Mrs. Harper.
Did you rest well?

262
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,153
- Thank you. Fine.
- Good.

263
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,990
Be sure you boil that water
before you drink it.

264
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,931
I'll bet two minutes after you were born,
you were telling the doctor what to do.

265
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,230
Think so? I'm sorry, Miss Irving.

266
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,327
You know, it's really no fun playing boss...

267
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,066
but someone's gotta say
what's to be done, haven't they?

268
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,539
You know, out here...

269
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,578
a trail boss has sometimes got to
take the law into his hands.

270
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,079
Yes. "Pioneering," I believe you call it,
don't you?

271
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,479
That's right.
You don't seem to be enjoying it much.

272
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,608
Enjoying it?

273
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,380
Can anyone enjoy being jolted along
week in and week out...

274
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,422
through a nightmare of heat and dust...

275
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,822
with sand in your teeth, eyes, and hair?

276
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,824
Faith, now. If you didn't like sand,
maybe you shouldn't have left home.

277
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,387
I wouldn't have.

278
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,628
But we didn't have much choice
after Father died.

279
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,927
I see. I'm sorry.

280
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,199
Here, can I take that?
It looks heavy for you.

281
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,070
No, thanks. I can manage it.

282
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,439
I'm sure you can manage a bigger one
in each hand, if you wanted to.

283
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,637
But why should you?

284
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,510
- Because I happen to be in a hurry.
- We'll wait for you.

285
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,174
There. See?

286
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,777
If everyone in the camp obeyed orders
as willingly and charmingly as that...

287
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,879
we wouldn't have any trouble at all.

288
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:01,585
My brother and I seem to be causing you
a great deal of trouble, Mr. Hatton.

289
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,560
No, just your brother.

290
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,895
You know, I think you spoil him
by mothering him, don't you?

291
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,331
Maybe I do.

292
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,565
May I make a suggestion?
Why don't you go...

293
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,941
Look here, Mr. Irving!
This ain't no picnic grounds.

294
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,043
Put up that gun
before you stampede them cattle.

295
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,247
Get down off your high horse,
will you, cowboy?

296
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,087
Watch me shoot the handle
right off of this one.

297
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,226
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hiya, Abbie.

298
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:40,196
You're just in time to witness
an exhibition of some real fancy shooting.

299
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,859
Put up that gun
before somebody takes it away from you.

300
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,367
Who's gonna take it away from me?

301
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,666
You're drunk,
you don't know what you're doing.

302
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,502
Don't start to lecture me.
I've had enough of that for now.

303
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,939
Lee, don't!

304
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,148
It's a run!

305
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,711
Tex, head in those leaders
and keep them milling.

306
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,284
See what you've done.
I hope you're satisfied.

307
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,190
I've been waiting to see some action
since this trip started.

308
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,420
You crazy galoot!
You saw what nearly happened.

309
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,022
What? Just gave you lazy cowhands
a little exercise, that's all.

310
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,803
Irving, you're giving us
a great deal of trouble.

311
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,538
- You're gonna force me to be unpleasant.
- Let me alone.

312
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,103
I'm not on your payroll,
and I'll do as I please.

313
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,808
No, you'll do as I please.

314
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,249
You people in the wagons
came to us for protection.

315
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,014
You paid for it, and you're getting it.

316
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,078
You'll obey orders
until we reach Dodge City.

317
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,386
You may not realize it,
but the Civil War is over...

318
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,653
and you're no longer
in the Army, Mr. Hatton.

319
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm not gonna argue with you.

320
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,891
Sober up and stay sober,
or I'll confiscate your liquor.

321
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,366
If you lay a hand inside our wagon,
I'll blow it off.

322
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,729
Look, Irving...

323
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,040
we've got a very special treatment
for bad little boys like you.

324
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,003
You behave yourself or you'll ride
into Dodge City backwards on a mule.

325
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,773
You'll look very silly.

326
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,481
Now we're moving. You better get started.

327
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,714
- Lee, be sensible.
- Let me alone.

328
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:14,290
I can hardly wait to see you on that mule.
You sure will look funny.

329
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,294
Take that stupid grin off your face,
you big hyena.

330
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,999
Drop that gun, Irving! Drop it, I tell you!

331
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,413
You've killed him.

332
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,074
Here you are, Tex. That's for Dr. Irving.

333
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,873
Take the shortcut into Twin Forks.

334
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,812
Bear left from there.
It's three hours to Dodge. Understand?

335
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,008
Sure I do, Wade.

336
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,484
I tried to explain in it.
Tell him I'll call on him when we get there.

337
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,522
I sure hope that doctor
is more understanding than his niece.

338
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,682
<i>- Good luck. Get going, Tex.
- Goodbye.</i>

339
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,542
Miss Irving.

340
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,509
I know how you must feel about all this...

341
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,482
and I know how you must feel
about my part in it.

342
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,518
My shot was unavoidable.

343
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,680
I'd never have fired it
except to defend myself.

344
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,448
I've no words to tell you
how badly I feel about it all.

345
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,859
Will you leave me alone, please?

346
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,989
Well, so this is Dodge City, huh?

347
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,415
It sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it?

348
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,460
That's not the city you smell. That's you.

349
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,020
We'd better get you to a bathtub
before somebody shoots you for a buffalo.

350
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,966
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Lady, can I carry your basket?

351
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,140
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?

352
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,270
Gentlemen, can I hold your horses?
I'll watch them real careful.

353
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,042
- What's the idea, sonny?
- I'm in business.

354
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,241
I'm the man of the family now.

355
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,411
You're certainly making an early start.
What do you charge?

356
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,047
A quarter just for keeping an eye
on your horses.

357
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,182
50 cents for watching them extra good.

358
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,387
All right, then.
We'll take $1 worth of the extra good.

359
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,553
Didn't Shakespeare begin
by holding horses?

360
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,065
- Who?
- Hey, stranger, where's the money?

361
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,863
So you don't get any credit here, either?

362
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,436
Here you are.

363
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,839
- Thanks, mister. Much obliged.
- You're welcome.

364
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,338
William Shakespeare.

365
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,039
I never heard of him.
What part of Texas is he from?

366
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,376
Stratford-on-Avon.

367
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,938
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning.

368
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,542
- You fellows look pretty dusty.
- We certainly are.

369
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,486
It's on us about an inch thick
for each state in the country.

370
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,372
What's the news in Dodge?

371
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,242
Just about the same as always:

372
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,408
gambling, drinking, and killing.
Mostly killing.

373
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,149
Had one here just the other night.
Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of.

374
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,781
Man named Yancey shot Matt Cole
over at the Gay Lady.

375
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,315
Matt Cole? I used to know him in Texas.
What was the trouble?

376
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,488
What was the trouble?
How long since you been in Dodge?

377
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,862
Quite some time.
We always ship up through Wichita.

378
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,061
This town is run
by a man named Jeff Surrett.

379
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,627
Cole was trying to collect
for some cattle he sold.

380
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,833
$15,000, Surrett owed him.

381
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,505
Good morning, gentlemen.

382
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,447
How long before you'll be through
with this fellow?

383
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,455
In about 10 minutes, Mr. Surrett.

384
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,958
All right, hurry it up.
I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey.

385
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,691
I'm sorry,
there's somebody in there already.

386
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,642
Hey, shut that door!
There's a draft in here.

387
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,172
What's the idea, Charlie?

388
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,578
You know I always take a bath
on Saturday mornings.

389
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,876
Get that fellow out of there.

390
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,649
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Mr. Surrett.
He ain't been in there half an hour.

391
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,756
He's been in there long enough.
You tell him to get his clothes on.

392
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,383
All right.

393
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,724
- Wait a minute.
- What did you say?

394
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,861
My friend in there paid for that tub.

395
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,663
Much as you undoubtedly need a wash,
he needs it even more.

396
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,200
If it ain't our old friend Hatton.

397
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,902
Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

398
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,373
You figuring on
being around Dodge City long?

399
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,316
No, just as long as it takes me
to finish my job.

400
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,149
Maybe longer, if I find it interesting.
Any objections?

401
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,689
No, I think we can make it
pretty interesting for you.

402
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,349
Yes, I'm sure you might.

403
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,522
I hear you made it pretty interesting
for Matt Cole the other night.

404
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,659
You always did hear a little too much.

405
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,033
It's possible you boys
were always a little too noisy.

406
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,679
Come on there, Charlie. Finish me up.

407
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,310
Put some of that green stuff on.
Make me smell like a geranium.

408
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,682
- Say, Wade.
- What?

409
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,189
You know, it just come to me
who that fellow was.

410
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,952
It did? Marvelous.

411
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,821
Naturally, our nephew's death
was a great blow to us.

412
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,696
But now, since your explanation,
I can understand how it happened.

413
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,396
There's no sense
in holding any grudge against you.

414
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,495
Thank you, sir.

415
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,769
We're used to death here in Dodge City,
Mr. Hatton.

416
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,602
Even of the people we love.

417
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,302
That's hard to say, but it's true.

418
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,041
Yes, I suppose so.

419
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,450
Thanks again, Doctor.

420
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,250
I wonder if I might pay my respects
to Mrs. and Miss Irving on my way out?

421
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,223
No, my boy. I wouldn't advise that.

422
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,522
Walter, Mr. Evans wants you to come
as soon as you can.

423
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,120
- Excuse me.
- Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton.

424
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:37,060
- How do you do, Mrs. Irving?
- He's come to tell us about Lee.

425
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:42,900
It's regrettable that we have to meet
under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving.

426
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,001
I'm sorry, my boy.

427
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,570
But, you see, we never had
any children of our own.

428
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,377
And to my wife, Lee was...

429
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,180
Well, you can understand
how she feels about it.

430
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,481
Yes, of course.

431
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,614
Anyhow, it was very gracious of you
to receive me, sir.

432
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,355
Don't bother about that thing, sir. I can...

433
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,860
Miss Irving.

434
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,290
I'll not be troubling you
with any further apologies.

435
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,133
But I would like you to know that
if ever I can be of any service to you...

436
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,502
- I shall be only too happy.
- Thank you.

437
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,770
The only way you can be of service to me
is to keep out of my sight.

438
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,545
I wouldn't take that too seriously, my boy.

439
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,948
Women's logic and emotions
are often very confusing.

440
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,846
I think I've heard my father say
the same thing.

441
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,288
I'm sure that Miss Abbie
has a more biting tongue...

442
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,052
than my mother ever had.

443
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,326
All right, gentlemen,
let's begin the auction.

444
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,594
One thousand six hundred and nineteen
head of prime Texas steer.

445
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,465
Grass-fed, fat, frisky,
fresh off the Chisholm Trail.

446
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,730
Is that correct, sir?

447
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,170
Go ahead.
But don't make any sale until I tell you.

448
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,471
Right. The agent reserves his right
to refuse all bids.

449
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,637
Now then, who'll start us off?
What am I offered?

450
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,839
$25 a head.

451
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,280
$25 from Mr. Surrett. I'm going to $28.

452
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,251
$28 for the finest herd of steers
that ever come out of Texas.

453
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,255
- Who'll say $28? Mr. Cagle?
- No, sir.

454
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,620
Mr. Orth?

455
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,751
Here's a cash profit of $50,000
begging to be picked up.

456
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,454
- All right, $28.
- Thank you, sir.

457
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,157
$28 is bid. Who'll say $30?

458
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,564
- Nobody will raise it?
- $30.

459
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:21,071
$30 from Mr. Surrett.
Anybody raise that? Anybody say $32?

460
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,040
How about you, Mr. Orth?

461
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:28,976
Going to Mr. Surrett for $30.
Once. Going twice.

462
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,441
Hold on.

463
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,073
Will Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth
be kind enough to step up here?

464
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,621
Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth,
will you come over here, please?

465
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,456
You offered $30. Was that cash?

466
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,587
What's that to you?
Do you own those cattle?

467
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,497
I'm the agent for them.
I'm protecting the owner's interest.

468
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,761
I see.

469
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,493
I'll give you part of it in cash tonight
and the balance in 30 days.

470
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,597
I see. How about you, sir?

471
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,571
I could've paid the full amount
in cash today.

472
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,204
- You could have? Right. They're yours.
- Mine?

473
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,804
- But he offered...
- I said, sold.

474
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,941
What are you trying to do?
I made the high bid on those steers.

475
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,078
I heard you. But I prefer to make my deal
with cash buyers...

476
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,850
who don't pay off
in the back rooms of saloons.

477
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,116
I'm at the Drovers Hotel, Mr. Orth.

478
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:18,355
If you care to meet me at 3:00
in Room 15, we can close this deal.

479
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,828
- I'll be there.
- Right.

480
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,525
Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer.
Thanks. Good day.

481
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,192
Sold to Mr. Orth.

482
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,294
- Joe, did you hear that?
- I'll put it right on the front page.

483
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,032
- Who's that fellow?
- I don't know.

484
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,267
But you can bet I'm gonna find out.

485
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,574
- How are you, Harry?
- Hello, Mr. Orth.

486
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,883
- I'll hold your horse for you.
- Good.

487
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,352
- For a quarter.
- Well, that's fair enough.

488
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,946
- Here.
- Thanks.

489
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,219
How are you, Frank?

490
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,318
- Fine. How are you, Mr. Orth?
- Just fine.

491
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,987
- Howdy, Mr. Orth.
- Howdy.

492
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,995
Stick 'em up.

493
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,031
Rusty, we're done for.

494
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,736
It's Dangerous Ambrose, the terror
of the prairie. He's got us in his power.

495
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,644
Yes, sir. I'm a pretty desperate character.

496
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,044
I can see that.

497
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,276
Would you take ransom
if we offered it to you?

498
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,909
Try it and see.

499
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,220
How's that?

500
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,585
Thanks, mister.

501
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,253
I'll watch your horses better
than they were ever watched before.

502
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,193
That's fair enough.

503
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,496
I sure hope you stay in town a long time.

504
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,535
I'll bet you do at that.

505
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,400
Mr. Orth come in yet?

506
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,068
He went upstairs a few minutes ago,
Mr. Hatton.

507
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,407
<i>My name is Joe Clemens.
I'm editor of the Star.</i>

508
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:45,347
I'd like to publish your impressions
of Dodge City, if you don't mind.

509
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,350
Jack Orth. Somebody shot him.
He's laying right outside of Room 15.

510
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,672
That's too bad, Hatton.

511
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,042
I don't think your deal with Orth
will go through.

512
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,614
But I'm still offering you $30 a head
for those cattle.

513
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:25,279
Listen, Surrett. Those cattle
aren't for sale to you at any price.

514
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,319
It's a shame about Jack Orth being killed,
isn't it?

515
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,661
Must have been a big surprise to you.

516
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,598
Excuse me.

517
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,034
Another murder. Four or five a day.

518
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,508
Surrett's getting to be
the undertaker's best friend.

519
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,772
It's sure getting dangerous
to live around here.

520
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,643
Why don't you get out?

521
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,300
Clemens, I see by that bulletin
that you're looking for trouble again.

522
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,929
What's the matter?
We're just printing the plain facts.

523
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,497
We've put up with you and your paper
long enough. Now we mean business.

524
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,545
Yancey, you're not scared
of that fellow from Texas, are you?

525
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,874
We'll take care of him.

526
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,940
But I'm warning you, don't print
no story about Surrett. Is that clear?

527
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,776
I'm waiting for an answer.

528
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,153
I reckon you get the general idea now.

529
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,625
Rusty, I don't like
the look of those clothes.

530
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,260
They look like you're up to no good.

531
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,637
I ain't had store clothes on for a long time.
I kind of felt like I wanted to clean up.

532
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,233
I got a call to make down here,
so you're on your own.

533
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,074
Just try and keep sober
and stay out of trouble.

534
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,979
You know I signed the temperance pledge
before we left Texas.

535
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,041
Sure, I know that.
You were blind drunk when you signed it.

536
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,054
No, you're confusing the issue.
I'm a reformed man.

537
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,784
Even a reformed man can get into trouble
when the boys get paid off.

538
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,554
No, I ain't gonna touch a drop.

539
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,858
I'm just gonna mosey around
and take in the sights.

540
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,591
Look out you don't become one of them.

541
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,496
Wade, don't you worry none about it.

542
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,797
You don't think
after me getting store clothes...

543
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,633
that I'll have anything like that
happen to me, do you?

544
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,781
Hey, mister.

545
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,985
Please help me over, will you, young man?

546
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,860
Come closer.

547
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,412
There you are, ma'am. Glad to be of help.

548
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,203
- Hi, Rusty. Come on, have a drink.
- Hi, Rusty.

549
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,145
Come with us and get your feet wet.

550
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,911
- Sorry, Tex. I'm just leaving.
- What do you mean, leaving?

551
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,079
We got a lot of Kansas dust to wash down.
Come on.

552
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,920
Waste my pay on liquor and gambling?
Not me, boys. I'm on the pledge.

553
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,323
You ain't serious, Rusty?

554
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,493
I tell you, boys, I've saw the light.

555
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,390
I'm through with your sinful ways
and your riotous living.

556
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,067
He must be crazy with the heat.

557
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,571
Hey, you old walrus, you!

558
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,444
I don't want that. Give me one of those.

559
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,285
That's more like it.

560
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,948
My gracious!

561
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,144
Howdy, young man.
Are you a stranger in town?

562
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,281
Yes, ma'am. But I sure didn't know
this was just for women folks.

563
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,555
But it isn't. Not at all.
We're mighty glad to have you.

564
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,894
But first of all, let me introduce
our beloved president, Mrs. McCoy.

565
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,894
So delighted to meet you
in this charitable institution.

566
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,967
Ma'am, my name is Hart. Algernon Hart.

567
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,968
Mr. Algernon Hart.

568
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,372
Well, Mr. Hart,
you're just in time for the meeting.

569
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,847
But first, come and have a cup of tea,
Mr. Harvey.

570
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,213
Hart, ma'am.

571
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,887
I'm so sorry. Mr. Hart.
Come, girls. Help me.

572
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:28,085
Now, here's your tea. I hope you like it.

573
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:31,093
- One or two?
- Three, ma'am.

574
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,956
Are you married?

575
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,478
- Hey, Joe!
- Yeah?

576
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,456
How about that Dixie?

577
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,162
That's for the Fifth Kansas Infantry.

578
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,901
He chased those fellows
so far from Fredericksburg...

579
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,205
they ain't stopped running yet.

580
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,111
Yeah? They must have stopped running
long enough to get their picture took.

581
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,149
Nobody ever chased
the Fifth Kansas, mister.

582
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,344
- Do you belong to it?
- All of us do.

583
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,977
So is that a fact?

584
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:40,148
You must have had to run a long way
to get back to Kansas.

585
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:42,920
Well, it's gonna be a longer run
back to Texas.

586
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,189
It's that dreadful saloon next door.

587
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,135
Mabel, please close the shutters.

588
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,505
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hart.

589
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,677
And there I was, a poor orphan,
no ma, no pa.

590
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,812
Brung up by Comanche Indians.

591
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:47,855
No matter where you go,
fighting ain't good.

592
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,517
It ain't no use to fight.

593
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,290
Fighting is a thing I...
I don't like it myself. And now I want...

594
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,505
That's a present from U. S. Grant.

595
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,266
That's for Robert E. Lee.

596
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:16,145
Yes, sir. And I want to say to you, sisters...

597
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:20,315
that when righteousness flows from the...

598
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,048
It was smooth.

599
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,146
Who's next?

600
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,531
Come get these fleas out of my hair.

601
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,111
Stop it, you fools! Stop it, I say! Stop it!

602
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,510
Thanks, Rusty. Just in time.

603
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,414
Stop it, you fools!

604
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,796
All right, boys. Looks like
we dusted this place out pretty good.

605
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,997
That's one fight you Yanks didn't win.

606
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,505
But take it easy.
We'll send a veterinary right over.

607
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,973
Come on!

608
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:32,218
Somebody's gonna pay for this
and it ain't gonna be with money.

609
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:38,223
When I seen the light,
it come to me sort of vision-like.

610
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,823
And I was saved.

611
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,990
Hey, Jeff, there's one of them
Texas heroes left behind.

612
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,933
- Let me take a sock at him.
- No, I'll handle this.

613
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,779
You boys had a lot of fun, didn't you?

614
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,872
- We sure did.
- That's fine.

615
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,112
I've been waiting a long time
for you and your pal to make a move...

616
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:05,018
- and this looks like it.
- What are you gonna do?

617
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,182
I'm gonna have some fun now
paying back an old debt with interest.

618
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,352
Come on, boys.
Let's take him out to the plaza.

619
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,668
Bring him along.

620
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,771
- Hey, Doc! Mr. Hatton!
- What's wrong, Joe?

621
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,714
Your men just wrecked
the Gay Lady saloon.

622
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:35,944
- Anybody hurt?
- I don't know.

623
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,577
They're gonna hang one of your boys.

624
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,918
- Where are the rest?
- They've ridden back to camp.

625
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,823
- Where's the hanging party?
- Right in the middle of the plaza.

626
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,735
You're plum loco.

627
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,705
- I ain't done nothing to be strung up for.
- Shut up.

628
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,440
Hold on, boys.

629
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,682
Be careful, Mr. Hatton. Take it easy.

630
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,832
That rope is strong enough
for both of them.

631
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,194
What do you think of that?

632
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,165
I've no wish to spoil your fun, Surrett.

633
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,700
But would you be kind enough
to tell those men to let him go?

634
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,839
Sure. We'll let him go just as quick as
he gets through dancing around up there.

635
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,250
You heard what I said, I think.
Tell them to let him go.

636
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,721
All right. String him up, boys.

637
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,752
Put 'em up! Stick 'em up!

638
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,961
Keep reaching high, boys,
or you know what happens to Surrett.

639
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,293
Get over here, Rusty. Get his gun.

640
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,199
We may never be this close again, Surrett.

641
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,938
I'm anxious to hear what the sheriff
has to say about this hanging.

642
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,500
Start walking.

643
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:30,161
- What are you gonna do with him?
- No warrant for his arrest.

644
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,996
Did he have a warrant to hang this man?

645
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,161
You can't jail him without a sheriff's order.

646
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:36,501
That's where we're going.
To get a sheriff's order.

647
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,270
Wait a bit. What's this?
Where's the sheriff?

648
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,875
Somebody ran him out of town.

649
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,576
Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now.

650
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,883
I see.

651
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,257
Why don't you make him sheriff then?

652
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,885
Yeah. That's not a bad idea.

653
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,457
Why not?

654
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,756
And if I can be of any service to you gents,
just let me know.

655
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,308
That's the first jail I've ever seen
you couldn't get in.

656
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,503
Come on. Good day, gentlemen.

657
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,876
- It was all a mistake.
- A mistake?

658
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,109
I thought you promised me
you weren't going to get into trouble.

659
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,653
Shucks, Wade, I really wasn't in trouble.

660
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,554
I see. You're the sort
who doesn't really get into trouble...

661
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,320
until they start nailing the lid down
on your coffin.

662
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,826
What's that?

663
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,761
"Pure Prairie League of Dodge City. "

664
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,973
Wait till I tell Tex about this.

665
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,471
Don't tell Tex.

666
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,118
Well, gentlemen, what's this all about?

667
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,882
You all look as though you lost a dollar
and found a dime.

668
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,423
All right. Go ahead and tell him, Doctor.
Thank you.

669
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:05,188
Mr. Hatton, we've invited you here
this afternoon with a special purpose.

670
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,593
We want you to help us clean up our city.

671
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,997
Up to date, our police officers
have not been equal to the job.

672
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,592
They've either got killed
or run out of town.

673
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,570
Won't you take the job?

674
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:19,339
Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate
your confidence in me.

675
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,606
But I'm afraid a position like that
isn't quite in my line.

676
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,237
You're asking me to turn policeman.

677
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:28,148
I have about as much qualifications
for that as I have teaching the ballet.

678
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,982
You seemed to be well-qualified
the other day in the plaza.

679
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,522
I had to get that big hardhead
out of that somehow.

680
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,115
Any one of you
would have done the same. No.

681
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,894
We know what we're asking of you
and the chances you'd be taking.

682
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:44,593
But it's finally come to a showdown.
Who's gonna run Dodge: we or Surrett?

683
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:49,104
We're inviting peaceful emigration here,
family men with women and children.

684
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,141
And we meet them
with what's come to be called Hell Street.

685
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,574
I can certainly appreciate
everything you say.

686
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,942
But as far as I'm concerned,
it can't be done.

687
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:00,176
I'm in the cattle business.
That demands all my time and attention.

688
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,308
I'm sorry.

689
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,784
I wish you'd think it over, my boy.
We need you.

690
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,219
You're asking the wrong man,
Uncle Walter.

691
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:09,190
He isn't interested
in the lives of innocent people.

692
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,056
Why should he care what happens
to you and your families?

693
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,460
Your struggle to make a living
in a decent city?

694
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,432
What Dodge City needs is a man
with a sense of public pride...

695
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,992
and the courage to back it up
by shooting it out with men of equal skill.

696
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,403
But Mr. Hatton's bravery consists
of gunfights with impulsive boys.

697
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,998
Abbie, stop it.

698
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,605
Well, gentlemen,
I don't think much remains to be said.

699
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,989
Mrs. Irving, thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

700
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,825
Quickly as you can. Come along.

701
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,959
Harry, keep out of that lunch basket.

702
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:56,062
I can't seem to get my mind
off those pies, Miss Abbie.

703
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,108
- How long before we eat?
- Not till we get to Sycamore Springs.

704
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,473
- Come along.
- I'll do my best to wait.

705
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,052
Everybody in?

706
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,849
Here we go. Come along.

707
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,931
Cross the river here, Russ,
and bear due west on Wichita.

708
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,593
When are you fixing to get started?

709
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,502
First thing in the morning.
I'm sick of this town.

710
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,102
Good morning.

711
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,911
I know that man.

712
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,913
Hello, stranger.

713
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,186
Hello there, Shakespeare.

714
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,286
- Here.
- Thanks.

715
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:59,157
You'd better watch that riverbed, too.
It's probably gonna be dry.

716
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,082
Steady!

717
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,753
I'll help you! Give me those reins.
Let me drive.

718
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,976
Let me through. Darling!

719
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,245
He was trying to help me.

720
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,252
Get a doctor, quick.

721
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,953
I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use.

722
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,786
Even children.

723
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,062
This has got to stop.

724
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:43,701
Oh, my darling. My little baby.

725
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,672
Go on.

726
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,962
You're all under arrest.

727
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,590
Take them out, boys.

728
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,194
Get in there.

729
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,124
I wanted to be sure
you'd seen this, Surrett.

730
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,097
So I paid you a special visit.

731
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,689
I've already seen it.

732
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,736
It looks like you're trying
to run everybody out of Dodge City.

733
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,897
No, not everybody.
Just the undesirable element.

734
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:28,007
There's no law in Kansas
that prevents a man from carrying a gun...

735
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,638
- or coming or going where he pleases.
- There's going to be one.

736
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,541
Sit down, Hatton.

737
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,917
The merchants
are not gonna stand for this.

738
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:40,012
Yes, I think they will. The merchants
helped me draw this law up.

739
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,818
They're willing to take their chances.

740
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,018
I just wanted to be certain
about you, though.

741
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,857
- Let's get down to cases, Hatton.
- Right.

742
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,796
What cases?

743
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,795
You and I have had a couple of run-ins.

744
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,996
But I'll forget them if you do,
and see if we can't work together.

745
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,471
If you really mean that,
that'll make my job easier.

746
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,168
- Your job is just what you make it.
- So I hear.

747
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,734
The last few sheriffs here
didn't do so well, did they?

748
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,906
They weren't your type. Just a bunch
of dumb sheep wearing badges.

749
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,745
I never even bothered to talk to them.

750
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,377
I'll bet if you had,
you'd have told them a thing or two.

751
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,819
Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.

752
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,288
Now listen, Hatton.

753
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,190
There's no reason
that Dodge City can't be run properly.

754
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,820
Just so long as you don't try
to change things too much.

755
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,456
Because this is a cattle town,
the biggest one on earth.

756
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,193
And that's what it's always gonna be.

757
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,758
There's more than $20 million worth
of beef and hides...

758
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,269
comes through here every year.

759
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,328
You know that because you bring them up.

760
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,465
You've been holding
the wrong end of the sack...

761
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,511
because the real money
ain't working for those Texas breeders.

762
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:39,070
No, sir. It's right here in Dodge City
because this is where they pay off.

763
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,638
You mean, on your roulette tables.

764
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,308
Sure, coming and going.

765
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,445
If not for the Gay Lady,
that money would go out of Dodge City...

766
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,319
and the trade would move right on
to Wichita.

767
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,949
You know that cattle crowd.

768
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,756
After months of backbreaking work
getting the cattle here...

769
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,694
they want a little fun and freedom.

770
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,062
If it's not here,
they'll go where they can get it.

771
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,966
- And you'd go broke.
- Sure. But I ain't aiming to.

772
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,300
You see, I make $100,000 a year
one way or another.

773
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,466
Frankly, I don't need that much money.

774
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,033
Naturally, I'd be willing to make a deal
with anybody...

775
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:11,705
that would sort of see things my way.

776
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,915
Make a mighty good deal for both of us.

777
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,248
You mean, a little friendly bribery?

778
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,222
You can catch more flies with molasses
than you can with vinegar.

779
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,555
True enough.
I hope you'll not be offended...

780
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,727
but I don't like the smell of your molasses.

781
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,799
You'd better get rid of that gun
by Monday. You're north of Front Street...

782
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,639
and that jail's apt to be a little crowded.

783
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,213
What's the matter? Didn't it work?

784
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,212
He wouldn't listen to reason?

785
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,915
No, he wouldn't.

786
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,187
All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do.

787
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,499
Don't ever do nothing like that
unless I tell you to.

788
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,093
This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while.

789
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,235
They sure make a fella feel at home
around here.

790
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:15,436
Yes. They'll even dig you a home,
if you're nice to them.

791
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,275
One at a time here, fellas. Line up.

792
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,612
There you are.

793
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,279
- Will I get this stuff back again?
- You sure will.

794
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,950
- Disarm me? Not for no man.
- Nobody gets my gun.

795
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,156
- What a leery idea.
- Who does he think he is?

796
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,623
- Bet two.
- I'll call it.

797
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,498
- Raise it five.
- Call five.

798
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,537
- I'm dead.
- Kings up.

799
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,299
- I guess we better quit, boys.
- Quitting because you're winning?

800
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,242
- You read that sign, didn't you?
- We don't believe in signs.

801
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:53,646
That sheriff's a big four-flusher and
that sign's been bad luck to me all night.

802
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,885
Guess that'll show you
Hatton ain't bluffing.

803
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,922
That's right, gentlemen.
Hatton's not bluffing.

804
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,856
- You're all under arrest.
- For what?

805
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,690
For not believing in signs.
All right, deputies, take them.

806
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,287
- Come on.
- Let go, now.

807
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,094
I tried to warn them, but I guess
they gotta learn through experience.

808
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,196
I don't know what
you're warning people about.

809
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,674
- What do you mean?
- You're north of Front Street, aren't you?

810
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,041
- And you're carrying a gun, aren't you?
- Yeah.

811
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,478
- Right. You're under arrest.
- What?

812
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,710
Come on.

813
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,684
But I'd feel undressed without my gun.

814
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,654
Where you're going, you won't need
any clothes for a few days.

815
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,248
If I was you,
I'd rather arrest my brother than me.

816
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,623
Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor...

817
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,430
I'm sorry, boys,
I can't do anything about it.

818
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,059
Wade, you ain't gonna keep me in here,
are you?

819
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,728
Sorry, Tex. You read that notice
the same as anyone else.

820
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,897
Three days in there
won't do you a bit of harm.

821
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,840
You can't do this to me
after all we've been through together.

822
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,309
We fought the war together,
built the railroad...

823
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:59,280
we ate, drank, slept, lived,
and died together.

824
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,875
Now we're gonna be in jail together:
you in there and me out here.

825
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:49,528
Isn't that wonderful? That makes seven
families that have moved in this week.

826
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,532
That does my heart good.

827
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,262
There's the Turner family,
moving back from Wichita.

828
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,134
And after she said
she'd never set foot in Dodge again.

829
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,003
Welcome home, Mr. Turner!

830
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,543
- How do you do, Mr. Clemens?
- Hello, Joe.

831
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,671
Isn't that the sweetest bonnet
she's got on? It's brown moiré.

832
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:10,846
Moiré. How do you spell "moiré"?
M- O-I-R-E?

833
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,219
Who in tarnation gives a hoot
what Mrs. Turner's wearing?

834
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,157
Just about every blessed woman in town,
that's all.

835
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,992
What happened in this fight
between the Indian and Jim Kendall?

836
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:24,157
I went into that pretty thorough.
There wasn't no fight.

837
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,600
They called each other names,
the Indian throwed a knife at Kendall.

838
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,639
Kendall sort of fired a couple of shots.
Nobody got hurt.

839
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:35,609
Nobody got... I see. It wasn't a real fight,
it was just a sort of friendly argument.

840
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,678
- Hello, Tex.
- Hi, fellas.

841
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:39,646
Come on in and sit down.

842
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,684
What are you doing with
that secondhand store around your neck?

843
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,844
Where've you been?
We ain't saw you for days.

844
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,650
Around. Been doing a lot of thinking lately.

845
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,882
Thinking?

846
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,222
I hope you're gonna take that job
I offered you.

847
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,022
We need another good deputy
around here.

848
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:56,462
That's what I've been thinking about.
I've decided to go back to Texas.

849
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,090
- What for?
- I don't know.

850
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,068
This place is getting too big, and calm,
and peaceful-like.

851
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,605
You mean,
Rusty and I have stopped all the fun?

852
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:07,972
It's all right for women and children,
but I've decided to go back to Texas.

853
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,676
If you've made up your mind, that's that.

854
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,714
There's nothing we can do
to keep you here?

855
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,373
- No.
- So long, Tex.

856
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,851
- So long, Wade.
- Give him back his gun. Number 27.

857
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,484
If you're ever around here,
that job will still be waiting for you.

858
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,890
No, sir. I just don't fit
in a sissy town like this.

859
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,051
I certainly hate to see you go.

860
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,065
I'll miss you fellas, too, a lot.
We had a lot of fun together.

861
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,298
So long, knot head.

862
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,203
If I hung around here much longer,
I'd be riding a side saddle.

863
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,865
Yes, I suppose so.

864
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,705
All right, Rusty. Arrest that man.

865
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,301
- Who? Me?
- What for?

866
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,574
He's carrying a gun, isn't he?

867
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,046
Give him back his old room.

868
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,300
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, Wade. What's the news?

869
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,563
You ought to know.
Haven't you read your paper?

870
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,127
Got those tax notices ready?

871
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,833
- Hack's just running them off.
- Fine.

872
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,568
- Come on in.
- All right.

873
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,666
Have a chair.

874
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:17,211
You look as though you're pretty busy...

875
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,610
- Fred?
- Yes, ma'am.

876
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:29,520
- Would you set this in my copy, please?
- I will, ma'am.

877
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,690
- Joe...
- Good morning.

878
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,823
Did you want something?

879
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:39,731
I'd like to have my curiosity satisfied.
What are you doing here?

880
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,895
Obviously, I'm working.

881
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,501
Obviously. But at what and why?

882
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:48,231
The town is growing by leaps and bounds,
and the paper needed somebody...

883
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,336
who would write things
that would interest its women readers.

884
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,975
I see. Tell me, what are the vital interests
of your women readers?

885
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,277
What other women are wearing...

886
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,584
how to make Lady Baltimore cake
with two eggs...

887
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,624
who invited the minister to tea...

888
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,285
and whose baby is going to be born
and when.

889
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,660
- Fascinating.
- Is there anything else you'd like to know?

890
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,995
What do the doctor and Mrs. Irving
think about it?

891
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:15,127
They made the same stupid objections
that you're making mentally now.

892
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:19,205
But when I decide on a thing,
I usually manage to carry it through.

893
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,936
Yes, I've noticed that.

894
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:24,568
You realize that people are inclined
to think that a newspaper office...

895
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:28,014
is an odd place for a charming lady
like you to be working, don't you?

896
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,176
Are you the delegation
sent to tell me that?

897
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,276
No.

898
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,148
I stop trouble around here. I don't start it.

899
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:38,216
- What's wrong with my working here?
- It's undignified. It's unladylike.

900
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,687
You ought to be home doing needlework.
Things like that.

901
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,324
Sewing buttons on for some man,
I suppose.

902
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,698
Buttons come off.
Someone's gotta sew them on.

903
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,067
That's a fine career
for an intelligent woman.

904
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,368
- Here are your tax notices, Wade.
- Thanks.

905
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,807
There will be wailing
and gnashing of teeth when these go out.

906
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,107
Abbie, I know this isn't in your line...

907
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,272
but as long as you insisted on the job...

908
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,442
will you stop calling them
"cows in the stockyard"?

909
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,575
They're steers. Steers.

910
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,951
I don't see any difference.

911
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:10,753
"A rise is expected this season
in the price of longhorn cows. "

912
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,659
Never mind. I'll correct this copy myself.

913
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,921
"Longhorn cows. " I must be running along.

914
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,593
By the way,
may I let you into a little secret?

915
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:20,794
What?

916
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,771
You've got a smudge of ink on your nose.

917
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,369
Goodbye. Goodbye, Joe.

918
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,739
Goodbye, Wade...

919
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,376
I'm sorry. Abbie.

920
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,174
Is this showing proper respect for the law?

921
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,945
I never saw the law fall on its face before.

922
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,452
I didn't fall on my face.

923
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,988
There's an old saying in the British Army:

924
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:44,048
"The law must always save its face
in front of the natives. "

925
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,651
And what if the natives object to its face?

926
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,090
We just put them across our knee...

927
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,654
and spank them soundly.

928
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,598
You're not suggesting that I'm a native?

929
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,637
No. The only real native of Kansas
is the buffalo.

930
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,195
He's got a very hard head,
a very uncertain temper...

931
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,298
and a very lonely future.

932
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,974
Apart from that, there's hardly
any comparison between you.

933
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,147
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Wade.

934
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,812
Goodbye.

935
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,950
I like that fella.

936
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,356
"Cows in the stockyard. "

937
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,892
Of course, I ain't a man
who believes in taxes.

938
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,058
But I can see they're a necessary evil.

939
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:28,399
Somebody's gotta pay for schools
and churches and such things.

940
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,405
Especially now that
the town's getting so darn big.

941
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,037
Yes, sir.

942
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,100
They do say there's nothing certain
except taxes and death.

943
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,509
Get up, Hatton.

944
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,373
What for?

945
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:45,216
A couple of the boys are waiting outside
to have a little talk with you.

946
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,276
I see.

947
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,956
You know, I'm really surprised at Surrett.

948
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:54,485
I thought he had more intelligence than
to send you here on a silly deal like this.

949
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:58,233
- You haven't got a chance...
- Shut up and get out of that chair quick.

950
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:07,035
About 10 days for this customer.
Five to cool off and five to think it over.

951
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,009
You bet. I'll take care of it personally.

952
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,602
Come on, sonny boy.
I'll buy you some candy.

953
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:21,213
- What were you saying about taxes?
- What taxes?

954
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,257
I don't remember.
Shall I trim your mustache?

955
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,660
No, thanks. I think I can manage.

956
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,308
See that big herd of buffalo
grazing away so peacefully down there?

957
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:57,255
The trouble with the buffalo is
they had things too easy at the start.

958
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,354
It works the other way around, too.
Take us, for example.

959
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:03,364
We had such a bad beginning.
We'll have a wonderful future.

960
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,957
That's typical Irish logic:
totally unconnected.

961
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,433
You think so?

962
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:11,369
It may be Irish, but it's not unconnected,
and I can prove it.

963
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,737
Thirty years ago, my father met
my mother at the Londonderry fair.

964
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,678
He'd come down to sell some prize pigs.
Big, fat, lovely pigs they were.

965
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:21,910
Mother was down there
after winning the grand prize for her roses.

966
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:26,478
Roses of Sharon, enormous, big things,
as big as your face and nearly as beautiful.

967
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:31,091
I don't suppose there were ever roses
like that in the whole of Ireland.

968
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,696
What must happen?
The very last day of the fair...

969
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:38,824
Father's pigs get out and eat up
every single one of Mother's prize roses.

970
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,798
Root, stem, flower and all.

971
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,836
Did any two people ever get off
to a worse start than that?

972
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:51,346
Look at them now: six big lusty sons,
a score or so of prize pigs...

973
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:54,644
and the most beautiful rose garden
in the whole of Antrim.

974
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,982
I envy you people
who have kissed the Blarney Stone.

975
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,544
You do?

976
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,751
It's cold on the lips.

977
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,192
I think we'd better be getting back.

978
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,322
I'm afraid it'll be dark before we get there.

979
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,562
- Are you sure it's the dark you're afraid of?
- What do you mean?

980
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:17,196
- Maybe you're afraid I might kiss you.
- You wouldn't dare.

981
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,708
I wish I were as sure of that as you are.

982
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,949
May I?

983
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,783
Thank you.

984
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,549
You know, I was just thinking...

985
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:44,558
the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off if
the buffalo didn't have a one-track mind.

986
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,134
But then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo,
would it?

987
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,726
I suppose not.

988
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:52,600
You wouldn't be you unless you thought
you might like that kiss.

989
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,302
- You seem very sure of my reactions.
- Oh, no.

990
01:16:56,345 --> 01:17:00,008
That's something you can
never be sure about until you've tried it.

991
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,310
Can you?

992
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,527
Good morning, Abbie.

993
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,903
Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you?

994
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,372
So-so.

995
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:31,209
Won't you come in and sit down?

996
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:35,010
There. Is there anything I can do for you?

997
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,881
Yes, I'd like to run this advertisement
in your paper.

998
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,183
That is, if it doesn't cost too much money.

999
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:44,021
Our advertising rates are very low.
I'm sure we'll be able to.

1000
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,193
You want to sell your house?

1001
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,661
No, I don't want to. I have to, Abbie.

1002
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:53,025
Let's get a new lead line
on this church bazaar story.

1003
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,092
How do, Mrs. Cole? How are you today?

1004
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,196
- Good morning, Joe.
- How much will you charge on this?

1005
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,274
One, two, three, four...

1006
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,073
You're selling your house?
You're not leaving town, are you?

1007
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,274
No, I just...
Joe, I can't afford to keep it up.

1008
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,045
I can't even begin to meet
the taxes on it these days.

1009
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,417
I can't understand that.
Matt always made good money.

1010
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,752
Just the day he died...

1011
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:19,494
he collected $15,000 from Surrett.
Didn't he?

1012
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:23,322
That's what I thought, too,
but I've never seen a penny of it.

1013
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,059
Well, what have you done about it?

1014
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,694
I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it
several times...

1015
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,261
but he'll never give me a straight answer.

1016
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:36,472
It looks to me like Mrs. Cole needs help,
and we might be able to help her.

1017
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,376
Yeah, it does look that way.

1018
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,777
Mrs. Cole, would you mind
if we kind of looked into this?

1019
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,718
Mind? I'd consider it a very great favor.

1020
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:50,187
There are a lot of accounts in this town
to be settled. Now, let's see.

1021
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,119
How's the best way to tackle this?

1022
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,257
There you are. The entry, the date,
and the figures. $15,000.

1023
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,665
What Matt Cole did with his money
after that is his business, not mine.

1024
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,933
He had $10 on his body when he
was found. He never left the saloon.

1025
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,940
I make it a point not to discuss
the affairs of my customers.

1026
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,806
But as long as you force my hand,
I'll give you the facts.

1027
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,540
Matt Cole lost that $15,000
playing roulette.

1028
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,378
Playing roulette?
I'd like you to remember that, Abbie.

1029
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,213
Don't worry, I'll remember.

1030
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:21,381
As a matter of fact, we'll all remember it.
He never went near those roulette tables.

1031
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:24,050
He went straight to the bar
and Yancey killed him there.

1032
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,617
- According to who?
- You'll find that out in court.

1033
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,721
If you've got such a clear case,
why don't you arrest me now?

1034
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,561
I think we'll wait a few days.

1035
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,430
I want to talk to a few more people...

1036
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,733
before we start giving you board and room
at the state's expense.

1037
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,269
You're bluffing, Hatton.

1038
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,535
You're holding a pair of deuces.
You're bluffing.

1039
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,735
Am I?

1040
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,608
Munger killed Orth
because he spoiled a cattle deal for you.

1041
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,115
Yancey killed Cole because he tried
to collect $15,000 you owed him.

1042
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,949
And more citizens in this town have
been killed trying to do business with you.

1043
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,580
That's what the three of us
are going to prove in court.

1044
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,181
We'll see if the jury thinks we're bluffing.

1045
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,555
Take that book, Joe.
I want to look at it again.

1046
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,324
I can hardly wait
to start writing this story.

1047
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,730
Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
the most important article...

1048
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,395
<i>that's ever appeared in
the Dodge City Star.</i>

1049
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,975
There it is. We'll have it out
by noon tomorrow.

1050
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,447
How did you find out
all these other things about Surrett?

1051
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,040
Abbie, a good newspaperman
has two jobs.

1052
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,712
One is to write the news as it happens,
day by day.

1053
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,813
The other is to be ready for it,
and write it first...

1054
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,547
all but the end.

1055
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,086
This is Jeff Surrett's morgue.

1056
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,696
I must be an optimist at heart.

1057
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:38,289
I've been getting it ready for a long time.

1058
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:43,029
You two, haven't you got any homes
to go to? It's past midnight.

1059
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:46,369
You'd better be running along, Abbie.
The Doc will skin me alive.

1060
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,534
We've got Surrett
by the scruff of the neck.

1061
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,239
You have? Why not let it go tonight
and resume your grip in the morning?

1062
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,511
You two realize what kind of a target
you'd make from out there?

1063
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:59,020
I'm gonna take you home before
your uncle gets after Joe with a shotgun.

1064
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,215
Here's your cloak.
I'll come back and stay till you finish, Joe.

1065
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,225
The story's all written.
You don't have to worry about me.

1066
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,990
I'm just gonna mark it for the printer,
then call it a day. Italics.

1067
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:12,223
Don't hang around, or Surrett
might come in and mark it for you.

1068
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,700
They wouldn't try anything
at this stage of the game.

1069
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,498
You think not? I hope you're right.

1070
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,402
Good night, Abbie.
See you in the morning.

1071
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,100
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Wade.

1072
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,040
Lock this door after us when we go out.

1073
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,102
Mr. Hatton, I am accustomed
to being up after dark.

1074
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,341
- Lock it.
- All right.

1075
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,513
- Good night.
- Good night.

1076
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:34,153
"The laws of Dodge City
must be respected...

1077
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,349
"not only by one group of citizens...

1078
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:39,951
"but by all groups. " Paragraph. I like that.

1079
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,574
What was that?

1080
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:13,053
Whoever killed Joe Clemens
ought to be strung up.

1081
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,255
And, by golly, I'll furnish the rope.

1082
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,525
If he's got enough neck left
to put a rope on.

1083
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,796
They sneaked up on him.
Never even gave him a chance.

1084
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,906
The bullet went through his heart.

1085
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,077
I can only blame myself for this.

1086
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,903
But it's one thing
they won't get away with.

1087
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,817
Little fella sure was aces. It's too bad.

1088
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,648
I can't understand it.

1089
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:45,220
Everybody knows that Joe didn't have
any enemies except Surrett and his gang.

1090
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,227
Who else could have done it?

1091
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:51,664
Isn't it sufficient proof that Joe's story
is gone and the whole file on Surrett?

1092
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,602
This door was locked.
I know that because I tried it myself.

1093
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,537
It's an old lock. Any key will fit it.

1094
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:06,672
- There's nothing here. You're sure?
- He always left his copy here on top...

1095
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,909
so we could set it up
first thing in the morning.

1096
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:13,182
I'm sorry, Sheriff, that's printer's ink.
You can't wash it. It has to wear off.

1097
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,055
Did you ever read the contents
of Joe's files on Surrett?

1098
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:25,224
I certainly did,
and there was enough in it to hang him.

1099
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,631
Keep that to yourself.
I think you ought to go now.

1100
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,795
You're looking tired. Good night.

1101
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,304
See the doctor and Miss Irving home,
will you?

1102
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,569
Right.

1103
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,975
- What's the next move, Wade?
- I suppose we're going to...

1104
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,615
Are you sure he isn't in his office upstairs?

1105
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,656
I tell you, Surrett left town
on the 4:30 train this afternoon.

1106
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,487
If you don't believe us,
go ask the station agent.

1107
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,255
Jeff was halfway to Wichita
when the shooting occurred.

1108
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,820
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.

1109
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,894
Thanks.

1110
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,093
Your bet.

1111
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,626
- Your bet.
- $3.

1112
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:38,532
I call.

1113
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,201
Who's winning all the money?

1114
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,039
Been playing long?

1115
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,339
Ask the bartender. He's got a watch.

1116
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,550
What do you know
about Joe Clemens, Yancey?

1117
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,321
No more than you, except that he's dead.

1118
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,323
How did you know he was dead?

1119
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,926
I heard some of the boys talking.

1120
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,963
People keep dropping in and out of here
all the time.

1121
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,393
Bet you $5.

1122
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:08,897
I call.

1123
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,671
Three fives.

1124
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:21,214
- You're under arrest, Yancey.
- For what?

1125
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,216
For the murder of Joe Clemens.

1126
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,320
Keep my stack, Bud.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1127
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:31,847
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.
Take him along, Rusty.

1128
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,969
What's the matter, Taylor?
Are you nervous?

1129
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,242
Go ahead. Deal them.

1130
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,273
Yancey seemed a little vague
about this game.

1131
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,475
Suppose you tell me what happened.

1132
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:56,675
How should I know?

1133
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,219
- Why don't you ask one of them?
- I'm asking you.

1134
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:02,415
Did Yancey ever leave this table
after the game started?

1135
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:05,025
No. He never left the room.

1136
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:08,291
I told you a hundred times,
he never went out of the place.

1137
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,058
Come on, you're wasting valuable time.

1138
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:13,225
- Answer my question.
- No, he never left the table.

1139
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,962
Stop lying. You're bad at it.

1140
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:18,233
Yancey left that room
between midnight and 1:00, didn't he?

1141
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,671
- No.
- What time was it, then?

1142
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:20,730
He didn't leave.

1143
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,106
Let me work on him, Wade.
I can make him talk.

1144
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,543
If you can't, I can.

1145
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:27,513
Let him alone.
Listen, if you're too stupid to realize...

1146
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,313
you're facing a charge of murder,
you deserve what's coming to you.

1147
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,681
What do you mean?

1148
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,214
I'm gonna have you indicted for murder
as an accessory after the fact.

1149
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,487
I had nothing to do with it.

1150
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,052
You're gonna be dancing in thin air
the same as Yancey.

1151
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,156
Do you wanna swing,
or you wanna tell me and save your neck?

1152
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,463
All right. I'll tell you.

1153
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,669
Come on.

1154
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,935
He went out about 12:30.
Came back in about half an hour.

1155
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,571
That's better.

1156
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,774
I'll do you a favor, Taylor.

1157
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:05,079
Lock him up.

1158
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:16,530
- Good morning, Mrs. Irving.
- Good morning.

1159
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,759
Morning. Did you get anything
out of Taylor?

1160
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:19,891
I did. Where's the doctor?

1161
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,731
- In there. What's wrong?
- What'd he say?

1162
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,532
Morning, Mr. Hatton. Won't you join us?

1163
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,970
No, thanks. I came to tell you...

1164
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,202
it's imperative you get Miss Abbie
out of town as soon as possible.

1165
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:29,436
Why, for heaven's sake?

1166
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,673
Because only two people beside myself
heard Surrett tell that lie...

1167
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,272
that he saw Matt Cole
lose his money playing roulette.

1168
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,581
One of those people was Joe Clemens.
That's why Surrett killed him.

1169
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,588
You're the only other person
who can bear me out in court.

1170
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,386
Without you, he can deny it
and the jury might believe him.

1171
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,427
That's all the more reason
why I should stay.

1172
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,587
I started this,
and I'm going to see it through.

1173
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,960
Will you not be a little idiot?

1174
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,330
You're life isn't worth a nickel
as long as Surrett stays out of jail.

1175
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,335
You're the key to our case
and he knows it.

1176
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:59,362
We can't go to trial for two weeks.
Your life's gonna be in danger till then.

1177
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,806
Even in this house,
on the street, everywhere.

1178
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:03,673
I know Surrett and I know what he'd do.

1179
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,612
You know I'm right, Doctor.
I want you to get her out of town.

1180
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,308
And stay out till I send for you.

1181
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,146
- You're right.
- I see what you mean.

1182
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,118
Abbie must take the next train for Wichita.

1183
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:14,950
She can stay with the Merrills.
I'll pack a valise at once.

1184
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,957
Come and help me get it down
off the shelf.

1185
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,653
I'd never forgive myself
if anything happened to her.

1186
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:24,061
- I won't go. You can't boss me around.
- Can I not, now?

1187
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,566
I'm the law in this town
and you'll do as I say.

1188
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,693
I don't care what you are, I'm staying here.

1189
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:29,896
Aunt Ellen, don't pack...

1190
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,405
You are the most stubborn female
I ever met in my life.

1191
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,998
Can't you understand I'm doing this
because I love you?

1192
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:37,340
All right, you two. Stop arguing.

1193
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:40,278
Don't worry, Mrs. Irving. We've stopped.

1194
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,916
What he needs is a rope.
He don't deserve a trial.

1195
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,757
Hand him over to us. We'll give him a trial.

1196
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:58,661
This is more like it.

1197
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,863
The last time I saw a mob like that
was in Texas...

1198
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,200
when they gave Curley Hawks
a necktie party.

1199
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:05,864
Mr. Grant, I want to talk to you.

1200
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,238
There's your man. You got 10 minutes.

1201
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,805
- Hello, Yancey.
- Hello.

1202
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,871
What's going on here?
What's the mob doing...

1203
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:16,678
Now, take it easy, Yancey.

1204
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:21,452
You might as well know this now as later.

1205
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:24,355
They wormed it out of Taylor
that you left for a half hour.

1206
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,893
They can't hang me on that.
I might have gone anywhere.

1207
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,054
Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you...

1208
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:31,163
if you ever get to a jury.

1209
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,428
What do you mean by that?

1210
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,298
What're you trying to say?

1211
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,733
Joe Clemens
was a mighty well-liked man, Yancey.

1212
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,467
He had a lot of friends.

1213
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,977
Half the city is planning
to break in here tonight...

1214
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,070
and take things in their own hands.

1215
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:48,980
Where's Jeff?
He's gotta get me out of here.

1216
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:53,177
I telegraphed him an hour ago.
He got off the train at Spearville.

1217
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,549
He got off? For what?

1218
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:59,387
Jeff's smart enough to know
this town's gonna be warm for a few days.

1219
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,419
So he's just laying low
until the excitement blows over.

1220
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:04,863
Too warm for him?

1221
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,230
So I stay here
and get hung for doing his job.

1222
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,299
- If you think that I...
- Shut up, you fool!

1223
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:13,101
- You want to tell the whole town?
- You bet I'll tell them.

1224
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,041
I'll tell them who paid me
to shoot Joe Clemens and Matt Cole.

1225
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:19,204
Let them hang me, sure.
But if I go, Jeff's going with me.

1226
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,180
You rustle him up and telegraph him that.

1227
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,844
He has to get me out by tonight
or I'm giving the whole story to Hatton.

1228
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,450
But how can Jeff get you out of here?

1229
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:30,519
I don't know. That's his problem.

1230
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:32,956
Keep your shirt on, Yancey.

1231
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,397
I got an idea
how Jeff and I can handle this.

1232
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:38,158
First I'll see Hatton.

1233
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,892
You got the right man, Hatton.
What are you waiting for?

1234
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:42,265
Yeah, what are we waiting for?

1235
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,463
If you don't know
what to do with Yancey, we do.

1236
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,064
- You bet we do.
- Will you give us some action?

1237
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:48,972
If he won't, we will give him some action.

1238
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:51,273
What are you stalling for?
You know he killed him.

1239
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:54,178
If you don't turn him over to us,
we'll come get him tonight.

1240
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:57,775
Listen, men, you fellas put me
in this office to enforce the law.

1241
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:59,217
And I'm going to enforce it.

1242
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,154
That means a fair trial
for any and all prisoners.

1243
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:03,588
Including Yancey.

1244
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,621
And understand this:

1245
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:11,298
There is going to be no mob rule
around this town as long as I am sheriff.

1246
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,102
They're bringing up a pole
for a battering ram.

1247
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,573
You see? They're right at the door.
Listen to them.

1248
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,872
You're in charge, Sheriff.
What are you gonna do?

1249
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:27,176
Wade, what are we gonna do?
The whole town's set on getting him out.

1250
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,682
You can't stop them,
the five of you against the town.

1251
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,718
They'd burn down the building
to get in here.

1252
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,414
We'd save a lot of trouble
if we'd feed him to the mob.

1253
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,117
You want to throw my client
to that pack of hungry wolves?

1254
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:40,183
Listen, no one's gonna get your client
but a jury.

1255
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,923
- I promise you that.
- There's only one way to protect him.

1256
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,023
Yancey's gotta be taken
out of Dodge City before night.

1257
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,660
Fat chance we'd have
of getting him to the station.

1258
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:51,466
You can hire a closed carriage,
drive him to Spearville...

1259
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,063
and catch the train for Wichita.

1260
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,904
Keep him in jail there
till he can be tried legally.

1261
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,104
- Yes, that might work.
- It will work.

1262
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,238
My client's entitled to a fair trial...

1263
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,578
and it's both our jobs
to see that he gets it.

1264
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,175
You want me to rustle a carriage, Wade?

1265
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:08,245
Wait a minute. I got a better idea.

1266
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,483
But you agree
we got to get him out in a hurry?

1267
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,389
Yes, but we'll do it my way.

1268
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:22,730
- This is a sample of your future.
- Get in, Russ. Get in.

1269
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:28,206
Hold them off as long as you can.
I'll send word from Wichita.

1270
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:06,940
- Say, what the...
- Keep calm, it's official business. Come on.

1271
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:13,876
I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City.
I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.

1272
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:17,447
- Is it all right if we ride with you?
- All right, Sheriff.

1273
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,257
- Mind shutting and locking this door?
- Not a bit.

1274
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:55,886
Get over there.

1275
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,361
You can sit there
and rest your face and hands.

1276
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:09,699
How many stops do you make
between here and Wichita?

1277
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:11,506
- None.
- Good.

1278
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:29,719
Keep going. I'll tell you what to do.

1279
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:39,737
Put 'em up.

1280
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:41,707
- But, gentlemen...
- Take him away, Joe.

1281
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,004
Get in there.

1282
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,345
Get your hands up.

1283
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,916
Get them up, I said!

1284
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:27,448
Now unlock those cuffs.

1285
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,084
We've gotta stop. The train's on fire.

1286
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,022
Don't slow down till the water tower.

1287
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:56,006
Hold it, Jeff! We're all gonna burn.

1288
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,150
Got a friend of yours here, Hatton.
Take a good look.

1289
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:07,811
Throw me those guns!

1290
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:17,796
Pick them up.

1291
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,393
Unlock those handcuffs!

1292
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,466
Come on! Hurry up!

1293
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,715
Close that door.

1294
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,917
Rusty, this end.

1295
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:52,624
Look out!

1296
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:03,362
Hurry up!

1297
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:58,881
So the lamb killed the butcher.

1298
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:05,560
Now, listen to that.
Singing hymns and it ain't even Sunday.

1299
01:40:05,632 --> 01:40:07,827
No one in sight even friendly drunk.

1300
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:12,168
Doggone, if this place ain't getting
so pure and noble it ain't fit to live in.

1301
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,298
I'm sure enough going back to Texas now.

1302
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,639
Imagine asking me
to lead the Pure Prairie League.

1303
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,201
Why not? You're one
of the leading lights in it, I hear.

1304
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,214
First thing you know, they'll be starting
a chamber of commerce.

1305
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:24,216
- Faith, it's not possible.
- What?

1306
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:25,774
Look, Col. Dodge.

1307
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:31,054
- Hello, Colonel.
- How're you, Colonel?

1308
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:32,285
Hi, Colonel.

1309
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:33,690
How are you, boys?

1310
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:35,820
By golly, Wade, it's good to see you alive.

1311
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:38,296
- It's good to be alive.
- Come on up.

1312
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,265
- Hello, Colonel.
- Wade. By golly, son, it's good to see you.

1313
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:45,396
Hello, Tex. How are you, Rusty?

1314
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,838
I couldn't complain, Colonel.
Wouldn't do no good.

1315
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,136
Sit down over there, sir.

1316
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:52,542
I've come all the way from Virginia City,
Nevada, just to see you.

1317
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:55,081
I'm building a railroad there
from San Francisco.

1318
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:57,208
It's the richest square mile on earth.

1319
01:40:57,284 --> 01:41:00,685
Gold, silver, copper.
We've got a solid mountain of the stuff.

1320
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,346
But it's a bad town, Wade.
A wild, murderous town.

1321
01:41:03,424 --> 01:41:06,018
Worse than Dodge City ever was
before you cleaned it up.

1322
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:07,560
And that's saying a good deal.

1323
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:10,825
- I want you to come back with me.
- I knowed our luck had changed.

1324
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,661
We've got 4,000 people out there.

1325
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,531
Decent men and women with families
who are living in terror.

1326
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:17,797
Think of them 4,000 poor people.

1327
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:19,862
There might be more
by the time we get there.

1328
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,134
We need you, son.

1329
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:23,369
The city is teeming
with crime and corruption.

1330
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:24,877
What law we've tried has failed...

1331
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:28,244
because the men behind it hadn't
the brains and courage to back it up.

1332
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:30,943
You can get plenty of men
for that job out here, Colonel.

1333
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:33,509
I'm getting married next week.
Got tickets for New York.

1334
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,714
Shucks, you can get married anytime.

1335
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:38,451
We'll even go on your honeymoon
with you to Virginia City.

1336
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:39,549
Thanks.

1337
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,186
Getting married
has ruined a lot of good men.

1338
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:46,098
Doesn't it mean anything to you to know...

1339
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:49,397
that someplace there's terror and death
that you could put a stop to?

1340
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:52,633
Yes, it does, Colonel.
But the decision isn't as simple as that.

1341
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:56,301
If I were free, it might be different.
I'll soon have a wife to take care of.

1342
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:58,276
Abbie doesn't want
to go pioneering anymore.

1343
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:02,008
We're planning on coming back here
from New York and settling down.

1344
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:06,508
There's a wagon train leaving here
the middle of next week for Nevada.

1345
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:11,657
It'd be a great trip, wouldn't it?

1346
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:23,434
Hello, darling. I was just telling the boys
how we're going to settle down...

1347
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:25,301
- Lemonade?
- Thank you.

1348
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,465
- Lemonade?
- Thank you, ma'am.

1349
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:40,585
Darling, I was just telling Col. Dodge
about our honeymoon in New York.

1350
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:45,523
How we're going to see all the shops,
theatres, and Niagara Falls, and things.

1351
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,794
Col. Dodge, when do we start
for Virginia City?

1352
01:42:56,103 --> 01:42:58,970
Wade, it looks like
you're marrying the right girl.

1353
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,575
Virginia City!

1354
01:43:57,931 --> 01:43:58,920

1355
01:43:59,305 --> 01:44:59,861
