1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,215
Twelve-year-old boy
driving an automobile.

3
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,476
l think your father's
as much to blame as you.

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,087
Father don't know about it.

5
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:17,420
-You said you had permission.
-l did. l got permission from Eddie Cooper.

6
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,755
-lt's his car.
-His car?

7
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,955
You mean it was his car.
Now it's a pile of junk.

8
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:27,331
And a law-abiding farmer's tractor
is damaged to the extent of $30.

9
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:31,335
So, Mr. James MacMahon, Jr...

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,308
...this court sentences you to 90 days.

11
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,914
Ninety days, Mr. Watkins, of working
for you after school.

12
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:43,576
Weeding turnips or sawing wood or any
other form of labor to make up your loss.

13
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:47,314
Jimmy, you tell your father
about this mess.

14
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,926
Dad? He'd just about
skin me alive.

15
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,188
l vaguely suspected
something of that sort.

16
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,736
This court will recess for 30 minutes
while l try a case in chambers.

17
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,709
Am l late, judge?
l came the minute l got your call.

18
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,682
That's quite all right, Mary.
Quite all right. Sit down.

19
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,016
Now....

20
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:22,316
The way this thing
looks to me...

21
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,020
...it appears that you...

22
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:30,223
...Mrs. Harry Tompkins, purchased an
expensive radio on an installment plan.

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,302
lt appears, Mary, that you're three months
in arrears in the payments.

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,961
l thought l could pay
from the household money.

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,404
The store wants to attach
your husband's salary.

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,137
You just can't let them take Harry's
salary. He'd never forgive me.

27
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,874
Besides, Mary, employers,
they don't like that sort of thing.

28
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,779
That's why l called you.

29
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:53,389
Now, Mr. Barnes, l shall delay issuing
a warrant in this case for 30 days.

30
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,525
ln the meantime, this court
will guarantee full payment.

31
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,593
That suits me fine, judge.

32
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,753
We don't like this sort of thing,
but it's business.

33
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,229
-l know. l know.
-Good day, judge.

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,699
-Good day, Mr. Barnes.
-Good day, Mrs. Tompkins.

35
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,236
Even with 30 days more,
l don't see how--

36
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,638
Your husband's always bragging around
at lodge meeting...

37
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,302
...what a miracle of a cook
you've got.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,246
Augusta? She's the best cook ever,
if l know anything about cooking...

39
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,818
-...and l was raised in my mother's kitchen.
-Splendid, splendid.

40
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,150
Now, when you get home...

41
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:30,724
...tell Harry to give you the wages
he used to pay the cook...

42
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:36,230
...and you cook from now on. That´ll give
you the money you need for the payments.

43
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,891
Judge Hardy, do you think it's fair
that Augusta loses her job...

44
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,903
-...just because l've been foolish?
-Mary, for a long time...

45
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:48,476
...l've been trying to get up the courage
to tell Mrs. Hardy we should have a cook.

46
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,474
For 30 years she's cooked with
her own hands every meal l've eaten.

47
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,173
She's gonna be furious.

48
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,215
But l'm putting my foot down.

49
00:03:56,586 --> 00:04:01,546
-Send your cook to my house tomorrow.
-l'll never be able to thank you.

50
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:06,923
And on your way home, drop in on
Mrs. Hardy and just mention crabapple jam.

51
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,791
She's preserving.

52
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:14,695
lf Harry likes them, tell him you
know where he can get lots more.

53
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:16,805
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

54
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,372
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mary.

55
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,271
-Goodbye, Miss Forrest.
-Goodbye, Mary.

56
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,549
l can't help it, Milly.
l'm glad to give the stuff away.

57
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:31,585
All the pleasure's gone from putting up
preserves. Guess l'm getting old.

58
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:35,713
Emily, why don't you get a girl to help
you in the kitchen?

59
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,258
Why, l'd never dare suggest it to James.

60
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:42,057
He wouldn't touch a mouthful of food
unless l cooked it myself.

61
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,199
l thought it was unusually quiet
around here.

62
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,429
Andy's usually home by this time.
Wonder where he can be?

63
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,744
There's $ 1 2. l'll sign a promissory note
for the other 8.

64
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:04,978
Of course, you know, you can't have
the car till you pay the full $20.

65
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:09,215
-Nobody pays cash nowadays.
-Then bring me that promissory note...

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,825
...signed by your father.

67
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:14,225
Why, l can't make Dad
sign a note, because--

68
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,264
Because he don't know you
figure on buying this car.

69
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:22,200
Sure he does. That is, he hasn't had
time for me to let him know about it.

70
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,535
-All right. No $8, no automobile.
-Oh, look, please.

71
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,608
l'll get the money
to you somehow.

72
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:31,508
But in the meantime, can't l come down
and do a little work on it?

73
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,172
Certainly. ln a way, it's your car.

74
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,251
Thanks, Mr. Dugan.
l'll have the money by the 23rd.

75
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,082
Because l need the car on the 24th.

76
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,018
Or l'll be a social outcast.

77
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,462
-Hi, Polly!
-Hi!

78
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,707
-Hi there!
-Hello. You're two hours late.

79
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,377
l'm sorry, Polly.

80
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,113
l have bad news for you.

81
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,259
l can't go to the country club dance
on Christmas Eve.

82
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:21,989
You can't go? You've got to.
You don't know the sacrifices l'm making.

83
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:26,124
lt's impossible. We're going to my
grandmother's tomorrow for the holidays.

84
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,032
A whole year to visit her
and you pick Christmas.

85
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,799
Can't be helped.
And me with a new evening dress.

86
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,807
lt's got a low neck
and practically no sleeves.

87
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,911
-Yeah?
-lt would have been fun...

88
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,980
...going to the dance with you.

89
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:44,347
At the club, there's a lot of little places
where you can sneak out between dances.

90
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:49,984
Really, l think we're getting much too old
for that sort of thing, hugging and kissing.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,320
l ain't ever too old
for hugging and kissing.

92
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,057
You didn't act no 90 years old
last night on the porch yourself.

93
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,964
Why, Andrew Hardy!
You kissed me last night by force.

94
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,537
Well, it's good that way too.

95
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:07,506
Polly, let's get dressed and walk home
the long way through the trees.

96
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,918
Andy.

97
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,225
You'll take some other girl
to the dance, l suppose.

98
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:28,727
No, l won't. There's no other girl l'd ask.
l'm going stag.

99
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,957
That's sweet of you, Andy.

100
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,931
Sit down, Polly?

101
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,069
Polly, when l say goodbye
to you tomorrow...

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,300
-...will you wear your new evening dress?
-ln the daytime?

103
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,001
-That's ridiculous, Andy.
-Oh, please, Polly?

104
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,374
The one l'm not gonna see
at the dance.

105
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,880
With the low neck
and practically no sleeves.

106
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,642
l certainly will not.

107
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,185
lt might get mussed.

108
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,915
You mean l'm gonna get
to kiss you tomorrow?

109
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,389
Well, l will be gone for three weeks.

110
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,995
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
But just supposing, Polly.

111
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,189
Suppose that l'm about to leave and...

112
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:06,096
...l'm about to kiss you,
one of the girls walk in.

113
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,863
And why do we have to be supposing that?

114
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,641
Well, what l mean is,
suppose l kiss you now.

115
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,242
We won't have to worry
about anyone walking in.

116
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,312
l thought so.
All your fine talk about...

117
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,972
...taking the long walk home
because of scenery.

118
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,675
You're gonna be gone
and l'm gonna be all alone.

119
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,219
Doesn't a man resist temptation better...

120
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,857
...if his own girl kisses him goodbye?

121
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,520
Why do you want me to wear
my new dress?

122
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:35,630
l'll bring a camera, take your picture
and keep it with me at the dance.

123
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,993
Oh, you're a darling.

124
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:42,301
Tomorrow, Andy.
Don't forget your camera.

125
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,654
-Hello, Andy.
-Oh, hello, Dad.

126
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,823
Just thinking.
A wonderful age we live in.

127
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:08,186
They didn't have airplanes
when you were a boy, did they?

128
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,822
No, l was quite grown
when men began to fly.

129
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,299
They didn't even have
automobiles, did they?

130
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,131
No.

131
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,838
When you were young,
everybody rode horses.

132
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,669
That's so.

133
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:24,108
-Did you have your own horse?
-Yes, indeed, l did.

134
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,376
That's fine.
Now, today, everybody rides in automobiles.

135
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,786
No. No, not everybody.

136
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,480
Maybe not everybody.
Maybe not children.

137
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,785
But look, Dad,
l'm not a child anymore.

138
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,791
A fella's just gotta have a car.

139
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,691
-Does he?
-Yes, sir.

140
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,823
l casually discussed the used car business
with Mr. Peter Dugan, and he--

141
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,835
He agrees that every
young man should have a car.

142
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,099
Yes, sir. There's a peach of
a job down there for 20 bucks.

143
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,176
-''Dollars.''
-Dollars. l thought if you might help--

144
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,438
Now, Andy, we've been
over this before.

145
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,481
On occasion, in emergencies,
you've driven the sedan.

146
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:05,212
You drive very well, though
goodness knows where you learned.

147
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:08,755
When you're 1 6 years old,
l'll allow you to take the car out.

148
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,856
One night a week.

149
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,519
That way l'll have some control
over the situation.

150
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,665
Gee, Dad, other fellas have cars.

151
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,357
Don't l have as much
sense as the other kids?

152
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,800
l think you've got a lot more.
But l've got to decide this.

153
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:26,499
When you can pay cash for a car
out of your own money...

154
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:30,878
-...that's something else.
-Do you believe in the partial payment plan?

155
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,450
No, no. Not unless you have
an assured income of your own.

156
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,644
-Come on home. Dinner's ready.
-l'm gonna buy some film.

157
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,814
Polly wants me to take her picture.
You know how girls are.

158
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,021
''Emily, times have changed.

159
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:55,035
Today, no woman should be
tied to her kitchen....''

160
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,879
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where number 27 is, please?

161
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,543
-Right next door.
-ls it the Draper house?

162
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:15,190
Right you are, young lady.

163
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:19,522
-l don't know if anyone's home.
-They'll be home. They're expecting me.

164
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,423
Mr. and Mrs. Draper
are my grandparents.

165
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:27,831
Well, well, well.
You're Betsy Booth, Martha Draper's baby.

166
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,834
l've come for Christmas.

167
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:33,497
Mother's doing
a musical comedy in Chicago.

168
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:36,110
l'm gonna be on the stage too
when l grow up.

169
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,540
l'm studying for it.

170
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:40,204
l hope you're a bigger success
than your mother.

171
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,647
So we're gonna be neighbors, eh?

172
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:46,015
l'm Judge Hardy.

173
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,790
ls Andy Hardy your son?

174
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,018
l have heard something to that effect.

175
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,626
Grandma always writes about him.

176
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,631
Oh, he's so polite,
and he always runs her errands for her.

177
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,430
She says he's the nicest boy
in the neighborhood.

178
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:05,199
Christmas with Andy Hardy next door!

179
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:09,568
-l hope you won't be disappointed.
-Oh, l won't.

180
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:15,149
-Well, goodbye, Judge Hardy. For now.
-Goodbye.

181
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,252
Don't forget, we're neighbors.

182
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,040
Here, here, here.
What's all the--?

183
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,479
Oh, Dad.

184
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:54,245
lt can't be that bad, Marian.
Nothing's that bad.

185
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,254
l'm just so mad, l--

186
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,757
Weren't you having
dinner with Wayne?

187
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,954
Dinner? l never want to see him again.

188
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,837
Let's us go in here, huh?

189
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,540
Now, tell me.

190
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,377
What's the matter?

191
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,912
Dad, l'm through with Wayne.

192
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:23,609
l never want to see him again
as long as l live. Never.

193
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:26,983
You mean never until
he calls to apologize.

194
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,453
No, Dad. Never.

195
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,649
Dad, he's--

196
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:35,126
Wayne went out with another girl.
That horrible Maxine Fort.

197
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,733
Well, honey.
Half a woman's love is faith.

198
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,864
l'm through with Wayne.
l'm through with all men.

199
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,032
l'm never going to marry
as long as l live. Never.

200
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:53,212
Well, that's rather a large order, honey.

201
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,550
Maybe l'll do social service work.

202
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,620
That's it.
l'll be a settlement worker.

203
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,788
And very commendable too.

204
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,861
But you want to remember, honey,
there's no new sorrow in the world...

205
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,467
...nor a trouble that a lot
of other people couldn't match.

206
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,212
''Emily.

207
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:33,446
Ever since you were a young bride,
cooking in your first kitchen--''

208
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:41,986
-Hello, Mother.
-Hello, dear. l didn't hear you come in.

209
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,689
Mother, l want to talk to you.

210
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,892
James, you're in trouble.

211
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,163
Can't l just talk to you
without it being anything special?

212
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,466
Well, what is it?

213
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:57,237
Mother, the day of the pioneer and
the covered wagon is unfortunately over.

214
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,745
You're not going camping at your age.

215
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:04,716
No, no, no. Of course not.
l mean, times have changed.

216
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,946
Once we did all our own work.

217
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,613
Once we used horses,
now we have cars.

218
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:13,728
-lf you've bought another automobile--
-No, no. Certainly not.

219
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:17,423
l mean, horses were all right in their way,
but cars are better.

220
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,397
Same with housework.

221
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:22,196
Now we have different stoves--

222
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,638
-lt nearly burned.
-But--

223
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,643
lt's all right, dear. l'm listening.
You were talking about horses.

224
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,577
-l wasn't talking about horses.
-You just said that--

225
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:36,081
l'm talking about cooks!

226
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,421
-l'll go.
-No, let Milly answer it.

227
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,456
She's probably getting fixed up
for dinner. l'll go.

228
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,424
Good evening.
Telegram for you, Mrs. Hardy.

229
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:54,967
-For me?
-Yes, ma'am.

230
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,765
-Will you please sign here?
-Oh, dear.

231
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,669
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

232
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:02,676
l'll sign for it, sonny.

233
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,944
There you are, boy.

234
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,778
Here you are.

235
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:16,686
-What are you afraid of?
-But a telegram, James.

236
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:21,159
When we were young telegrams
were new, expensive and exciting.

237
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,199
-Today they're as ordinary as postal cards.
-l don't know, James.

238
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,928
Mother, you're the same
sweet girl l married.

239
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,971
You haven't changed a bit.
But times have.

240
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,508
Telegram's here to stay.
You may as well get used to it.

241
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,935
Oh, dear.

242
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,408
What is it?

243
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,853
Mother had a stroke this morning.

244
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,457
She's still in a coma.

245
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:56,053
-James, l'll have to go to her.
-Now, Mother, you just relax.

246
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,893
l know it's a shock, but....

247
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,895
Now, now, now, Mother.
Here. You just sit down a minute.

248
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,803
Can't be as bad as you think.

249
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,107
Never is.

250
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,551
That's right, have a good cry.
Make you feel better.

251
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,245
Then you must go right upstairs and rest.

252
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,413
But Milly, our mother....

253
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,389
James, l have to go to her.
l'm the oldest, you know.

254
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,290
There's a train out tonight.

255
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,593
-Andy will get you a timetable.
-l can't leave you.

256
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,895
l'm a big boy.
l can take care of myself.

257
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,436
-Milly will go with you.
-Thanks, James.

258
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:41,872
-She'll want to be there.
-l'll put some of our things together, Emily.

259
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,369
James, l can't leave you
and the children alone.

260
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:48,448
Who will take care
of the house and fix your meals?

261
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:52,883
Well, Emily, Providence
sometimes moves in a strange way.

262
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,081
l hired a cook this afternoon.

263
00:17:56,258 --> 00:18:00,126
Oh, James, l've wanted
to ask for one for the past five years.

264
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,956
Yes, so did l.

265
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,929
l was afraid you'd think
l didn't like your cooking.

266
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,694
Best cook in the whole world.

267
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:11,235
Aunt Milly just told us, Mother.
What can l do to help?

268
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:16,571
Here's your chance. You can start your
settlement work right here in the family.

269
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:19,009
We're used to having
a woman look after us.

270
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,809
Don't worry,
Grandma Forrest will be all right.

271
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,884
And l'll take such good care of Dad.

272
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,155
As for Andy,
if he once steps out of line, l'll--

273
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,520
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

274
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,216
Social service isn't dictatorship.

275
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:33,827
l hear what you're saying.

276
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,521
You won't ride any high horse
while Mom is away.

277
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,461
Now, children, children.

278
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:41,364
-l'm sorry, Mom.
-l'm sorry too, Mother.

279
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,768
l promise to treat Andrew
with the consideration that you do.

280
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,602
l don't like the smell of that.
l'll let it pass.

281
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,544
Mom, l won't be any
trouble to Marian or Dad.

282
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,306
l'll keep my room clean.
l'll wash before meals.

283
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:56,349
l won't be any trouble
to anyone in the world.

284
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:59,120
The age of miracle has not passed.

285
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,549
-Find a timetable upstairs.
-l'll get it!

286
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,055
Oh, no, you won't!
Dad told me to get it.

287
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,287
Everything's under control, Mom.
lnstant service. Timetable as good as here.

288
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,298
Andy!

289
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,297
That's all right.
Everything's under control.

290
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:16,368
Everything's under control.

291
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:32,078
Hey, Marian.
Ain't grub ready yet?

292
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,313
You'd let a guy starve to death.

293
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,821
lf you thought to help
while Mother's away...

294
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,392
...you'd be up at 7:30
this morning, as l was.

295
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,654
Sorry, l'm starving.
Ain't grub ready?

296
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,390
-''lsn't.'' And if you mean breakfast--
-Excuse me.

297
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:48,263
Would you inform me whether l can
partake in my morning nourishment?

298
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,838
-Come in and find out.
-Such talk!

299
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,904
Good morning, Dad.

300
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,737
Good morning, son.
Sleep well?

301
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,640
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

302
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:06,047
-ls it that bad, Dad?
-No, no, no. Not at all.

303
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,155
That's excellent coffee.

304
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,019
-Just scalding hot.
-Oh, l'm glad.

305
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:14,356
l know how fussy you are
about your coffee.

306
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:18,758
lf she made good coffee,
she must have got it out of a cookbook.

307
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:25,597
She calls that coffee?
Tastes like she put mucilage in it.

308
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:29,005
-lt's the worst l've ever tasted!
-Take it easy, Andy.

309
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:32,544
She did the best she could.
We don't want to hurt her feelings.

310
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:35,706
Leave it to me, Dad.

311
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,818
Marian, this is the best coffee
l've ever tasted.

312
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,927
Honestly, Andy?
That's sweet of you.

313
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,825
-l'll get another cup.
-Never mind. Don't bother.

314
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:54,526
-Oh, it's no bother.
-One cup is sufficient for a growing boy.

315
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,193
All right.

316
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,867
You saved my life. lf there's anything
l can ever do, say the word.

317
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,410
Thank you, Andrew.
Thank you.

318
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,706
There is something you could do for me.

319
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:12,013
-Just name it. A favor's a favor.
-The car's about due for a washing.

320
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:16,781
Yes, sir.
That just about makes us even, all right.

321
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:23,291
Mother left a note for you
to take some preserves over to the Drapers.

322
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:27,060
-Don't forget.
-Oh, yes. They have a visitor.

323
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,226
A new playmate for you.

324
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:34,137
Playmate? What do you think l do with my
spare time, dress dolls or something?

325
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:36,743
Excuse me, Andrew.
A companion.

326
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,543
-Their granddaughter from New York.
-A new girl?

327
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,741
-Yes.
-How old is she?

328
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,819
Oh, l think about 1 2 or 1 3.

329
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,512
Just a child.

330
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:50,180
l realized something.
l'm older than my years.

331
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,055
-Must have been Washington that done it.
-''Did'' it.

332
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,786
-Did it.
-Nevertheless...

333
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:58,763
...you'll have to humiliate yourself
and deliver the preserves.

334
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:02,197
l understand the little girl
next door sings.

335
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,168
Twelve years old and sings?

336
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,213
l'll go, Grandma.

337
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,447
How do you do?

338
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,456
Good morning.

339
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,424
l'm Betsy Booth.

340
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,325
Won't you come in?

341
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:32,592
My mother just sent these
over to your grandmother.

342
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,935
-You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?
-l live right next door.

343
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,240
l....

344
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,276
-l sing, you know.
-l know. l heard you.

345
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,107
Oh, that wasn't singing.
That was only practicing.

346
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,913
Well, go and practice.
Don't let me bother--

347
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,780
Oh, it's no bother. l love to....

348
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,480
l mean, l'd love to sing for you.

349
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,158
Some other time.
You just keep on practicing.

350
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,851
Music isn't the most important
thing to me.

351
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:05,659
-l play tennis. And l swim.
-Swell. Well, look, l gotta be going.

352
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,598
l gotta do something for my dad.
Wash the car.

353
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,331
l mean, tune it up.
Wash the carburetor and the spark plugs.

354
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,441
l might even look at the motor.

355
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:19,279
l bet after you work on it
it'll pass every car on the road.

356
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:24,143
Well, l wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Well, l gotta be running.

357
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,588
Well, maybe--
Could l help you?

358
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,520
No. lt's a special job.
My father won't even do it.

359
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:33,855
l'll see you later.
Goodbye.

360
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,431
l'll never be able to get a man,
much less hold him.

361
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,733
No glamour.

362
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,710
No glamour at all.

363
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,140
Betsy, who was that?

364
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:57,615
Some of Mrs. Hardy's
preserves for you, Granny.

365
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,746
No glamour.

366
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,187
That's my trouble.

367
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,552
-Hi, Andy.
-Oh, hi, Beezy.

368
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,389
Say, l've gotta talk to you.

369
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,126
Very private and confidential.

370
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,437
Just when l was
getting ready to go to work.

371
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,939
Oh, well, come on.

372
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:38,520
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

373
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:42,561
-l'm Augusta, the new cook.
-Oh, of course. Come right in.

374
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,331
-Hello there.
-Hello.

375
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,071
Say, did Andy go into the house?

376
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,940
l saw him sneaking
down the street with Beezy.

377
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,408
And if the car isn't washed,
he's going to catch it.

378
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,359
We're far enough away.
They couldn't hear us holler.

379
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,587
-What's on your mind?
-Andy...

380
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,255
-...l'm in love.
-Who is it this time?

381
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,298
-Cynthia Potter.
-That dizzy dame?

382
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:23,767
-Say, listen--
-There's no accounting for taste. Go on.

383
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,806
My folks are taking me away on a trip.
Three weeks!

384
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,136
l'm in the same boat.
Polly left today.

385
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:34,110
Andy, l don't suppose, as sort of a favor,
you'd date her up?

386
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,874
Keep the other guys away.

387
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,383
Me? Go after your girl?

388
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,851
Sure. When l get back,
you drop her cold.

389
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:44,355
-Then she's still my girl.
-That's a terrible trick to play.

390
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:48,427
-Andy, you've got to help me.
-No, no, no, no.

391
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:51,031
Look, if you do it,
l'll pay you for it.

392
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:57,528
Well, l suppose if you paid me
it'd make it more respectable.

393
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:00,038
-Just a straight business proposition.
-Sure.

394
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:03,302
You keep other guys
from dating Cynthia until l get back...

395
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,471
-...and l'll pay you four bits a week.
-Four bits a week?

396
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,415
Expose myself to a redheaded
vampire for four bits a week?

397
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,054
-Listen, l'll make it six bits.
-Look at you.

398
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:16,986
You're in love,
and all she means to you is six bits?

399
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,149
Beezy, you don't know what love is.

400
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,694
Look, l'll go one dollar.
That's as far as l'll go.

401
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:24,798
lt's a pleasure taking out Cynthia.

402
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:27,196
No, Beezy.
A dollar's not enough.

403
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,893
Well, how much do you want?

404
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,369
l need--
l want 8 bucks and expenses.

405
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,405
-Expenses?
-Think l want to ruin her reputation...

406
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:38,842
...having everybody say l'm a cheapskate?

407
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,707
You win. 8 bucks for the job
and 50 cents a week for expenses.

408
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:45,717
-Give me the 8 bucks.
-l haven't got it right now.

409
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,981
-Then the deal's off.
-When Mom gives me Christmas money...

410
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:51,318
-...l'll mail you the 8 bucks.
-When?

411
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:54,189
She'll give it to me
a week before Christmas.

412
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,796
Word of honor,
l'll have it before the 23rd.

413
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,956
-Word of honor.
-lt's a deal.

414
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,466
Leave it to me.
l've got a system with women.

415
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:05,367
After l give Cynthia the air,
she'll be tickled even with you, Beezy.

416
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,907
Hey, wait a minute.
How do l know you'll go through with it?

417
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:12,511
l know. Ask Cynthia to
the Christmas Eve dance now.

418
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:16,617
And if l know Cynthia,
you'll have to go through with it.

419
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,686
Say, that's not a bad idea.

420
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,452
After all, a redhead's a redhead.

421
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,191
l get into my tuxedo
for a cotillion in Washington--

422
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:29,625
Washington?

423
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,596
This little French girl
sees l'm a very good dancer.

424
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,736
She says, ''<i>Pardonnez-moi</i>.''
That's French for ''Excuse me.''

425
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,067
-She asked me to teach her the Big Apple.
-That's marvelous.

426
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,435
-Do you really like to dance?
-l sure do.

427
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,636
But that's with the right partner.
l'll bet you could dance swell.

428
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,044
Some girls like a fella
to hold them tight.

429
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:51,413
l bet you're different.
Fella would be too afraid.

430
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,316
Well, l am really delicate, but....

431
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:57,322
Well, it depends on who my partner is.

432
00:27:57,492 --> 00:28:01,588
Well, would you like me if l was
your partner at the Christmas dance?

433
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,321
Why, Andrew!

434
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,725
You'll really take me
to the Christmas Eve dance?

435
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:11,668
l'd better go in.
Mother will wonder why l'm out so long.

436
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,536
Goodbye, Andrew, darling.
See you tomorrow.

437
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,540
Goodbye.

438
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:29,087
Say, she's my girl.
Don't forget that.

439
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,986
You hired me, didn't you?

440
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,060
-You didn't have to kiss her.
-l didn't. She kissed me.

441
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:37,130
That's it. You start your system
and she kisses you.

442
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,462
lt was a kiss of gratitude,
like a dog licking your hand.

443
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,695
Besides, l've gotta do
my wooing my way.

444
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:46,136
She's just 8 bucks and expenses to me.

445
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,107
You might at least wipe my girl's
lipstick off your face.

446
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:59,786
Hello.

447
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:04,522
Say, did you notice anything around here
about washing this car?

448
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,717
Yes, l had Mother's chauffeur do it.

449
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:09,159
-Mother's what?
-Mother's chauffeur.

450
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,731
-l heard your sister say you'd catch it.
-You've got a chauffeur?

451
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,597
Mother has.
The one that drives the town car.

452
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,137
-Town car? Here?
-Sure. lt brought me.

453
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:22,743
-How do you think l got here?
-How do l think she got here?

454
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:25,402
What kind of a car?
How many cylinders?

455
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,447
-Two hundred.
-Two hundred?

456
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,710
-Listen, no car has 200 cylinders.
-Hasn't it?

457
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:33,353
No.

458
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,651
Oh, then it's 200 horsepower
and only 1 2 cylinders.

459
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:41,557
Only 1 2 cylinders and 200 horsepower.

460
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:45,798
Children that don't know what's what
trusted with town cars.

461
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:49,969
Betsy? Your name is Betsy, isn't it?

462
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,732
Betsy, l'd like to repay the favor.

463
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:56,468
l'd like to take you to the drugstore
and buy you an ice cream soda.

464
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,305
Will you, Andy?

465
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:03,646
But it's kind of far, and it's liable to snow
before we get there and dad's using our car.

466
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,549
Mother's chauffeur can drive us down
before he starts for Chicago.

467
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,624
That's right. l never thought of that.
Let's go!

468
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,434
Yes, sir. Some boat, all right.

469
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,636
The radiator cap alone would make you
feel like you was a millionaire.

470
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:36,616
Hello, folks.
What'll it be?

471
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,218
Chocolate soda with
vanilla ice cream, please.

472
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,014
-Make it two, buddy.
-You bet.

473
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,953
Something about ice cream sodas
makes a fella feel...

474
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:48,118
...as though he's wasting time with
meat and vegetables. Ain't it the truth?

475
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:51,823
-Hello, Cynthia.
-How do you do, Mr. Hardy?

476
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,834
Hey, Cynthia, wait a minute.

477
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,994
-Cynthia!
-Pardon me, Mr. Hardy.

478
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:01,301
l'm not in the habit of being practically
knocked down by casual acquaintances.

479
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,741
Casual acquaintances!
What are you mad about?

480
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,404
There are plenty of boys
l could go around with.

481
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,846
No, you can't go around
with anybody but me.

482
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,077
l don't even have to go
to the dance with you.

483
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:13,845
Oh, yes, you do.
You promised.

484
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,819
l wasn't crazy about Beezy...

485
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,925
...but at least he didn't
go out with other girls.

486
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:22,119
Oh, her? Oh, she's just a little kid
visiting next door.

487
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,097
Dad told me to be nice to her.
lt won't happen again.

488
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,395
l'll see you every day, every minute.
l'll monopolize you.

489
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,267
-This afternoon?
-What´ll we do?

490
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,204
Beezy could always think
of something for us to do.

491
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,844
We could go and watch
basketball practice.

492
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,139
l don't like basketball.

493
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:44,908
-l used to like to roller skate.
-l don't like to roller skate.

494
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:48,451
l don't suppose you'd like to
play a set of tennis.

495
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:52,115
Why, l'd love to.
Oh, l have the loveliest new sports outfit.

496
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:55,387
Well, you be at my house at 2:00.

497
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,034
-Excuse me for running away, Betsy.
-lt's all right.

498
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,773
You see, l can't afford
to fight with Cynthia.

499
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:09,409
-ls she your girl?
-No.

500
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,943
l gotta be nice to her till after Christmas.

501
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,638
You expecting her to give you
a special present?

502
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,374
No.

503
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,678
Look, this is a secret:
l bought a car.

504
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,585
l paid 1 2 bucks down on it and
promised to pay 8 more by the 23rd.

505
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:25,589
That's why l gotta be nice to her.

506
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,593
-l don't get it.
-Cynthia's Beezy Anderson's girl.

507
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:33,200
He's away, and he promised to pay me
to keep the other fellas away from her.

508
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,365
She's just an installment on a car to me.

509
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:41,804
Polly Benedict's my real girl,
but she's away too.

510
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:46,836
Sometimes l wonder if it's all worthwhile.

511
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:57,614
Twenty bucks!

512
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,983
Mother said in case l needed extras...

513
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:03,494
...so if you wouldn't mind, Andy,
l'd like to pay for the sodas.

514
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:06,532
-No. l asked you.
-Please?

515
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:09,932
Why, l don't do things that way.

516
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:13,198
Andy...

517
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,199
...you need that 8 bucks
pretty badly, don't you?

518
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,141
You're darn tooting l do.

519
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:23,540
l'd love to give you the $8, Andy.

520
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,118
No. l couldn't take money from a woman.

521
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,555
Not even if she's just a child?

522
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,082
l couldn't even borrow it from you.

523
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,722
-You wouldn't have to be nice to Cynthia.
-You don't understand.

524
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:39,856
Polly being away, the girl l take to
the dance has gotta be sensational.

525
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:43,364
l'll bet Cynthia's got
a sensational evening dress.

526
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,030
No, l can't afford to fight with Cynthia,
not a man in my position.

527
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,937
Then it isn't the $8.

528
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,340
Well, it's both the $8 and Cynthia.

529
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:54,538
l gotta take Cynthia to the dance
to get $8 for the car...

530
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,708
...and l gotta have a car
to take anybody to the dance.

531
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:01,488
Well, then you won't really
enjoy taking Cynthia?

532
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,117
Well, even if she dances like a horse...

533
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,160
...it's an awful long ride
home in the dark.

534
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,329
Augusta, you must realize we're
accustomed to the best of everything.

535
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:19,871
l want you to pay particular
attention to the coffee.

536
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:27,376
You call that coffee? That's mud.
That's what it is, mud.

537
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,516
Augusta, do you realize
you are being insulting?

538
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:34,519
l quit. Any house that calls
that mud coffee, l don't work in.

539
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,850
-Oh, but, Augusta, l--
-Marian?

540
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:40,923
Well, well, well,
what seems to be the difficulty?

541
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:43,222
-She insulted my coffee.
-Mud.

542
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:47,094
Any house that calls that mud coffee, l quit.
l don't work there.

543
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:50,294
But, Dad, you said yourself it was excellent.

544
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:53,540
lt is. lt's fine coffee.

545
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,040
Yes, Augusta, it's fine coffee.

546
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,611
Of course, only amateur coffee.
l know you could do much better.

547
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,043
l'll try, Your Honor.

548
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:03,809
We'll reserve that ''Your Honor''
for the courtroom.

549
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:05,885
Okay, judge.

550
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,949
Come along, Marian.
We ought to write to Mother.

551
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:13,959
Anyhow, it was mud.

552
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,096
That's what it was, mud.

553
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:26,004
But, Dad, the bathroom was filthy.
The towels were black.

554
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:28,438
Where he accumulates
such filth and grease--

555
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,101
You can't please her.
She hollers if l wash and hollers if l don't.

556
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,771
He has no more conception
of cleanliness than--

557
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,310
-Than a tomcat?
-Exactly.

558
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,885
You see? She wants me
to lick myself clean.

559
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,648
lf he thinks l'll clean up after him,
he's wrong.

560
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:48,318
Oh, l'll do that.
lt'll be easy after twins at the Tompkins' .

561
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,259
Thank you, Augusta.

562
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,194
l'll go.

563
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,627
Everybody spoils Andy because
he's the baby in the family.

564
00:35:56,804 --> 00:36:00,331
Baby? Dad, am l gonna have to be
insulted until l'm 80?

565
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,272
lt won't happen again, Marian.

566
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:07,205
Special delivery.

567
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,901
She all right, Dad?

568
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,032
Mother's well and sends her love.

569
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:33,765
They don't know about
Grandmother Forrest yet.

570
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,602
Pretty serious, l guess.

571
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:40,543
What do you say, with Grandma Forrest
so sick, we give up our social engagements?

572
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:44,981
Well, what is it that Grandmother Forrest
always asks you when you visit her?

573
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,676
''Are you having a good time?''

574
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:50,521
l think that's your answer, Andy,
in Grandmother's own words.

575
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,520
l'll get it.

576
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,592
Hello?

577
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,597
Just a minute.

578
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:04,364
-lt's for you, Andy.
-Who is it?

579
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,132
The same one. Cynthia.
lt's the fourth time today.

580
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:11,369
-She ought to move here and save money.
-Oh, smart cracks.

581
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,807
Hello, Cynthia?

582
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,311
Yes, Cynthia.

583
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:19,352
Well, anything you wanna do.

584
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,384
Why, sure, l'd like to.

585
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,852
Yes, ma'am.
l mean, certainly, Cynthia.

586
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:32,430
All right, Cynthia.
Goodbye.

587
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:41,131
Well, l don't think you're
very amusing, Andy.

588
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,176
What else is there to do
at a pool except swim?

589
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,609
lf you can't think of anything
to amuse me--

590
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:49,648
Okay, okay, watch me.

591
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:08,894
Andy! Stop it, Andy! Stop!

592
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,530
Really, there's no need
to practically drown me.

593
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,836
l'm sorry. Come on in.
The water's swell.

594
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:18,672
No, my hair would get wet.

595
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,370
Oh, well, can't you dry it?

596
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,039
Andrew, l haven't ordinary hair
like some girls.

597
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,812
Special hair like mine is a great
responsibility. l never get it wet.

598
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:30,116
You'll get wet if you swim,
get muscles if you play tennis--

599
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,419
-Other boys would be glad of a chance--
-Don't get mad...

600
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:38,293
...but you don't need a bathing suit to sit.
Can't you think of something else to do?

601
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,400
Well, we....

602
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,525
We could take a walk.

603
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:48,004
Say, that's not a bad idea.
l know just the place.

604
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:51,201
lt's a little longer than
the regular way home, but....

605
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:57,310
Well, l finally found something
you like to do.

606
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,612
Well, doesn't it interest you?

607
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:03,154
Well, l'm not exactly doing you any favors.

608
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,791
Would you rather be swimming?

609
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,985
What do you think?

610
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:12,724
Hey, Andy! Andy, come in a minute,
l wanna talk to you.

611
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,098
All right, but l can't make it long.
lf l'm late for dinner, l'll catch it.

612
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,637
-What's up?
-Come here. l got something to show you.

613
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:25,210
What is it?

614
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,074
lt's a--

615
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,227
Must have been that
jelly sandwich that l had.

616
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,431
Come on in here.

617
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,465
What's all the mystery?

618
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,165
l got you a present.
l hope you like it.

619
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,742
Well, what do you know?

620
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:05,613
Do you like it?

621
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:07,947
Why, it's the best present l ever got.

622
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:11,990
l'm glad. l guessed you wanted one,
so l ordered it. lt just now got here.

623
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,519
lt'll make my car look like a million.
Gee, thanks, Betsy.

624
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:18,756
Some girls don't know what to get a guy,
but this is swell.

625
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:23,063
Why, Cynthia, she'll be crazy about it.
And Polly, she'll go wild.

626
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:25,831
l'm sure they'll like it.

627
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,970
l'll drop by before the dance
and show you.

628
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,872
That'll be nice.

629
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,639
Dinner's almost ready,
so l better be going along.

630
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:37,045
-Thanks again. Goodbye.
-Bye.

631
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:43,488
Aren't you going to practice, Betsy?

632
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,591
Yes, Granny.

633
00:44:56,543 --> 00:45:00,639
l know, but men just don't seem to be
as important as when l was a young girl.

634
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:03,305
Well, if it isn't the old ladies'
sewing circle.

635
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:05,008
-Hi, Andy.
-Hello there, Andy.

636
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:08,052
-Did you enjoy your games?
-Games?

637
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:12,157
With a bit more practice,
l might be able to make the Potsy team.

638
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:13,953
-What's that?
-Nothing, nothing.

639
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,529
Oh, all right.
You're going to have secrets, so can l.

640
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:20,132
There are ways of handling
mysterious children.

641
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,861
Just because you're the only woman here
doesn't make you my mother.

642
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:27,063
lf you act that way,
l won't give you your telegram.

643
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,903
Telegram! Oh, my dearest sister...

644
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:33,205
...if l've offended you in any way,
l beg you to forgive me.

645
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,975
After all, we children, we just--
We just don't understand.

646
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,557
Gee, thanks, sis. Thanks.

647
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,244
Two girls.

648
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:17,481
Two girls for the same dance.

649
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:37,138
Good morning, Dad, Marian.
Any word from Mom?

650
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,109
No news is good news, son.

651
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:45,350
Well, in case you're at all curious,
l finished my Christmas shopping today.

652
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,218
Me too. And l wanna thank somebody for
that extra money l found on my table.

653
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,827
That's all right, honey.
Christmas comes but once a year.

654
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,732
-Well.
-Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy.

655
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:07,435
l'll sign for it.

656
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:11,505
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Good morning.

657
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:15,114
Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy.

658
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,749
Thanks, Dad.

659
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,045
Francis Bacon Anderson.
Why, that's Beezy Anderson.

660
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,383
-Want me to read it to you?
-Good old Beezy, real pal.

661
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,787
Right on time, just like the Pony Express.

662
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:28,587
-Goodbye, children.
-Bye, Dad.

663
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,493
Open it. Let's read about the teddy bear
Beezy's getting for Christmas.

664
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,157
Oh, no hurry.
l know what's inside.

665
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:37,203
And l know who that is.

666
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,670
''This is Miss Potter speaking.
May l please speak to Andrew?''

667
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:43,241
Kindergarten society.

668
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,415
Hello?

669
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:52,114
What's on your mind, Cynthia?

670
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,882
Oh, don't worry about the dance.
l wouldn't miss it for anything in the world.

671
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,524
Oh, you got your new formal dress?

672
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:02,962
Sensational, huh?

673
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,859
No back in it at all?

674
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,595
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

675
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,397
Well, l'll be seeing you soon.

676
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:14,200
All right, dear.
Bye-bye.

677
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:33,652
Hello. ls Miss Polly Benedict in, please?

678
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,857
Listen, will you tell her
Mr. Andrew Hardy called...

679
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,364
...and he's unable to take her to the dance?
He remembered a previous engagement.

680
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,334
Thank you so much. Bye.

681
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,515
-Hello.
-Hello.

682
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:03,520
l spent all my money except 60 cents,
and l still got two presents to buy.

683
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,888
Gee, l'd like to help you, Betsy,
but l've got a very important deal to close.

684
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:11,329
Beezy came through like
the Marines landing.

685
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:17,130
Then it's all fixed up about your--
Your car?

686
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:42,459
-Oh, l'm ruined.
-Andy, what's the matter?

687
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:46,497
-Are you sick?
-Oh, l wish l was sick.

688
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,295
Oh, how l wished l was sick.

689
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:54,637
Beezy's gone and fallen for another girl.
He said l could have Cynthia.

690
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:57,971
The whole deal's off.
l'm cooked.

691
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,841
Well, we've gotta do something.

692
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,175
We gotta talk to Mr. Dugan.

693
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,841
Come on.
Come on, Andy.

694
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,543
Come on.

695
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,051
All right.

696
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:13,715
No 8 bucks, no sports-model
roadster, my friend.

697
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,361
Gee, Mr. Dugan, couldn't l--

698
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:18,521
You gotta pay for this car
by tomorrow noon or--

699
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:21,167
You're Judge Hardy's son, aren't you?

700
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:23,492
Yeah, sort of.

701
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,230
l'll go to court and get
an order to show cause.

702
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,933
And you know what that'll mean.

703
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:32,140
Yeah, l--
l got a rough idea.

704
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:35,042
Well, there you are.

705
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:43,180
Andy.

706
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,852
l've only got 60 cents...

707
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:53,091
...but l've got a fur jacket, practically new.
We could pawn it and pay Mr. Dugan.

708
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,562
But we just can't let this happen.

709
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:00,571
Betsy, you're the best friend l ever had,
but l couldn't let you do that.

710
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:04,108
lt's-- Well, it's more than a car now.

711
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:07,041
Yes, but if l did get the money,
no one would know.

712
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:08,977
l gotta do this myself.

713
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,844
Dad used to recite me a poem.

714
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:14,680
lt's all about a tangled web you make
when you start deceiving people.

715
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:16,288
l know what it means now.

716
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:20,449
When you do something phony
and it turns out good, it's still all wrong.

717
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:25,030
-Maybe if l explained to your father.
-No, l've gotta do my own explaining.

718
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,758
Of course, l never told him any real lies.

719
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,596
l just can't seem to be able to.

720
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:35,297
But, gee, he'll start thinking that sometimes
not actually telling a dozen lies...

721
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,909
...is worse than really telling one.

722
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:41,309
No, l've gotta tell Dad.

723
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:46,179
And there's no telling what'll happen.

724
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,001
Did you want to be alone, Dad?

725
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:09,631
No, not at all, not at all.
Sit down.

726
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,808
Dad?

727
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:21,177
What's an order to show cause?

728
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,489
ln case someone wants to start
a lawsuit against you...

729
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:29,288
...they ask the court to direct you to show
cause why they shouldn't be granted relief.

730
00:52:29,462 --> 00:52:31,054
Like being arrested?

731
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,699
Technically, you're in custody.

732
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,934
Why this interest in the law?
Going to follow in your father's footsteps?

733
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:42,564
No. A friend of mine got himself mixed up
in one of them show causes.

734
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,302
Too bad for your friend.

735
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:53,350
-Dad?
-Yes, Andy?

736
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,750
l'm in an awful jam.

737
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,119
Well, that's too bad.
What's the trouble?

738
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,817
l.... You see--

739
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,687
Start from the beginning.

740
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:06,992
Well, to tell the truth,
you're partly to blame for it all.

741
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,828
l am?

742
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,229
You and Polly Benedict's grandmother.

743
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,270
You just tell me how l'm guilty.

744
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,966
When l asked you for the money
to get a tuxedo...

745
00:53:17,143 --> 00:53:19,737
...you gave it to me.
lf you hadn't, l couldn't...

746
00:53:19,913 --> 00:53:22,575
...go to the dance
where you had to wear a tuxedo.

747
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:25,240
When you wear a tuxedo,
you gotta take a girl...

748
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:27,818
...and you've gotta have a car
to take her in.

749
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:29,387
l see.

750
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:32,047
Well, what about Polly Benedict's
grandmother?

751
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:36,389
She took Polly away for the holidays,
so l couldn't take her to the dance.

752
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:40,124
Because l couldn't take Polly,
l got mixed up with Beezy's girl.

753
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,827
-Beezy's girl?
-Cynthia. The one that's calling all the time.

754
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:47,940
-Dad, can l talk to you man-to-man?
-That's the way l always want it to be.

755
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:52,272
Well, man-to-man, Dad, can a guy
be in love with two girls at once?

756
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:58,149
Both are estimable young ladies?

757
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:02,677
Oh, well, we just do a little
hugging and kissing, Dad.

758
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:05,347
l mean, good, clean fun,
just like Polly and me.

759
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:06,856
Object matrimony?

760
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:10,895
Matrimony? You don't have to worry.
l'm never gonna get married, ever.

761
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:12,827
That's a momentous decision.

762
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:17,402
Well, not at least until l'm middle-aged,
you know, 25 or 26.

763
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:19,829
That's a sound idea.

764
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,066
-Dad, l don't understand these modern girls.
-ln what way?

765
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,638
Polly, for instance.
Sometimes she won't let you kiss her.

766
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:30,112
But this Cynthia, she'll let you
kiss her whenever you want.

767
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:32,945
She doesn't wanna swim,
play tennis, go for walks.

768
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,577
All she does is wanna kiss you.
l'm a nervous wreck.

769
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:42,590
Well, of the two degrees of kissing,
which seems the most desirable to you?

770
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:47,199
When you wanna kiss a girl and she won't
let you, you wanna kiss her all the time.

771
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,230
But this Cynthia....

772
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:53,498
Do you think it's wrong for a guy not to
want a girl kissing him all the time?

773
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:57,835
Well, what would you say?

774
00:54:58,511 --> 00:54:59,773
l don't know.

775
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:02,847
When l only had three days
to go around with Cynthia...

776
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:05,814
...l felt like a free man
for the first time in weeks.

777
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:07,351
Three more days?

778
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,957
Yeah. l promised l'd date her up for Beezy
till Christmas, to save her for him.

779
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,526
For 8 bucks--
For 8 dollars that l needed for....

780
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:18,688
Remember, now, this is man-to-man.

781
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:22,594
You'll know anyway tomorrow,
so l might as well tell you.

782
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:27,399
l gave Peter Dugan $ 1 2 out of my bank
account for a down payment on a car...

783
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,442
...and promised to give him
the remaining $8 by the 23rd.

784
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:37,077
Was this before or after we had
our little talk about cars?

785
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,377
Before. l wouldn't have done it after...

786
00:55:39,552 --> 00:55:43,488
...but l was already stuck
for the 1 2 bucks-- Dollars.

787
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:47,285
And, well, now Beezy isn't gonna
send me the 8 bucks...

788
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,089
...and Mr. Dugan's going to your court
to get an order against me...

789
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,324
-...and here l am, and l'm sunk.
-l shall issue the order.

790
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:56,668
Mr. Dugan can serve me...

791
00:55:56,836 --> 00:56:01,068
...and l'll take whatever steps l think
necessary as proper punishment for you.

792
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:04,536
Why, you can't do that!
You mustn't do that! lt isn't human.

793
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:09,045
Dad, why do you have to be an old crank,
way behind the times? This is 1 938!

794
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,015
You made easy money in Washington.
l don't see why you can't give me $8.

795
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:14,915
Andrew!

796
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,286
Come back here.

797
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,061
All right. Man-to-man.

798
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:25,754
You've asked me a question,
and l'll answer it.

799
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:30,460
That money, that unexpected windfall,
must never be touched.

800
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,502
-Do you know why?
-Why?

801
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:35,664
That's to guarantee you
a college education...

802
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:40,142
...so you, your sister and your mother
will have resources to take care of them...

803
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:44,147
-...in case l'm not able to.
-ln case you lose your job?

804
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,148
No.

805
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,946
But a man doesn't live forever.

806
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:53,058
Too frequently, l hear of men l went
to school with that have passed on...

807
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:56,389
...and l'm shocked to learn
that they leave boys like you...

808
00:56:56,563 --> 00:57:00,966
...and girls like your sister and wives
like your mother with nothing, not a penny.

809
00:57:01,134 --> 00:57:04,228
Dad, don't you dare talk about dying.

810
00:57:04,404 --> 00:57:07,430
-We must plan for it.
-l can't stand it.

811
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:10,201
l can't let myself think about
you not being here.

812
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:11,866
All right, Andy.

813
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:14,206
Do you want into that kind of money...

814
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,076
...or shall we let it all remain in the bank?

815
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,378
Give me a good licking.
l'd rather have that than more talk.

816
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:24,956
No, that's why l used words
instead of a slipper on your pants.

817
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:27,357
Are you feeling all right, Dad?

818
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,518
Yes, l feel all right.

819
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,722
-Have you been to the doctor lately?
-No. What are you--

820
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:36,801
-Here. l'll get you a pillow.
-No, no. There's nothing wrong with me.

821
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,700
Oh, l understand.

822
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,267
Well, don't you worry.

823
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:46,378
Barring accidents, l expect to be
with you for a long time yet.

824
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,614
Maybe you'd better take a tonic.
Once or twice a day.

825
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:53,650
Maybe you don't get enough sleep.
A little castor oil would do the trick.

826
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:59,087
No, no, no. There's nothing--
Let's just dismiss our problem.

827
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,989
Remember that your mother
is a long way from here...

828
00:58:02,162 --> 00:58:05,131
...and she's got a serious
problem all her own.

829
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:07,266
Why? Did you get a telegram from her?

830
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:10,960
No, but l have a feeling Mother's
not very happy at this minute.

831
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:12,900
Did you get a message...

832
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,866
...kind of a thought, a telepathy?

833
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,941
lt doesn't matter what you call it.

834
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,774
After two people have lived as close as
your mother and me after all these years...

835
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:24,109
...you sense things about each other.

836
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:27,048
Why don't you send her
a wire and make sure?

837
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,085
They haven't any telephone.

838
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,782
Besides, a telegram is always
so startling to your mother.

839
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:36,122
l'd give anything to let
her know we're trying to help her.

840
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:40,460
l know how we could get word to Mom
without upsetting her. By using a ham.

841
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:42,931
-A ham?
-A ham outfit. A radio.

842
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,593
Jimmy MacMahon's got one.
We could have him--

843
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,763
Wait a minute. Hold on.

844
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,910
l don't believe Jimmy MacMahon
would be very eager to--

845
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,442
Why not?

846
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,546
Because he was in your court once?

847
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:59,151
Dad, kids don't hold a grudge against old
folks just because they punish them.

848
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:00,843
-No?
-Certainly not.

849
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,684
lf they did, everybody would be hating
their father. Which, of course, they don't.

850
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,724
Don't they, Andy?

851
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:14,390
-You ought to know, Dad.
-Yes, l know, son. l know.

852
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:19,197
Tell me, now, what about this Jimmy
MacMahon's ham? What do we....

853
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,246
Dad, write the message.
Soon as he gets it--

854
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:34,182
All set? Quiet, please.
Here we go.

855
00:59:34,354 --> 00:59:37,448
This is W8XZR calling

Okay. Come in, Brigham.

860
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,632
You mean to tell me that he can--

861
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:53,260
He contacts some bird with a
ham radio near Grandmother's farm...

862
00:59:53,439 --> 00:59:56,431
...and then this fellow,
without disturbing anybody...

863
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:58,839
...goes and gives the message to Mom.

864
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,412
-Amazing.
-There's nothing amazing about it.

865
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:04,982
-Kids are doing it all over.
-We once got a guy in Australia...

866
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:10,555
...when the telephone people couldn't find
him. Relax, because it takes quite a while.

867
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:18,753

Listen, Brigham, get this right.

877
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:02,066
Emergency. Will you take down a message
and get it to the Forrest farm near Brigham?

878
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:06,905
No telephone. Sickness, maybe death in the
place, so don't disturb anybody.

879
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,445
Take this message.

01:02:20,353 --> 01:02:24,449
This is W8XZR.
Go ahead, VE3AVS.

897
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:29,918
<i>I got in through the back door</i>
<i>of the Forrest</i>´<i>s to cook in kitchen.</i>

898
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,360
<i>Cook delivered message to Mrs. Hardy.</i>

899
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:36,400
<i>Have a message from Mrs. Hardy</i>

900
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:37,831

901
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:44,034
<i>Message number 329</i>

902
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:48,873

<i>Inexpressibly helped by your dear thoughts.</i>

904
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,280
<i>Grandmother very low.</i>

905
01:02:57,723 --> 01:03:00,453

01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,863

<i>All my love, Mother Hardy. ""</i>

910
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:18,603
<i>Okay, W8XZR.</i>
<i>Is that satisfactory?</i>

911
01:03:18,778 --> 01:03:21,212
<i>Come in, W8XZR.</i>

912
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:25,977
This is W8XZR. More than satisfactory,
old man. Thanks a million.

913
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:28,586
l'll do the same for you sometime.

914
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:30,415
Say, who are you?

915
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:35,254
How old are you? Where's your place?
Come on in, VE3AVS.

916
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:38,989
<i>Hello, W8XZR.</i>
<i>This is VE3A VS.</i>

917
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:40,826
<i>My name is Basil Gordon.</i>

918
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,436
<i>I</i>´<i>m 1 2 and I work on my</i>
<i>father</i>´<i>s farm near the Forrest</i>´<i>s.</i>

919
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:48,134
<i>And I built this set myself.</i>
<i>Drop me a QSL card.</i>

920
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:50,798
<i>Come in, W8XZR.</i>

921
01:03:52,545 --> 01:03:54,706
All right, Basil.
Thanks again.

922
01:03:54,881 --> 01:04:00,945
So 73 and lots of DX.
This is W8XZR signing off for the night.

923
01:04:02,154 --> 01:04:05,248
Twelve years old.

924
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,823
l wouldn't believe it.

925
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:10,520
Well, Dad, boys are good
for something after all, aren't they?

926
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:12,759
Jimmy...

927
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,891
...l'm going to send a check tomorrow
for the damage to that tractor.

928
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:20,436
And man-to-man, thank you.

929
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,632
That's all right, judge.
Thank you.

930
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:28,303
And as for that tractor smashup,
well, l had it coming.

931
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:32,178
Heaven only knows what
this generation has coming.

932
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:54,438
-Oh, hello.
-lt's Betsy.

933
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:58,907
Excuse me, Judge Hardy.
l just came over to see how Andy--

934
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:01,638
Marian said l could wait here
until you got back.

935
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,647
-Where is Marian?
-Going over the household accounts.

936
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,411
She can't figure out why food
costs so much.

937
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:10,681
About that other business,
do whatever you think l deserve.

938
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:13,950
l'll tell you what l'm gonna
do about that, Andrew.

939
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:17,755
l'm going down to Peter Dugan's
place tomorrow morning...

940
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,488
...and get you your car.

941
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:23,032
-Gosh! Thanks, Dad!
-Andy, you'll have your own car!

942
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:25,170
Sure! l got my new car!

943
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,999
-Good night, Betsy.
-Good night.

944
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,731
Good night, and thanks again.

945
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:32,002
lt's swell when both fellas think
the other guy done him a favor.

946
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,078
-''Did.''
-Did. And how.

947
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:37,409
-Good night, Betsy.
-Good night, Dad.

948
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:40,408
-Andy.
-Yeah?

949
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:43,749
What are you going to do
about your two girls?

950
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:47,248
Gosh-all hemlock.

951
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:50,554
l can't take two girls to a dance.

952
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:54,222
We've gotta figure out how
to settle things without any trouble.

953
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,528
l wanna take Polly.
She's the best-looking girl in Carvel.

954
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,432
But l can't get rid of Cynthia.

955
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:03,166
Cynthia's a stunner.
She's gonna wear a sensational dress.

956
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:07,176
But if l take Cynthia to the dance,
Polly will never speak to me again.

957
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:15,119
Andy, what if Cynthia accidentally
learned about Polly...

958
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:20,486
-...and Polly about Cynthia?
-Don't even speak it. Then l'd have no girl.

959
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,158
We couldn't have that, could we?

960
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:29,995
But suppose you found another girl
that Polly wouldn't be jealous of.

961
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:31,636
You don't understand.

962
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:34,796
Sensational girls don't come
a dime a dozen in Carvel.

963
01:06:34,974 --> 01:06:37,943
Well, does she have to be
so awfully sensational?

964
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,307
Does she have to be sensational?
To drive up in my new car...

965
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,176
...me in my tuxedo,
to say nothing of the opera hat?

966
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,716
Does she have to be sensational?

967
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,448
l see.

968
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:57,585
l guess no girl in the world would be
sensational enough for that.

969
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,789
-Good night, Andy.
-Good night, Betsy.

970
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:04,834
How long does it take for a letter
to get from Carvel to Chicago and back?

971
01:07:05,004 --> 01:07:08,030
l don't know. lt depends
how quickly it's answered. Why?

972
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:12,007
Nothing. l was just wondering why Mother
hadn't answered my last letter.

973
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:15,375
-Good night, Andy.
-Good night, Betsy.

974
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:25,516
Polly, if you're still my girl
after this mess is cleared up...

975
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:28,660
...l'll never go in for polygamy again.

976
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:42,530
There's a lot of power,
but l can't let her out all the way yet.

977
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:47,042
Yes, l can feel it straining
at the leash right now.

978
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:59,024
Wait just a minute, Dad.
l'll get it. l'll get it.

979
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:05,893
When l put my new radiator cap on,
we'll go for a long drive.

980
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:10,263
l think l'd better stay close to the
house in case there's word from Mother.

981
01:08:10,436 --> 01:08:14,338
lt's kind of a tough day before Christmas,
ain't it-- lsn't it?

982
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,305
Especially for Mother.

983
01:08:30,956 --> 01:08:34,392
After that business in the drugstore,
l had to explain to you.

984
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,496
-Awfully sweet of you.
-You mustn't ever be jealous of me.

985
01:08:38,664 --> 01:08:41,497
Andy's simply thrilled
he's taking you to the dance.

986
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:43,862
-He says you're different.
-l don't know.

987
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,163
You have an important
social position...

988
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:50,297
...and with a big formal dance, he
couldn't afford to take you any old way.

989
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:51,670
Well?

990
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:54,972
So he bought a car
so he could bring you in style.

991
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:01,680
l wish l could be there to see you looking
gorgeous in a new evening dress...

992
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:06,689
...driving up with Andy in his own car
and everybody staring and....

993
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,158
-Have you seen the car?
-Yes. He showed it to me at Dugan's...

994
01:09:10,329 --> 01:09:12,320
...where he's buying it.

995
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:16,525
Well, this is Dugan's now.

996
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:24,071
And here's Andy's car. They've
got it all fixed up and ready for him.

997
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:32,578
Does he expect me to ride
in this junk heap?

998
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:36,847
Your dress might get dirty, but
he'll cover the seat with a piece of carpet--

999
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:39,786
Me, in a thing like this.

1000
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:43,622
Well, l'll have a few words
to say to Mr. Andrew Hardy.

1001
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:47,459
Of all the nerve. Well!

1002
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,506
<i>I</i>´<i>ve never been so insulted in all my life.</i>

1003
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:59,166
You aren't fit to take a girl out
who's been used to the very best.

1004
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:01,813
Don't you ever try to see me again,
Mr. Hardy.

1005
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:06,208
<i>Riding in such a wreck. It</i>´<i>s insulting!</i>
<i>Don</i>´<i>t ever come to my house again.</i>

1006
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:09,582
<i>And don</i>´<i>t you ever try</i>
<i>to see me again, ever!</i>

1007
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:14,454
lf you don't stop hollering, you're liable
to get big muscles all over your face.

1008
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:29,773
Hey, Betsy! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
What do you think has happened?

1009
01:10:29,942 --> 01:10:33,036
-What? Tell me!
-Cynthia won't go to the dance!

1010
01:10:33,212 --> 01:10:36,409
That's a shame. She had such
a sensational evening dress.

1011
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:39,278
We're gonna go and square it with Polly.

1012
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:42,511
l don't think l'd better.
l don't know Polly.

1013
01:10:42,688 --> 01:10:47,352
You'd love Polly. l'm sure she'd like you.
Come on, she adores children. Come on.

1014
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:49,756
Come on, Betsy. Come on in.

1015
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:15,919
Hello, Polly.

1016
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:19,615
-l see you got my message.
-Yes.

1017
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:23,125
The butler gave me your message,
and it was very clear.

1018
01:11:23,295 --> 01:11:25,855
Don't be sore at me.
l can explain everything.

1019
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:29,762
lf you can explain this,
you're smarter than l think you are.

1020
01:11:29,935 --> 01:11:32,836
Smarter than l thought you were.

1021
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,634
Can l come in and talk to you
for just a minute?

1022
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:41,576
l suppose one can't very well turn
a former friend from the door.

1023
01:11:51,156 --> 01:11:55,286
l only took the other girl out while you were
away. You weren't gonna be here--

1024
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,725
You didn't know until
the day before l left.

1025
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,764
-You gotta be polite to people, don't you?
-Did you take walks with her?

1026
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:03,697
No.

1027
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:06,937
A fellow has gotta have a little exercise.

1028
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:10,007
-Did you put your arm around her?
-No.

1029
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:12,200
Maybe just a little bit.

1030
01:12:12,778 --> 01:12:15,246
You-- You kissed her too.

1031
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:20,044
Polly, you make it sound--
l didn't like it. Honest, l didn't...

1032
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:21,686
...very much.

1033
01:12:22,354 --> 01:12:25,255
Don't be mad.
l don't like any other girl except you.

1034
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,222
All the time,
l was wishing you were here.

1035
01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:29,725
Who's the girl?

1036
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:31,260
l can't tell you, Polly.

1037
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:35,127
Andrew Hardy, you tell me who she is.

1038
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,564
Cynthia Potter.

1039
01:12:37,736 --> 01:12:40,330
That awful red-headed creature?

1040
01:12:40,506 --> 01:12:43,066
-Andy, how could you?
-l don't know, Polly.

1041
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:46,541
l must have been out of my mind,
but l needed $8.

1042
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:50,148
Beezy said he'd give it to me
if l'd date up Cynthia for him.

1043
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:53,716
-What?
-You see, it was only for financial reasons.

1044
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:55,615
For money?

1045
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:59,383
Andrew Hardy, that's the most
contemptible, the most--

1046
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:01,890
You're nothing but a gigolo.

1047
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:05,030
l never want to see you again
as long as l live.

1048
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:08,064
Polly!
Polly, wait a minute.

1049
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:12,067
Besides, when l got your message, l made
a date with a man from New York.

1050
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:15,900
And he's wearing
full dress and a silk hat.

1051
01:13:16,075 --> 01:13:18,509
Wait till you see who he is.

1052
01:13:22,948 --> 01:13:25,109
Polly.

1053
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:45,029
Well?

1054
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,529
She never wants to see me again.

1055
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:01,641
l doubt if Thomas Edison
himself could have done better.

1056
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:05,779
lt's lovely, Dad, but l do think Andrew
might have helped a little.

1057
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:12,056
He's sitting in, walking around, polishing
and pouring out his heart to his new car.

1058
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:15,824
But it is about time he came in.

1059
01:14:16,668 --> 01:14:20,536
Well, anyway, the tree's done.

1060
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,881
Well, why don't you sleep out here...

1061
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:38,045
-...or take the car to bed with you?
-l wouldn't get to sleep anyway, Pop.

1062
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:41,192
l guess l was just too smart
for myself this time.

1063
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,126
First l had two girls and no car,
and now l got a car and no girl.

1064
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:47,523
There just isn't any justice.

1065
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:48,996
Andrew...

1066
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:54,629
...for years l've been administering justice
as l thought the guilty ones deserved it.

1067
01:14:54,806 --> 01:14:58,139
You'd be surprised at the number
of people who define justice...

1068
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,245
...as something they think
they'd like to get.

1069
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:04,871
-Why don't you go to the dance alone?
-Stag? No.

1070
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:08,281
The fellows would think l couldn't
get a girl. l'd be ruined.

1071
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:11,616
l just can't take any girl.
She's gotta be a knockout.

1072
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:14,588
Well, that's not exactly
a new thought either.

1073
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,560
-Well, don't stay out here too long.
-l won't.

1074
01:15:39,718 --> 01:15:42,687
Betsy, you've grown up.

1075
01:15:42,854 --> 01:15:44,822
Am l sensational?

1076
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,924
l'll say.

1077
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:51,358
Andy, even though l'm only a little girl,
even little girls can see ahead.

1078
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:55,830
l was afraid there might be trouble,
so l wrote Mother. She always understands.

1079
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:59,198
She's the one that sent me
this sensational dress.

1080
01:15:59,371 --> 01:16:02,772
She said that just once before
l left Carvel l could be grown-up.

1081
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:08,174
She even sent me a wrap.
That's for the long drive home in the dark...

1082
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:10,110
...even though l'm not Cynthia.

1083
01:16:10,282 --> 01:16:15,686
This will be a world's record! l'm gonna go
put on my tuxedo and my opera hat.

1084
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:18,948
Maybe l'll shave!

1085
01:16:36,742 --> 01:16:39,404
See that it's parked.
And mind the fenders.

1086
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:42,411
Yes, sir.

1087
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,830
Tonight's my big night, Andy.

1088
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:06,334
l hope l don't break my neck.
These heels are two inches high...

1089
01:17:06,505 --> 01:17:08,939
...and they're killing me.

1090
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:12,540
l'll tell you about that later, Alan.

1091
01:17:13,578 --> 01:17:16,979
This is not like the swell shindigs
in Washington.

1092
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:20,346
There are so many ambassadors,
any time you do a Big Apple...

1093
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:22,111
...you insult half of Europe.

1094
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:26,747
-l think it's grand.
-Well, it's pretty swell.

1095
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,728
Do we seem provincial, Dennis, after all
the wonderful parties you've played for?

1096
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:36,891
Of course not. l think the party's charming.
Hope they like our music.

1097
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,434
-Hello, Andy. How are you?
-Hello, Gene.

1098
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:42,436
-Hi, Andy. How are you?
-Fine.

1099
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:46,407
-Good evening, Andy. Glad to see you.
-Freddy.

1100
01:17:47,946 --> 01:17:50,380
Say, that girl, the one in blue.

1101
01:17:50,549 --> 01:17:51,948
l've seen her in New York.

1102
01:17:52,117 --> 01:17:55,609
lf you mean that infant trying to look
grown-up, l don't know...

1103
01:17:55,787 --> 01:17:59,416
-...but she certainly isn't in good company.
-l'm sure l know her.

1104
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:03,425
Of course. Martha Booth's daughter.
Excuse me a moment.

1105
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:06,294
Pardon me. Aren't you Betsy Booth?

1106
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:09,923
-Why, yes, l am.
-Wait a minute. lf he's trying to get fresh--

1107
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,332
l beg your pardon,
but l know Miss Booth.

1108
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:15,064
Your mom brought you
to my father's in New York.

1109
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,539
-Who's your father?
-Caldwell Hunt, the composer. l'm Dennis.

1110
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:20,041
Dennis Hunt's Harmonists?

1111
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:23,340
Certainly. You played for me
to sing your signature song.

1112
01:18:23,515 --> 01:18:25,779
-We had fun.
-What are you doing out here?

1113
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,350
Just visiting.

1114
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:30,579
Help me start the party with a bang.
Come sing.

1115
01:18:30,756 --> 01:18:34,055
-This is a dance.
-lt'll be better when Betsy warms it up.

1116
01:18:34,226 --> 01:18:37,491
-Come on, Betsy, and sing for us.
-All right. Excuse me, Andy.

1117
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:42,999
Betsy, a lot of my friends are here.
Do you think you've practiced enough?

1118
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:44,760
She'll be a sensation.

1119
01:18:44,936 --> 01:18:47,837
l've always wanted you
to hear me sing, Andy.

1120
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:50,440
-l'd love to.
-Swell.

1121
01:18:52,544 --> 01:18:53,806
Ladies and gentlemen.

1122
01:18:54,613 --> 01:18:56,808
l know it's not Christmas
till midnight...

1123
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,474
...but here's a present for
everybody that just has to be opened.

1124
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:05,919
Miss Betsy Booth, daughter of that famous
musical comedy star Martha Booth.

1125
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:08,116
Miss Booth, by special request...

1126
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:10,117
...my own special request...

1127
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:13,492
...will sing for us
''lt Never Rains But What lt Pours.''

1128
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:35,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
as a gesture of our appreciation...

1129
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:39,328
...l suggest Miss Booth
be invited to lead the grand march.

1130
01:23:46,404 --> 01:23:48,838
l'll lead with the gentleman
who brought me.

1131
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:50,338
Certainly. Who is he?

1132
01:23:50,508 --> 01:23:53,170
Mr. Andrew Hardy.

1133
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:56,513
May l have the honor, Mr. Hardy?

1134
01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:59,047
You're doggone tooting you can!

1135
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:01,947
Ladies and gentlemen,
your partners for the grand march.

1136
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,192
-l have a splitting headache.
-l'm terribly sorry.

1137
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,796
-l'll take you home.
-No, you have to stay.

1138
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,296
Carl will take me home.

1139
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:34,783
lt was grand.

1140
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:38,782
What's the matter, Andy?

1141
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:41,448
Wasn't l sensational enough?

1142
01:24:41,626 --> 01:24:47,155
You were the most terrific, marvelous,
sensational girl that ever lived.

1143
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:49,824
Well, what's the matter?

1144
01:24:51,469 --> 01:24:53,198
l don't know.

1145
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:56,167
l do.

1146
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:58,068
lt's Polly.

1147
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:02,712
We'll pick up your Christmas present
on the way home...

1148
01:25:02,881 --> 01:25:05,281
...so you can open it in the morning.

1149
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:07,247
Yes, Andy.

1150
01:25:28,273 --> 01:25:31,640
Here you are. Merry Christmas,
and thanks a million for tonight.

1151
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,540
l'll bring yours over first thing
in the morning.

1152
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:37,146
No. You've done too much
for me already.

1153
01:25:37,315 --> 01:25:39,340
Hello, Betsy.
Hello, Andy.

1154
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:41,508
-Hi.
-Hello.

1155
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,414
Well, children.

1156
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:49,617
l was just leaving my presents.

1157
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:52,456
l just brought Betsy in for her present.

1158
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,757
Anything happen yet, Dad?

1159
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:59,370
No, no. Still no word from Mother.

1160
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,364
Gee.

1161
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,600
Well, it's after 1 2:00.

1162
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:08,409
lt's Christmas.

1163
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:12,142
Merry Christmas to you, Marian...

1164
01:26:12,851 --> 01:26:15,547
-...Andy, Betsy.
-Merry Christmas, Dad.

1165
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,382
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1166
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,687
A heck of a Christmas this is!

1167
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,394
-A telegram.
-l'll get it!

1168
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,363
Mom!

1169
01:26:31,536 --> 01:26:33,766
Andy, baby!

1170
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:36,406
-Merry Christmas!
-Mother!

1171
01:26:36,574 --> 01:26:38,906
-Mom!
-Oh, darling.

1172
01:26:39,077 --> 01:26:40,806
Hello, honey.

1173
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:44,646
Why, Emily, how could you--?
What happened?

1174
01:26:44,816 --> 01:26:46,875
-Didn't you get my telegram?
-Telegram?

1175
01:26:47,051 --> 01:26:49,349
-Did you send one?
-Why, of course.

1176
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,250
Mother came through
her crisis with flying colors.

1177
01:26:52,423 --> 01:26:55,790
l left Milly in charge and came
home for Christmas by airplane.

1178
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,657
What? You, in an airplane
all the way from Brigham at night?

1179
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:01,492
Why, of course. l loved it.

1180
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:04,100
Okay, everybody's crazy.

1181
01:27:05,503 --> 01:27:07,869
What was it you said about a telegram?

1182
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:13,636
Oh, James. lsn't that just like me?
l forgot to send it from the airport.

1183
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:16,837
Oh, dear. My fingers are all thumbs.
Here it is.

1184
01:27:17,015 --> 01:27:20,212
l wouldn't be surprised if Grandma
isn't sitting up tomorrow.

1185
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:24,014
-Merry Christmas, my dear.
-Yes, sir! lt's a Merry Christmas.

1186
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:26,554
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Betsy!

1187
01:27:26,724 --> 01:27:32,390
Merry Christmas, Andy! Don't you worry
about Polly. Everything's gonna be just fine.

1188
01:27:32,563 --> 01:27:34,326
Yeah.

1189
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,759
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:55,948
Hello.

1191
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,248
-What do you want?
-l came to wish you a Merry Christmas.

1192
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:00,721
Merry Christmas.

1193
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:02,917
That's not a very nice way to say it.

1194
01:28:03,094 --> 01:28:07,053
Andy, l just found out that
Mr. Hunt is Polly's cousin.

1195
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:09,927
Cousin! Yeah?

1196
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:12,399
Oh, well, then l'm glad to know you, bud.

1197
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,435
Andy, will you drive me over--

1198
01:28:14,605 --> 01:28:17,904
-l didn't know you were busy.
-l'm Dennis Hunt, Polly's cousin.

1199
01:28:18,076 --> 01:28:21,671
-l'm Marian Hardy, Andrew's sister.
-Andy seems to be busy right now.

1200
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:24,337
-Let me give you a ride.
-lt's too much trouble.

1201
01:28:24,515 --> 01:28:27,177
On the contrary.
lt can be your present to me.

1202
01:28:27,352 --> 01:28:30,048
-Oh, Mr. Hunt.
-Come on. Shall we go?

1203
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,397
l said some nasty things yesterday.
l'm sorry.

1204
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,261
Nothing you ever said meant a thing.

1205
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:45,631
l mean....

1206
01:28:45,803 --> 01:28:49,136
Well, l guess l better
go and unpack my presents.

1207
01:28:49,307 --> 01:28:52,572
lt was sweet of you to come
talk to me this morning, Betsy.

1208
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,440
You mean Betsy squared everything?

1209
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,240
Gee, Betsy, you're the swellest girl....

1210
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:03,410
l didn't do anything.
You just had some troubles.

1211
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:07,581
l sure did. Anybody else had my troubles
wouldn't have figured a way out.

1212
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:12,822
Sure. You gotta be smart to get into
as much trouble as Andy does.

1213
01:29:12,997 --> 01:29:16,626
Betsy, l'll never be able to
thank you enough for last night...

1214
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:20,931
...the radiator gadget, you wanting
to pawn your coat, Polly--

1215
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:23,403
No, Andy.
l've gotta thank you.

1216
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:27,442
You know what l'm gonna do? Write an
Andy Hardy page in my memory book...

1217
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,206
...and read it every day for five years...

1218
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:33,578
...because on account of you
l was grown-up for one night.

1219
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:35,946
Just like Cinderella.

1220
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:38,252
With an evening dress...

1221
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:42,655
...and high heels
and leading a grand march.

1222
01:29:43,428 --> 01:29:49,560
You see, Andy, now l know how wonderful
life's gonna be when l'm 1 8.

1223
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:52,626
And you did it all.

1224
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:56,197
Well...

1225
01:29:56,374 --> 01:29:57,841
...so long.

1226
01:30:03,448 --> 01:30:07,578
-You're not mad at me anymore, Polly?
-Not if you'll tell me one thing.

1227
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:09,652
What's that?

1228
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:14,190
Did you like kissing Cynthia
better than kissing me?

1229
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:20,156
Well...

1230
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:25,200
...it's been so long since l kissed you
that l....

1231
01:30:32,643 --> 01:30:35,476
Well, what about Cynthia now?

1232
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:38,843
Cynthia was just one of the errors
of my childhood...

1233
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,246
...but you, Polly....

1234
01:31:14,919 --> 01:31:15,908
