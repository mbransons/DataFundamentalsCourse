1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,353
James Connors,
you are not Cab Calloway.

3
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,658
We are trying to play
"The National Emblem."

4
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,926
Not "My Heart Belongs to Daddy."

5
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,330
Yes, ma'am.

6
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,397
Well, I guess that's all we can do
for tonight.

7
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,131
I think you'd better go home.

8
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,832
Rehearsal's dismissed.

9
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,444
Turn your music in to Willie.

10
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,009
Willie. Here, Willie.

11
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,346
You know, Jimmy, I'm getting to hate
these rehearsals. The same thing...

12
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,082
...every time.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,420
Would you like to stick around
and play records?

14
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,428
I'd like to, but last time we did,
I didn't get home until 12.

15
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,997
My dad was pretty burned up.

16
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,293
We could knock out a couple
and get home early.

17
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:26,063
- That's what you said last time.
- We were just practicing.

18
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,366
But my folks think
I practice better at home.

19
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,065
Anyway, Annie's waiting for me.

20
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,108
- Oh, you're dead.
- Yeah. Good night.

21
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,303
Booper, like to try
a little classical swing?

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,314
Can't do it. My family's out of sympathy
with these night sessions you been having.

23
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,146
- See you tomorrow, Jimmy.
- So long, Boop.

24
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,075
Is that you, Jimmy?

25
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,341
Yes, Mom.

26
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,846
What time is it, dear?

27
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,449
Gosh, Mom, I don't know.

28
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,315
It must be close to 11.

29
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,388
Good night, son.

30
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,756
Good night, Mom.

31
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,963
- How was I doing?
- Swell.

32
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,531
Say, I'm glad you're here, Mary.
I wanna talk to you.

33
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,191
- Okay.
- Well...

34
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,769
You know, I don't go around
steaming people up.

35
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,168
Oh, no, of course not.

36
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,902
Remember once I told you that someday
we might have our own dance orchestra?

37
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,568
- Yes.
- Well, the dog is barking.

38
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,681
- What do you mean?
- I've been thinking it over in my mind.

39
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,875
A fellow doesn't wanna play
with a broken-down brass band anymore.

40
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,679
You know, the same:

41
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,052
He gets tired of that.

42
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,192
Instead of the school having a band
play a concert once a year...

43
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,090
...why, we could have our own
great modern dance orchestra.

44
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,752
We've got everything right here.

45
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,162
We've got the brass, the piano,
the reeds and you and...

46
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,427
- Me?
- Sure. You could handle all the vocals.

47
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,498
Oh, that sounds wonderful, Jimmy.

48
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,799
It is. We could make
our own arrangements...

49
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,306
...and specialties
and play for all the dances.

50
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,707
We could put Riverwood High School
on the map.

51
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,313
Now, all we gotta do
is to get the school behind us.

52
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,643
Do you think we could sell the idea
to Mr. Judd?

53
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,944
- Mr. Judd, the principal?
- Yeah.

54
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,849
I thought the last time you saw him...

55
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,251
Well, I don't think
he'd hold my past against me.

56
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,982
This is something big.

57
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,854
Will you go down to see him with me?

58
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,585
- Maybe tonight?
- Sure, I'll go.

59
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,958
- It's a date.
- All right.

60
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,240
- Be right there, Jimmy.
- All right, Mary.

61
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,409
I won't be gone long.

62
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,810
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs. Holden.

63
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,544
I told mother about the band.
She thinks it's wonderful.

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,688
- You do?
- Of course. I think it's splendid.

65
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,982
Doesn't your mother think so too?

66
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,558
Yes, ma'am. She thinks it's great.

67
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,222
Well, I guess we'd better be going.
Good night, Mother.

68
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,661
Good night, Mrs. Holden.

69
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,061
- Good luck with Mr. Judd.
- Thanks.

70
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,739
That was a fib,
what you said about your mother.

71
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,246
- Yeah.
- Why'd you say it?

72
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,044
- I don't know.
- You didn't even tell your mother.

73
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,449
- No.
- Why?

74
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,317
Well, I guess I'm afraid to.

75
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,391
Afraid to tell your mother?

76
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,619
Mary, it isn't as easy as you think.

77
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,595
It's not just telling her that we're gonna
have a band, lot of fun, lot of laughs.

78
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,199
You see, I've gotta tell her...

79
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,360
I've gotta tell her that this is it, music.
It's my future. It's the thing I want most.

80
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,006
- Maybe she'd understand.
- No, I don't think she would.

81
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,642
She wants me to be a doctor like Dad.

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,177
But, Mary, look at me.
Do I look like a doctor?

83
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,481
- No, I guess you don't.
- No, of course I don't.

84
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,678
But ever since I can remember,
she's always talked to me about it.

85
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,053
Well, I've agreed with her because it...
I saw that it made her happy.

86
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,750
But now I can't even do that.

87
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,293
Well, Jimmy, are you sure
you wanna be a drummer?

88
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,829
Mary, I was never more sure
of anything in my life.

89
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,695
You've got to be really sure.
Why don't you wait and see...

90
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,633
...what Mr. Judd says
about you organizing this school band?

91
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,172
If he says it's all right, and the first
school dance is a big success...

92
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,539
...and you know that that's what
you wanna do, go to her and tell her.

93
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,940
She'll understand.

94
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,913
Because she'd realize
that your ambition is strong and sincere.

95
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,712
Oh, mothers are like that, Jimmy.

96
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,789
Gee, I never thought of it
that way before.

97
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,757
But you're right, Mary, and I'll do it.

98
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,861
Oh, you know, you're so wonderful.

99
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,157
It's a great comfort to have somebody
you can tell your troubles to.

100
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,800
You're always wonderful
about putting me on the track.

101
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,906
You know, you're gonna make
some man a fine wife.

103
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,974
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,941
And, well, I'm gonna envy the guy
that gets you too.

105
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,583
And, Mary, I'll never forget
what a great pal you've been to me.

107
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,979
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

108
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,643
Straight from the shoulder, a real pal.

109
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,551
- Reminds me of a song.
- What song?

110
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,057
"Oh! What A Pal Was Mary."

111
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,258
Yeah!

112
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,154
Yeah.

113
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,131
Jimmy, the band
has been a big disappointment.

114
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,967
- Are the boys losing interest?
- No, sir, not in the music.

115
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,336
There are awfully fine musicians
in that outfit.

116
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,104
They're just not interested
in the stuff they're playing.

117
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,272
When you start playing anything,
you've gotta be hopping inside.

118
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,714
Oh, it's wonderful for parades
and Memorial Day...

119
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,151
...but people don't wanna sit around
and listen to that stuff anymore.

120
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,453
Jimmy, I've been giving it a lot
of thought lately, and I'm glad you told me.

121
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,118
The band has cost the school
a lot of money.

122
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,788
Maybe we better disorganize it
and call the whole thing off.

123
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,367
We're already enough in debt.

124
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,561
Mr. Judd, you just give me 60 seconds
of your time...

125
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,969
...and I'll brush that burden
off your shoulders.

126
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,109
Go ahead, Jimmy. It would be a pleasure.

127
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,337
Well, I've been talking to the fellows
and we'd like to organize...

128
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,378
...our own dance band.
- Dance orchestra?

129
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,417
Certainly. Instead of a brass band,
we'd like to have a modern dance orchestra.

130
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:25,114
Let us go ahead and form this band and give
a high school dance instead of the concert.

131
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,556
And I'll guarantee you that within one night,
we'll wipe out that debt.

132
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,697
I know it. I've been thinking it over
for a long time.

133
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,061
If we don't bring in as many people
at the dance as at the concerts...

134
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,998
...in the past 10 years,
we'll forget about the whole thing.

135
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,334
Just a minute. You're going to organize
a dance orchestra, ready to play...

136
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,908
Not only are we gonna have
a great dance orchestra...

137
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,238
...but we're also gonna have
a great singer too.

138
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,847
Oh, I see.

139
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,551
- You're going to arrange the whole thing?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,315
Publicity, selling tickets...

141
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,721
...paying off the debt of the band.

142
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,953
The whole thing, all in three weeks?

143
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,156
- In a breeze.
- In a breeze?

144
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,970
You've taken on a pretty large order,
Jimmy. I don't believe you can do it.

145
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,402
Oh, he can do it.
I know he can do it, Mr. Judd.

146
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,942
I'm sure I can do it, if you'll only
give me the chance, Mr. Judd.

147
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,378
All right. I'll buy the first ticket.

148
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,144
Oh, thanks, Mr. Judd.

149
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,780
Mary, the principal shook hands with me.

150
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,360
We certainly slipped it to him all right.

151
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,520
- We certainly did.
- There's a great old guy.

152
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,098
- He's a great old guy.
- Vision. That's what he's got.

153
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,258
There's a man that can see
over the transom.

154
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,461
- Yes sir, he's gonna go places.
- He sure is.

155
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,003
- You know what that was?
- What?

156
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,199
A springboard. He just launched
the biggest ship that ever sailed.

157
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,368
- You're absolutely right. Okay.
- Let's take a short cut.

158
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,006
You know, I misjudged that man.

159
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,585
- Heart, that's what he's got. A lot of heart.
- Here, I'll help you.

160
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,780
- Something's been troubling me lately.
- What?

161
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,893
Do you think "our Love Affair"
has enough punch in it?

162
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,854
"Our Love Affair."

163
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,124
Oh, well,
now that you mentioned it, Jimmy...

164
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,165
Because I've got
a new arrangement on it.

165
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,929
Oh, it's a dynamite love song
just made-to-order for you.

166
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,732
I'll play it.

167
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,701
Wait until you get a load of this intro.

168
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,107
I've got some chords
that are really out of this world.

169
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,903
Listen.

170
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,016
It starts off a little flairy.

171
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,085
Are you listening to me?

172
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,481
Then it softens down here.
It's violins, you know?

173
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,559
Then the orchestra sneaks back in
for the vocal.

174
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:49,034
<i>Our love affair will be such fun</i>

175
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:54,764
<i>We'll be the envy of everyone</i>

176
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:00,602
<i>Those famous lovers
We'll make them forget</i>

177
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:06,608
<i>From Adam and Eve
To Scarlett and Rhett</i>

178
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,980
Flutes and oboes.

179
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:14,684
<i>When youth has had its merry fling</i>

180
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,265
<i>We'll spend our evenings remembering</i>

181
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:27,065
<i>Two happy people
Who say on the square</i>

182
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,331
With fiddles.

183
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:36,539
<i>Isn't ours a lovely love affair?</i>

184
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,547
Come on, sit down. Try it.

185
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,883
Are you sure you want me to sing
with the band? You're not just...

186
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,422
of course not, we need you.

187
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,958
You're as important to me
as the brass section.

188
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,892
- That's pretty important.
- Try the verse.

189
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:58,469
<i>Here we are
Two very bewildered people</i>

190
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:05,741
<i>Here we are
Two babes that are lost in the wood</i>

191
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:12,316
<i>We're not quite certain
What has happened to us</i>

192
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,888
<i>This lovely thing that's so marvelous</i>

193
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,025
<i>But right from here</i>

194
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:26,495
<i>The future looks awfully good</i>

195
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:34,168
<i>Our love affair
Was meant to be</i>

196
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,867
<i>It's me for you, dear</i>

197
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,444
<i>And you for me</i>

198
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,947
<i>We'll fuss, we'll quarrel</i>

199
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,245
<i>And tears start to brew</i>

200
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,583
<i>But after the tears</i>

201
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:56,490
<i>Our love will smile through</i>

202
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,689
<i>I'm sure that I</i>

203
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,267
<i>Could never hide</i>

204
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,996
<i>The thrill I get</i>

205
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,472
<i>When you're by my side</i>

206
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,045
<i>And when we're older</i>

207
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,116
<i>We'll proudly declare</i>

208
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:28,921
<i>Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?</i>

209
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:36,462
<i>I'll learn to bake a chocolate cake</i>

210
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:43,131
<i>The kind of cake mother used to make</i>

211
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,767
You hungry? Come on, let's go see
if we can find some of that cake.

212
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,538
Swell.

213
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,047
I hope there's some left,
if Daddy hasn't eaten it all up.

214
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,956
You know, Mary,
I'd never be satisfied with a small band.

215
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,561
I want a great big one. A symphony.

216
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,754
Why, I wanna make American music...

217
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,195
...just as important
as any other country's music.

218
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,726
Look at George Gershwin.

219
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,167
Why, his music is as good
as Beethoven or Bach, better maybe.

220
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,307
Best of all, it's American.

221
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,140
You like grapes and strawberries?

222
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,774
Can you imagine me conducting
a concert in Carnegie Hall?

223
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,779
Oh, boy, what a thrill.

224
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,349
On my left, I have 50 fiddles.

225
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,280
Fifty? That's a lot of strings.

226
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,387
And on my right,
I'd have the violas and the cellos.

227
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,794
Oh, wonderful.

228
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,235
And right in front of me,
I'd have the saxes and the clarinets.

229
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,266
You know, the woodwind
is the real body to an orchestra.

230
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,706
Right in back of them,
I'd have the brass section.

231
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,577
Over in the back,
I'd have the bass fiddles. Ten of them.

232
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,210
- Ten?
- Sure, you gotta have a good beat.

233
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,821
Then I'd have the drums
and the tymps. Over here.

234
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,918
Oh, you've gotta have
those drums in there, Mary.

235
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,724
And over in the back,
I'd have a piano on a platform.

236
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,231
- Piano.
- Make it two pianos.

237
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,836
- Two pianos.
- Oh, I just love pianos.

238
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,437
- And a harp?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,972
Then the lights would dim down,
and I'd come out.

240
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,973
Here, this is me.

241
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,771
I'd tap on my stand for order.

242
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,742
I'd get ready
to give them the downbeat.

243
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,644
I'd give the tymps a downbeat like this:

244
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,811
- There you are, Mary.
- That's wonderful.

245
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,212
Oh, that's the way
it's gonna be: Success.

246
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,045
- Only...
- only what?

247
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,848
There's just one thing that it lacks
to make it perfect.

248
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,652
- Yeah, just one thing.
- What's that, Jimmy?

249
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,955
Oh, you'd think I was silly
if I was to mention it.

250
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,598
Oh, no I wouldn't.
Really, I wouldn't. What is it?

251
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,064
- Well...
- oh, Mary?

252
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,834
Yes, Daddy.

253
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,405
Where is my tobacco pouch?

254
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,099
It's on the desk, Daddy.

255
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,915
Well, it's a little late, isn't it?

256
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,020
It's just about that time.
I was just going.

257
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,420
Good night, Mr. Holden. Good night.

258
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,351
- Jimmy.
- Yeah?

259
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,824
- What is it?
- What?

260
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,327
You know,
what you're gonna say in there.

261
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,661
The only thing you needed
to make it all perfect.

262
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,197
Oh, a xylophone.

263
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,735
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

264
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:23,652
<i>Isn't this a lovely love affair?</i>

265
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,547
Wait a minute.
Hold it! Hold it, everybody!

266
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,852
Come on, fellas,
now let's get together!

267
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,028
Dick, you and Leonard
have been introduced.

268
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,393
You don't have to start taking a solo.
We gotta play a dance tonight.

269
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,965
People are paying money!

270
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,601
Okay, Jimmy, we'll get it.

271
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,168
All right, then, let's get it.

272
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,966
Everybody, right from the bridge,
let's take it again. Here we go. One, two.

273
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,340
How you doing, honey?

274
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,811
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm discouraged.

275
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,212
You know, it does something
to a girl's spirit...

276
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,513
...to keep on fighting a losing battle
to a snare drum.

277
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,953
Well, just keep holding out, Mary.
You'll win.

278
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,494
Gee, Mary, if I were Jimmy Connors,
I'd tell the whole world you were my girl.

279
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,097
Well, that's why
all the girls love you, Willie.

280
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,756
But who wants all the girls?

281
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,139
That's great. You play it like that tonight
and we can't miss.

282
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,903
That's all, everybody.
Leave your music on the stands.

283
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,876
Don't forget, 8:00 sharp,
and everybody with a clean shirt.

284
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:04,353
Hey, Jimmy, I can't make it at 8:00.
I have to pick up Annie.

285
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,289
You have to pick up Annie?

286
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,256
Well, gee, Jimmy, I promised her
and it's a big night.

287
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,454
Are you gonna play a saxophone
or keep your mind on the gals?

288
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,192
- You know I'm... It's only that Annie...
- Somebody's gonna have to pick her up.

289
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,700
I can't take any chances on that.
I may lose her.

290
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,394
We're playing for big stakes now.

291
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,268
If we wanna get anywhere,
everybody's gotta hang in there.

292
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,809
Well, they tell me
that we've just sold our 257th ticket.

293
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,037
Oh, it's wonderful. You see, Phil?

294
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,145
Now, if we only had a good orchestra.

295
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,347
That's what I meant, Phil.
A female mind.

296
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,218
- Why...
- Annie, come here a minute...

297
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,259
...and sit down here.
I wanna tell you something.

298
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:48,332
Now, Annie, I've got something
kind of hard to tell you.

299
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,092
But I'm not worrying about it...

300
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,930
...because I know
you're big enough to understand.

301
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,629
Here comes the business.

302
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:59,539
Now, now, Annie, I'm not gonna be able
to bring you to the dance tonight.

303
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,770
- Oh, heck.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

304
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,415
Because I'm getting a friend of mine.

305
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,814
He's not very good-looking
but he's loyal.

306
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,578
- Can he rumba?
- Rumba?

307
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,451
Rumba, why, he made it up.

308
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,086
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

309
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,660
I gotta get here early and set up,
so I won't be able to stop by for you.

310
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,354
How about it, Willie?
Will you bring Mary for me?

311
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,695
- Well, yeah, sure.
- You don't mind coming with Willie, do you?

312
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,860
- No, of course not.
- Swell, see you tonight.

313
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,265
Yeah, so long.

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,636
I always have a wonderful time
when I'm with Willie.

315
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,643
- Don't I?
- Yeah.

316
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,973
And I always wind up
with a pat on the head.

317
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,104
Hey, Phil. It's a swell gait, isn't it?

318
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,646
Gee, Mary, I feel dandy.

319
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,416
Couldn't we go someplace
where we could, well, sort of be alone?

320
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,059
Oh, now, Willie, you be a good boy.

321
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,218
Remember what I told you.

322
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,921
You know, Mary,
I was studying up on Napoleon.

323
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,623
Did you know he was a very short man?

324
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,133
Oh, Willie.

325
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,503
Hey, Booper, who are you waving at?

326
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,440
Annie, you ought to strike oil any minute.

327
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,420
Thank you very kindly,
ladies and gentlemen.

328
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,830
And now, we'd like to do our special
number for you. It's called the "La Conga."

329
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,564
Oh, yeah, and the vocal
will be done by Miss Mary Holden.

330
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,018
<i>In Havana</i>

331
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:31,322
<i>Every Cubana
Shakes her bandana to</i>

332
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,523
<i>The La Conga</i>

333
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,295
<i>It's a new dance
Something new to dance</i>

334
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,770
<i>Wait until you dance to</i>

335
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,241
<i>The La Conga</i>

336
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,210
<i>Wait till you hear the beat</i>

337
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,682
<i>Of the bonga</i>

338
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,946
<i>Just get that beat</i>

339
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:02,355
<i>And you'll get the conga</i>

340
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,190
<i>It delights you
And it excites you</i>

341
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,094
<i>And it invites you to</i>

342
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:15,570
<i>Do the La Conga</i>

343
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,269
<i>In Buenos Aires
In London and Paris</i>

344
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,938
<i>They tango</i>

345
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,346

346

<i>Their favorite has long been a waltz</i>

347

<i>In Guayaquil
In Madrid and Seville</i>

348
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>They fandango</i>

349
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:45,127
<i>But in Havana
All the natives go</i>

350
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,134
<i>One, two, three, boom</i>

351
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,034
<i>One, two, three, boom</i>

352
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,004
<i>One, two, three, boom</i>

353
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,905
<i>One, two, three, boom</i>

354

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,474

357
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,347
<i>- The La Conga

359
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,124

00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,285
<i>Wait until you dance to</i>

361
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,630
<i>- The La Conga
- One, two, three, boom</i>

362
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,766
<i>One, two and three, boom</i>

363
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,062
<i>- Wait till you hear the beat
- The La Conga</i>

364
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,435
<i>- Of the bonga
- Conga</i>

365
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:30,104
<i>Just get the beat
And you'll get the Conga</i>

366
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,278
<i>Conga</i>

367
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,943
<i>It delights you
And it excites you</i>

368
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:42,389
<i>- As it invites you
- To do the La Conga</i>

369
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,289
<i>Conga</i>

370
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:48,091
<i>Conga</i>

371
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,893
<i>Now you know</i>

372
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:56,564
<i>The La Conga</i>

373
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,889
- one.
- Two.

374
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,894
- Three.
- Boom.

375
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,453
Yahoo! Come on!

376
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,153
<i>Come on, do La Conga,
Come on, do La Conga</i>

377
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,797
<i>And now you know
The La Conga</i>

378
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,201
<i>Conga</i>

379
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,105
<i>Boom</i>

380
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,579
- Say, wasn't that a swell dance last night?
- It certainly was.

381
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,614
You should have heard
what Mr. Judd said.

382
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,151
He said, "We are very proud of the
Riverwood High School's achievements."

383
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,449
- Oh, he's a swell guy.
- Well, did you ever think he wasn't?

384
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,391
Well, I always kind of thought
he was a little on the old fashioned side.

385
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,527
Jimmy, careful.

386
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,724
You've been nearly dropping that thing
since you were 6 years old.

387
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,632
Listen, Mom,
I've come much closer to it than that.

388
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,509
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?

389
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,170
When do mothers stop thinking about
their sons as being a little boy?

390
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,840
I guess never, Jimmy.
That's the fun of being a mother.

391
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,078
Mom, someday
whenever you want anything...

392
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,381
...all you're gonna have to do is just ask.

393
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,821
No worries, no landlords, no store.
I'm never gonna stop...

394
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,429
...until you have 10 days of happiness
for every one of those tough ones.

395
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,088
You know, Jimmy,
parents live through their children.

396
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,790
When you're happy, I'm happy.

397
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,334
When you're successful,
then I'll be a success.

398
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,665
Well, I guess then
I just gotta be a great man.

399
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,363
I always thought you would be.

400
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:29,070
But remember, a great man
is only the reflection of a great boy.

401
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,238
In a larger mirror.

402
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,319
Mom.

403
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,887
You're worried about me, aren't you?

404
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,754
Look, you don't have to worry about me.

405
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:47,193
Because a lot of times a guy
does things that people can't understand.

406
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,766
Things crawl around inside of him
that nobody in the world can understand.

407
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,527
What is it, Jimmy?

408
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:06,612
Mom, you and dad,
you wanted me to be a doctor.

409
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,953
And after we lost him,
you wanted it even more so.

410
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,591
I know what you've done,
what you've had to give up...

411
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,159
...to try and help me to be one like Dad.

412
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,920
That's why it makes it
so tough for me to tell you...

413
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,460
...that I can't.

414
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:30,903
I'm so sorry I could almost bawl inside.
But it's just not there.

415
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,369
Why, Dad loved medicine.
He loved every little part about it.

416
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,877
That's why he was such a fine doctor.

417
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:42,042
And the way he loved medicine,
that's the way I love music.

418
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,081
When I'm sitting there at the drums,
I feel as though I'm in the right place.

419
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,225
I feel as though I belong there.

420
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,753
That's what I wanna do.

421
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,760
You want to be a drummer
in an orchestra?

422
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,869
Well, that's part of music, Mom.
It's rhythm and...

423
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,941
It's been beating around in my mind
ever since I can remember.

424
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,907
I'm sure you'd understand
if you'd thought about it as much...

425
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,673
If you only knew, Jimmy,
how much we've thought about it.

426
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,248
Why, since before you were born
it started.

427
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,876
Your father and I prayed you'd be a boy
just for that reason.

428
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,080
And when you came...

429
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,488
...I don't believe
I've ever seen a prouder man.

430
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:28,564
And to the very end
he'd clung to that ideal for you to heal.

431
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,227
And that's such a wonderful thing, Jimmy,
in a world that's sick and suffering.

432
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,668
I know, Mom.

433
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,141
I've thought a lot about that too.
But it's the same way in music.

434
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,179
When the music's happy,
it makes the people happy.

435
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,840
And when it's sad, they take things
out of their lives that made them sad...

436
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,418
...and lose them in music.

437
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,181
And then they feel better afterwards.

438
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,224
In a way, Mom...

439
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,628
...isn't that sort of like healing, too?

440
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,466
Isn't it?

441
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,092
All right, Mom.

442
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,098
I'll be a doctor.

443
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,100
And I'll be a good doctor.

444
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,616
Jimmy?

445
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,387
- Yes, Mom?
- I was wrong...

446
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:02,083
...when I said that a mother never stops
thinking of her son as a little boy.

447
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,088
Why, there's always that time
when a mother sees her son before her...

448
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:10,598
...with a mind of his own,
a will of his own...

449
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,759
...and a heart of his own.

450
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,071
And it's then that she realizes...

451
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:21,041
...whether she's made a success or a failure
of her son as a boy.

452
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,682
Just now I saw it.

453
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,308
And I knew that I was proud of my boy.

454
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,989
You could be a doctor, Jimmy.
A good doctor.

455
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,720
I know that now.

456
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,263
But if deep down inside of you...

457
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,300
...your ambition to make people happy
with your music...

458
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,200
...is as sincere and honest
as I think it is...

459
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,568
...why, that's all that matters.

460
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,710
I'm satisfied.

461
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,409
You're the most
wonderful mom that ever lived.

462
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:04,487
But remember, son,
the top of the ladder is very appealing...

463
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:09,422
...and for my sake
be careful how you climb that ladder.

464
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,824
Because that's very important, too.

465
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,191
I will, Mom. I will.

466
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:18,665
And when I get there, nothing they could
cook up would be too good for you.

467
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,799
- You know what, Mom?
- What, Jimmy?

468
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,968
I'm gonna make you a queen.

469
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,051
Wait a minute, you're eating too fast.
You're gonna get sick.

470
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:38,211
- Yes, you are, you darling.
- Hey, Mary!

471
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,919
Mary. Hey, Mary.

472
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,331
Give me a mountain,
I wanna crush it into a molehill.

473
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,196
- Who's been feeding you vitamins?
- I was worried about Mom.

474
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,770
We had a long talk
and everything's fixed, like that.

475
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,133
That's wonderful, Jimmy.

476
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,901
I got the greatest news
since the invention of the wheel.

477
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,169
- You have?
- I'm gonna give it to you straight.

478
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:05,247
I found this in the newspaper. It's been
burning a hole in my pocket. Listen.

479
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,884
"Paul Whiteman, number one band leader,
now on tour...

480
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,317
...through the cities of the country,
decided, due to great interest...

481
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,650
...among the youth of America
in modern music...

482
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:17,225
...to give auditions to high school
dance orchestras in various cities."

483
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,623
This is the important part.

484
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,357
"Mr. Whiteman's final selection will be
guest-starred on his radio program...

485
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,898
...on June 29th from Chicago."

486
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,468
- That is something.
- Just think what it mould mean...

487
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,161
...if our band made that program.

488
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,467
It'd put Riverwood High School
on the front page of every newspaper.

489
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,631
You bet it would.

490
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,405
Suppose we got to Chicago on the 28th
and we gave Mr. Whiteman the audition.

491
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,481
We could stay until the next day
and play on the radio program.

492
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,346
It would cost a fortune
to get that whole band to Chicago.

493
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,748
No, I've figured it out.

494
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,118
To get the band there and back by bus
and two days in Chicago...

495
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,553
...it'll cost about $200.

496
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,023
That's if nobody eats heavy.

497
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,924
Oh, Jimmy, that's an awful lot of money
even if we have it.

498
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:57,124
- Yeah, it is quite a bundle.
- But it's not impossible.

499
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,064
When's bank night?

500
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,533
You're pressing.

501
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:08,304
Say, suppose we went over
and we had a little talk with...

502
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,243
- Mr. Judd.
- The school board will do anything he says.

503
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,747
- He was crazy about our band.
- We out to get him...

504
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,887
...while he's in a good humor.
- What are we waiting for?

505
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:21,650
I'm sorry. And I'm still sorrier
to have to disappoint you.

506
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,420
But I couldn't give my consent.

507
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,895
It would be impossible for the school
to finance a venture of this kind.

508
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,261
But, if you'd only tell them
what it would mean.

509
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,302
The publicity for Riverwood High School
and how big it was.

510
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,431
That's one of the troubles.
I'm afraid they think it's too big already.

511
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,076
I might as well tell you, Jimmy.

512
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,179
There have been complaints
from parents of the boys in the band.

513
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,645
Interfering with studies, late hours.

514
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:49,582
No, I'll have to veto this, Jimmy.
Definitely.

515
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,788
Well, I'm sorry
to have bothered you, Mr. Judd.

516
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,891
That perfectly all right, Jimmy.

517
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,584
You come to see me any time you want.

518
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,824
- Goodbye, Mr. Judd.
- Goodbye, Mary.

519
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,456
- Jimmy.
- Goodbye. Thanks.

520
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,535
Well, he was nice about it, anyway.

521
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,003
Yeah, but a kind heart
will never get us to Chicago.

522
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,902
Well, Phil, there's more than one way
of spinning a top.

523
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,444
- Yeah.
- Maybe the school board is content...

524
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,414
...with having Riverwood remain a little
red dot on an auto map, but not me.

525
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,949
We packed them in last night.

526
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,713
We gave them a good time
after we got them in, didn't we?

527
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
- Yeah.
- All right.

528
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,757
I've been thinking ever since we left
Mr. Judd's house how we can raise $200.

529
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,452
- Yeah.
- We've got a terrific band.

530
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,325
It's hot merchandise.

531
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,695
Oh, we'll get to Chicago if we have to
crawl on our hands and knees...

532
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,836
...and blow out every lamp on the way.

533
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,097
I think Annie's good and sore.

534
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,037
Yeah, she's really burned up, all right.

535
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,610
Annie. Annie. Annie!
Is that all I get out of you is Annie?

536
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,679
- Aren't you interested in the band?
- Sure.

537
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,409
Don't you realize we only got six weeks
to raise the money to get to Chicago?

538
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,282
This is terrific, there's bands from
all over the country. This isn't baby talk.

539
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,425
- I'm with you, all the way. You know that.
- All right, all right.

540
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,891
So we've got to raise $200.
How we gonna do it?

541
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,992
How about some punchboards?

542
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,863
Punchboards, sure, sure.

543
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,301
- And we'll give Annie away as a prize.
- Yeah.

544
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,465
- Lf you're gonna be a wise guy.
- Oh, I was only kidding, Phil.

545
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,270
I mean, we got to keep in there punching.

546
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,380
Wait a minute. Why couldn't we
make a deal with the Elks Club...

547
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,573
...to give a dance
at their Milk Fund Bazaar?

548
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,312
<i>- Well, it's only a month away.
- Oh, they don't give dances at any...</i>

549
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,494
Say, that's not a bad idea.

550
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,186
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.

551
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,265
We could make up our own specialties,
sketches, dance routines.

552
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,924
Great, I like it already.

553
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,229
Say, what's the number one Elk?

554
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:51,500
- Who is he? The whatchamacallit?
- Mr. Mollison, and he owes my dad money.

555
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,905
- That's our man.
- I'll get after it right away.

556
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,138
Mr. Mollison? Gotta make a list
down here, we gotta get costumes.

557
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,680
Cot Mollison. Mollison.

558
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,977
- You know what, Jimmy?
- What?

559
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,643
I think I ought to call Annie.

560
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,591
You're still making valentines again.

561
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,353
When Annie's sore at me,
it throws me all off key.

562
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,191
I just can't stand talking to a guy
with a one-track mind.

563
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,165
Well, wait'll you're in love with somebody.
You'll know what I'm going through.

564
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:22,203
Women to me are just people.

565
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:34,147
- Oh, Miss Hodges, I'm sorry to disturb you.
- It's perfectly all right, Mr. Judd.

566
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,219
I'd like you to meet a new student,
Barbara Frances Morgan.

567
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,824
- How do you do, Barbara Frances?
- I'm delighted to know you, Miss Hodges.

568
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,458
My, what a nice, bright classroom.

569
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,788
Mr. Morgan wants Barbara Frances
to finish out the term here.

570
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,866
- I've selected this as her homeroom.
- We're happy to have her.

571
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:55,165
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
getting into the swing of things.

572
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,966
I'm sure I won't.

573
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,132
- Thank you, Miss Hodges.
- Don't mention it.

574
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,245
Now, let me see.
Where shall we put you?

575
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,450
Oh, yes. Suppose you sit
in that empty chair over there.

576
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,053
Thank you.

577
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,315
And if you're happy there,
you may keep it permanently.

578
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,891
I'm sure I will be.

579
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,903
- She's touched it up.
- Yeah.

580
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,883
Oh, James, I wonder if you'd take
Barbara Frances to the supply room...

581
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:45,545
...and help her with her text books.
- Would it inconvenience you terribly?

582
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,284
No, not at all.

583
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,331
Have you traveled very much?

584
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,127
- Me, travel?
- Yes, travel.

585
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,065
Well, a little.

586
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,001
That is, my uncle took me to Chicago
three years ago to see the World Series.

587
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,666
Oh, no. I mean the continent.

588
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:13,310
- Which one?
- Oh, you must see the Riviera.

589
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:19,153
- Must I?
- Cannes, Nice, San Raphael, Juan-les-Pins.

590
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:24,351
- Juan-les-pins is simply wild.
- It is, huh?

591
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:29,097
I met the most wonderful man there.
Almost too beautiful.

592
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,599
But he turned out to be a duke,
and you know what they are.

593
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,763
Yeah, yeah,
you've got to watch those dukes.

594
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,506
Oh, there goes the bell.
We're gonna be late for our classes.

595
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:45,911
Oh, dear. And we were just getting
to know each other.

596
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,752
You're cute.

597
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,757
Are you going right home now, Mary?

598
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,493
No, honey,
I have to work at the library today.

599
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,432
I had a talk with my dad
this noontime.

600
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,402
He thinks he can fix an appointment
with Mr. Mollison for us.

601
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,474
He can? Oh, that's swell.
Good work, Phil.

602
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:17,376
- Well, I've got to meet Annie. So long.
- Annie, so long.

603
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:22,282
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy. Looking for me?

604
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,714
Well, no, not exactly.

605
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,880
- Come on, jump in. I'll drive you home.
- Thanks anyway, Barbara.

606
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,618
- I don't think l...
- oh, come on, jump in.

607
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,762
Stuck.

608
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,759
Hey, Jimmy,
how's the weather down there?

609
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,867
Get a load of that.

610
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,937
Say, that Barbara Frances
doesn't waste any time, does she?

611
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,700
How about Jimmy? He's doing all right.

612
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,235
Just give me the word, Mary,
and I'll slug him.

613
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:58,349
Oh, the county fair, wonderful.

614
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:04,759
- The fair, are you going?
- Oh, yeah, sure. I never miss the fair.

615
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,453
- I wish I could go.
- Well, why can't you?

616
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:13,092
Well, I don't know many young people,
and a girl can't very well go there alone.

617
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,567
I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you. Somebody will ask you.

618
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,834
Oh, Jimmy, isn't that sweet of you?

619
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,676
Oh, no, no, well, I can't...

620
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:27,010
You're really a dear.
You have the cutest way of saying things.

621
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,292
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmy.

622
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,735
- What you doing?
- Just putting these books away.

623
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,398
Gosh, there's an awful lot of them,
aren't there?

624
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,670
- Yeah.
- You read them all?

625
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,947
Only up to here.

626
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,877
<i>Mary, about that fair...</i>

627
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,384
What about it?

628
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,216
Well, I thought that you and I...

629
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,383
...we had an understanding
that we were going together to the fair.

630
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:14,896
<i>Well, I got myself all tied up and...</i>

631
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,602
oh, there was really no definite
understanding that we were going together.

632
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,701
Besides, I'm pretty busy.

633
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,336
And fairs, they're just a bunch of livestock
and a merry-go-round.

634
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:34,575
I've seen all that.
Besides, they're really for children.

635
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,912
Oh, you wouldn't like
anything like that, huh?

636
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,055
Oh, I'd like it all right.

637
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:43,592
But there are a lot more important things
in life than going to the fairs with people.

638
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,092
Sure, sure, sure, there are.

639
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,763
I'd better get going. I just thought
I'd drop in and explain it to you.

640
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:54,165
- I knew that you'd understand.
- Oh, sure, I understand.

641
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,636
You can always count on me, Jimmy.

642
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,900
Just the same
as you could your own cousin.

643
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,670
Yeah, and I appreciate it, too.

644
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:09,646
Well, well, so long.

645
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,624
So long, pal.

646
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:27,263
<i>Mary, where can I find
a copy of Romeo and Juliet?</i>

647
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:30,338
Back there with the rest
of the Shakespeare, on the last shelf.

648
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,769
Thanks.

649
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,370
<i>Where's Antony and Cleopatra?</i>

650
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,809
<i>Right back there,
leaning on Romeo and Juliet.</i>

651
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:42,611
<i>Mary, have you ever heard of a book
called Indian Love Lyrics?</i>

652
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,152
- Yes.
- Well, I want to read it.

653
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,883
Well, it's all yours.
It's over there in the poetry section.

654
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,257
I beg your pardon, miss.
I wonder if you could help me find a book.

655
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,528
<i>- What is it?
- The Decline And Fall of The Roman Empire.</i>

656
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,669
Thanks, brother.
It's right over there in the History section.

657
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,238
Thank you.

All right, buy your tickets for the midway.
We have 52 attractions on the inside.

707
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,549
- There you are. Two. Thank you very much.
- Please, two.

708
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,194
Two more, sir. There you are.

709
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,297
- We have Jo-Jo, the Dog-Faced Boy.
- Two, please.

710
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:31,298
- Two? Yes, sir. There you are, sir.
- Change out of $5, please.

711
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,665
Five dollars? That's the biggest bill
I've seen here this afternoon.

712
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,033
- There's one, two, three, four.
- Thank you.

713
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,040
Changing the 5.
As I said before, we have a...

714
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,906
He was coming down the street
in a hurry when I told him...

715
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,980
...we had to see Mr. Mollison
and he just turns to me and says:

716
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,016
"You'll have to take over.
I've got business this afternoon."

717
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:52,348
Lmportant business,
the guy's gone stark, raving mad.

718
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,116
Nothing's gonna keep us
from getting the band to Chicago.

719
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,522
- We'll see Mr. Mollison.
- That won't do any good.

720
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,492
Jimmy's the one who can tell him
the show we're gonna put on.

721
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,825
If we could only get him away
from that fair.

722
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,968
- I'll get him away.
- You'll get him away. When everything...

723
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,626
I can get him to leave the fair.

724
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,432
- You can get him to leave the fair?
- How, Willie, how?

725
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:14,008
He'd have to, if he ran out of money,
wouldn't he?

726
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,747
All right, folks. Come on, now.
Who's next?

727
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,747
- You got to do better than that.
- Missed me again.

728
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,817
That curve's not working at all.

729
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,420
Oh, yeah? Give me six more,
and keep track of them.

730
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,180
Thattaboy, Jimmy. You can hit him.

731
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,915
- Hold my coat, Willie.
- Sure.

732
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,584
All right, folks! All right, come on, son.
Do better than you did last time.

733
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,856
Oh, no, you missed it again. Try it again.

734
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,728
Oh, no. You've got to come
much closer than that.

735
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,733
You're too far away.

736
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,101
- Would you like hold this for a second?
- Oh, sure.

737
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,813
Son, I got a mosquito in my back yard
hits harder than that.

738
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,547
How much do I owe you?

739
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:57,016
- A dollar and a quarter.
- Soon as I get my wallet.

740
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,723
- Where's my wallet?
- Are you kidding?

741
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,554
Now, I'm gonna get that wallet routine.

742
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,722
Honest, mister,
I had it right here in my pocket.

743
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,696
- Willie! Where's Willie?
- He was here a minute ago.

744
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,234
- Hey, Willie!
- We know how to handle guys like you!

745
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,338
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, mister.

746
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,770
I got the money!

747
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,503
Jimmy Connors?

748
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,879
Jimmy! Jimmy, where are you?

749
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,943
Here. Here! Here I am!
Get me out of here!

750
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,385
- Come on in, start pitching.
- Give him room, boss.

751
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,716
Look out. Hey, don't do that!

752
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,415
Oh, look out!

753
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,993
Hey, Jimmy. The Elks Club
is gonna give us a tryout.

754
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,527
They are? When?

755
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,425
Tomorrow, right after school!

756
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,227
Oh, boy. That's wonderful.

757
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,764
- Hello.
- Hello.

758
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,026
Can I see you for a minute?

759
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,067
All right.

760
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,302
Are you very mad?

761
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,674
Yes, I'm pretty mad.

762
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,815
Well, I don't blame you.

763
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,388
I'm sorry, Mary.

764
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,683
Are you very sorry?

765
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,621
Yeah.

766
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,887
She didn't hit you on the head, did she?

767
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,464
It wasn't a she, it was a...

768
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,134
...accident.

769
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:58,565
But look, Phil told me how great you were
with Mr. Mollison and the Elks Committee.

770
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,539
Well, we had to do it today.

771
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,372
You weren't here.

772
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,811
No, I wasn't here.

773
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,747
I was supposed to take you to the fair,
but I don't do that.

774
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:14,856
I take $5 that I saved up to buy music with
and I throw it away like I was a millionaire.

775
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:16,953
I want a great band.

776
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,356
I want them to be a success
more than anything...

777
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,987
...and I go rolling off like a rubber tire
just when they need me.

778
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,895
Why do I do things like that?

779
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,936
Because you're stubborn, that's why. Just
because you got a pair of long pants on...

780
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:33,041
...you think you know everything. You don't
have to go around doing things like that.

781
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,006
- Why don't you tell me when l...
- Me?

782
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,475
You're gonna have to figure out
your own problems.

783
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,411
You can't carry somebody around
for the rest of your life...

784
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,245
...to keep telling you
when you're off the track.

785
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,717
- Can you?
- No, I can't do anything like that.

786
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,724
It's just that, I thought
maybe you and me could work...

787
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,988
...in a closer cooperation
with each other, that's all.

788
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,757
You mean, sort of like a pal?

789
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:02,804
No, it's a little more than just a pal.

790
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,040
Well, what I mean is that...

791
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,543
Well, Mary, couldn't you
be my girl without...

792
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,376
- Without us getting silly about it?
- Oh, you're...

793
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,247
You're gonna have to work out
your own personal problems.

794
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,617
I've got more important things
to think about.

795
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,088
You don't wanna be my girl?

796
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,727
Look, from now on,
we're business partners.

797
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,830
And whatever work we do together
is for the success of the band.

798
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,399
But let's keep very impersonal
about the whole thing.

799
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,060
Sure. Sure, if that's the way
you want it, Mary.

800
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,001
- Well, then, we gotta move fast.
- Yeah.

801
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,574
Remember the day we were up in the attic
looking at those old clothes?

802
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,405
The high silk toppers and long dresses
and puffed sleeves?

803
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,242
You thought it would be a good idea
to use them in a show.

804
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,249
We talked to my dad, and he told us
about the old melodramas?

805
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,183
Oh, yeah, and he told us
how the actors used to ham it up...

806
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:55,119
...with the broad gestures
and the asides to the audience...

807
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,054
...and the business with the cape.

808
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,717
But he said that was really acting
in those days.

809
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,761
Well, remember that melodrama
we wrote...

810
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,798
...but we never got a chance to put it on?
- Sure, I remember.

811
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,993
That's the show
I told Mr. Mollison about.

812
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,434
- You did? What'd he say?
- He thought it was great.

813
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,631
- That's wonderful.
- It's more than wonderful.

814
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:15,005
Mr. Mollison wasn't just being nice.
He was really sold on the idea.

815
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,907
I know if we do well in the tryout...

816
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,913
...we can get the Elks Club
to furnish scenery and costumes.

817
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,280
Gosh. Do you think we could?
We gotta knock them right off their feet.

818
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,751
It's laying right in our lap.
You could play Nell.

819
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,186
You play Mr. Goodpenny,
who falls in love with me.

820
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,826
He's supposed to be handsome
but you could use makeup.

821
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,859
- Sure.
- Who's gonna play the villain?

822
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,860
- The what?
- The villain.

823
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:39,265
I know. Phillip, with that trick laugh
of his. You know:

824
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,097
- He'd be a natural for Squire Poultice.
- That'll be great.

825
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:45,798
<i>- And who gets to play La Belle Francais?
- La Belle Francais...</i>

826
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,567
- Has to be blonde and giggly.
- Yeah.

827
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,577
A glamour girl. Thinks all the men
are madly in love with her.

828
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,215
- That's it.
- What's the matter with Barbara Frances?

829
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:57,319
- No. No, no. Not in my show.
- Wait a minute, fella. Our show.

830
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,217
Look, she's just the type.
She's going play the part.

831
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,291
She is, huh? All right,
but it's gonna be awfully embarrassing.

832
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,051
This is a show we're putting on.

833
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,560
It's gotta be the greatest
that ever hit Riverwood.

834
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,800
You're right, Mary.

835
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,869
We've got to have a great show
with a million laughs and color.

836
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,973
And a lot of lights to make it sparkle.
And songs.

837
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,905
- Wonderful songs with you selling them.
- It'll be wonderful.

838
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:24,342
And after we get the people in that hall
we got to start them laughing.

839
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,347
Can't you just see it, Mary?
The people are just packing in.

840
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,610
Why, there's not a seat left in the house.

841
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:33,313
Why, the overture's starting
and the house lights are going down.

842
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,286
- We're ready to go.
- On stage.

843
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,450
- Lights. Music.
- Curtain!

844
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,941
<i>Let's be gay in the way they were gay</i>

845
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,281
<i>In the dear gay '90s</i>

846
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,923
<i>Be naive, wear your heart on your sleeve</i>

847
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:12,323
<i>For the golden days</i>

848
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:15,725
<i>When life was gay and charming</i>

849
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,093
<i>But with great propriety</i>

850
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,632
<i>Great propriety</i>

851
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:24,569
<i>And grandmamma was horrified
If grandpa saw her knee</i>

852
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,402
<i>Men should never see a knee</i>

853
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,067
<i>Give a cheer for each dear souvenir</i>

854
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,443
<i>Of the dear gay '90s</i>

855
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,311
<i>Drink a toast to the ghost</i>

856
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:39,421
<i>Of the most delightful years</i>

857
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,150
<i>When home sweet home
Didn't know discord</i>

858
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,888
<i>And a cad was someone to be abhorred</i>

859
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,056
<i>And virtue was its own reward</i>

860
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:55,068
<i>In the gay, gay
The terribly gay</i>

861
01:02:55,238 --> 01:03:00,835
<i>The horribly gay
Gay '90s</i>

862
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:17,619
<i>Walking down Broadway
The festive gay Broadway</i>

863
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:23,130
<i>The okay thing on Saturday
Is walking down Broadway</i>

864
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:28,430
<i>The lady on your arm
Is full of grace and charm</i>

865
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:34,270
<i>And life is very, very gay
While walking down Broad...</i>

866
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:38,209
Stop. Do not make fun
of this simple country lassie.

867
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,440
She may be somebody's mother.

868
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:45,076
<i>Or somebody's sister or somebody's...</i>

869
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:48,155
Stop. You're just as cruel.

870
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,225
<i>And even though
I may have erred in my ways...</i>

871
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:55,160
<i>I am more to be pitied than censured</i>

872
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,893
<i>I am more to be helped than despised</i>

873
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:03,766
<i>I am only a lassie who ventured</i>

874
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,104
<i>On life's stormy path, ill-advised</i>

875
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:12,509
<i>Do not scorn me with words
Fierce and bitter</i>

876
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,846
<i>Do not laugh at my shame and downfall</i>

877
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:21,513
<i>For a moment just stop and consider</i>

878
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,821
<i>That a man was the cause</i>

879
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:30,364
<i>Of it all</i>

880
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,898
I beg your humble forgiveness, miss.

881
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:39,474
Never again shall I insult a lady
when she is down.

882
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,610
<i>Adieu.</i>

883
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:45,770
Alas, this is the end.

884
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,721
Why, it's Miss Nelly from New Rochelle.

885
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:01,462
Fancy meeting you here, my dear child.

886
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,225
Squire Poultice. Fancy meeting you here.

887
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,300
Even though I know
you may be a villain...

888
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,030
...'tis still most warming to see
a friendly face from my old home town.

889
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,664
New York is indeed a cruel
and unfriendly city.

890
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:17,210
Alas, I have not eaten for five days.

891
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,143
What a pity, my child.

892
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:24,818
Come with me. What you need
is some champagne and caviar.

893
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:30,152
Merciful fate,
guide me in this crucial crisis.

894
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,556
Methinks there is something rotten
in Denmark.

895
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:43,228
The old codger has intentions on the poor
child which are not altogether honorable.

896
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:47,137
<i>I shall be on the qui vive for foul play.</i>

897
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:13,067
And now, my pretty pet,
do you not feel better?

898
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:19,097
I have misjudged you, Squire Poultice.
You are indeed a very kind man.

899
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:23,735
Shall we have a demitasse?

900
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:27,542
- A demitasse? I might have known.
- Nelly, I love you.

901
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:32,086
Stand back, villain, go your way.
For I will no longer stay.

902
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:37,521
<i>And face the vile temptations
That you hurl</i>

903
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:42,721
<i>You may tempt the upper classes
With your villainous demitasses</i>

904
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:47,961
<i>But heaven will protect</i>

905
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:53,905
<i>The working girl</i>

906
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,408
Nelly. Nelly. I love you.

907
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,548
Oh, no. No. A thousand times, no.

908
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,879
Help, help. Save me.

909
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:12,083
Curse you, Merriwether Goodpenny.

910
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:15,859
My hero, how can I ever repay you?

911
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,500
By forgiving me for being a cad.

912
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:23,036
I do forgive you, a thousandfold.

913
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:28,803
My heart is bounding
like the surging sea.

914
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:33,608
Wait. Would she think me impetuous
if I asked her for a tryst?

915
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,307
I'll risk it.

916
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,477
Miss Nelly, may I hope to see you again
on the morrow?

917
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:43,614
Silly headstrong youth.
Shall we say the park?

918
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:47,524
- At 3?
- Until 3, then, at the park.

919
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,092
<i>Adieu. Adieu.</i>

920
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,893
<i>- Adieu.
- Adieu.</i>

921
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:56,471
<i>But heaven will protect</i>

922
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,234
<i>The working girl</i>

923
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:06,439
<i>The working girl</i>

924
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:20,288
It has been three years
since Merriwether and I were made one.

925
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:24,490
And fate has blessed us
with this lovely child.

926
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,457
I thank you, kind fate...

927
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,969
...for having guided my footsteps
from the gutters of ignominy.

928
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,801
Oh, baby.

929
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,643
- Nelly. My wife.
- My husband.

930
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,509
Why do you hang your head in shame?

931
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:45,586
Would that I could die here, I sullied
her pretty brow with such sordid news.

932
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:49,485
Nelly, the mortgage is due,
and alas, I have no money.

933
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:52,991
Oh, shame. Oh, agony.

934
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:57,262
'Tis the squire, Nelly. Be brave.

935
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,127
Well, my pretty doves, we meet again.

936
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,604
'Tis the end.

937
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,671
No, Merriwether. No. Not yet.

938
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:10,642
Where there's life, there's hope.
Here, take this ring and pawn it.

939
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,510
- No, Nelly, 'tis your wedding ring.
- This is no time for sentiment.

940
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:15,911
Run, Merriwether.

941
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,645
Now, Squire Poultice,
until this house belongs to you...

942
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,187
...you are not welcome in it. Scram.

943
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,986
Curse you, Nelly Newcombe.
But you have not heard the last of me.

944
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,789
I'll get you yet.

945
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,543
Here's your lemonade, sir.

946
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,583
Nice of you to invite me for a refreshment
on such a hot day.

947
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,722
- Little does he know.
- This lassie, awfully clever.

948
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,585
With this, we'll work the trick.

949
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,676
Good. Good.

950
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:28,448
Come on, Squire Wire, old boy, let's you
and I have another little drink, huh?

951
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,252
- Merriwether!
- It's my wife.

952
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,794
<i>Father, dear Father
Come home with me now</i>

953
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:38,593
<i>The clock in the steeple strikes</i>

954
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,465
<i>One</i>

955
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:45,573
<i>You said you were coming right home
With the dough</i>

956
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:49,575
<i>As soon as Ma's ring you did pawn</i>

957
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:53,738
<i>Come home, come home, come home.</i>

958
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,247
My baby.

959
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:59,820
<i>Please, Father, dear Father</i>

960
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:00,978
My boy, Squire.

961
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:04,819
<i>Come home</i>

962
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,053
My little boy.

963
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,423
My baby.

964
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,025
So.

965
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,295
You've been spying on me, huh?

966
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,803
Merriwether,
you've been gone for two years.

967
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,270
Where is the money?

968
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,205
Money? What money
are you talking about, Nelly?

969
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:25,347
The money for the mortgage.

970
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,273
What happened to the money
for the mortgage?

971
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,816
Your husband's bought rum
with the money, madame.

972
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,578
Then all is lost.

973
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:38,250
Now, I'll teach you
to meddle in my affairs.

974
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,025
Benny, my child. Benny.
You brute. You brute.

975
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,495
- No, Nelly, wait a minute.
- To strike the baby.

976
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,763
- Where's he going?
- Benny, my child.

977
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,830
You killed our baby.

978
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:57,309
Unkind fate, this is too unfortunate.

979
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,177
Look. Go on. Get out of here, Nelly.
Go on, Nelly! Get out of here.

980
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,649
What have I done? My wife gone.

981
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,282
My little baby gone. My home gone.

982
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,827
Oh, shame, shame.

983
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,091
How about a slug
of white lightning, partner?

984
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,859
Well, I don't mind if I do, Miss...

985
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:23,198
No. Take that vile stuff
out of my sight forever.

986
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,966
I must redeem myself
in the light of heaven...

987
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,770
...and save my Nelly
from a fate worse than death.

988
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:57,727
You fiend incarnate.
You snake in the snow.

989
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:01,603
Now, Miss Nelly,
I have come to help you.

990
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,712
If you will marry me,
I can give you the niceties of life...

991
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,475
...that you so richly deserve.

992
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,153
Perhaps it would be better than suicide.

993
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:15,620
- But I do not love you.
- My riches will make you love me.

994
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:19,158
Now, just sit down here,
my pretty pigeon...

995
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,786
...and sign this paper.

996
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:28,393
- Sign.
- Hark. Methinks I hear dog barks.

997
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,566
Hold those dogs.

998
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,511
Just in the nick of time.
Stop, Nelly. Do not sign those papers.

999
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,443
The old fox is up to his old tricks.

1000
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,106
- My husband.
- My wife.

1001
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:46,448
Curses. Curses.
Foiled again. But no. Not yet.

1002
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,455
Quasimodo!

1003
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:54,284
Tie them up and make sure
the pretty doves can't get away.

1004
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:58,092
Mr. Goodpenny has an engagement
at the sawmill.

1005
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,095
Mercy, Squire.

1006
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,396
- Will you marry me?
- No. I'd rather die.

1007
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:06,132
Then die you will, my pretty pet,
on the railroad tracks.

1008
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:10,301
The railroad tracks? This is the end.

1009
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,750
<i>Father, dear Father
Come home with me now</i>

1010
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,160
<i>The clock in the steeple strikes</i>

1011
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,768
<i>Two</i>

1012
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,201
<i>Mother is tied to the railroad tracks</i>

1013
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:40,933
<i>And the sawmill is going to get you</i>

1014
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:45,136
Save me. Oh, save me. Save me.

1015
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,578
My boy, you saved my life.
Where is your mother?

1016
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:51,810
- Tied to the railroad tracks.
- Oh, then we must be off!

1017
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:58,323
There they go. After them.

1018
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,532
I gotta be going, Dad.
I got a date with a dream. So long.

1019
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,768
So long, son.

1020
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,413
Help. Help. Save me!

1021
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,986
Help. Help me!

1022
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,991
- I'll save you, my dear.
- Save me.

1023
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,187
Here comes the train.

1024
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,046
- My hero.
- Love triumphs over all.

1025
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:18,669
Hey, let me down.

1026
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,775
- Hey, we forgot Willie.
- Let me down.

1027
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,203
It's Willie up there!
Pull him down.

1028
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,612
Weren't they splendid?

1029
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,410
Wonderful.
I don't know how they've done it.

1030
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,382
Come and help me with the refreshments.

1031
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,646
Why, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1032
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:37,519
- Hurry up, will you, Phil?
- I'm hurrying. Hold still.

1033
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,524
Hold still.

1034
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,026
What's the matter?

1035
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,858
I socked my arm
when they pulled me up the last time.

1036
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:47,524
They yanked the line too hard and I felt like
I was going through with wall.

1037
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:51,298
- Here, let me take a look at it.
- No. No. Leave it alone. It's okay.

1038
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,442
- Just a little sore, that's all.
- You were great, Mary.

1039
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,601
- Thanks. You were swell too, Jimmy.
- Thanks.

1040
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,245
You're coming over to the house?

1041
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,973
- I'd like to. That is, if you're not too tired?
- Oh, no.

1042
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,743
- You've got to take good care of yourself.
- I will.

1043
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,217
Hey, Jimmy.
Have you seen Mr. Mollison yet?

1044
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,585
No. But don't worry about it.
I won't leave until I get the $ 150.

1045
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:13,091
Thattaboy.
Oh, great, Barbara Frances. Terrific.

1046
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:18,062
- Yeah, you were very good, Barbara.
- Thank you. You're so very kind.

1047
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,266
I have my car, Jimmy.
Could I drive you home?

1048
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,301
We were all going over to Mary's and...

1049
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,600
- Well, fine. Then I'll drop you off.
- But you don't have to...

1050
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,073
- Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy Connors.
- Why, here I am, sir.

1051
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,940
Here's your check for $ 150.
And you certainly deserve it.

1052
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:34,275
This was the finest show
we've had in Riverwood.

1053
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,180
Thanks, Mr. Mollison. We appreciate it.
Looks like we're on our way to Chicago.

1054
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,480
- You bet we are.
- Lf we can dig up $50 more.

1055
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,884
Here we come!

1056
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,862
Well, goodnight.
I'm sorry you can't come in.

1057
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,558
We won't be late.
We're only having a few refreshments.

1058
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,932
Thank you, but I'm expecting
my mother and father back from New York.

1059
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,005
- I really must run.
- I'm sorry. Goodnight.

1060
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,506
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Barbara.

1061
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,044
Jimmy, could I see you a minute?

1062
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,245
Dad's giving me a party
at the country club next Saturday.

1063
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,012
Will you come?

1064
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,489
Why, I'd love to.
That's if I'm gonna be in town.

1065
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,251
Oh, I'm so glad.

1066
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,797
The only trouble is, I haven't been able
to make up my mind about the music.

1067
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,990
- You mean, you haven't hired a band yet?
- No.

1068
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,966
- But I must decide before I see my father.
- Sure, you do.

1069
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,537
Well, maybe I could help you decide.

1070
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,040
You might drive home with me
and talk to Dad. He'll be there.

1071
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,509
- I hate to spoil your evening, but...
- oh, no, no. Not at all.

1072
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,478
See you later. I've got
some important business to attend to.

1073
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,551
Hey, Willie, take care of Mary, will you?
Slide over.

1074
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,416
But, Jimmy.

1075
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:50,581
Some birds just gotta be shot twice
before they stop flying.

1076
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,223
I knew that blonde was a Jonah
the moment I saw her.

1077
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,529
Would you and Annie go on inside?
I got something to say to Mary.

1078
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:07,869
- What's the big secret?
- Come on, Squire, let's have a demitasse.

1079
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,576
Mary?

1080
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,148
What is it, Willie?

1081
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,345
There's something I've wanted to ask you
for an awful long time.

1082
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,456
Yes?

1083
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:26,116
Whenever I had the opportunity,
I never had the courage.

1084
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:29,923
Whenever I had the courage,
I never had the opportunity.

1085
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,861
Now I got both.

1086
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,800
Willie, what is it?

1087
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:38,939
Will you marry me?

1088
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,676
I don't expect you
to give me an answer right away.

1089
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:48,873
- Well, but, Willie...
- It isn't as if I just met you.

1090
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,110
I remember the first day I saw you.

1091
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,949
You were wearing gym bloomers.

1092
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:58,388
I was just getting out of Julius Caesar
and you were laughing.

1093
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,027
Oh, Willie, you're the cutest...

1094
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:03,562
I know I'm not
the best-looking guy in town...

1095
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,257
...but I'll always love you
and I'll be true to you...

1096
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,868
...and I won't go out with other girls.

1097
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,971
Oh, Willie.

1098
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:15,576
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me in my whole life.

1099
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,178
And I'm very grateful.

1100
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:24,142
But I'm much too young
to think of getting married.

1101
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,282
Of course I'm not in any particular hurry.

1102
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:36,325
- Willie, how old are you?
- Thirteen going on 14.

1103
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,489
- Willie.
- Yes, ma'am?

1104
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:43,104
Your mother phoned and wants you home.
She says it's time for you to go to bed.

1105
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,703
Goodnight, Willie.

1106
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,808
Goodnight.

1107
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,857
- This is my favorite room in the house.
- It is?

1108
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,222
Someday, I'm gonna have
an enormous yacht.

1109
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:12,662
- Wouldn't you love to go to the South Seas?
- Yeah, it might be nice in the wintertime.

1110
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:16,167
There aren't very many good-looking boys
in this town, are there?

1111
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,432
Here, Jimmy, drink this.

1112
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,802
- All right now?
- Yeah.

1113
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:26,345
Just got my pipes tangled up.

1114
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,108
You know, Jimmy,
when I look back and remember...

1115
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:33,516
<i>...the thousands of dates I've had
with so many different boys...</i>

1116
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:37,283
<i>When I think of the time I've wasted,
the empty hours...</i>

1117
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:41,589
- I wouldn't say that.
- James.

1118
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,526
Do you really want to kiss me?

1119
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:49,300
- Barbara?
- Who's that?

1120
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,769
It's Mother and Dad. They're back.

1121
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,373
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mother.

1122
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,338
- My dear.
- Hello, Dad.

1123
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,946
Hello. Well, what's this?
Another young man?

1124
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,207
I want you to meet
a very talented musician...

1125
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,544
...and one of my dearest friends,
James Connors.

1126
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,015
- How are you?
- How do you do?

1127
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,483
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Morgan.

1128
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:07,986
What do you play, young man?

1129
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,590
I kind of mess around
with the drums a little bit.

1130
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,421
James has the most wonderful orchestra
in the whole world.

1131
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,530
And he's volunteered to play
for my birthday party for only $50.

1132
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:20,190
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Well, that's very nice of you, Mr. Connors.

1133
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,700
But, Barbara,
I wish I'd known about this before.

1134
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:25,873
- Why, Dad?
- I'm afraid I've made other arrangements.

1135
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,032
But, Dad, I promised James.

1136
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,042
We play fine music, Mr. Morgan.
We do an awfully good job.

1137
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,148
Well, I'm sure of that, son.
But I've already signed the contract.

1138
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,615
- Oh, I see.
- But we want you to come to the party.

1139
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,153
Especially if you're a musician,
then you can bring your whole orchestra.

1140
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,918
That's kind of you. I don't know whether
we can make it or not, but we'll try.

1141
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,994
- I hope so.
- How about a Coke, young man?

1142
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:51,655
- Thanks.
- We'll get to your band. Market's going up.

1143
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,630
- Going to have a lot of parties.
- Sure.

1144
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,863
Now, don't you worry about it.
And we wanna have you try and be there.

1145
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:01,706
It isn't every day you get a chance
to hear Paul Whiteman.

1146
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:04,136
- Paul Whiteman?
- Yes.

1147
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,804
- He'll be winding up his tour near here and...
- Paul Whiteman, here?

1148
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:12,079
Yes. We had a hard job getting him
but I have a lot of good friends.

1149
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:16,212
Paul Whiteman in Riverwood?
Oh, thanks. Thanks. We'll be there.

1150
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,756
Just try and keep us away.

1151
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,520
Paul Whiteman. Paul Whiteman.
Well, goodbye, every...

1152
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:22,890
Pardon me.
Glad to have met you, Mrs. Morgan.

1153
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:27,262
You too, Mr. Morgan. I mean, Mrs. Morgan.
You know what I mean anyway.

1154
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:33,203
Sorry. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Goodbye. And we'll be there too. Yes, sir.

1155
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,490
In behalf of Mrs. Morgan and myself...

1156
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:10,161
...I want to welcome all of Barbara Frances'
friends to her 18th birthday party.

1157
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,602
We also want to welcome
Mr. Whiteman and his band.

1158
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:16,437
And tell them
we are glad to have them with us.

1159
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,846
Thank you, Mr. Morgan,
and we're mighty glad to be here too.

1160
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:26,214
And now, I want you to have
the very best of good times.

1161
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,550
Paul, it's all yours.

1162
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,135
- Say, your old man's all right.
- What did you expect him to be?

1163
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,234
- How about this dance, Mary?
- Thanks, but I'm wondering about Willie.

1164
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,813
- You haven't seen him dancing, have you?
- I haven't.

1165
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,508
Last time I saw him
he was hanging around on the porch.

1166
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:01,052
Well, thanks. I think I'd better go find him.
He's kind of shy, you know.

1167
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,247
We want him to have
a good time, don't we?

1168
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,483
Oh, sure we do.

1169
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:16,033
They certainly are swell.
But we've got just as good a brass section.

1170
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:17,466
Just as loud anyhow.

1171
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,075
Yeah, only they push the valves down
at the same time.

1172
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:26,676
Hello, Willie. What are you doing
out here?

1173
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:30,443
- Nothing.
- Well, come on inside and let's dance.

1174
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,085
No, thanks.

1175
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,086
You've acted awfully funny
ever since the night of the show.

1176
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,224
Is there anything wrong?

1177
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,727
I got things on my mind.

1178
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:44,129
Well, I won't bother you then.

1179
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:52,163
Willie, you're not mad at anything,
are you?

1180
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,173
- No, I'm not mad.
- That's swell.

1181
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:59,746
- Willie, what's wrong?
- Just my arm. It hurts something awful.

1182
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:03,247
- Your arm?
- Don't, please. Don't touch it.

1183
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,909
Willie, maybe you should go home.

1184
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:08,487
I don't wanna miss all the fun.

1185
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:10,749
Have you seen a doctor?

1186
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:14,122
- They don't know nothing.
- Willie, that's very foolish.

1187
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,957
If there's something wrong,
you should have it looked at.

1188
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:20,191
Promise me you'll go see a doctor
tomorrow morning.

1189
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,930
Okay, I'll go, but it won't do any good.

1190
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:28,598
But nevertheless, you promised.

1191
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,238
Yeah.

1192
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:35,007
Well, let's go on inside and watch, huh?

1193
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,707
Come on.

1194
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,723
Hey, kids. I just met Paul Whiteman.

1195
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,299
- You did?
- Swell, Phil.

1196
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:57,836
Hey, Jimmy, take a load of that tenor sax.
No wonder he can make it moan.

1197
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,133
He didn't win that clarinet
at a raffle either.

1198
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:03,607
Gosh, I'd sure like to take a feel
of those sticks.

1199
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,440
- It wouldn't hurt anybody, would it?
- No, go ahead, Jimmy.

1200
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,447
Go ahead. Sure. Go on.

1201
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,916
- Oh, gee, do you think he should?
- Sure, why not? It can't do any harm.

1202
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:14,918
Oh, I don't know.

1203
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:21,052
- Hey, Leonard, what a set of skins.
- Yeah.

1204
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,493
Gosh, with a set of drums like these,
a guy could get in the White House.

1205
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:31,266
Boy, if I owned this,
I'd just sit around all day and look at it.

1206
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,066
Beauty.

1207
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:36,677
Just as easy.

1208
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,948
- Look, Jimmy. Isn't this a honey?
- Gosh, it sure is.

1209
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:45,244
- Gee, I never felt more in the mood.
- Me neither.

1210
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:48,355
Say, it wouldn't do any harm
to knock out a couple, would it?

1211
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:49,751
- No.
- No, it wouldn't.

1212
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,983
- What are we waiting for?
- Just a downbeat.

1213
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,254
Well, all right then, let's get ready.
Sid, get over at the piano.

1214
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:57,398
One, two.

1215
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,651
<i>There's a boy down on our street</i>

1216
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,753
<i>Plays the drums with such a beat</i>

1217
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:58,324
<i>You cannot control your feet
When you hear the drummer boy</i>

1218
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:02,759
<i>In the morning when you wake
You can hear him take a break</i>

1219
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:07,526
<i>Soon the whole street starts to shake
When they hear the drummer boy</i>

1220
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:12,365
<i>Bing bang, ding dang
He's so nimble on the cymbal</i>

1221
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,977
<i>Bing bong, ding dong
When he plays 'em he just slays 'em</i>

1222
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:21,514
<i>All your troubles fly away
Every day's a happy day</i>

1223
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,616
<i>Everything will be okay</i>

1224
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:28,188
<i>When you hear the drummer boy play</i>

1225
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:48,441
Say, it looks like somebody's
kind of taken over here.

1226
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:51,772
- Yeah, and not bad either, Pop.
- You're telling me.

1227
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,811
<i>Gather 'round, all you chums</i>

1228
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,578
<i>Watch this cat spin those drums</i>

1229
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:02,988
<i>Swing it, brother, beat that hide</i>

1230
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,524
<i>Take us on a jivin' ride</i>

1231
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:14,625
<i>This is what the doc prescribes
For a case of jibs and jibes</i>

1232
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:18,898
<i>Drummer boy please give out
On those vibes</i>

1233
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:45,854
<i>Hear that drummer boy play</i>

1234
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,437
Goldie, you boys go on ahead.

1235
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,972
- I'll meet you at the hotel.
- Right, Pop.

1236
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,700
Come in.

1237
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:05,412
You wanted to see me?

1238
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,605
Sure. Come on in.

1239
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:11,448
My name's Connors.

1240
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,087
- I know. Mine's Whiteman.
- Yeah.

1241
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,553
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1242
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,353
I guess I ought to apologize for barging
up there and taking over like I did...

1243
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,622
...but we wanted to give you
an audition for your contest.

1244
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:27,097
It was a good audition.
How long you been playing the drums?

1245
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,667
Ever since I was a kid.

1246
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:31,361
- You're through school?
- Yes, sir. I've just graduated.

1247
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:35,771
- Well, I bet you're mighty happy about that.
- Well, I made it, but I had to slide.

1248
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:37,308
What are you going to do next?

1249
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:40,936
Keep on pounding the drums
as long as anybody will listen to me.

1250
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:44,084
Jimmy,
you're a mighty talented young fellow.

1251
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:46,276
And I think I ought
to do something about it.

1252
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,582
One of my boys, a swell saxophone player
and a mighty fine fellow...

1253
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:51,622
...is starting his own band in New York.

1254
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:54,420
They open Thursday.
The drum spot's open.

1255
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:56,187
How'd you like to have that job?

1256
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,364
Oh, you're kidding me.

1257
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:05,835
They open Thursday.
You'll have to be there if you want the job.

1258
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,337
I want the...

1259
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:13,609
New York.

1260
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:16,310
Yeah.

1261
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:19,009
Yeah, why, I could go home
and pack right now.

1262
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,051
Wait a minute, Jimmy. Don't get excited.

1263
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:23,452
I'm not excited.
Who's excited, Mr. Whiteman?

1264
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,787
Think it over and let me know
in the morning. I'm at the Wentworth.

1265
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:29,930
The Wentworth?
Well, I don't have to think it over.

1266
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,724
I could just have to tell my mom.

1267
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:35,232
Well, I could phone you the first thing
in the morning. Say, about 7:30?

1268
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,803
That's okay but I think
10 would be a little better.

1269
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:41,999
Ten o'clock. Oh, gosh.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Whiteman. Gee.

1270
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,576
- You're on the level?
- Sure I'm on the level, Jimmy.

1271
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:48,203
Oh, gosh. Well, thanks.
I'll phone you the first thing in the morning.

1272
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,974
Good night.

1273
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:56,682
Hey, Mom. Mom!

1274
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,291
Mom. Mom, you awake?

1275
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,258
- Jimmy, what on earth...?
- It's happened. I told you it would.

1276
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,954
We're on our way. I've got a job.

1277
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,929
- Job? What do you mean?
- Mr. Whiteman heard our band tonight.

1278
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:10,161
Paul Whiteman. He's offered me
a job with an orchestra in New York.

1279
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,668
All of our troubles are over.

1280
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:15,002
Jimmy, I'm so glad for you, son,
and I'm so proud.

1281
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:17,644
Oh, gosh, Mom, just think of it.
New York.

1282
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:20,303
Oh, that's right.

1283
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:24,144
You said you'd be going
to New York right away.

1284
01:35:24,318 --> 01:35:25,717
Yeah.

1285
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,649
Have you told Mary and Phillip?

1286
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:31,417
Well, I thought I'd wait
until I got the whole thing set.

1287
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:35,221
- I've got to see Mr. Whiteman tomorrow.
- I wonder what they'll say.

1288
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:37,388
<i>Why, they'll...</i>

1289
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,328
- Why?
- And the band.

1290
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,264
Everybody's looking forward so
to going to Chicago.

1291
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,927
Everybody's been working so hard.

1292
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:48,166
Working for the whole group.

1293
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,867
- I know what you're thinking but...
- Do you?

1294
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:52,876
I remember when you started the band.

1295
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:57,780
When you told me that they believed in you,
had faith in you to stick by you.

1296
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,147
And what suddenly happens
to them now?

1297
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,749
They're the same people.

1298
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:08,962
But this is my one big chance.
I can't give it up. Don't ask me to.

1299
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:12,293
You'd be climbing
the first rung of the ladder.

1300
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:15,333
By walking out on your friends.

1301
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:24,836
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

1302
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:27,510
I know it now.

1303
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:30,943
I guess I just didn't stop to think.

1304
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,254
I thought it'd be wonderful
for both of us.

1305
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,889
And so it can be, Jimmy.

1306
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:40,024
But not quite so fast.

1307
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:49,501
Where are you going, son?

1308
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,604
You know where I'm going.

1309
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:02,309
So I'm afraid I won't be able
to accept the job, Mr. Whiteman.

1310
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,816
<i>I thought I could, but I just got
through talking to my mother and...</i>

1311
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:08,716
Well, she straightened me out
on a few things.

1312
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,756
Mothers have a knack at that sort of thing,
don't they, Jimmy?

1313
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,690
Yes, sir. You know, ever since
you made that announcement...

1314
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:17,524
<i>...about a guest appearance
on your broadcast...</i>

1315
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:19,893
Why, that's been our ambition.

1316
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,096
We played dates.

1317
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:25,636
We even gave a show to try to raise
enough money to get to Chicago...

1318
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:27,865
...to give an audition.

1319
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:30,670
But that's before we knew
you were coming here.

1320
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,540
Jimmy, did you form that band?

1321
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,379
Yes, sir.

1322
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,941
I kind of cooked it up.

1323
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,050
But I can't very well
pull out on them now.

1324
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:47,756
That's good enough for me.
Jimmy, let me tell you something.

1325
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:50,954
When I started out, a band was
a bunch of boys with instruments...

1326
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:54,726
...who got together and beat out rhythm
for the rest of the folks to dance to.

1327
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,496
But now it's a profession,
and a mighty important one.

1328
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:01,368
Take the big bandleader of today.
He's almost a household word.

1329
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,273
He's as well known as your
biggest picture actor or baseball player.

1330
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:09,644
Fred Waring, Kay Kyser, Glenn Miller.
All very popular.

1331
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:12,980
But once they were a little guy
called Jimmy Connors who...

1332
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:14,711
...just sort of cooked things up.

1333
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:19,582
But with this popularity
comes a great responsibility.

1334
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:23,993
Rhythm can either excite the worst in us
or bring out the best.

1335
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:25,995
Take that little fellow on the street.

1336
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,896
Teach him to blow a horn
and he'll never blow a safe.

1337
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:32,004
You know, rhythm is really
a wonderful thing.

1338
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:34,800
Sometimes I think
rhythm almost runs the world.

1339
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:39,275
In a little baby, the first thing that starts
is his rhythm. His little heart starts to beat.

1340
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:42,006
And every different city
has a different kind of rhythm.

1341
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:44,514
In your car,
if the engine's missing and jerking...

1342
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:48,086
...or you feel the bump of a flat tire,
rhythm tells something's wrong.

1343
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:51,520
And if you call a doctor,
the first thing he does is check your rhythm.

1344
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:55,719
He feels your pulse to find if your rhythm
is solid and your beat's strong.

1345
01:38:55,896 --> 01:38:59,059
So, Jimmy, when we get
to the last eight bars of the big tune...

1346
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:02,168
...and the old ticker
kind of slows down...

1347
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:06,966
...no matter what's wrong with us,
the last thing to stop is our rhythm.

1348
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:14,540
After listening to a lot of bands
all over the country...

1349
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:18,879
...I don't think it would be fair to select one
and give them the guest spot on that show.

1350
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:21,578
No, there's too many good ones.

1351
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:23,623
I've put up a $500 prize...

1352
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:27,750
...and I'm gonna devote my whole
program for a high school band contest.

1353
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:29,122
I'm going to play it safe.

1354
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:31,457
I'm gonna let the public
worry about who's best.

1355
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,691
Gosh, that sounds terrific, Mr. Whiteman.

1356
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:37,963
I've already selected three bands,
but I think I'll make it four.

1357
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:39,935
Do you want to try?

1358
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:44,367
- Do we?
- Chicago, Saturday night.

1359
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:48,140
- Will you be there?
- Why, you couldn't keep us away.

1360
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:55,312
<i>- Well, what's the matter, Jimmy?
- Oh, I...</i>

1361
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,589
I forgot, Mr. Whiteman.

1362
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:01,250
It's gonna cost us $200
to get the band to Chicago.

1363
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:05,831
I've figured it out.
We've only got 150.

1364
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:13,632
Mr. Whiteman, do you think you could see
your way clear to give me a loan of $50?

1365
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,638
I'll give you my personal note.

1366
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:18,141
Well, what have you got
for collateral, Jimmy?

1367
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:21,679
Well, I could put up my drums.

1368
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,181
They mean more to me
than anything in the world.

1369
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:26,610
You'd really do that, Jimmy?

1370
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,186
Yes, I would, Mr. Whiteman.

1371
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:31,290
- It's a deal. There you are.
- Oh, gosh.

1372
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:34,427
Thanks. You won't have to wait long,
not if there's a $500 prize.

1373
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:37,530
I wouldn't be too confident.
You might get a little competition.

1374
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,599
We're not afraid
of a bunch of kids from high school.

1375
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:43,870
- Hurry up, you're late.
- Is everybody here?

1376
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,165
- Music hasn't been passed out.
- Where's Willie?

1377
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:48,137
- He isn't here.
- I'll scalp that midget.

1378
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:49,775
- Run over the old ones.
- Jimmy!

1379
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:53,572
Mrs. Brewster phoned, Willie's terribly sick.
The doctor's there. She wants us.

1380
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:55,044
What? Let's get going.

1381
01:40:57,251 --> 01:41:01,688
I'm so glad you've come.
I'll call the doctor.

1382
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:04,117
Oh, I'm afraid it's awfully serious.

1383
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:08,057
- I hope not. What's the matter, doctor?
- From what I gather, he injured his arm...

1384
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,696
...when he was swung up
on that wire during your show.

1385
01:41:10,864 --> 01:41:12,889
- His arm.
- It's perfectly possible for him...

1386
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,400
...to have gone around all this time
without knowing the arm was broken.

1387
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:17,832
That often happens.

1388
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:20,496
Unfortunately,
what was a simple fracture then...

1389
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:22,938
...has developed
into a serious complication now.

1390
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,943
And it is serious.
He's had that injury for over a week.

1391
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:29,310
- What are you doing for him, doctor?
- There's not much that I can do.

1392
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:32,475
It calls for an operation
by someone who is an expert.

1393
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:34,746
- Or else...
- or else what?

1394
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:38,289
<i>Unless that boy is operated on
within the next few hours, I...</i>

1395
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:40,552
Well, I can't be responsible for him.

1396
01:41:40,727 --> 01:41:42,820
Oh, no.

1397
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:46,057
Well, we've got to do something.

1398
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:49,293
You're right, son. I've phoned
the best orthopedic man I know.

1399
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,665
Dr. Ganglin
at the General Hospital in Chicago.

1400
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:54,740
But he's operating today,
and can't possibly get away.

1401
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:56,876
That leaves us only one alternative.

1402
01:41:57,044 --> 01:41:58,773
We've got to get Willie to Chicago.

1403
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,846
Well, all right, let's get him there.

1404
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:03,915
Yes, get him there.
But we've got to get him there immediately.

1405
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:07,349
- Well, couldn't we charter a plane?
- That would cost a lot of money.

1406
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:09,785
I'm afraid Mrs. Brewster
could hardly afford that.

1407
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,623
How much would it cost, doctor?

1408
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,726
About $200.

1409
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,507
Call the airport. We have the money.

1410
01:42:29,676 --> 01:42:32,167
- Two hundred dollars?
- Well, what are you waiting for?

1411
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:35,804
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Doctor, could we see Willie now, please?

1412
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:38,383
Yes, I think you should.

1413
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,686
Oh, Mrs. Brewster,
could I see you a moment?

1414
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,058
Hello, shortstop.

1415
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:48,618
I heard you. I'm not going.

1416
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:50,490
Going where?

1417
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,632
In that airplane.

1418
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:55,393
Oh, but you've gotta go.

1419
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:00,364
I know where you're getting the money.
And you're not gonna spend it on me.

1420
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:02,139
What's money?

1421
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:06,769
It's like corny saxophone players,
you can shake it out of trees.

1422
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:10,373
Look, Willie, I'm your friend, aren't I?

1423
01:43:13,253 --> 01:43:17,189
- Yeah.
- And Jimmy's your friend too, isn't he?

1424
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:22,426
Yeah.

1425
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:27,158
Well, have we ever asked you to do
anything that wasn't good for you?

1426
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:32,401
Look, Willie. Jimmy's a boss.

1427
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:35,041
The only reason we've gotten
anywhere with the band...

1428
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,507
...is because we've listened to him.

1429
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:40,977
And everybody's always done
what he's asked us to.

1430
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:43,542
Even hard things.

1431
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:46,751
Things that we
sometimes didn't agree with.

1432
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,686
But the only reason the band
has done anything...

1433
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:52,825
<i>...the show and the play
and the dance...</i>

1434
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:56,019
Well, those were little things.

1435
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:59,165
And now, don't you see, Willie?

1436
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:02,666
You're giving us a chance
to do a big thing.

1437
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:08,271
Why, to Jimmy and me
and every person in the band...

1438
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:12,071
...you're more important
than all the broadcasts in the world.

1439
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:16,012
We've got the rest of our lives
to do broadcasts.

1440
01:44:17,184 --> 01:44:22,349
I know you'll do it because
I know you won't let us down.

1441
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:27,991
You'll do it, won't you, Willie?

1442
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:34,299
I always wanted to ride in an airplane.

1443
01:44:42,376 --> 01:44:44,537
- Mr. Connors is here, sir.
- Well, show him in.

1444
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:48,613
- Yes, sir. This way, please.
- Thank you.

1445
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:51,240
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello, Mr. Morgan.

1446
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:53,750
- Breakfast?
- No, thanks. I don't care for anything.

1447
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,512
- Well, sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

1448
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:58,214
What time is that
Whiteman broadcast tonight?

1449
01:44:58,392 --> 01:44:59,984
Oh, 8:00.

1450
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,526
Well, think you could win that contest?

1451
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,595
I know we could, if we were there.

1452
01:45:06,433 --> 01:45:09,994
How long would it take you to get
your band together and get out of town?

1453
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:12,529
Like that:

1454
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:14,833
Well, that's too long.

1455
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,900
There's a special train pulling into the yard
in three quarters of an hour.

1456
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:21,479
I want you to be on it.

1457
01:45:22,783 --> 01:45:25,650
We'll be on it, Mr. Morgan.
But will it get us there in time?

1458
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:29,687
Well, this train will. I've been
connected to that railroad for 20 years.

1459
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,552
And this is the first time
I've ever had any fun out of it.

1460
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:35,160
Now, get going and strike up the band.

1461
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:39,288
Do you mean it? You ain't kidding us, huh?
Oh, thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1462
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:01,852
Johnson, if you're looking for that pension,
you'd better get this train in on time.

1463
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,820
Don't worry, Mr. Morgan.
This one's got to be in on time.

1464
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:08,085
- Well, hello, everybody. Here we are.
- Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara.

1465
01:46:08,261 --> 01:46:09,626
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my dear.

1466
01:46:09,796 --> 01:46:12,060
Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara.
Well, here we go.

1467
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:14,598
- Goodbye now. Good luck, my boy.
- Goodbye.

1468
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:16,258
Goodbye.

1469
01:46:16,436 --> 01:46:18,495
Hurry up, Mary. Well, goodbye, Mom.

1470
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:21,573
- Do you think we're gonna be the best?
- Everybody thinks so.

1471
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:23,767
I don't know.
Everybody will be listening in.

1472
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:26,845
- New York, Chicago, all over.
- They all came from Riverwood.

1473
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:30,176
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I think you're the best.

1474
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:34,081
And your father, he'd be so proud of you.

1475
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:36,217
Well, then we're gonna win.

1476
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,824
- You know what, Mom?
- What, Jimmy?

1477
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:41,623
I'm gonna make you a queen.

1478
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:46,060
- Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye.

1479
01:46:49,202 --> 01:46:50,760
Goodbye, Jimmy.

1480
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,702
Good luck.

1481
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,467
Time's about up. Three seconds to go.

1482
01:47:58,638 --> 01:47:59,866
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

1483
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,565
- That's it.
- There you are.

1484
01:48:03,276 --> 01:48:05,369
Connect me with the stage.
I have the winner.

1485
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:07,979
Come on, girls. You can see from here.

1486
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,987
Thank you ladies and gentlemen
for listening...

1487
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:23,959
...and for your wonderful reaction.

1488
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:27,190
I'd also like to thank you for your votes
by phone and telegram...

1489
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:28,834
...from all parts of the nation.

1490
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:31,334
Which helped us pick
the winner of this contest.

1491
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:35,441
Which only goes to prove that this country
not only has a genuine love for music...

1492
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:38,203
...but is happy to acclaim
the youth of America.

1493
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:40,972
This wonderful enthusiasm
and fine musicianship...

1494
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:44,207
...demonstrated here tonight
makes me feel quite safe in saying...

1495
01:48:44,384 --> 01:48:47,717
...that we need have no fear
for the future of American music.

1496
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:51,654
And now for the winner, a name you're
probably hearing for the first time tonight.

1497
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:54,419
But which may in the future
become a musical byword.

1498
01:48:54,594 --> 01:48:57,256
Jimmy Connors and his band.

1499
01:49:06,773 --> 01:49:09,401
Thank you. Thank you.

1500
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:13,671
- Jimmy, it's wonderful.
- Gosh, aren't you thrilled, Mary?

1501
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:15,474
Thank you.

1502
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:17,744
- Here. It's for you.
- Me?

1503
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:19,886
Oh, Jimmy.

1504
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:26,449
And now for our final number...

1505
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:31,393
...performed by a combination of all
our contesting bands and glee clubs.

1506
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:35,262
The honor of leading this finale
goes to our young winner, Jimmy Connors.

1507
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:39,201
I feel pretty sure Jimmy's got a few tricks
up his sleeve he hasn't told me about.

1508
01:49:39,372 --> 01:49:42,068
- Maybe.
- Mr. Connors, the stick.

1509
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,176
Thank you, Mr. Whiteman.

1510
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,583
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1511
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:57,984
Well, I guess this is it.

1512
01:49:58,658 --> 01:50:00,785
I don't have to tell you how I feel.

1513
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:04,192
If I felt any better,
gosh, I couldn't stand it.

1514
01:50:05,031 --> 01:50:08,125
When something wonderful like this
happens to anybody...

1515
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:10,963
...I suppose you ought
to thank somebody.

1516
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:14,436
They're not here,
but I know they're listening in.

1517
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:21,005
Mr. Judd, I was all wrong about you.

1518
01:50:21,181 --> 01:50:24,014
You'll always be a swell guy
with us because you said:

1519
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:26,277
"I'll buy the first ticket."

1520
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:32,516
And as for you, Willie, you little shortstop,
even though you're in love with my girl...

1521
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:35,525
...we're all thinking about you
and we want you to hurry up...

1522
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:38,357
...and get out of bed
because we all need you.

1523
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:42,299
And of all the people
throughout the United States...

1524
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:44,994
...who might be listening
to this program...

1525
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:47,765
...there's only one thing I'd like to say.

1526
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:50,569
To the most important one of all.

1527
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:53,946
Mom.

1528
01:50:55,448 --> 01:50:58,975
I don't know what I was thinking about
when I said that someday...

1529
01:50:59,152 --> 01:51:01,143
...l'd make you a queen.

1530
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:05,219
Because if you hadn't been
a queen all the time...

1531
01:51:05,725 --> 01:51:07,784
...l'd never be here now.

1532
01:51:08,795 --> 01:51:13,192
Well, here it comes, Mom.

1533
01:52:57,337 --> 01:53:00,329
<i>We must have music in the land</i>

1534
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,066
<i>For everybody loves a band</i>

1535
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:08,306
<i>A good old rousing melody
Is a joy and inspiration</i>

1536
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:12,076
<i>A hundred million folks agree
That a tune can stir a nation</i>

1537
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:15,278
<i>So, music master, take command</i>

1538
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:22,451
<i>Our hearts will beat to beat the band</i>

1539
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:26,758
<i>Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call</i>

1540
01:53:26,933 --> 01:53:28,366
<i>- While the people shout
- Hooray!</i>

1541
01:53:28,535 --> 01:53:30,400
<i>Strike up the band</i>

1542
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:34,028
<i>Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all</i>

1543
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:37,506
<i>To that happy swing
Strike up the band</i>

1544
01:53:37,677 --> 01:53:41,169
<i>Yankee doo doodle-oo, doodle-oo
We'll come through Yankee doo, doodle-oo.</i>

1545
01:53:41,347 --> 01:53:45,181
<i>For the red, white, and blue, doodle-oo
Lend a hand</i>

1546
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:49,082
<i>With the flag unfurled
We can face the world</i>

1547
01:53:49,255 --> 01:53:54,318
<i>Hey, leader, strike up the band</i>

1548
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:57,657
<i>Let the drums roll out</i>

1549
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:01,232
<i>Let the trumpet call</i>

1550
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:04,165
<i>While the people shout</i>

1551
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:08,296
<i>Strike up the band</i>

1552
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:11,637
<i>Hear the cymbals ring</i>

1553
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:15,212
<i>Calling one and all</i>

1554
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:18,145
<i>To that martial swing</i>

1555
01:54:18,318 --> 01:54:22,049
<i>Strike up the band</i>

1556
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:25,521
<i>And we'll all give the cheer as we stand</i>

1557
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:28,991
<i>To the man with the stick in his hand</i>

1558
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:32,222
<i>He's the man whose command of the band</i>

1559
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:36,528
<i>Makes the band grand</i>

1560
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:40,332
<i>And you can't go wrong
With a happy song</i>

1561
01:54:40,506 --> 01:54:43,942
<i>Hey, leader</i>

1562
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:47,876
<i>Say, leader</i>

1563
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:53,913
<i>Hey, leader, strike up the band</i>

1564
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:03,017
<i>Mister leader
We all want to dance, sir</i>

1565
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:09,692
<i>Give our feet a chance, sir
And say you'll play the La Conga</i>

1566
01:55:57,350 --> 01:56:00,114
<i>Rhythm is frantic</i>

1567
01:56:00,286 --> 01:56:03,050
<i>We feel romantic</i>

1568
01:56:03,222 --> 01:56:08,660
<i>Play a song of love</i>

1569
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:14,425
<i>Our love affair</i>

1570
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:18,195
<i>Was meant to be</i>

1571
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:21,863
<i>It's me for you, dear</i>

1572
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:25,306
<i>And you for me</i>

1573
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:28,311
<i>We'll fuss and quarrel</i>

1574
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:31,882
<i>And tears start to brew</i>

1575
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:35,145
<i>But after the tears</i>

1576
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:40,623
<i>Our love will smile through</i>

1577
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:46,629
<i>When youth has had</i>

1578
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:53,469
<i>Its merry fling</i>

1579
01:56:54,874 --> 01:57:01,370
<i>We'll spend our evenings</i>

1580
01:57:02,749 --> 01:57:09,245
<i>Remembering</i>

1581
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:17,622
<i>Two happy people</i>

1582
01:57:17,797 --> 01:57:23,565
<i>Who say on the square</i>

1583
01:57:23,736 --> 01:57:28,901
<i>Isn't ours a lovely</i>

1584
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:35,571
<i>Love affair</i>

1585
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:40,944
<i>If you feel you need a kick</i>

1586
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,213
<i>Rhythm ought to do the trick</i>

1587
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:45,254
<i>Mister leader, shake that stick</i>

1588
01:57:45,425 --> 01:57:50,021
<i>Let 'em hear the drummer boy play</i>

1589
01:58:51,023 --> 01:58:54,459
<i>With our flags unfurled</i>

1590
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:59,189
<i>We can face the world</i>

1591
01:58:59,365 --> 01:59:05,861
<i>Hey, leader, strike up the band</i>
